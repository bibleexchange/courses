## Sin has died and we are free to marry another (v. 1–6)

### Meaning of the illustration

The sinner is in a binding relationship to his sin, just as a wife is bound to her husband. As long as they both live, the husband and wife are bound to each other under God.

Paul announces a death! It is the death of self. As the wife would be free from the law of her husband by death, so the sinner is freed from the law of sin through sharing in Christ's death. This death is the crucifixion of the old man with Christ (Acts 13:38–39; Rom. 3:25; 5:21; 6:6; 7:4; II Cor. 5:15; Gal. 1:4; 2:20; 5:24; 6:14; Eph. 4:22; 5:2; Col. 2:11; 3:5, 9; Tit. 2:14; Heb. 9:15; 1 Pet. 1:21; 4:2; 1 John 2:2; 4:10). Raised then in resurrection, we share in Christ's life that we might be married to another. In this second marriage, we are united with Christ.

### The power of the law is terminated

As long as a person is **living** in sin they are under the law. The sinner has no choice but to be under the law, and the only way of escape is if he dies to his sinfulness. The law dominates the sinner. The person that lives in sin is under the law. Death dissolves the legal obligation of the marriage. The sinner can be free from the power of sin and the penalty of the broken law (7:4; 6:14).

Paul repeats the words "know ye not" three times when talking about this subject:

1. "Know ye not" The old life is baptized into His death (6:3).
2. "Know ye not" The old service is broken off, destroyed through Christ (6:16).
3. "Know ye not" The old union is impossible with the new union with Christ (7:1).

### The service of the union with Jesus Christ

From this union with Christ will come our service to Christ (v. 6).

* Serve with newness of life (6:4)
* Serve in newness of Spirit (7:6)
* Serve with new power (1:16; 8:11; I Cor 6:14; II Cor 13:4; II Thess. 1:11)
* Serve as a new creature (II Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15)

### The fruitfulness of this union

Our union with sin produced death (7:5; 1:32; 6:21; 7:5; Gal.5:19–21), but union with Christ enables us to bring forth fruit of righteousness unto holiness (1:13; 5:3–5; 6:22; John 15:2,4,5,8,16; I Cor. 1:6; Gal. 5:22–23; Eph. 5:9; Php. 1:11; 4:17; Col. 1:6, 10; Tit. 3:14; Heb. 12:11; 13:15; James 3:18; 5:7; II Pet. 1:3–9).
