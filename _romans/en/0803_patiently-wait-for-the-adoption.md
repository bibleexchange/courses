### Heirs of God (v. 17a)

The believer receives the privileges and inheritance of a son because he shares a relationship with the Father.

### Suffering unto Glorification (v. 17b-18) 

Trials prove the true character of the Christian. And although the suffering is not glorious, Paul brings our attention to glory that will follow. The Christian has hope in suffering, for if we suffer, we shall also reign. Christ is our example of suffering (1 Pet. 2:21; Heb. 2:10; 5:8-9; 1 Pet. 4:1; James 5:10).

### The creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God (v. 19-22)

God has a vast plan and Hope lies ahead for Creation. In bondage because sin is in the world, but there will be a deliverance!
