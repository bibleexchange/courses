# Grace Reigns "THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST" (chapter 5)

## Introduction

A person has access into the grace of God and therefore justification by faith in God's provision. The very opportunity for faith to receive this provision is possible as a result of God's love and grace demonstrated in Christ's atoning death. We were shut out by the law in its judgment on sin, but access to and good a standing in the grace of God, is gained by faith in Jesus Christ. In this chapter Paul is emphasizing the role of our Lord Jesus Christ in the believer's justification and them having favor with God or "grace."

So who get's the credit for salvation? Jesus! It is not merely even a work of faith that pleases God alone, because no such opportunity for faith to work is even possible without Christ. It is based upon the merits of Christ that God provides the opportunity for man to be saved through faith. 

## What we receive through Jesus (v. 1–5)

The sinner is in bondage and cannot enjoy the fulness of God's intended blessing for him. He is held back because of sin. When a man places his faith in Christ and in His atonement for their sin, that person is provided through Jesus many wonderful treasures that enable him to abound in the Grace of God. Following are some Scriptures on _abounding_: Proverbs 28:20; Romans 5:20: 15:13; 2 Corinthians 8:7; 9:8; Philippians 1:9; 4:17; 1 Thessalonians 3:12; 4:1; 2 Peter 1:5–8. Read Romans 5:1–5.

Through Jesus:

* We have been justified through His blood (saved)
* We have peace with God (reconciled)
* We have access into grace
* We have access into the presence of God. 
* We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God
* We joy in tribulations (as it works patience -> experience -> hope)

### Through Jesus we have the Holy Ghost given unto us (v. 5)

See also 2 Cor. 1:22; Gal. 4:4–7; Ephesians 1:13–14.

### Through Jesus we have the love of God shed ABROAD in our hearts (v. 5)

## What we receive through God's love (v. 6–10)

### Jesus was motivated by love (v. 6) 

All of the preceding blessings (justification, peace, access, etc.) are possible because, "When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." It is the Blood of Jesus Christ that satisfied the law and His love was the motivation for His action.

### It is an uncommon love (v. 7–8) 

Man's "love" is self concerned and limited. For those that are religious and do good things you might find some to die and for those that are kind to others and generous, you might have an easier time finding someone to die, but Christ died not for those who appeared to have value and worth, but he died for the offenders, trespassers. He died for **sinners**. 

Christ Died for SINNERS, who are those that have have erred and offended God. God's love was demonstrated to those neither **righteous** nor **good**.

### Love worked for Reconciliation (v. 9–10)

We were at odds with God. We were:

* Without Strength - Dying, powerless.
* Ungodly - No God in them.
* Sinners - Always aiming, but missing the mark.
* Enemies - Hostile Toward God and His Holiness.

Jesus was motivated by love, and He saved us from wrath and He has provided justification through His blood.

_Reconciliation_ means "To come to terms; agree." When I'm reconciled to God, He sets the terms and He changes me. Read 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Isaiah 1:18–20.

Reconciliation has to do with man's relationship with God. We have a Received the _ministry of reconciliation_ (2 Cor. 5:16–21). God changes man thoroughly through reconciliation, and this change is the **work of God**. The "new things" are created by God, just as in creation God spoke the earth into existence. The the earth has its source in God. Salvation is God reconciling the world unto Himself.

We have been made ambassadors of the office of reconcilliation (Rom. 5:19–20). Man's sin separates him from God, but He has committed to us a great word of reconciliation (Rom. 5:21).

## Through Christ's atonement grace reigns (v. 11–21)

### We Joy in God Through Jesus, the provider of Atonement (v. 11)

The facts that God is Love and Christ remains righteous is not enough alone to justify man. A price had to be paid for sin and Christ paid that price with His own blood (the atonement). In verse 11 through 18, Paul draws a contrast of the Reign of Sin and the Reign of Grace.

### Sin imputed & sin's reign (v. 12–14)
 
### The free gift (v. 15–21)

## Conclusion — "By Jesus"   (v. 19–21)

Just as sin reigns unto death, grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal **life**. Just as the law has authority over those that break the law, so grace has power and authority over the righteous. Just as the believer has the power and authority to reign in life they shall have the power and authority to reign in eternity. Adam's sin abounded by the abiding condemnation of the law and reigned unto death. God's abounding grace reigns through His abiding righteousness by Jesus Christ our Lord unto life.

Grace is love, as seen in the death of Christ for the ungodly and in the life Christ gives for those whom He has saved through His death. Condemnation is slavery to death through Adam. Justification is reigning in life by Jesus Christ. In Christ all men are made alive.

Paul draws a powerful contrast of the reign of sin and the reign of grace:
