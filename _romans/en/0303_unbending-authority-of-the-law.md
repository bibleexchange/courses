## The Unbending Authority of the Law (vs. 9-19)

> *Justification is by faith without the deeds of the Law. The Law is: an advantage to those who know it (vs. 1-2), absolute in its nature (vs. 3-8), unbending in its authority (vs. 9-19), has a distinct purpose (vs. 20-30), and is not made void, but rather is established	by our faith. (v. 31).*

The whole world is under the sentence of condemnation.

## The charge is levied against the sinner. &mdash; v. 9

Who is a sinner? We have proven both Jew and Gentile to be under sin as ALL are guilty of breaking the law.

## Witnesses are brought before the accused.

### The witness of creation &mdash; 1:20
### The witness of conscience &mdash; 2:15
### The witness of commandment &mdash; 3:19
 
## The indictment is read from the Scriptures. &mdash; vs. 10-18

### According to the rules of the court the indictment had to be written.

> An indictment is a written accusation or formal charge of a crime or misdemeanor, preferred by a grand jury under oath to a court. - Webster

The Great Judge leaves no excuse for humanity and has Paul use the written Word to indict the accused.

### Paul used their own sacred text to condemn the Jews.
	
The Jew boasted that he possessed the Scripture; now God is using that same Word to expose their sin. God is making them accountable to His Word.

### Although the Gentile did not have the written word; they still had the same principals contained in the Word written on their heart 

## The defense of the accused &mdash; V. 19

What is the defense of the accused?

The accused has nothing to say; every mouth is stopped.
The Day of Judgment will be a day of silence.

## The verdict &mdash; V.20

### GUILTY AS CHARGED!

### No flesh is justified by deeds of law.
	
This law refers to more than Moses Law; there is also reference to moral law and the law of conscience. The Gentile did not posses Moses&apos;s Law, but every man has the moral law of God written on his heart and testified to by his conscience.

### The death penalty has been levied against the condemned. Rom.6:23
