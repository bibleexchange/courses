#I Corinthians Introduction

##The Writer

>1 Corinthians 1:1

<h2>The Purpose of the Writing</h2>
<h3>"To the Church of God which is at Corinth" 1:2</h3>
<h3>"To them that are sanctified" "Called to be saints" 1:2</h3>
<h3>"All that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord" 1:2</h3>
<h3>Paul intended for the letter to circulate beyond this church.</h3>
<h3>To answer questions the Corinthians had concerning problems in the Church. (7:1; 8:1l; 12:1; 16:1) These problems are common today in one form or another.</h3>
<h3>To reprove contentious arguments. I Cor. 1:11-13</h3>
<h3>To defend his apostleship and ministry. I Cor. 9:1-27</h3>
<h2>The Theme</h2>
<p>Cleansing the church from false conceptions. Christian conduct is a top priority.</p>
<p>GIVE ALL YOUR ALLEGIANCE TO JESUS</p>
<h2>Setting: The City of Corinth</h2>
<p>In Paul's day, Corinth was the leading commercial center of Greece and one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire. No other city held such a commanding geographic position in Ancient Greece. Its location on the Isthmus of Corinth, the narrow strip of land that was considered a commercial bridge between the North and the South allowed it to control all travelling merchants. There was a harbor on the west side and the east side giving it the advantage commercially and militarily as a leading naval power.</p>
<p>Corinth was a Grecian city noted as a sports center (I Cor. 9:24-27). It was populous (500,000 - 700,000) and wealthy. The first athletes were attracted to the Isthmian games celebrated near the city. Paul addressed athletes in his epistles.</p>
<p>A cosmopolitan place, intellectually alert, materially
 prosperous, but morally corrupt. The ideal of the Corinthian was the reckless development of the individual. The Corinthian man was a man of pleasure and leisure and proud of his physical strength. The Corinthian's desire was his law—if it feels good, do it. Corinth was a land of idolatry and prostitution. The Greek's worshipped a multitude of false gods and goddesses which included the false goddess Aphrodite who supposedly embodied love and beauty.</p>
<p>Paul looked for strategic places to preach the Gospel (Matt. 28:18-20; Acts 18:1-11). Corinth was also a prestigious center from which the Gospel could spread out to the surrounding districts. Anything preached in Corinth was sure to spread.</p>
<p>The spirit of the city of Corinth was getting into the Church. The church today faces the same problems—carnality and immaturity instead of growth under the Lordship of Christ. Some of the problems in Corinth were:</p>
<h3>INTELLECTUAL PRIDE</h3>
<p>Corinth was the rival of Athens. The Greeks were proud of their language, literature and learning. Paul prepared this epistle to meet the Greek mind. He begins by showing the foolishness of human wisdom. (1:20,21; 2:14; 3:19) Paul renounced human wisdom and influence from his ministry. (1:17; 2:1)</p>
<h3>ADDICTION TO IMMORALITY</h3>
<p>…reported commonly that there is fornication among you. (5:1-11; 6:15-18)</p>
<h3>DRUNKENNESS</h3>
<p>Ye come together not for the better, but for the worse…and another is drunken. (11:17,21)</p>
<h3>CARNALITY</h3>
<p>They were babes before and still babes full of their carnality. Paul had to feed them milk when they should have been mature enough to handle meat. They were still walking as men. (3:1-3)</p>
<h3>LACK OF BROTHERLY LOVE</h3>
<p>Christian brothers were taking each other to secular courts over personal disputes. There was a lack of unity and the common bond of love which is characteristic of Christ. (6:1-8)</p>
<h3>CHURCH ATMOSPHERE OF LUXURY AND LICENTIOUSNES</h3>
<p>Paul admonishes them to set their goals higher and to be more mindful of the kingdom of God. Their affluence has created the dangerous potential for idolatry.</p>
<h3>TORN BY CONTENTION AND DIVISION</h3>
<p>Divisions plagued the church. Loyalty, love and forbearance were replaced by jealousy, bitterness, and revenge. (3:4; 16:12)</p>
<h3>RELAXED IN ITS DISCIPLINE</h3>
<p>Over and over, Paul finds it vitally necessary to instruct them in proper judgment. There is quite a sense of disorder in the church that Paul is confronting in this letter.</p>

<h2>Instructions concerning Spiritual gifts (Ch. 12, 13 &amp; 14)</h2>
<h2>Rules of Unity Ch. 12</h2>
<h3>Spiritual Gifts</h3>
<p>No one ruled by the Spirit of God will ever curse Jesus. 12:3</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost in a person's life will always exalt Jesus, produce morality and unity. Eph 4:3; 4:13</p>
<p>Each gift is necessary for the proper functioning of the Body. 12:12-27</p>
<p>The gifts of the Holy Spirit are given according to the Holy Spirit's will.12:11</p>
<p>There are many members of the one body and all should seek the more excellent way.</p>
<p>We must be growing spiritually and diligently exercising our faith so that God will add to our life more of His Love that we all would be like Him, which is the more excellent way. (12:27-31)</p>
<p>A special gift enabling a Christian to perform a particular ministry in the church. I Cor. 12:4; Rom. 12:4; Eph. 4:4; Heb. 2:4; 1Peter 4:10</p>
<p>Paul gives instructions on the spiritual gifts in 1 Cor. 12:4 - 11, 28 - 30.</p>
<p>Spiritual gifts are gifts and abilities given by the Holy Ghost to be used in the church and in the ministry to reach the world for Christ. People do not always use the gifts in the way that they should be used. Christian believers do not always use their gifts wisely as God wants them used. This happened to the believers in the Corinthian church, and it happens to multitudes of believers and churches in every generation.</p>
<p>The misuse and abuse of God's gifts are the very reasons the whole world has never been reached for Jesus Christ. I Cor. 1:5-9; I Peter 4:10-11</p>
<p>The Gifts of the Spirit are many but only one Holy Ghost There are Nine gifts of the Spirit specifically mentioned in I Corinthians 12:The Word of Wisdom; The Word of Knowledge, Faith, The gifts of Healing, The Working of Miracles. Prophecy, Discerning of spirits, Divers kinds of Tongues, and the interpretation of Tongues.</p>
<p>Paul emphasizes the practical nature of the Spiritual gifts. The Spirit bestows his gifts for the edification of the church, the formation of Christian character, and the service of the community. The reception of a spiritual gift, therefore, brought serious responsibility, since it was essentially an opportunity for yielding yourself in sacrificial service for others and was not self-serving.</p>
<p>The more spectacular gifts such as tongues, healings and miracles necessitate order that would prevent indiscriminate use (1 Cor. 14:40). The spirits of the prophets must be subject to the prophets (vs. 32). Paul clearly insists that those receiving spectacular gifts must remain in order. Speaking in Tongues was not forbidden but encouraged (vs. 39), gifted exposition of the word, instruction in faith, in morals and anointed preaching of the gospel are infinitely superior. The greatest peril lay in overemphasizing the gifts, which tend to exalt the individuals and leads to the loss of the church's awareness of the Spirit's presence and power.</p>
<p>The standard used to judge the relative values of spiritual gifts are: doctrinal (1 Cor. 12:3), moral (1 Cor. 13), and practical (1 Cor. 14).</p>
<h3>Spiritual Authority</h3>
<p>"Some" have been placed in the church for the proper order to be kept and that people would remain submissive and humble. Without the leading, guiding and directing of the Holy Ghost people will go astray. It takes Holy Ghost filled people that operate in the spirit to govern the church properly.</p>
<blockquote>1Cor. 12:28—And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</blockquote>
<p>Apostles. Apostles are Men of God chosen by a Word from God for specific purposes over the church to declare and to do the Will of God. Even when Paul was asked to legislate for the churches he had founded, his authority was not his apostleship but a word from the Lord (1 Cor. 7:10).</p>
<p>Prophets. Prophets stand next in importance to apostles they build up believers in the faith by speaking and teaching the Revealed Word. (1 Cor. 14:6, 26, 30 - 31).</p>
<p>God makes His will known through the prophet Acts 13:1 or a future event will be foretold (Acts 11:28; 21:10 - 11); but the prophet's special gift is the edification, exhortation, consolation, and instruction of the local churches (1 Cor. 14).</p>
<p>Teachers. Carefully distinguished from, the gift of prophecy is the gift of teaching (1 Cor. 12:28 - 29; Rom. 12:7). The prophet proclaims the word; the teacher explained what the prophet proclaims, reduces it to statements of doctrine, and applies it to the situation in which we live. The teacher offers systematic instruction (2 Tim. 2:2) to the local churches. In Eph. 4:11 Paul adds pastor to that of teacher, because no one is able to communicate effectively without loving those who are being instructed. Likewise, to be an effective pastor, one must also be a teacher.</p>
<p>Helpers . The Gift of Helps (1 Cor. 12:28) Helpers; What spiritual gift was signified by "helper" may be gathered from Acts 20:35, where Paul exhorts the Ephesians elders to labor "to help the weak" The deacon was one who ministered to the needy (Acts 6:1 - 6).</p>
<p>The Evangelist. The evangelist is a gift to the church. Timothy is called an evangelist in 2 Tim. 4:5, as is Philip, one of the seven, in Acts 21:The task of preaching the gospel is every believer's responsibility, but Evangelists have been entrusted specifically to encourage and enrich the church as well.. They are to exercise their ministry in the full realization that the power comes from God.</p>
<p>Governments. The Gift of Governments or Administration (1 Cor.12:28; Rom.12:8) Leaders, Directors or elders, who maintain church discipline.</p>
<p>It is absolutely necessary that we follow the leading of the Holy Ghost but If you're not submissive to the God-ordained leadership then you're not submissive to God.</p>
<h2>Rules of Love Ch. 13</h2>
<h2>Love excels spiritual gifts. 13:1-3</h2>
<h2>Love out lasts spiritual gifts. 4-12</h2>
<h2>Love is the greatest. 13:13</h2>
<p>Love is Greater in quality and longer in endurance.</p>
<h3>The value of love 1-3</h3>
<p>More than any sound, More than every Gift, More than all sacrifices</p>
<h3>The virtues of love 4-7</h3>
<p>Long suffering, Kind, Envieth not, Vaunteth not itself, Is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all thing, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
<h3>The victories of love 8-13</h3>
<blockquote>8—Charity never faileth:</blockquote>
<blockquote>10—that which is in part shall be done away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>11—I became a man, I put away childish things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>12—then shall I know even as also I am known.</blockquote>
<blockquote>13—And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</blockquote>
<h2>Rules of Edification Ch. 14</h2>
<h3>The chief test of any spiritual manifestation is edification. 14:12</h3>
<h3>Prophecy is superior to tongues. But if you have a weakness yielding your tongue to the Lord, how can you yield your mind, heart, soul and spirit properly to the Lord to Prophesy. 14:1-12</h3>
<h3>Tongues interpreted edify. 14:22, 26-28</h3>
<h3>Improper manifestation can repel people from the church. 14:23-28</h3>
<h3>The Spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets. 14:32</h3>
<h3>The things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</h3>
<blockquote>1Cor. 14:40—Let all things be done decently and in order.</blockquote>
<blockquote>1Cor. 14:36—What? came the word of God out from you?</blockquote>
<p>[or came it unto you only?]</p>
<h3>Don't abuse the gifts that God gives you by thinking that you are the only teacher and that you have something that no one else has, that God speaks exclusively to you: a truth, insight, revelation, understanding.</h3>
<p>Too many think God doesn't speak specially to people and that God doesn't give truth and insight that other's won't receive but He does, just don't abuse it.</p>
<p>LEARN THE TRUTH</p>
<p>LOVE THE TRUTH</p>
<p>LIVE THE TRUTH</p>
<h3>Be spiritual and covet the best gifts but don't abuse them by just thinking that you are more spiritual than others.</h3>
<blockquote>1Cor. 2:15—But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</blockquote>
<p>The rules laid down by Paul were commandments from the Lord.</p>
<p>Every prophet and every spiritual person must acknowledge this fact and obey the rules.</p>
<p>There were some in Corinth who had rejected the rules God had given Paul.</p>
<p>They thought their gifts and spirituality placed them above the rules and gave them the right to exercise their gifts as they felt led.</p>
<blockquote>1Cor. 14:37—If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</blockquote>
<p>If anyone refuses to accept and follow the rules, then let him remain in his ignorance.</p>

>1 Corinthians 14:38

<p>God will take care of him who rebels and continues to act selfishly in ignorance.</p>

>1 Corinthians 14:23

<p>(Receive from the Lord to help them also.)</p>

>1 Corinthians 14:3

<!--- -->

>1 Corinthians 14:20

(1Cor. 15:33, 34)

<p>A Spiritual minded man is knowledgeable, Faithful and wise in all his ways. All are edified where the spiritual are obedient.</p>
<p>KEY VERSES:</p>
<blockquote>12:31 "Covet earnestly the best gifts"</blockquote>
<blockquote>13:13 "The greatest of these is love"</blockquote>
<blockquote>14:33, 40 "Let all things be done decently and in order"(God of PEACE)</blockquote>
<h2>Errors corrected concerning the resurrection 15:1-58</h2>
<p>KEY VERSES:</p>
<blockquote>15:10 "By the grace of God I am what I am"</blockquote>
<blockquote>15:26 "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"</blockquote>
<blockquote>15:4 "As we have born the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly"</blockquote>
<h2>Instructions concerning stewardship (Ch. 16)</h2>
<p>These are the greatest resources that we have in this world and they must not be wasted: Money 16:1-4, Opportunities 5-9, People 10-24.</p>
<p>KEY VERSES:</p>
<blockquote>16:2 "Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him"</blockquote>
<blockquote>16:9 "A great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries"</blockquote>
<blockquote>16:22 if any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be accursed</blockquote>
<p>There is a deep significance. Failure to recognize Jesus Christ as Lord caused many disorders to creep into their lives. I Cor. 1:1-10; 31; 2:8,16; 3:20; 4:4; 5:4,5; 6:11-14,17; 7:10,11,17; 8:6; 9:1; 10:21; 11:23-32; 12:3; 14:21,37; 15:57,58; 16:10,22,23</p>
<h2>Basic Principles in I Corinthians</h2>
<p>I Tim. 1:19; Heb. 5:11-14; I Cor. 3:1-4; 15:34; II Peter 1:3-10</p>
<h3>Conscience depends on Spiritual knowledge 8:7</h3>
<p>The more spiritual knowledge we know and act upon, the stronger our conscience will become.</p>
<h3>Knowledge must be balanced by love</h3>
<p>I Cor. 1:5; 8:1; 16:14; Eph. 4:5; Phil. 1:9-11; II Peter 1:3,8</p>
<p>The right knowledge is seed for the fruit of God's Love to grow in your heart by faith in the power of God.</p>
<p>For a man to experience the same love of God working in his heart there must first be right knowledge. For every measure of spiritual development there must first be planted a seed of truth.</p>
<h3>The strong must care for the weak I Cor. 8:9; Rom. 14-15</h3>
<h3>Personal rights and privileges must be surrendered for the Gospel's sake 9:1-16</h3>
