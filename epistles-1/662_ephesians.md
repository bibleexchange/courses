<p>The book of Ephesians is like the chambers of God's grace. These chambers are intimate experiences which God brings us into with Himself. Intimacy with God does not involve just one experience, but many. Notice the word is plural - chambers and not chamber.</p>
<blockquote>Song of Solomon 1:4 "The King hath brought me into His chambers."</blockquote>
<h5>The chamber of salvation and redemption</h5>
<h6>The father planned it—thought it 1:4-6</h6>
<h6>The son paid for it—bought it 1:7-12; 2:13</h6>
<h6>The Holy Spirit applies it—wrought it 1:13, 14; 4:30</h6>
<p>Total redemption is the most glorious work of God. To make the world, He spoke the Word. To redeem the world, He sent His only Son to shed His blood on a cruel cross and arise the third day morning from death, hell, and the grave and ascend forty days later to the throne and sat down at the Father's right hand and sent the Holy Ghost to lead us and guide us into all truth from Chamber to Chamber!</p>
<h5>The chamber of power or baptism</h5>
<p>Eph. 1:13, 14, 19; 2:18; 3:7, 16, 20; Luke 24:4; Acts 1:8; I Cor. 12:13</p>

<p>Fruits come and grow by character - Eph. 5:9</p>
<h5>The chamber of intercession and prayer</h5>
<p>1:16; 3:14; 5:19,20; 6:14,18</p>
<h5>The chamber of love and perfection</h5>
<p>1:4,6,15; 2:4; 3:16-19; 4:2,13,15,16,24,31,32; 5:1,2, 25,27-29,33; 6:23,24</p>

<h6>"We have redemption" 1:7,14</h6>
<p>The purpose or end goal of redemption is "adoption" (1:6). Adoption is the The placing of sons - Heb. 2:10; Rom.8:19-23, 29, 30</p>
<p>This is the work of the Spirit. Rom. 8:14; Eph. 1:13,14; He draws us to Christ; He seals us as God's possession, shewing divine ownership and leads us on to the purchased possession. (The complete state of release.) Fully matured sons of God.</p>
<p>This is the work of the Father 1:3 To bless usActs 3:26 1:4To provide for us "We should be holy" 1:5, 11 He sees and knows all things before hand He foreordained sonship - God forces no man's will - His grace works 1:6, 2:8</p>
<p>This is the work of the Son 1:7-12 Heb. 13:12 To redeem us with His own blood To forgive us of sin 1:7, 8 To abound toward us in grace 1:12 We should be to the praise of His glory</p>

<p>The work of the Believer is to receive revelation. "Who believe" 1:19</p>
<p>The work of the Church 1:23"His body" Full of Him -"The fullness of Him that filleth all in all. Functioning by Him. 1)The church is Christ's body that He works through 1:23 and 2)The church is a Holy temple in the Lord 2:21 The church is part of the mystery of Christ.3:4-10 "To the faithful" 1:1, "A perfect man" 4:13, "Unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." 4:13, "The new man" 4:24, "A glorious church" 5:27, and The great mystery is Christ and His bride 5:32 Rev. 3:20—"If any man hear" The whole Church will not listen now, but they will be brought to a place to listen. Rev. 12:14 A Church within a Church, Called out from the called out ones, Individuals that will hear. Overcome as He overcame - Rev. 3:21 Putting on the whole armor of God and fighting from the victory He gives by faith in the promises not for a victory of our own doing in our strength alone. Eph. 6:10-18; Rom. 8:37-39; I Cor. 15:57; II Cor.2:14</p>
<h6>"Ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise" 1:13</h6>
<p>Baptism requires salvation through the blood. (1:13, 7)</p>
<p>The baptism of the Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance. (1:14)</p>
<p>Two commands are given us concerning the Holy Ghost: a)Eph. 4:30"grieve not" and b)Eph. 5:18"be filled".</p>
<h6>"Hath raised us" 2:6</h6>
<h6>Enthroned us</h6>

<p>Throne life requires a revelation in the knowledge of Christ (1:15-19), the hope of His calling (1:18), the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints (1:18), and the exceeding greatness of His power to usward who believe (1:19).</p>
<p>Throne life requires faith. "To usward who believe" (1:19). According to the working of His mighty power(1:19). Unlimited faith - Unlimited power. Limited faith - Limited power.</p>
