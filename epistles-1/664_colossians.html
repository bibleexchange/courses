<h3>"Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God." (1:1)</h3>

<h3>Written around the same time as Philemon probably from Rome shortly before Paul's death while he was a prisoner there (59-62 AD).</h3>

<h3>Show"Christ is all and in all." (3:11)</h3>

<h3>Warn of and correct false teaching that had infiltrated the Church. (1:28)</h3>

<h3>Admonish the saints and faithful brethren in Christ. (1:2)</h3>

<h3>The Lordship of Jesus Christ</h3>

<h2>Introduction (1:1,2)</h2>

<h2>IThanksgiving and prayer for the Lord's Divine Preeminence (1:3-29)</h2>

<h2>IIThe Deity and Preeminence of Christ Jesus the Lord.</h2>

<h2>Warnings and Exhortations (2:4-4:6)</h2>

<h3>Greetings (4:7-18)</h3>

<h2>Introduction (1:1-2)</h2>

<p>Same as in Philippians, Timothy was given honor with Paul</p>

<h2>Thanksgiving and prayer for the Lord's Divine Preeminence (1:3-29)</h2>

<p>The continued prayer for them 1:3,9,13</p>

<p>The apostle's desire 1:9-11</p>

<p>Giving thanks to God 1:3,12-29 For His Word is working in them mightily. First faith is exercised, then hope and love is manifested1:4,5,1:23"Continue in the faith, grounded and settled</p>

<p>" The"hope of the Gospel" is the source of his preaching and teaching. 1:23-28"Made a minister"1:23,25 Sufferings and joy Secrets and mysteries</p>

<p>The labor of love 1:10,24,29 Building downward 1:23"Grounded and settled" Deeper life Building upward 2:7"Built up in Him and established in the faith" Higher life Building inward 3:3"Hid with Christ in God" Inner life Building outward 4:5"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without" Outer life 1:7-11 "As ye also learned of Epaphras" 2:6 "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in Him."3:24"For ye serve the Lord Christ" 4:12"Laboring fervently"</p>

<h2>IThe Deity and Preeminence of Christ Jesus the Lord.</h2>

<p>His preeminence in relation to God. Equal. He is the image of God. He makes God visible</p>

<p>His preeminence in relation to creation"The firstborn of every creature"1:15 His creative power"For by Him were all things created"1:16 His sustaining power"And by Him all things consist" 1:17 His consummating glory"He is before all things"1:17 He is the beginning and the end of all things. He is the cause 1:16"By Him - For Him" He is the firstborn. He is the goal</p>

<p>The preeminence in relation to the Church"He is the head of the body, the church"1:18 This implies sovereignty - government This implies responsibility - lordship. This implies union - He is the head, we are the body (baptized believers) I Cor. 12:13 He is the only redeemer"We have redemption through His blood" 1:14"To every creature which is under heaven" 1:23 Reconciled unto perfection 1:19-23,28 He is the fulfillment of the mystery"But now is made manifest to His saints" 1:26"Among the Gentiles" 1:27"Which is Christ in you the hope of glory" 1:27 Divinely qualified for inheritance 1:12,13; 2:1-3</p>

<p>The Savior The Head of the BodyThe Bridegroom</p>

<p>The Saved -----The Body of Christ----The Bride of Christ</p>

<blockquote>Col 1:9—For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</blockquote>

<blockquote>10—That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</blockquote>

<blockquote>11—Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Col. 1:24—Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hebrews 6:12—That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</blockquote>

<p>Beginning with the Reformation, God began restoring"the faith which was once delivered unto the saints." That is, the Faith that had been lost through tradition, opinions and human ideas.</p>

<blockquote>I Cor. 2:14—The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned</span>
<span id="t1004#" class="swahili">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>

<p>Romans 1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>

<p>The Body of true believers is now one fold.</p>

<blockquote>John 10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</blockquote>

<p>There is a body called the General assembly, and not all are of the Lord's planting.</p>

<blockquote>Mat. 15:13 But he answered and said, every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mat. 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</blockquote>

<h4>23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</h4>

<p>There is one Body of true believers in the general assembly born into the family of God.</p>

<p>Not all people in the general assembly are born again and only those who have been born again are a part of the Family of God.</p>

<blockquote>Eph 3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</blockquote>

<blockquote>15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</blockquote>

<blockquote>John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</blockquote>

<h4>5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</h4>

<blockquote>Mat. 13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mathew 21:43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</blockquote>

<p>There is one body, that God is building Mathew 16:18"I will build My Church"</p>

<p>Jesus said,"If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine" (John 7:17).</p>

<p>There has to be obedience to the truth already revealed to receive more truth.</p>

<blockquote>Proverbs 4:18 says,"The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day."</blockquote>

<p>The Wisdom of God is what we need to receive; you can't know divine truth unless God reveals it to you.</p>

<p>The Spiritual are given the understanding by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The experience that God has for us is greater than anyone of us can even imagine.</p>

<blockquote>1Cor. 2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Heb 3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</blockquote>

<p>Hebrews 3:8-5:14</p>

<blockquote>Heb 4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mat. 11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</blockquote>

<p>rest (anapauo) rest (anapausis) rest (katapausis) rest (katapauo) rest (sabbatismos)</p>

<blockquote>Eph 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Acts 4:25 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</blockquote>

<p>It does not matter how hard you try, your imagination will be vain without the Lord helping you.</p>

<blockquote>II Timothy 2:7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Eph 1:18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Eph 4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Acts 2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</blockquote>

<p>The Lord added the saved to the general assembly</p>

<p>157 ekklhsia ekklesia, ek-klay-see'-ah A calling out, a popular meeting, especially a religious congregation</p>

<p>Christian community of members, assembly, church, the local church.</p>

<blockquote>Acts 7:38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:</blockquote>

<p>The church in the wilderness is the general assembly of Israel that God brought out of Egypt</p>

<blockquote>Numbers 1:45 So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Numbers 14:29 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Numbers 26:64 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 65 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Joshua 5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jude 1:5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1 Cor. 12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</blockquote>

<p>God hath set some in the church (The general assembly-the local church has some men of God)</p>

<p>Not all men in the local church are ordained of God.</p>

<p>All men in the Body of Christ are ordained of God.</p>

<blockquote>Eph 4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;</blockquote>

<p>swma soma, so'-mah The body (as a sound whole), used in a very wide application, literally or figuratively:--bodily, body, slave.</p>

<blockquote>Romans 12:5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</blockquote>

<p>I will build my church</p>

<blockquote>Mathew 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</blockquote>
