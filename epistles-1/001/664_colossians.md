<h2>IThe Deity and Preeminence of Christ Jesus the Lord.</h2>
<p>His preeminence in relation to God. Equal. He is the image of God. He makes God visible</p>

He is the cause 1:16"By Him - For Him" He is the firstborn. He is the goal</p>
<p>The preeminence in relation to the Church"He is the head of the body, the church"1:18 This implies sovereignty - government This implies responsibility - lordship. This implies union - He is the head, we are the body (baptized believers) I Cor. 12:13 He is the only redeemer"We have redemption through His blood" 1:14"To every creature which is under heaven" 1:23 Reconciled unto perfection 1:19-23,28 He is the fulfillment of the mystery"But now is made manifest to His saints" 1:26"Among the Gentiles" 1:27"Which is Christ in you the hope of glory" 1:27 Divinely qualified for inheritance 1:12,13; 2:1-3</p>
