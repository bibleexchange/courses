<h2>Introduction to Galatians</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Personal Declarations (Ch. 1 &amp;2)</h2>
<p>Chapters 1 and 2 are generally personal in nature. Paul feels it necessary to establish the fact and premise of his own apostleship. Paul claims he was an apostle before he met the other apostles, they recognized him as an apostle and he even rebuked Peter to the face.</p>
<h2>Doctrinal Declarations (Ch. 3 &amp; 4)</h2>
<p>Chapters 3 and 4 are generally doctrinal in nature. The true children of God are the children of Abraham by faith who was saved by faith and not circumcision.</p>
<h2>
<span id="t##" class="english">Practical Declarations (Ch. 5 &amp; 6)</h2>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 are generally practical in nature. You are in bondage if you live under the law, but you are free if you live above the law by faith. Obedience to the moral law of God is liberty.</p></div>
<h2>Personal Declarations (Ch. 1 &amp; 2)</h2>
<h3>The Call of God (1:1-6)</h3>
<h4>Paul's call came from the Lord</h4>
<h5>Direct 1:1"By Jesus Christ"</h5>
<p>Appeared to Him. Acts 9 and called him as He did the other disciples.</p>
<h5>Divine 1:1"And God the Father"</h5>
<p>1:12"By the revelation of Jesus Christ"</p>
<h5>Distinct</h5>
<h6>1:6"Into the grace of Christ"</h6>
<h6>1:15"Called me by His grace"</h6>
<h4>Galatians' call came from the Lord</h4>
<h5>Direct</h5>
<p>1:6"Him that calleth you"</p>
<p>5:8 "Him that calleth you"</p>
<h5>Divine 1:4 "According to the will of God and our Father"</h5>
<h5>Distinct 1:4 "Deliver us from this present evil world."</h5>
<h4>The Believer's call comes from the Lord (3:22)</h4>
<h5>Direct 3:22 "Of Jesus Christ"</h5>
<h5>Divine 3:26 "Children of God by faith"</h5>
<h5>Distinct 2:16 "Justified by the faith of Christ Jesus"</h5>
<p>3:27 "Baptized into Christ"</p>
<p>3:27 "Put on Christ"</p>
<h3>The Grace of Christ 1:3, 6,15; 2:21; 5:4; 6:18</h3>
<h4>A definite calling 1:6</h4>
<p>Called by the gospel in the Bible 1:6."Called into the grace of Christ."</p>
<h4>A definite warning 1:8, 9</h4>
<p>It is dangerous to project anything into your mind that is not in the Bible.</p>
<h4>Subtle 3:1</h4>
<p>Whatever comes by revelation of the Spirit will agree with the Bible.</p>
<p>"not after man…but after the revelation of Jesus Christ."</p>
<h3>A Revelation of Christ in Paul</h3>
<p>God's interest in His Son equals the interest He has for every one in the world.</p>
<blockquote>John 3:16—For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</blockquote>
<p>Communicate the same gospel that they can have the same revelation 2:2, 5; 3:5; 4:19, 30; 5:3</p>
<p>"I went in to Arabia" 1:17</p>
<h2>Doctrinal Declarations (Ch. 3 &amp; 4)</h2>
<h3>"Bewitched" Gal. 3:1</h3>
<h4>The means of bewitching</h4>
<h4>The power of this bewitching</h4>
<h4>The means of escape from this bewitchment.</h4>
<p>They left the truth to turn back to the rituals of the law. 5:4-6</p>
<h3>Obey the moral law of God through faith. Gal. 3:11; 5:5, 6; 18-21</h3>
<h3>The Ideal Life Gal. 2:16-21</h3>
<h4>The nature of this life 2:19; Rom. 6:6</h4>
<p>Rom 6:11"alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."</p>
<p>In the world but not of the world</p>
<h4>Christ liveth in me Gal. 2:20</h4>
<h4>Live as a branch from the vine John 15:1-10</h4>
<h3>The Curse Has Been Lifted</h3>
<p>Gal. 3:13"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law."</p>
<h3>The Cross was a part of the curse</h3>
<h4>Through the cross the penalties of the broken law have been removed.</h4>
<p>Thorns also, …shall it bring forth to thee.</p>
<p>Gen. 2:21-23</p>
<p>When God formed a bride for Adam, God took from Adam's side.</p>
<p>From out of the riven side of the body of Christ, He will take a rib and form a bride.</p>
<h4>Christ is alive Acts 1:3</h4>
<p>The cross and the empty tomb are proof the curse has been lifted.</p>
<h3>The Positioning of Sons Gal. 4:1-7</h3>
<p>The positioning of sons is known as spiritual adoption. God does not adopt children into the family of God.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the Holy Ghost is to bring to birth every believer. John 3:5; I Peter 1:23</p>
<p>The responsibility of the church is to nurture the newborn babes.</p>
<p>Gal 4:2; I Peter 2:2; John 21:15-17; Luke 22:32; I Cor.3:1, 2; Heb 5:12,13; Eph 4:11, 12</p>
<p>A new born is dependent on the milk of the Word. Eph. 2:8"By grace through faith"</p>
<p>The responsibility of the individual to work out what God has worked in. Phil. 2:12, 13</p>
<p>Heb. 2:1; 5:12; 6:1, 11-12</p>
<p>The baptism into the body of Christ is the operation of the Holy Ghost. I Cor. 12:13; Eph. 1:13,14</p>
<p>There are many operations of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<h5>When a child of God reaches maturity he is placed as a son. Gal. 4:7, 19; Rom. 8:14-30; Eph. 4:13; Heb.2:10</h5>
<p>4:5 (total release from the curse and bondages of breaking the law.) We need to stay completely out in front of the laws of God upholding and fulfilling each one. Ephesians 1:14</p>
<h5>Grace positions the full matured in a higher position like His son.</h5>
<h2>Practical Declarations (Ch. 5 &amp; 6)</h2>
<p>Marks of the Spiritual Christian Gal. 6:17</p>
<blockquote>Galatians 6:17 …I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</blockquote>
<h3>Holiness</h3>
<blockquote>Galatians 5:13 …use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh,…</blockquote>
<blockquote>Galatians 5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Galatians 5:22,23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Galatians 5:24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Psalms 29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Psalms 90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</blockquote>
<p>Holiness will produce happiness John 13:17; Psa. 16:11</p>
<h3>The cross is that which comes to us as a result of obeying Christ.</h3>
<p>To carry the cross means to be attached to the person of Christ.</p>
<h3>The desire to see the honor of God advanced—To be like Christ.</h3>
<p>Absolutely nothing brings more honor to the Lord than for His people to become like Him.</p>
<blockquote>Gal. 3:27—For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</blockquote>
<blockquote>4:19—My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</blockquote>
<blockquote>5:24—And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>6:18—Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Luke 22:42—"Not my will, but Thine, be done."</blockquote>
