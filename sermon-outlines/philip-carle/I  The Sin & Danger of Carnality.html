practice. &nbsp;Its defiling influence has worked on your heart </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">and affections</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> for a long time. &nbsp;It has become so familiar that it

the heart seeks to think of itself as in a good state all the while allowing some sin or lust without striving to mortify it. &nbsp;To think on good qualities to quiet the conscience when we are being convicted of sin is a deceitful devise of the heart </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">that is in love with sin</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="csB456B2E3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB456B2E3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3. &nbsp;When sin often succeeds in obtaining the consent of the will. &nbsp;Though we may not do the outward act, </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">yet if we embrace the desire for it, the temptation has succeeded</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. &nbsp;The will finds delight in or affection for a sin. &nbsp;He chooses ways that lead in the direction of that sin. &nbsp;If sin frequently succeeds in this way, he is in a very dangerous condition.</span></p><p class="csB456B2E3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB456B2E3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">4. &nbsp;When a man fights against a sin only because of the consequences or penalty of that sin. &nbsp;This is evidence that this sin has a great grip on his will and his heart is full of wickedness. &nbsp;They do not hate the sin, they fear being put to shame before men or they fear the judgment of God. &nbsp;These cannot say that they love God. &nbsp;</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">If a person is under the power of sin to the extent that the only opposition to it is the law, hell and

of the spirit of this world and in subjection to the devil. &nbsp;Carnality is sin. &nbsp;It is a stain on our wedding garment. &nbsp;It defiles our soul rendering us unclean and guilty before God. &nbsp;We must repent of it and overcome it. &nbsp;There is a day of reckoning coming where every individual will stand before Christ to give an account of everything that they have done, every word they have spoken together with every hidden motive, thought and purpose. &nbsp;Every thought, motive, word and deed that is not covered by the blood, though hidden from the eyes of man, will be revealed before all the inhabitants of heaven and earth and He who is perfect in justice and judgment will judge them. &nbsp;Then we will have no opportunity to repent, to change our ways or to ask for forgiveness. &nbsp;That opportunity is granted to us now. &nbsp;Diligently respond to the Lord&rsquo;s conviction and dealings now with a tender heart so that those things will not be brought up on that day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Corinthians 4:5</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Therefore judge
