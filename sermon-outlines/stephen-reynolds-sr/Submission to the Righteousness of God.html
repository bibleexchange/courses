But this man repented and he believed in his heart that God would raise Him from the dead (Lk.23:42) and with his mouth he confessed Him as Lord and King (Lk.23:42). May we believe and confess as this man did!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Christ has done the work of salvation; man is responsible to believe and confess. (The ship is fully able to get you to London but you must get on the ship!) What is this word of faith which we preach (see v.8)? Verse 9 gives the answer (&quot;that&quot; means &quot;namely&quot;). CONFESS is the Greek word &quot;homologeo (homo=same; logeo=from a verb which means to say, to speak&quot;) and thus it means &quot;to say the same thing as another, to agree with another person.&quot; The believer is to confess Christ before men (Matt. 10:32) which means that he is to vocally and publicly agree with what God has said concerning His Son (1 John 5:9-12). God has said, &quot;This is My beloved Son&quot; (Matt. 17:5) and the believer who confesses Christ is in agreement with that statement (see 1 John 4:15). God the Son came into the world and took upon Himself human flesh (John 1:14) so that He could die for sinful men (1 Tim. 1:15), and the believer who confesses Christ is in agreement with this fact (read 1 John 4:2-3).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">To confess that Jesus is the Christ means that a person agrees that Jesus is indeed the Messiah (John 1:41; 4:25-26,42). According to the Old Testament Scriptures, the Messiah was portrayed as 1) the God-man (Isa.7:14); 2) the mighty God (Isa.9:6); 3) the sinner&rsquo;s Substitute and Saviour (Isaiah 53: 4); the eternal King (Micah5:2) and 5) THE LORD (JEHOVAH) OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS (Jer.23:5-6). There is a cost involved in confessing that Jesus is the Messiah (John 9:22) and because of this cost many fail to confess Him (John 12:42). But those who do confess Him before men have Christ&#39;s own promise that He will confess them before the angels and before His heavenly Father (Matt.10:32; Luke 12:8).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The word that means the opposite of &quot;confess&quot; is the word &quot;deny&quot; (John 1:20; 1 John 2:22-23). To confess is to say &quot;YES&quot;; to deny is to say &quot;NO.&quot; In Luke 22:57-60 Peter should have said, &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Yes</span><span class="csA7555675">, I know Him (v.57)!&quot; &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Yes</span><span class="csA7555675">, I am one of them (v.58)!&quot; &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Yes</span><span class="csA7555675">, I was with Him (verses 59-60)!&quot; But Peter denied Christ (although his denial was only temporary because later, on the day of Pentecost, he boldly confessed Christ and preached Christ before thousands--Acts chapter 2). Thus, when asked this question, &quot;Do you own Jesus as your Saviour and Lord? Do you claim Him as your own?&quot; the believer can respond: &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Yes</span><span class="csA7555675"> I do! I acknowledge that He is mine! I belong to the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me!&quot; During the great Christian persecutions of the second and third centuries, those believers who would not deny the Lord even at the risk of great suffering were known as CONFESSORS. May we never be ashamed of the God who was unashamed to die for us (2 Tim. 1:8; Rom.1:16; 1 Pet. 4:16)!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Finally, the confession of our mouth must be matched with the conduct of our life. In Titus 1:16 Paul describes a group of people who confess that they know God! But do they really know the living God? Their lips say, &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Yes</span><span class="csA7555675">, we know God!&quot; But their lives says, &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">No</span><span class="csA7555675">, we don&rsquo;t know God.&quot; Their walk is in conflict with their talk and this is an abomination to the Lord. These people name the name of Christ but they do not belong to God (2 Tim. 2:19). Though they claim to know God, they are liars and the truth is not in them (1 John 2:3-4). As believers in Christ, may we like Timothy confess a good confession before all men (1 Tim. 6:12). May the world see that the Christ we name with our lips is the God we serve with our lives! Just as a label on a can is there to confess its contents, so believers ought to confess their Lord and Saviour clearly, without being ashamed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the </span><span class="csC57700C4">Lord</span><span class="csA7555675"> Jesus&quot;&mdash;the emphasis is upon the word &quot;Lord.&quot; The phrase actually should be translated, &quot;If thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is Lord.&quot; It is the same construction as Philippians 2:11 (&quot;that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord&quot;) where it is translated correctly in the KJV (compare also Romans 10:9 in the NASB, NIV, Amplified, etc.). Jesus is Lord! This is the truth that must be confessed out of the mouth of the believer. The word &quot;Lord&quot; is the Greek word &quot;kurios&quot; which is the word consistently used in the O.T. for JEHOVAH (in the Septuagint). We must confess that Jesus is JEHOVAH, which means that He is GOD (the only Saviour and the only God--see Isaiah 43:11; 44:6,8; 45:21-22 where JEHOVAH declares Himself to be the only God and the only Saviour. There is none else!). Jesus Christ is God. He is the sovereign Lord! He is Jehovah Jesus! Believers gladly confess this truth now (Rom.10:9). All men will someday confess this truth (Phil. 2:11). In the early centuries the Christian believers refused to bow down to Caesar and they refused to call him Lord. Instead they confessed that Jesus was Lord!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">If Jesus Christ is really MY Lord, then He demands and deserves my glad submission and wholehearted obedience. I humbly bow before His authority and I gladly do those things that please Him. How can I do anything less?

Often the question is asked, &quot;Can a person receive Christ as Saviour and not as Lord?&quot; On the one extreme are those who teach that 1) People can receive Christ as Saviour but reject His Lordship, and thus they can live any way they please;&nbsp; 2) Believers will go to heaven because they are saved, but many of them will live immoral and wicked lives during their time on earth so that you cannot even distinguish them from unbelievers; however, these carnal ones will not receive any rewards; 3) Believers can live in total rebellion against the authority of Christ over their lives and yet still be saved. On the other extreme are those who teach that every saved person will inevitably bow before the authority of Christ and will fully submit to His Lordship in every area of his life and be His faithful disciple. They would say that there is no such thing as a carnal Christian and that any significant evidence of carnality would indicate that the person is not saved at all. As is often the case, Biblical teaching on this subject is found somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. God&rsquo;s truth must ever be kept in careful balance. </span><span class="csC57700C4">&quot;The pendulum swings, ridiculous extreme, bypassing the truth which lieth between.&quot;</span><span class="csA7555675"> Consider the following: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The term &quot;Lord&quot; (kurios) is used of a master who is lord over his slave or slaves (Col. 3:22). The believer can say, &quot;Jesus C</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">hrist is my Master and I am His </span><span class="csA7555675">love-slave!&quot; <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The term &quot;Lord&quot; is used of an emperor or king who is lord over his subjects. It was used of the Roman emperor: &quot;Caesar is Lord!&quot; Compare Acts 25:26; Matthew 27:63 (of Pilate) and Rev. 17:14. The bel</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">iever can say, &quot;Jesus Christ is my King and I am His </span><span class="csA7555675">subject!&quot;<br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The term &quot;Lord&quot; is used of a husband who is lord over his wife (1 Peter 3:6). The overcoming believer is to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom.7:4; Eph.5:22ff.). <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The term is used of an employer who is lord over his employee (Luke 16:3,5). The believer can say, &quot;The Lord Jesus is my Master and my Boss.&quot; <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The term is used, of a father who is lord over his son (Matthew 21:30). The believer submits to God as his heavenly Father. <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">To the Jew the term &quot;kurios&quot; was a Greek word which was used to translate two important names of God: 1) Adonai (meaning Master and Lord and Sovereign One; and 2) Jehovah (the most sacred Name for God as far as the Jews were concerned; it referred to absolute deity). See Psalm 110:1&mdash;&quot;&quot;The LORD (Jehovah) said unto my Lord (Adonai).&quot; In the Greek translation both of these Names are translated by KURIOS (Lord). <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Hence when Thomas saw the risen Lord he said, &quot;My Lord and my God&quot; (John 20:28) and this included such meanings as &quot;my Lord, my Master, my Sovereign, my Owner, My Authority, etc.&quot; <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The Saviour whom we preach is Jesus Christ the Lord! &quot;For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord&quot; (2 Cor.4:5). He cannot be other than who He is! Christ cannot be divided (one part of Him is Saviour and the other part is Lord). <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">When a person receives Christ as Saviour he also receives Him as Lord because that is exactly who He is! Note carefully Colossians 2:6--&quot;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus THE LORD.&quot; Who is this Saviour that I have believed on? See Luke 2:11--&quot;a Saviour who is Christ the Lord!&quot; We must never divorce the Lordship of Christ from His Saviourhood (or vice versa). A person must not say, &quot;I receive Him as Saviour but I reject Him as Lord!&quot; This is impossible because the Person you received (if you really did receive Him) is Lord of all (Acts 10:36). He is the Lord Jesus Christ and He is Lord of all.&nbsp; He is Lord right now whether you believe it or not, whether you live like it or not, whether you acknowledge it or not or whether you surrender to Him or not. He is just what He is and He is all that God says He is! When a person receives the Lord he receives Him for all that He is. <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">See Acts 9:6 and Acts 22:10. The apostle Paul surrendered to the Lordship of Christ right from the start. May the heart cry of every true believer be, &quot;Lord, what do you want me to do?&quot; (compare Isaiah 6:8--Here am I Lord!) <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">See Acts 16:31. The One we are to believe on is LORD! cf. John 9:38. <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">IS JESUS CHRIST YOUR LORD?</span><span class="csA7555675"> Every true believer without any hesitation should say &quot;YES&quot; and &quot;AMEN!&quot; If a person can&rsquo;t say that, we would have to question whether or not he is really saved (1 Cor.12:3). <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">ARE YOU LIVING CONSISTENTLY WITH THE FACT OF HIS LORDSHIP?</span><span class="csA7555675"> This is a different question, and the honest believer would confess that often he is inconsistent. In shame but in honesty he might say, &quot;Many times I have failed to obey my Lord and to submit to Him, and I have failed to allow Him to be the complete authority over my life. In and of myself I am very prone to rebel . But I know that He is Lord and my desire is to obey Him in all things.&quot; <br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Such inconsistencies are found frequently on the pages of the Bible. Examples: If Jesus is really Lord, then how could Peter say, &quot;Not so, Lord&quot; (Acts 10:14)? If Jesus is really Lord, then how could Peter contradict His Word and say, &quot;Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee&quot; (Matthew 16:22)? If Jesus is really Lord how could Peter say what he said in John 13:6,8? Every act of disobedience, every sin committed by a believer is an affront to the Lordship of Christ. But God does not disown us for these things. How gracious He is! This is why we have an Advocate (1 John 2:1-2)!<br/>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The more we grow in the Lord the more we will understand the many implications of the Lordship of Christ and how this truth affects every area of our lives. This happens gradually, not all at once (2 Cor.3:18). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">And shalt believe in thine heart</span><span class="csA7555675">&quot;&mdash;. The believing actually precedes the confessing (as in v.10). Confession is the outward and audible expression of one&#39;s inward faith. &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">With the heart</span><span class="csA7555675">&quot;--many have an intellectual, head-knowledge concerning Christ, but this is not enough (see Acts 8:37--&quot;with all your heart&quot;). When a person is saved God does a wonderful work in the heart (Acts 16:14). The gospel must be &quot;obeyed from the heart&quot; (Romans 6:17). The heart is involved in serving the Lord as well, &quot;doing the will of God from the heart&quot; (Eph.6:5-6). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Believe...that God hath raised Him from the dead</span><span class="csA7555675">&quot;. Belief in the bodily resurrection of Christ is essential for salvation. Our faith is in a living Saviour (Rom. 4:25; 1 Cor.15:14-19). The substitutionary death of Christ is not mentioned here but it is implied here (to be raised He must have died), and the importance of His death has been taught by Paul repeatedly in this book of Romans. &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Thou shalt be saved</span><span class="csA7555675">&quot; is God&rsquo;s sure salvation promise! If man does the believing God will do the saving. Have you claimed this glorious salvation promise and made it your very own? Is your heart believing on Him? Is your mouth speaking of Him?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:10</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">This verse explains verse 9 (&quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">for</span><span class="csA7555675">&quot;) and gives the proper order or sequence of events: first belief and then confession. &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">With the heart man believes unto righteousness</span><span class="csA7555675">&quot;--compare Romans 4:3,5 (a person believes God and it is counted unto him for righteousness). Believing is inward; confession is outward (just as the heart and the mouth&mdash;the heart is inward and not visible; the mouth is outward and visible). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">CONFESSION IS FAITH MADE AUDIBLE!</span><span class="csA7555675"> (just as good works are faith made visible--see James 2:14-26). How can I know whether you really are saved until you confess? &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Confession is made unto salvation</span><span class="csA7555675">.&quot; This does not mean that confession is a condition of salvation (you must confess Christ in order to be saved) but it means that confession is a result or evidence of salvation (you confess Christ to show that you are saved). Confession is not something that a person does to be saved; confession is something that a saved person does! Faith must be expressed OUTWARDLY and PUBLICLY. Believing is the root; confession is the fruit. Everyone who truly believes will confess Christ (Matthew 10:32; Rom.10:9 and cf. Rev. 3:5). However not everyone who confesses Christ is a true believer (see Matthew 7:23; Titus1:16 and 2 Timothy 2:19). In God&rsquo;s army there is no place for &quot;secret believers.&quot; May we never be ashamed of our Commander-in-Chief (2 Timothy 2:3-4)!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Just as a label on a can proclaims its contents, so it is that by confession the believer proclaims who lives within (2 Cor.13:5 &quot;....Jesus Christ is in you&quot;).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:11</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">This verse explains verse 10 (&quot;for&quot;).

In that passage there is no difference because all have sinned and all are under condemnation (all men partake in the same condemnation). In Romans chapter 10 there is no difference because the same Lord will pour out His riches to all who call upon Him (all men are invited to partake in the same salvation).

See Romans 3:29 and Acts 10:34-36 (the first time the gospel was preached to the Gentiles). God is RICH unto every person who calls upon Him. He pours out His wealth on those who call upon His Name. Only those who receive the gift of God (Romans 6:23; 5:17; Eph.2:8-9; etc.) know how valuable and precious this gift is. The goodness of God is only known by those who &quot;taste and see&quot; (Psalm 34:8 and 1 Pet. 2:3). Only believers can begin to know &quot;the riches of His grace&quot; (Eph.1:7) and the &quot;unsearchable riches of Christ&quot; (Eph.3:8). How rich are you?

The chronological order is the opposite: First God sends the preacher who preaches the gospel, the sinner hears, believes in his heart and calls upon the Name of the Lord. We who are saved can thank God for sending someone with the message of good news our way. We who are saved &quot;owe&quot; the gospel to others who have not heard (see Romans 1:15-16 where we learn that Paul was a debtor!).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Before a person calls on Christ, he must first believe on Christ in his heart.

His words merely expressed the faith which he already had.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Before a person believes on Christ he must HEAR (compare John 9:35-38). A person cannot believe on Christ if he has never heard of Christ. Faith fixes itself upon the facts concerning WHO CHRIST IS and WHAT HE HAS DONE. The facts are found in the Word of God and those facts must be HEARD (compare Rom.10:17).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Before a person can hear, he must have the gospel preached unto him (or have the gospel delivered to him in some way such as a tract or Gospel of John, etc.). Without a preacher there is no gospel message and thus there can be no faith and no salvation. Believers have an awesome responsibility in this because WE ARE THE PREACHERS GOD USES (neither angels nor anyone else).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Before a person can preach (v.15), he must be SENT (BY GOD)! God is the One who does the sending! God, not man, sends forth His servants and His missionaries. We do the PRAYING (Matthew 9:38) and God will do the SENDING. How beautiful are the feet of those whom God has sent who are faithfully proclaiming the good news! How ugly are the feet of those who have gone forth preaching the false message having never been sent by God (see Jeremiah 14:14,15; 23:21,32 and also Gal. 1:8-9). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">A missionary was preaching in the village market, and some of the people were laughing at him because he was not a very handsome man.

Nor do I have beautiful teeth, for they are really not mine; they were made by the dentist. I do not have a beautiful face, nor can I afford to wear beautiful clothes.

The tragedy is that the great majority of those who hear the gospel reject it, and this brings us to verse 16.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:16</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">How tragic! God has good news, and men don&#39;t want it! They reject God&rsquo;s offer of peace (v.15). They reject God&#39;s invitation to be saved (v.13). They reject God&#39;s riches (v.12). They reject God&#39;s so-great salvation (v.9). They reject God&#39;s righteousness (v.3). It is the tragedy of man&#39;s foolish unbelief! They have not all obeyed the gospel. Indeed, the great majority of people have DISOBEYED the gospel. How does a person disobey the gospel? By refusing to believe it! God&#39;s commandment is clearly seen in 1 John 3:23 (the first part of the verse), and those who disobey this command are disobedient to the gospel. Isaiah the prophet anticipated this terrible unbelief in the first verse of that important 53rd chapter which speaks of the Messiah dying for our sins. &quot;Who hath believed our report?&quot; Not many! How sad that the vast majority of Jews reject the great message of Isaiah 53 even to this day (and the majority of Gentiles do as well!).&nbsp; &quot;And to whom is the arm (symbol of strength and power) of the LORD revealed (uncovered, discovered)?&quot; The gospel is hidden to those who are lost (2 Cor. 4:3) and the message of the cross is &quot;foolishness&quot; to them (1 Cor.1:18) but unto us who are saved it is the POWER of God (1 Cor.1:18,24; Rom.1:16). Isaiah 53:1 found its fulfillment in John 12:37-38, and it is still being fulfilled today as men and women reject the gospel of God&#39;s grace and refuse to trust the Son of God, the only Saviour.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:17</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The word &quot;hearing&quot; (two times in v.17) is the same Greek word as the word &quot;report&quot; in v.16. For a person to be saved there must be a report and a message that is heard, and this report or message must be believed. How can I obtain saving faith? How can saving faith come my way? I must hear the message of God&#39;s Word and respond to it in a positive way. God&#39;s Word is POWERFUL (Heb.4:12). God&#39;s Word is EFFECTUAL (1 Thess.2:13). God&#39;s Word is ALIVE (John 6:63,68; Heb. 4:12). God&#39;s Word is PENETRATING (Heb.4:12; Eph.6:17). God&#39;s Word is able to make a person WISE UNTO SALVATION (2 Tim. 3:15). Man&#39;s faith must fix itself upon God&#39;s facts and God&#39;s facts are found in the Word of God. This does not mean that everyone who hears the gospel facts from the Bible will be saved (as we have seen in Rom.10:16). But it does mean that no one will be saved without hearing the gospel facts from the Bible. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Trying to pierce a sinner&#39;s heart without the Bible is like a soldier trying to pierce the enemy&#39;s heart without a sword. Believers do not need to defend the Bible nor do they need to try to prove that its true. They simply need to USE THE BIBLE, trusting a great God to honor His Word and do the work in the hearts of men and women. God&#39;s Word will go forth and accomplish its purpose (see Isaiah 55:11). God&#39;s preachers must be men of the Book! May we never substitute our own ideas, opinions or philosophies for the pure, unadulterated truth of God&#39;s Word! Compare Ephesians 1:13 (faith comes by hearing the gospel!).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:18</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Why don&#39;t people obey the gospel (v.16)? Why don&#39;t people come to faith in Christ (v.17)? Why have so many of the Jews failed to obey the gospel and come to Christ in faith? IS IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT HEARD? No, </span><span class="csC57700C4">they have heard!</span><span class="csA7555675"> They got the message! They heard the message! The problem was that they did not respond to the message in faith. God has no problem getting His message to men. Paul quotes from Psalm 19:4, a passage which sets forth the truth that the knowledge of God and the glory of God have been made known to all men in every part of the world by way of CREATION. We studied this in detail in Romans <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.middletownbiblechurch.org/romans/romans1.htm"><span class="cs426F745E">chapter 1</span></a></span><span class="csA7555675">. As a result, all men are WITHOUT EXCUSE because God has made Himself known. Often people will ask, &quot;What about those people in far off lands who have never heard the gospel?&quot; On the one hand it is certainly true that they cannot hear the gospel message (of Christ and the cross) without a preacher (Rom.10:14), and the church of Jesus Christ has been given the responsibility and the command to preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15) and to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). We should also note that God is the One who SENDS THE PREACHERS (Rom.10:15 and Matthew 9:38) and in His wisdom God sends the right person to the right place at the right time with the right message. On the other hand, it is true that all men on the face of the earth have HEARD the message of God as revealed in CREATION. Because of sin men rejected and suppressed and cast out the knowledge of God which they had (Romans chapter 1, see especially verses 21-23,28).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Not only have all men heard God&#39;s revelation in nature, but there is another message which during this church age is being proclaimed far and wide, namely the gospel message:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Preach the gospel to every creature&quot; (Mark 16:15)<br/>&quot;And they went forth and preached everywhere&quot; (Mark 16:20)<br/>&quot;The truth of the gospel which has come unto you, as it is in all the world&quot; (Col. 1:5-6)<br/>&quot;The gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature under heaven&quot; (Col. 1:23)<br/>My gospel...made known to all nations for the obedience of faith (Rom.16:26)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:19</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Did Israel know about God&#39;s message going into all the earth, to the ends of the inhabited earth, even to the despised Gentiles? They should have known because their own Scriptures indicated this. First Paul quotes from MOSES (see Deut.32:21, and notice that the Bible clearly teaches that Moses was the human author of Deuteronomy, a fact that is denied by unbelievers today). In Deuteronomy 32:21 the people provoked God to jealousy by that which is not God, and so God would provoke them to jealousy by those who are &quot;no people.&quot; They chose another god; He would choose another people! &quot;Foolish&quot; means without understanding. Here is a people with no understanding (see Titus 3:3), and yet they believe the gospel. The Jews, who had the Scriptures and who should have had understanding, reject Christ and His gospel. See Romans 11:11.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:20-21</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Paul&#39;s second quote is from Isaiah 65:1-2. &quot;Made manifest&quot; means &quot;revealed.&quot; The Gentiles did not seek God (Rom.9:30), but God sought and found them (cf. Luke 19:10). God is the Seeker and He is now seeking &quot;those that asked not of Him&quot; and He has been found by those who &quot;sought Him not.&quot; They simply heard the good news and believed! May we praise His matchless grace! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Note verse 21.

God&rsquo;s purpose and plan will be accomplished without fail: &quot;My counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it&quot; (Isaiah 46:10-11). <br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We must, however, be careful to distinguish between what God purposes to accomplish directly by His own actions and what God permits His creatures to do, both of which will ultimately bring glory to His holy Name. Examples of God purposing to accomplish something directly by Himself would be creating the world, sending the Genesis Flood, bringing judgment upon Babel and Sodom, causing the miracle of the virgin birth, etc. Man has nothing to do with these things. God&rsquo;s direct will and activity brings them about. The sovereign God also accomplishes His overall purpose of bringing glory to Himself by allowing His creatures to perform in certain ways, even ways that are contrary to His revealed will. His creatures are allowed to act in ways that are contrary to the desire and wish of the Creator. This we call sin, and God is not the Author of sin. God, for example, did not want or wish Adam to eat of the forbidden fruit as indicated in His command to the contrary (Gen. 2:16-17), but God allowed Adam to partake of the fruit and this terrible sin and momentous fall was part of God&rsquo;s overall plan whereby He would ultimately bring glory to Himself by revealing the riches of His grace and the depths of His mercy. <br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Extreme Calvinists seem to have difficulty in understanding how a sovereign God can &quot;desire&quot; something that will never come to pass. They believe that whatever God wills and desires must come to pass. If God desires to save certain men then these men must be saved. If God so loved the world, then the world must be saved (the &quot;world&quot; referring to the world of God&rsquo;s elect). If Christ died for all men, then all men must be saved. This is how they would reason. Of course, they believe that Christ did not die for all men but that He died only for the elect. They believe that all who Christ died for will be saved (but they say He only died for some and not for all). <br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">In 1 Timothy 2:4 we learn of God&rsquo;s compassionate desire for the salvation of all men. One Calvinistic writer made the following comment in light of 1 Timothy 2:4&mdash;&quot;What God </span><span class="csE5F3F462">desires</span><span class="csA7555675"> that He will do&quot; (thus he believes that the phrase &quot;all men&quot; in this verse refers only to the elect). They feel that if God wants men to repent, then they will repent (God will work in their hearts and bring about repentance). They reason that if God wants men to believe, then they will believe. The logic of this implies that God does not want the majority of men to believe, and hence, does not want these people to be saved, 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9 to the contrary.<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Extreme Calvinists have difficulty understanding how God could love someone and not save that person. For example, the Scripture says that Christ loved the rich young ruler (Mark 10:21), a man who &quot;went away&quot; and as far as we can tell never followed Christ. A.W. Pink did not believe that Christ could love a man who would never be saved. He said, &quot;We fully believe that he (the rich young ruler) was one of God&rsquo;s elect, and was saved sometime after his interview with the Lord&quot; [</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">The Sovereignty of God</span><span class="csA7555675">, p. 125, footnote]. This is Pink&rsquo;s theory, but the Scripture provides no support for this view. It is a view based on Pink&rsquo;s theology, not based on Pink&rsquo;s Bible.<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Every honest believer knows that what God desires is not always fulfilled. In 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 we learn what God desires for every believer. His revealed will (&quot;this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you&quot;) is that believers rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing and give thanks in everything; yet how many times do we fail to fulfill God&rsquo;s will in these areas?<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">If God is willing, then the extreme Calvinist believes that man must be willing also, because God will make him so. If man is unwilling, then it must be because God was unwilling to make the person willing. The Scripture, however, teaches that even though God is willing and desirous that men should turn from sin and go in His direction,</span><span class="csE5F3F462"> He often allows men to have their own way and go their own way according to the stubbornness of their own sin-hardened hearts</span><span class="csA7555675">. God was willing, but they were not. God would, but they would not.<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Thus our purpose in this study is to examine certain key words (especially in the Old Testament) which demonstrate that God&rsquo;s compassion and desire and invitation does indeed reach out to all men, even to those who refuse to repent and believe and come to Him. We shall see the wonderful willingness of God in sharp contrast to the stubborn unwillingness of man. We will gain a better appreciation for our Lord&rsquo;s words in Matthew 23:37 which cannot be fully understood apart from certain Old Testament passages which we shall study. May the Lord open our eyes to these truths. <br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The Hebrew Verb </span><span class="csC57700C4">‛abah</span><span class="csA7555675"> [Strong&rsquo;s #14]</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This verb means &ldquo;</span><span class="csC57700C4">to be willing</span><span class="csA7555675">, to consent, to desire, to wish.&rdquo; It is an interesting verb because it is always used with a negative particle except for two places (Isa. 1:19 and Job 39:9). With the negative it means &ldquo;to be unwilling, to refuse.&rdquo; For example, in Exodus 10:27 it is used of Pharaoh&rsquo;s stubborn refusal to let the children of Israel go (&ldquo;he would not,&rdquo; he refused!). This word is also illustrated in 2 Samuel 23:16 where David refused to drink the water (&ldquo;he would not&rdquo;) even though he was terribly thirsty. This word is also used in Isaiah 42:24 (Israel&rsquo;s refusal to walk in God&rsquo;s ways) and in Ezekiel 3:7 (used twice) and 20:8 (Israel&rsquo;s refusal to listen to God). The following passages which contain this verb especially relate to our study: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1) Psalm 81:11&mdash;&ldquo;But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel </span><span class="cs79659084">would have none</span><span class="csA7555675"> of me.&rdquo; God wanted them to open their mouth wide (v.10). God wanted to bless them and fill them (v.10). God earnestly desired that they should hearken unto Him and walk in His ways. How could God&rsquo;s willingness and desire be stated any clearer than in verse 13? &ldquo;Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!&rdquo; (Psalm 81:13). God was willing! God would have done so much for them (verses 14-16), but they would not. They refused! God had a heart for them; they had no heart for God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2) Proverbs 1:25,30&mdash;&ldquo;But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and </span><span class="cs79659084">would have none</span><span class="csA7555675"> of my reproof . . .

God wanted them to live and be blessed by loving Him and keeping His commandments (v.16). God, through Moses, warns them about making the wrong choice (verses 17-18). Finally Moses said, CHOOSE LIFE (v.19). Doubtless Moses was reflecting the desire of the living God that He might be their choice. God was willing for them to have life, but they must choose (compare John 5:40&mdash;God was willing for them to have life, but they must come).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2) Proverbs 1:29&mdash;&ldquo;Because they hated knowledge, and did not </span><span class="cs79659084">choose</span><span class="csA7555675"> the fear of the Lord.&rdquo; God was willing (verses 20-23) but man was not (verses 24-25; 29-30). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">3) Isaiah 65:12&mdash;&ldquo;When I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear, but did evil before mine eyes, and did </span><span class="cs79659084">choose</span><span class="csA7555675"> that in which I delighted not.&rdquo; God was not delighted by their choice. It&rsquo;s obvious that their choice did not please the Lord. It was not God&rsquo;s wish or desire that they should choose in such a way. Notice God&rsquo;s gracious appeal to these people. He &ldquo;called&rdquo; (v.12). He spread out His hands (v.2). He was willing, but they were not. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">4) Isaiah 66:3-4&mdash;&ldquo;Yea, they have </span><span class="cs79659084">chosen</span><span class="csA7555675"> their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations . . . when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear; but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.&rdquo; God allowed these people to go their own sinful ways. The people made a choice and the people were delighted in the choice that they made! God, however, was not delighted in their choice. He was grieved. God wanted the people to choose His ways not their own ways. Their choice was contrary to God&rsquo;s desire. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Hebrew Verbs Meaning &ldquo;To Stretch Out the Hands&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">God&rsquo;s willingness is seen by the way He earnestly and urgently calls to His people and pleads with them and entreats them. How can the Bible writers describe this divine entreaty in terms that we can understand? One of the ways is by picturing God as stretching forth His hands as He invites and urges His people to come unto Himself. In Proverbs 1:24 the verb </span><span class="csC57700C4">natah</span><span class="csA7555675"> [Strong&rsquo;s #5186] means &ldquo;to stretch or extend the hand.&rdquo; In Isaiah 65:2 the verb </span><span class="csC57700C4">paras</span><span class="csA7555675"> [Strong&rsquo;s #6566] is used with a similar meaning (&ldquo;to spread out or extend the hands&rdquo;). Consider the following passages: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1) Proverbs 1:24&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Because I have called, and ye refused; I have </span><span class="cs79659084">stretched out my hand</span><span class="csA7555675">, and no man regarded.&rdquo; Here we have wisdom making her wonderful appeal and invitation which man foolishly rejects. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2) Isaiah 65:2&mdash;&ldquo;I have </span><span class="cs79659084">spread out my hands</span><span class="csA7555675"> all the day unto a rebellious people, that walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts.&rdquo; Notice that God was not pleased in the way that they were walking. God stretched out His hands and wanted to draw them unto Himself, but they wanted to go their own way. And God allowed it to be so! God let them have what they wanted even though it was not what He wanted. This verse is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 10:21 (see below).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">3) Romans 10:21&mdash;&ldquo;But to Israel he saith, All day long I have </span><span class="cs79659084">stretched forth my hands</span><span class="csA7555675"> unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;gainsaying&rdquo; means &ldquo;rebellious, contrary, refusing to have anything to do with God.&rdquo; What words could better express God&rsquo;s tender invitation to sinful men as He extends wide His arms. As Hodge remarks, &ldquo;God has extended wide His arms, and urged men frequently and long to return to His love.&rdquo; What yearning, what love, what pleading, what patience! As Barnes has said, &ldquo;This denotes an attitude of entreaty; a willingness and earnest desire to receive them to favour, to invite and entreat.&rdquo; &ldquo;The arms outstretched all the day long are the symbol of that incessant pleading love which Israel through all its history has consistently despised&rdquo; (</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Expositor&rsquo;s Greek New Testament</span><span class="csA7555675">). God was so willing; man was so rebellious! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The New Testament Verb </span><span class="csC57700C4">thelo </span><span class="csA7555675">[Strong&rsquo;s #2309]</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This common verb means &ldquo;to wish, desire, be willing, take delight, have pleasure.&rdquo; In the Septuagint it is used frequently and often it corresponds to some of the Hebrew verbs we have already studied. For example, it occurs in Isaiah 1:19-20; Isaiah 28:12; Jeremiah 5:3; 8:5; Ezekiel 3:7; 18:23,32. Let us now consider a few New Testament examples of the usage of this word: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1) Matthew 23:37&mdash;&ldquo;Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them who are sent unto thee, how often </span><span class="cs79659084">would I</span><span class="csA7555675"> have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chicken under her wings, and </span><span class="cs79659084">ye would not</span><span class="csA7555675">.&rdquo; The verb is used twice in this verse. Jesus was saying: &ldquo;I would . . . ye would not.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was willing . . . you were not willing!&rdquo; God was willing to gather these murderers unto Himself but they were not willing! God wanted to gather them, but they did not want to be gathered! God&rsquo;s willingness and man&rsquo;s stubborn refusal are so clearly expressed in this passage! We will say more about this verse later. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2) Luke 13:34&mdash;parallel to Matthew 23:37. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">3) John 5:40&mdash;&ldquo;And </span><span class="cs79659084">ye will not</span><span class="csA7555675"> come to Me, that ye might have life.&rdquo; A literal translation: &ldquo;And ye do not desire to come to Me, that ye might have life.&rdquo; Again we see man&rsquo;s wicked refusal to come to the living God. Why do people not have eternal life? They refuse to come to the One who is LIFE and who desires to give LIFE (John 10:27-28). Is God willing that men should come to Him and have life? Consider the next verse: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">4) 1 Timothy 2:4&mdash;&ldquo;Who </span><span class="cs79659084">will have</span><span class="csA7555675"> (desires) all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; This is God&rsquo;s desire for all men. God is willing (1 Tim. 2:4) but man is unwilling (John 5:40). God does not desire that any should perish.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs79659084">Note</span><span class="csA7555675">:&nbsp;&nbsp;This verb, </span><span class="csC57700C4">thelo </span><span class="csA7555675">[Strong&rsquo;s #2309], in its noun form, is often used in relationship to God&rsquo;s will for the believer (1 Thess. 4:3; 5:18; Eph. 5:17-18; etc.). God&rsquo;s will and desire for every believer is that we should be holy, constantly filled with the Spirit and constantly filled with thanksgiving, etc. Yet often we fall short of these things and our God is grieved. God is willing to fill us with Himself, but often we hinder and quench His working in our lives even though He is willing to do so much in and through us (compare Psalm 81:10). So even when it comes to practical sanctification, God is willing but His believers are unwilling at times.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The Hebrew Verb </span><span class="csC57700C4">chaphets</span><span class="csA7555675"> [Strong&rsquo;s #2654]</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This verb means &ldquo;to delight in, take pleasure in.&rdquo; Here are some of the places it is used:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1) Isaiah 65:12&mdash;&ldquo;When I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear, but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that in which I </span><span class="cs79659084">delighted not</span><span class="csA7555675">.&rdquo; God was not pleased by their choice.

God is delighted and pleased when the wicked turn from their wicked ways. God&rsquo;s will and wish for every wicked person is this: Turn from your evil ways and live! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">4) Ezekiel 18:32&mdash;&ldquo;For I have no </span><span class="cs79659084">pleasure</span><span class="csA7555675"> in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD; wherefore, turn yourselves, and live.&rdquo; In this verse God answers the question raised in verse 23. God is not willing that sinners should continue in their sin. God is willing that they should turn in the direction of the living God. Question for the extreme Calvinists: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">If God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, then why do the wicked die? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">5) Ezekiel 33:11&mdash;&ldquo;Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no </span><span class="cs79659084">pleasure</span><span class="csA7555675"> in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?&rdquo; Nothing could be more clear. God desires that the wicked should turn from their evil ways.

This is the point at which we are given our ticket to Heaven. How we behave after that is important but not critical.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">ROMANS 10:9,10</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. (Romans 10:9,10)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The above passage, isolated from its context, gives us a simple formula for salvation. We confess that Jesus is Lord; we believe God raised Him from the dead; and we are saved. We then defined &quot;saved&quot; as &quot;go to Heaven when we die.&quot; We could conclude that no matter how we behave after taking this step of confession and belief, we will go to Heaven when we die.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The problem here, is, these two verses were not meant to be a formula for salvation Rather, they are part of an epistle titled &quot;The Book of Romans.&quot; By all the laws of biblical interpretation, we must interpret a passage in terms of the entire context. We must attempt to get the sense of the author.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Given Paul&rsquo;s comments in Chapter Six through Eight, one could never be satisfied with interpreting Romans 10:9,10 to mean all there is to being saved is to confess that Jesus is Lord and believe God raised Him from the dead. One has to consider the preceding passages if he is to get the sense of these two verses.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Before we examine the statements in the verses that precede Romans 10:9,10, let us explain what we mean by saying prior chapters in Romans prevent the current use of the two verses as a ticket to Heaven.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Consider the following.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, (Romans 8:13)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">If we, as a Christian, obey the lusts of our sinful nature, we will die spiritually. We will lose the resurrection life mentioned in Romans 8:11. Now, here is the question. Let us say a person confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believes in his heart that God raised Him from the dead. Then the individual continues to follow the compulsions of his sinful nature. Will he or won&rsquo;t he die spiritually?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Because the current teaching insists he will not die spiritually in that Romans 10:9,10 says he will be saved, the Christian churches of today are in a deplorable moral condition.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Now stop and think. If Romans 10:9,10 is Divinely inspired, why wouldn&rsquo;t Romans 8:13, two chapters earlier, also be Divinely inspired?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Are they contradictory? Of course not. Romans 8:13 is absolutely true; so is Romans 10:9,10. Does one supplant the other? Not at all!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We might think of Romans 10:9,10 as being the entrance to the path of salvation. The only entrance into the Divine plan of redemption is the confession of Jesus as Lord and the belief that God has raised Him from the dead. Because God raised Jesus from the dead we are confident that Jesus is able to save us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Now we have gone through the correct door, the door that leads to salvation. It is what comes after this that presents the problem.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">By using Romans 10:9,10 as a ticket to Heaven, we are saying the entrance to salvation is the entire program of redemption. It is not. It is merely the entrance. Most of the New Testament is written about what we are to do after we go through the entrance.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">One would think this would be obvious. It is not obvious at all! Most Christian people, as far as I can tell, are not aware what they do after their initial confession has genuine significance. May I say that as important as the initial step is, if the subsequent steps are not taken, the initial step will avail us nothing. We have died in the wilderness, so to speak.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Today we are placing far too much emphasis on the initial step of salvation. In the Pentecostal movement we say that the next step after salvation is the baptism with the Holy Spirit. In actuality, the baptism with the Holy Spirit is part of initial salvation. We should believe, repent, be baptized in water, receive the Holy Spirit with speaking in tongues, be healed if we need healing, and go on our way rejoicing that we have taken the beginning step of salvation.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">But the salvation we have just entered must be worked out patiently and in the fear of the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Have we been saved at this point? Yes, and no. Actually, we are not finally saved until we endure to the end. &quot;He who endures to the end shall be saved.&quot; Isn&rsquo;t this what Jesus, who is God in the flesh, informed us? Yet some today are challenging the statement made by the Lord Jesus, saying we do not need to endure to the end because we are saved by a sovereign grace. Thus they make God a liar! Sorry to be so blunt, but it is time we return to the Bible and believe what it states. Do you agree?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">For myself, I would tremble to disagree with what Jesus said. Wouldn&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The problem lies in our definition of salvation, as I have written so many times in the past. Salvation has little to do with going to Heaven. Salvation is not a change in where we are but in what we are. Salvation moves us from Satan to God, not from earth to Heaven.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">All of us are on a continuum of salvation. Probably most of us are not entirely in Satan or entirely in God. Each day, if we are following the Holy Spirit, we are moving from Satan to God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:9,10 is the entrance to the continuum.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Can I be saved yesterday or tomorrow? Not really. Salvation is today. Right now you either are moving forward in the program of salvation, or the powers of darkness are moving you back toward Satan. The prevailing spiritual pressures do not permit us to stand still.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Remember, Ezekiel told us if a righteous person starts behaving wickedly, his righteousness will not be remembered. Conversely, if a wicked person starts behaving righteously, his wickedness will not be remembered.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Do you know what the above means? It means salvation operates only in the present. It is what you are doing now that is of interest to both God and Satan.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">I know the unscriptural philosophy of Dispensationalism maintains that such Old Testament do not apply to Christians. But they do! The words of the Prophets are still true. They still are the Words of God. They will remain true when the present earth and sky flee from the face of Jesus Christ. That&rsquo;s what Jesus said, and He is the Word of God, isn&rsquo;t He?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">So there is no such thing as a ticket to Heaven. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. What there is, is a program of redemption that saves us from the bondages of Satan and brings us into the image of Christ and into untroubled rest in the Center of the Person of God and His will. How utterly marvelous!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">When we tell people that Romans 10:9,10 is all there is in the plan of salvation we are shortchanging them to an incredible extent. We are dooming them to an eternal babyhood.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Now let&rsquo;s see if we can grasp the mind of the Apostle as he wrote Romans 10:9,10.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Brothers, my heart&rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. (Romans 10:1)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We see right away that Paul is concerned about the salvation of the Jews. In both Romans and Galatians we notice that Paul is attempting to convince Jewish people that they no longer are under the Law of Moses. It is this emphasis, this argument, that reveals the meaning of Romans 10:9,10.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. (Romans 10:2)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Paul is seeking to bring knowledge to zealous people, people who were seeking to honor Moses and the law. They hoped to obtain righteousness by observing the Law of Moses and the accompanying traditions. Remember, this is what was in Paul&rsquo;s mind when he wrote Romans 10:9,10. To remove the two verses from this context and apply them to Gentiles who are seeking a ticket to eternal residence in Heaven is quite inappropriate.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God&rsquo;s righteousness. Romans 10:3)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We would be in a much better position to understand the Apostle Paul if we had been taught from childhood that God wants us to keep all the statutes found in the Law of Moses. Righteousness is obtained by obeying the Law. This conviction was deeply ingrained in Paul&rsquo;s readers in Rome. Try to put yourself in their frame of mind.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The issue is, can we obtain righteousness if we let go of Moses? Do we dare just believe God will esteem us as righteous if we are not observing the Law? Is there actually another source of righteousness of which we have been ignorant, while we desperately endeavor to keep all aspect of the Law?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Christ is the end of the law so there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. (Romans 10:4)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">I don&rsquo;t think the idea here is only that faith in Christ takes the place of the Law, although that is true. Also the Book of Hebrews tells us that the old covenant is passing away.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">I believe it is true rather that Christ is the fulfillment of the Law. All of the Law is fulfilled in Christ so when we follow the Spirit of God we receive the righteousness that would have been ours had we kept the Law perfectly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">So it is not a case that the Law is imperfect; rather it is true that we cannot receive the righteousness of the Law except through Christ. And, I might add, not merely by believing in Christ or identifying with Christ but by receiving Christ into ourselves so He becomes our Life and directs our behavior.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Paul told us the Law is as a slave who bring us to the school where Christ teaches us. So the Law is good, but we can keep it only through Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: &quot;The man who does these things will live by them.&quot; (Romans 10:5)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The Law provides commandments which a person could observe and thus obtain righteousness. But the Law did not fulfill God&rsquo;s desires for a righteous people, because our sinful nature causes us to disobey the Law&mdash;even when we desire to keep all of its parts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">However, I think it is important to note that the eleventh chapter of the Book of Hebrews, which is a record of people who lived under prior covenants, is our best definition of &quot;the righteous shall live by faith.&quot; No one has ever pleased God except by faith. There were times, as described in the Old Testament, when God did not accept the offerings of the Israelites because they were not presented in faith, only as a dead ritual.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">But the righteousness that is by faith says: &quot;Do not say in your heart, &lsquo;Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo;&quot; (that is, to bring Christ down)&quot; or &lsquo;Who will descend into the deep?&rsquo;&quot; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? &quot;The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,&quot; that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: (Romans 10:6-8)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The above three verses really get at the root of faith, don&rsquo;t they. We don&rsquo;t have to ascend into Heaven to obtain righteousness. We don&rsquo;t have to descend into the deep to obtain righteousness. The righteousness we want is right there in our mouth and in our heart, as we speak and believe the word of faith.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The righteousness that Paul longed for; the righteousness the Jews longed for; was right there in their mouth and in their heart.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. (Romans 10:9,10)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Now we can see what the passage means. It is not a formula that Gentiles can accept so we can go to Heaven; it is Paul&rsquo;s instruction addressed to Jews who were attempting to gain righteousness through the works of the Law.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Paul is not emphasizing that all you have to do to be saved is to make the correct confession and believe the correct belief. Rather, Paul is moving the Jews away from seeking righteousness by the Law toward placing their faith in Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">In fact, the two verses are not really suited to Gentiles. The Jew would understand confessing Christ as Lord and believing in His resurrection was not an excuse to behave unrighteously. We Gentiles do not understand this. We think Romans 10:9,10 is just that&mdash;an excuse to live unrighteously and yet be accepted into Heaven when we die. We do not love the truth; therefore God Himself has deceived us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Why has God deceived us? Because we should know better than to believe we have found a way to please God without repenting and living righteously. We are attempting to make God a partner in our evil ways.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The remainder of the Book of Romans proves beyond doubt that Romans 10:9,10 is not an alternative to righteous behavior.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">As the Scripture says, &quot;Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.&quot; For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile&mdash;the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, (Romans 10:11,12)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">God blesses everyone who calls on Him. Those who trust in Jesus Christ will never be put to shame. This statement might be difficult for the Jews in Rome to swallow. Paul is telling them that the playing field has been leveled. There is only one path to righteousness, and it is through the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the same for the Jew and the Gentile.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">For, &quot;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&quot; (Romans 10:13)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Here is another aspect of this &quot;ticket&quot; problem. We don&rsquo;t confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, on only one occasion. We keep confessing the Lordship of Christ every moment of every day in our thoughts, in our words, and in our behavior.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We don&rsquo;t believe in our heart that God has raised Him from the dead, on only one occasion. We keep believing in our heart that God has raised Christ from the dead, every moment of every day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We don&rsquo;t call on the name of the Lord only one time. We call on the name of the Lord at all times in all that we do. This is what it means to live by faith.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Denominations are identified by their Statements of Faith. Such theological facts may have their use, but they tend to be counterproductive. They leave people with the idea they can assent to correct doctrine and then their eternal residence in Heaven is assured. This is not faith, it is nothing more than a dead mental assent to facts&mdash;facts that the demons know only too well.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">When we really know the Lord and love the Lord, we know how entirely inappropriate it is to present Romans 10:9,10 as a formula that saves us once it is adopted. We understand Paul was reasoning with the Jews concerning their zeal for the Law of Moses, not giving us an alternative to enduring to the end.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We soon learn, as we follow the Lord each day, that the program of redemption operates as each smallest area of our personality is brought to our attention by the Holy Spirit so we can turn away from our sinful nature and receive the Virtue and Substance of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">To be fully saved is, as I have stated, to be formed in the image of Christ and to be dwelling in untroubled rest in God&rsquo;s Person and will. Anything short of this must be viewed as our coming short of the rest of God. It does not mean we are doomed to Hell, only that there is more ground for us to cover; more enemies to overcome.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The Apostle Paul toward the end of his life, after he had been saved and filled with the Spirit of God for many years, and had had an exceedingly fruitful ministry, claimed that he had not as yet arrived at the mark set before him. The old, experienced saint was pressing on! pressing on! pressing on!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Paul was pressing toward that for which Christ had called him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Until we have attained to that for which Christ has called us, we are to press on! press on! press on! To not do so is to displease the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 10:9,10 is the small gate. Now we are to be pressing forward on that pressured way that leads to eternal life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
