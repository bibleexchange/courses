The nation had recently plunged into a violent war of <br/>independence against Asbury&#39;s native land of England. The American <br/>frontier was also ablaze with war between the colonist and Native <br/>Americans tribes. <br/>Asbury was not greeted upon his arrival by a limo. He had to purchase a <br/>horse on which he traveled 6,000 miles a year for over 40 years. His financial <br/>reward was $60 a year, much of which he gave away or sent back to England <br/>to help his parents. He wore hand-me-downs not tailor made suits. </span></p><p class="cs72BECA7B"><span class="cs65085821">He had no retirement, no insurance, no dental plan, and no 401 k. He set no fee <br/>for his ministry. <br/><br/>What he did receive, he often gave away. He traveled on &quot;roads&quot; on which <br/>his horse sank many times knee-deep in mud. If a road did not exist, he <br/>would lead his horse over the steep, rocky inclines of the Appalachians <br/>to reach a pioneer community. Many times, his feet and legs were bloodied <br/>and bruised by the horrific journey. When he came to a river where there <br/>was no bridge or ferry, he would swim his horse across. Numerous times, <br/>he was nearly drowned by an angry, swollen stream. His &quot;hotel&quot; on many <br/>occasions was on a dirt floor in an overcrowded, rat-infested frontier <br/>cabin. Often times he slept in the woods, on a mountain ledge or in damp <br/>cave. Many days he would travel over 60 miles with nothing to eat. </span></p><p class="cs72BECA7B"><span class="cs65085821">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs72BECA7B"><span class="cs65085821">The paths and roads he traveled were full of dangers from murderers, thieves, <br/>wolves, bears, poisonous snakes and roaming bands of Native Americans with <br/>whom the frontiersmen were at war. If he met someone who needed a cloak, <br/>food or money, he would take what he had and give it to the person in <br/>need. Asbury sought out the forgotten, hidden places of early America. He traveled from New England, to the Midwest, and to the Deep South <br/>spreading the Gospel of Christ. When he would meet a person who was ill, <br/>he would minister to their physical needs with the last medication he had. <br/>He demanded nothing of others in order to come into a community. The <br/>demands he made were on himself. Frequently, his body would be racked <br/>with pain, illness, fever, hunger and weakness. His physical being would <br/>cry out for rest and nourishment. </span></p><p class="cs72BECA7B"><span class="cs65085821">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs72BECA7B"><span class="cs65085821">However, his spirit ruled his body. When truly unable to travel, he would mount his horse and ride for 8 hours or more through blinding snowstorms, torrential rain or in oppressive heat. <br/><br/>He had been invited to Baltimore. In 1816 he was traveling by buggy <br/>through Virginia headed to the annual conference in Baltimore. However, <br/>he was dying. His last sermon was preached in Richmond. He had to be <br/>carried into the meeting room. He commented, &quot;I am too weak t o walk but <br/>not to preach.&rdquo; They sat him on a small table and he ministered the Word <br/>for the last time. He made it as far as Spotsylvania twenty miles north of <br/>Richmond. He body was rapidly failing. </span></p><p class="cs72BECA7B"><span class="cs65085821">He stopped at a friend&#39;s house on Saturday. Shortly before he left this world he was asked, &quot;Do you feel Jesus precious?&quot; Summoning his last remaining strength, the great circuit rider raised both hands in victory. Minutes later he laid his head on a friend&#39;s hand and gently slipped away to be with the Lord. He owned no mansion, no land, and no bank account. His net worth was what he wore on his body. He was buried in a borrowed grave plot. <br/>When Asbury came to America, there were few believers and preachers. At the end of his ministry, there were over 240,000 believers and almost 8,000 ministers. He affected lives of thousands upon thousands. He changed the very course of American history. Among his converts were poor farmers, merchants, Governors of several states, frontiersmen, slaves, NativeAmericans, State Supreme Court Justices, <br/>attorneys, physicians, housewives, children, youth and people from all walks of life. </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB361EC22"><span class="cs65085821">He gave all he had. </span></li><li class="csB361EC22"><span class="cs65085821">He sought nothing for himself. </span></li><li class="cs94C9AEAD"><span class="cs65085821">His passion was to bring salvation and the Light of the Gospel to those in <br/>darkness of sin. He loved a nation and made it his own even though he was not her native son.</span></li></ul>
