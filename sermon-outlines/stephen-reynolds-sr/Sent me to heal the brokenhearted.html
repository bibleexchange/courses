Note the word &quot;wondered&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">ethaumazon</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=W\#4399: Wondered; Wondering"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;4399</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">). It means they began to marvel and to be astonished at the gracious words flowing from His mouth. They were taking </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">pride</span><span class="csC05134DD"> in one of their own neighbor&#39;s being so capable.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they began to question. This was a quick reaction, a quick change. Sitting there listening, the questions began to arise in their thoughts: &quot;Is this not Joseph&#39;s son?&quot; Matthew is even more descriptive. The people were sitting there, glancing around, asking in their minds, &quot;Is not this...His mother...His brethren...His sisters, are they not all with us?&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+13%3A55-56"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Matthew 13:55-56</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). &quot;And they were offended in Him&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+13%3A57"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Matthew 13:57</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). The word &quot;offended&quot; means they stumbled over Him. They could not imagine that someone from their own town&mdash;someone whom they had known since a child&mdash;could be the Messiah, the Son of God.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, they demanded proof, insisted that He had to heal, that is, prove Himself by working miracles in their midst. Remember, all this was still thoughts in their minds. They were still sitting there and listening to Him, but their thoughts were </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">stumbling</span><span class="csC05134DD"> over His claim to be the Messiah. Jesus knew their thoughts, so He stopped His message and directed a statement to them: &quot;You are thinking, saying to me, Physician, heal, prove yourself. Prove yourself by doing the miracles you did in Capernaum.&quot;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">The point is this: the response of the people to Jesus&#39; claim deteriorated from being </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">impressed</span><span class="csC05134DD"> to being </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">offended</span><span class="csC05134DD"> to </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">demanding proof</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Many are impressed with Jesus Christ at first, but when they are presented with His claims and the cross, they become offended and demand proof. His claim to be the Incarnate God in human flesh&mdash;to be the virgin-born Son of God&mdash;who must die for man&#39;s sin by being crucified upon a vulgar cross, is offensive to some. Many refuse to accept such phenomenal claims and vulgar scenes. They want a religion of grand images, beautiful pictures, and soft words.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Joh 2:5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Heb 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</span></p></body>
