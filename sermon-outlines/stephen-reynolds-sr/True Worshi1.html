If we say that we believe in Jesus, we must prove it by abiding in believing Jesus as Saviour and by still further believing Him as Lord. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Word of Jesus must be the object of our faith; into that Word we must enter and the Word must enter us and in that Word we must continue. Beginning to believe is nothing unless we continue to believe and obey Him as Lord of all our life.</span></p><p class="csABFFAF69"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">I. These believers were not all of one kind</span><span class="csC05134DD">; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;The LORD HAD DIFFERENT KINDS OF BELIEVERS AROUND HIM. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">There were two sorts of believers distinguished in the Word.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">	8:30&mdash;&ldquo;many believed on him&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8:31 Then said Jesus </span><span class="csD04A7434">to those Jews </span><span class="cs87110596">which believed on him</span><span class="csC05134DD">, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is a singular expression also, &quot;</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Those Jews</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> which believed on him.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;They were Jews still in connection to their traditional belief. &mdash;Jews first of all, whatever they might be in connection with their Judaism. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The omission of the word &quot;on&quot; or &quot;in&quot; would be exactly accurate; and it helps to bring out an important distinction, while it also accounts for what seems so strange, that those who had believed him, immediately after, charge him with being a Samaritan and having a devil, and should even take up stones to stone him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The same sun that hardens the clay softens the wax. This discourse, which proved the savour of death unto death to the obstinate Pharisees, became the savour of life unto life to many of the simple-hearted people. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A lot of people say that they believe and have not faith.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is it to believe on Christ?</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;It means not only to accept what he says as true, and to believe that he is the Messiah and the Son of God, but trustfully rest in him as Lord and Saviour. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To believe on him is to call on Him as our Saviour, upon whom we depend for salvation. When we believe in him or on him, we accept him as God our Saviour; and we trust on him to do for us what God has appointed him to do. Fully Trusting on Jesus is saving faith.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">believe on his name</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">To believe him</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> may be a very different thing from believing on him. Such belief may fall far short of saving faith. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">To believe </span><span class="csA657E9A2">on</span><span class="csE2DF19C1"> him</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> means heartily to give yourself up to him, and to follow him as the way, the truth, and the life. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">To believe on him</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is also to obey implicitly. We believe all that he may say. We accept not only what he says which we can fully understand, but that which is dark to us. We so believe in him that we believe in all his teachings. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus is Saviour for every sinner and Lord for every believer.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We not only go as far as he has revealed himself to us, but we are prepared to go as far as he pleases. What he says is truth to us, on the sole evidence that he says it. We believe in Jesus, not because we have understanding but because he says it.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This woman came from unbelief, sin, adultery and selfish carnal living for she was in the act of sin and with no intentions of her own to be with Jesus in the temple to hear and obey His Word.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">But there is </span><span class="csA657E9A2">another kind of belief</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &nbsp;natural reasoning which was not produced by the Saviour&#39;s Word but while He spoke, a false hope arose. There is a temporary belief which believes Jesus in a sense, and after its own way of understanding him, or rather of misunderstanding him. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Natural reasoning believes about him; believes that he was undoubtedly sent of God; that he was a great prophet; that what he says is, to a high degree, reasonable and right, but does not fully trust Him as Lord.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Natural reasoning believes of what he has said; but not prepared to believe or accept everything that he may say. This natural reasoning believes everything that instructs itself by its own judgment: it does not, in fact, believe in Jesus as Saviour and Lord, but believes in itself, and believes him so far as the Lord agrees with their opinions. This belief is not prepared to obey Christ, and accept him as </span><span class="csA657E9A2">Master and Lord</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This was the kind of belief these Jews possessed: it was a belief which was so crowded with prejudice that before long it smothered them. They might accept Jesus as the Messiah, but then he must be the kind of Messiah they had always pictured in their minds&mdash;a leader who would defeat the Romans, who would deliver Palestine from the foreign yoke, rebuild the temple, and glorify the Jewish race. They half hoped that he might turn out to be a great leader for their own purposes; but they did not believe in him as he revealed himself as the </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

We are encouraged by certain persons to include in our churches all that have any sort of belief; and, indeed, the line is to be more inclusive still, for these who have no belief at all are to find an open door. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Only those who enter by the door of regeneration and spiritual faith will be within the kingdom of the Lord. They must be baptized in the Holy Ghost to be a part of the body of Christ.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Don&rsquo;t think some strange thing has happened unto us as a church when the baser sort are found among us, like Judas, Ananias, Demas. &nbsp;A notable believer Simon Magus, believed because he saw the signs and wonders wrought by the apostles; but as he also sought to make gain of godliness, he remained in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity, and never became &quot;a disciple indeed.&quot; There is one even the devil. We read that &quot;the devils believe and tremble.&quot; </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They hold on to belief, and feel something of the power of it, for they tremble. Devils know that Jesus is the Christ of God; for they have confessed it, and have borne witness to the gospel in the open streets, crying after the preachers of the Word; and yet with all their knowledge, and their sort of belief, and with an apprehension which leads to trembling, they remain devils still, and can&rsquo;t make any advance towards God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Beware of that belief which is a mere intellectual movement, which does not control the heart and the life. Synagogue worship was a source of pride to the Jews, it was exceedingly mortifying to those Jews who obstinately remained in unbelief as they saw many believe on Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To come to faith through a cold argument, and to feel no spiritual life, is but poor religion</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You want faith that leads you to an entire reliance upon the person of Jesus, to the giving up of everything to him, to the reception of him as your Saviour and King your all in all.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;You have not believed unto eternal life unless you have so believed on him that you make him the foundation and corner-stone of your life. You must believe in him for taking away sin. God has set him forth to be the propitiation for sin, and you must believe on him in total capacity.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We never preach the saving power as temporary, unpractical, unsanctifying belief. If a man says, &quot;I believe in Christ and therefore I shall be saved, his faith will have to be tested by the light of life.. The faith of God&#39;s elect is an abiding faith; it is precious faith. Now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">True Worship is through faith among abiding in the word, undying, unquenchable love for the Lord. If you truly believe in Jesus, it is for life. Saving faith is to be a life-long act. &ldquo;continue in My Word&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csC05134DD">III. The LORD SETS BEFORE THEM TO CONTINUE IN HIS WORD. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John 8:31 &para; Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csC05134DD">A.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span><span class="csD04A7434">Discipleship</span><span class="csC05134DD"> is obedience to the Word in True Worship </span><span class="csD04A7434">:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;Then are ye my disciples indeed.&quot; That is to say, if they persevered in obeying his Word, they would be disciples, not in name only, but in truth.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;It is a small thing to be called Christians; but it is a great matter truly to be Christians. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Further, they would not be merely superficial learners, but deeply taught, and inwardly instructed disciples of Jesus. They would really and truly know what Jesus taught, and would receive it into their inmost souls: they are a disciple indeed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When a man loves the Lord, and treasures his words; he puts his discipleship of Christ before everything, and you cannot live with him a single day without perceiving a savor of Christ in his words and action. You say of him, &quot;That man is indeed a Christian.&quot; In such a case religion is not exhibited by way of pride, as with the Pharisees of old, but it is seen because it is there, and must shine forth. Faith throbs in the man&#39;s pulse, it looks out from his eyes, it tunes his voice, and lights up his countenance, it rules his house, and controls his business. The man lives for Jesus, and if it were necessary he would die for him. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Highly worship Christ as Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Blessed is he who makes his Master&#39;s service his pleasure; his Lord&#39;s law his delight; his Saviour&#39;s glory his occupation; he is a disciple indeed if he continues in the Word!<br/><img src="True%20Worshi1_files/image1.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />To have the assurance that we are a disciple indeed &nbsp;is a blessing. Some are always asking themselves, &quot;Am I truly a disciple?&quot; He that continues in Christ&#39;s Word in loving obedience, soon ceases to ask that question: he has the witness in himself, he has the witness in Christ. He knows that he is Christ&#39;s disciple, for he continually follows his Master. He not only believes, but he knows that he believes. He has continued in the Word so long that he has no doubt about his being in it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">B.

You may be charged false, but you will not flinch from the assurance that you </span><span class="csC382D2BB">know</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the truth and you continue in the truth.

Free from sin. He that lives in sin is the slave of sin. True belief in the Word of Christ leads to freedom from the power of the evil which dwells in our members, and from the dominating power of the sin which rules in the customs of the world. &quot;The truth shall make you free.&quot; You shall be free from your own prejudices, prides, and lusts. You shall be free from the fear of man. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Jesus is Lord you shall be free from sin. &quot;The truth shall make you free&quot;; this is a noble saying.
