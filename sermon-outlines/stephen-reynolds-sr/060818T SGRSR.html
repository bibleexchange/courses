If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God, then they took away the stone. The Word of God broke up their unbelief and hesitance. Unbelief will choke out the Word you do have. The bad apple will always cause the good to rot. The church has not be challenged to excersise their faith. They pray that someday Good will pour out and show His glory, but for them to actually wait on God and believe God to do something at THIS TIME. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Isaiah 32 The hosts of heaven in position and under His control and direction and authority.
