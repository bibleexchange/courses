		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">In part one of this study, we looked at some introductory scriptures which detail the fact that we shall all stand before the Lord Jesus to have our life as a Christian examined. We saw the need that we have to live our life with an eternal perspective. This study will carry on from there and will look at what exactly we are rewarded for, what God&rsquo;s standard of measurement is, and whether we can lose our rewards. It will close with an Old Testament example from the life of David. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">There used to be a bumper sticker that said &lsquo;Look busy, Jesus is coming!&rsquo; This sticker is obviously humorous (and it makes me laugh!) but I don&rsquo;t think anyone is going to be able to trick the Lord so easily! Our whole life will pass through fire, as we saw in the first study, to see what will last and be rewarded for eternity. So an obvious question you may be asking is &lsquo;Well, what gets rewarded then?&rsquo; Good question. Let&rsquo;s go back to 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and see what it says&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs9BB05DD8">1 Cor 3:5-8 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe&mdash;as the Lord has assigned to each his task</span><span class="csF8AB1308">. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.</span><span class="cs9BB05DD8"> So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. </span><span class="csF8AB1308">The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.</span><span class="cs9BB05DD8"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs9BB05DD8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Straight before discussing the judgement seat of Christ, Paul gives two activities that will be rewarded by God at that time. They are pretty simple&hellip; Planting and watering. Simple enough so that anyone could do them&hellip; in fact, you may be even able to! </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs64D34F3"><span class="csD5D7D290">Planting - We plant or sow seeds through our witness for the Lord Jesus Christ.

God says that the sower of spiritual seed will be rewarded in the age to come. </span></li><li class="cs64D34F3"><span class="csD5D7D290">Watering - What do you think this involves? In the context of this passage, it meant teaching, exhorting and encouraging. Paul had come in first to the Corithians and planted the seed. But it was Apollo&rsquo;s&rsquo; job to follow it up and make sure there was growth by watering the seed. </span></li></ul>

And what&rsquo;s more, in the age to come they will rejoice together! There will be the sower of the seed, the waterier, the gardener, the harvester, and the one harvested in the Kingdom of God&hellip; all rejoicing together. And it will all be worth the effort!</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftn_GoBack2"><span class="csD5D7D290"><sup>[3]</sup></span></a><span class="csD5D7D290"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Five different crowns are also mentioned in the Bible for those that are to be rewarded. Can you name them? Or do you know of any passages that speak of them?

It is always important to remember that God&rsquo;s standard for measuring our lives is not necessarily our own. We look at people in the natural and think &lsquo;wow, hasn&rsquo;t that person succeeded?&rsquo; And yet God says that many who are first (in this life) will be last (in the age to come) and many that are last will be first.

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">While a true believer cannot lose their salvation, they can lose their rewards. A few verses are necessary to point this out. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD007A21A">Rev 3:11 &lsquo;I am coming soon.

Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD007A21A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">From these two verses it is clearly important to make sure that you are not falling into spiritual deception, which will lead to a loss of reward. Also, it is important that our &lsquo;works&rsquo; as a Christian come from a true heart and are not performed to be &lsquo;seen&rsquo; by others. If that is the case then it truly is a &lsquo;performance&rsquo;, an act, and the words of Jesus to the Pharisees would apply to us &ndash; </span><span class="cs43C038A">&lsquo;I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.&rsquo; Matt 6:2 &ndash; &lsquo;their reward&rsquo; being the applause of men!

			<span class="cs31D24DEE">Old Testament Example &ndash; David&rsquo;s Faithful Men.</span></h3>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, there is an awesome example in the Old Testament (like there always is!) which we would do well to follow. The example occurs in the life of King David, and especially relating to David&rsquo;s faithful followers. Here is the abbreviated background &ndash; David has been anointed as King by the prophet Samuel, though he is not yet reigning in his kingdom. Instead, it is Saul, who despite being rejected by God, still reigns temporarily over Israel. While in exile, a small band of misfits rally around David and become his men. Here is where we are introduced to them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs9BB05DD8">1 Sam 22:1-2 David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father&rsquo;s household heard about it, they went down to him there. </span><span class="csF8AB1308">All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8AB1308">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A more raggedy bunch of men you wouldn&rsquo;t find&hellip; distressed, in debt, and discontented with life&hellip; yet they believed in David and where willing to follow him though it meant hardship for them. And David accepted these men and trained them as his own. He knew that if they were willing to side with him in the day of his trouble, then they would make faithful leaders when he reigned and became King of Israel. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy discussion for these men to make however, as King Saul didn&rsquo;t make life very easy for those who aligned themselves with David. At times they had to run for their lives. At times they went hungry and were forced to live in caves as they tried desperately to escape from the clutches of Saul. Yet despite this, they looked forward. They looked forward to the day when David would reign... they looked forward to the day when the difficulties they had encountered for the sake of David would be rewarded. And rewarded they were. You see we read about these &lsquo;misfits&rsquo; again in 1 Chron chapters 11-12 where, after David received his kingdom, all of their deeds are recorded. No loyalty to David was forgotten. No faithfulness to the king went unrewarded. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, I&rsquo;m sure you get the picture, but I&rsquo;ll spell it out anyway. Like David, Jesus has been declared by God to be the true King. But we do not yet see Jesus reigning in His kingdom on this earth. Instead, we know that Satan is currently &lsquo;the god of this world&rsquo; even though, like Saul, he has been rejected and will be overthrown. Now, until this happens, Jesus is gathering to himself those that long for His kingdom &ndash; that raggedy munch of misfits like me (and hopefully you!) who are discontented with what this world has to offer and long for the true King to come into His Kingdom! And on that day, those that have faithfully followed Jesus will be fully rewarded. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">And don&rsquo;t you just wish that would come quickly!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

It is the story of a man called Henry Morrison. Henry had been a faithful missionary in Africa for 40 years. When he finally headed home he found himself on the same boat as the American President, Theodore Roosevelt. As they entered New York harbour, Morrison began to feel quite dejected as he saw the great fanfare that Roosevelt was receiving. &lsquo;Surely I should get some recognition after 40 years in Africa&rsquo;, Morrison thought to himself. It was at this stage that Morrison heard a still small voice say to him &ndash; &lsquo;Henry, you&rsquo;re not home yet!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">You see, there is a &lsquo;fanfare&rsquo; coming for those that are faithful to the Lord.

I recently read the testimony of Charles Spurgeon. Now, that guy was a real legend! It has been estimated that he preached to over 10 million people in his lifetime! What&rsquo;s more, his sermons have been read by an estimated 50 million people in 23 different languages! There is no doubting the fact that he was an enormously gifted individual who also worked hard to be faithful to his calling. I have no doubt that he will be greatly rewarded. But in reading Spurgeon&rsquo;s life story, there was someone else who really impressed me. Someone who didn&rsquo;t have Spurgeon&rsquo;s gifts and abilities, he didn&rsquo;t have the same opportunities&hellip; in fact, no one even knows his name! Yet I think when the rewards are handed out way up yonder, this man will be greatly rewarded... possibly even as much as Spurgeon himself. You see, this man lead Charles Spurgeon to the Lord. A snow storm blew so hard that particular Sunday morning that the minister didn&rsquo;t even make it. In all, about a dozen people turned up at a little Primitive Methodist Chapel and in the end, a very thin looking man went up into the pulpit to preach. The text was &lsquo;Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.&rsquo; He bungled the pronunciation. But Spurgeon recorded the opening &ndash;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs9FF1B611">&ldquo;My dear friends, this is a very simple text indeed. It says &lsquo;Look&rsquo;. Now lookin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t take a deal of pains. It ain&rsquo;t liftin&rsquo; your foot or your finger; it just says look. Well, a man needn&rsquo;t go to college to learn to look. You may be the biggest fool, and yet you can look. A man needn&rsquo;t be worth a thousand a year to be able to look. But then the text says &lsquo;Look unto me&rsquo;. Ay! Many on ye are lookin&rsquo; to yourselves, but it ain&rsquo;t no use lookin&rsquo; there. You&rsquo;ll never find comfort in yourselves. Look to Christ. The text says &lsquo;look unto me&rsquo;. &ldquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs9FF1B611">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs9FF1B611">Now, this man wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;minister&rsquo;... he was believed to be a shoemaker!
