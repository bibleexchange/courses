The task is great and great strenght will be required of the Lord. We must not be at ease always allowing others to bear the burden and do the work.

The joy is to those that know what the fast is all about. That understand the greatness of His love, goodness, and beauty. 8:20,21 I SENSE MY NEED TO SEEK THE LORD. LET US.
