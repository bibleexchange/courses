(God&rsquo;s way of doing things)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is the first thing that one has to do to be able to walk in Divine health. You must be born of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;When you become born again, you must receive this new birth, by faith.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;KJV: Heb 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</span></p><h3 class="cs2C9D4ECD">
					<span class="csCF6BBF71">Hebrews 11:1&nbsp;(Amplified Bible)</span></h3>
				<p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">NOW FAITH is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for, being the proofs of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses].</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Amplified Bible really breaks it down so you can get the meat of the word.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1 Th 5:23&nbsp; And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You are a spirit, you have a soul (mind, will and emotions) and you live in a body. Whenever we are born again it is our spirit that receives that new birth and you become a new creation. The soul (mind will and emotions) is to be renewed by the Word of God. Whenever that new birth occurs, you have entered into the Kingdom of God and His ways of doing things. Divine Health belongs to you and all you have to do is receive it in your spirit by faith. </span></p><h3 class="cs2C9D4ECD">

Jesus took care of that for us; &ldquo;all the promises of God are Yea and Amen in Him&rdquo;. The Bible does not say that Jesus is going to do it, but that He took our sicknesses and diseases on himself when He went to the cross and died for us. It has already happened. It is done. Healing is ours; we are healed, wholeness is ours, and all you have to do is grab hold of that truth by faith and start confessing what the Word of God says with regard to healing and wholeness. Feed your inner man (spirit) on these truths until they become so alive in your spirit that they manifest in your body. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The realm God operates in is not the sense realm, but the unseen realm, which is where faith functions. It does not matter what it looks like in the natural because the Kingdom of God realm walks by faith not by sight.&nbsp; </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2 Cor 5:7&nbsp; (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When a child of God really believes, in their heart, (spirit) and not their mind that they have been made whole, things will begin to happen; changes will begin. The Holy Spirit will guide you in regards to maintaining your healing and walking in Divine health.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Search the Word of God for all scriptures on healing and being made whole. Confess them as it is now. Remember NOW FAITH IS. Here is an example: &ldquo;I thank you Father that by Jesus stripes I was healed (made whole) 2000 years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few days ago a doctor may have said that you had some incurable disease, but you decided not to receive that report, because you knew that the Word of God is greater than any report of sickness. You stepped out in faith and called those things that be not as though they were. Even God the Father called those things that be not as though they were.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">KJV:</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> Rom 4:17&nbsp; (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Amplified: Rom 4:17 17As it is written, I have made you the father of many nations. [He was appointed our father] in the sight of God in Whom he believed, Who gives life to the dead and speaks of the nonexistent things that [He has foretold and promised] as if they [already] existed</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">KJV: </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Rom 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When you confess what the Word says your mind is renewed and you are transformed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Greek word and meaning of transformed is: </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">3339. metamorphoo, met-am-or-fo&#39;-o; from G3326 and G3445; to transform (lit. or fig. &quot;metamorphose&quot;):--change, transfigure, transform.&nbsp; Renewing the mind cause a change to happen. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your soul (mind, will and emotions) are lining up with what the Word says about your healing.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Noah Webster&rsquo;s 1828 dictionary says this about transformed: Changed in form or external appearance; metamorphosed; transmuted; renewed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Praise God for all that He gave us through Jesus. What a wonderful Father we have. He loves us unconditionally.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">KJV: 1 John 4:16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God&rsquo;s word is true, it does not lie. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Isa 55:11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An important thing to remember is that you cannot receive these truths in your mind, because your mind cannot understand them, you must receive them by revelation to your spirit from the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you have been confessing the Word on wholeness and have not seen the manifestation there could be some spiritual forces blocking that wholeness, but it does not change the truth, and that is that you are totally made whole. I am going to list some things that can block the manifestation.</span></p><p class="cs53158294"><span class="cs813FD41"></span><span class="cs116BBDE0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Not walking in God&rsquo;s love, because faith works by love.

We need our body while we are on the earth. The Holy Spirit lives in us. We are the temple of God.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1 Cor 6:19 What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1 Cor 6:20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God&#39;s.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Our bodies are not our own, they were bought with a price and Jesus was that price. Our bodies are the Body of Christ. I believe that this is going to really be a revelation to a lot that read this. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Holy Spirit spoke to me and said that the Body we live in is the greatest asset we have on this earth. We are to glorify God in our body. When we become born again we belong to Jesus and are to go forth as the Body of (Jesus) Christ and preach the good news of the gospel of the Kingdom. The Holy Spirit said that we have been deceived on what the most important thing is. People think that money; things and etc. are the most important thing we can have on earth. That is not true. The most important is taking care of the temple of the Holy Ghost (which is the body we live in) so that we can do the things of the Kingdom, so that we can fulfill our calling and election.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How can the Body of Christ go forth and preach the good news when their bodies are always tired or feeling bad?</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Luke 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Here is a question for you: Are you robbing God of glory by not taking care of your temple? There have been many that have died too young, because of not taking care of&nbsp;&nbsp; their body. They did not get to finish what God had planned for them. Do not let that happen to you. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That is the importance of learning How to walk in Divine health and allowing the Holy Spirit to guide us in what our bodies need to stay healthy and whole.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The world that we live in has become so fast pace that even our diets have become a part of the fast paced world. We have been provided with the knowledge through the Word on how to take care of our bodies, but we need to get the wisdom on what our bodies need. You can go to any supermarket and find all types of food to eat, but are we making the right choices?&nbsp; I have found that there are always new and enticing desserts, which are loaded with all the things we do not need, and all types of new breads to try. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are always commercials enticing our taste buds to try this new item, but they do not tell you it is loaded with ingredients that are not good for your body.&nbsp; I cannot begin to give you the accurate numbers on all the diets that are out there. I have known many people that have tried many of them, and yet have found that none of them worked for them. They feel discouraged and want to give up. That is why learning to walk in Divine health is so important. God, the Father knows our bodies better than anyone, so I believe that He is waiting on His children to come to Him for His wisdom on what they should eat. He gave us the Holy Spirit to guide us and teach us all things, which includes what is best for our bodies.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I have a sister in Christ that told me a few years ago that the Holy Spirit spoke to her and told her to eat one egg every day, and that is what she did. She was obedient to what the Holy Spirit told her. I do not know if she is still doing that but I know that the Holy Spirit knew that there was something in an egg that her body needed. I hope you see the point I am trying to make here. She received wisdom from above. If God did that for her He will do it for you.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Holy Spirit has been teaching me how to take care of my body. He has prompted me to buy certain foods that I have never tried before, and may not have if He had not instructed me to do so. I asked the Father to teach me on nutrition and what I needed to eat, so I could walk in that wholeness, and He has done so and is still doing so. I am always learning from Him. He wants all of us to totally depend on Him in every area of our life.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The same way that the Holy Spirit teaches me He can teach you, He is always waiting for us to involve Him in these things. He is a gentleman and will not interfere if he is not asked.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are many great vitamin supplements and herbs on the market that can really be beneficial to your health. People today do not always cook the way they should because of such busy life styles, and that is why we need to get extra nutrients from herbs and vitamins. I recommend that you buy whole food herbs, because they are full of veggies and fruits and our bodies need both. Do not buy synthetic vitamins, they may be cheaper, but they have stuff in them that is not good for you. Ask the Holy Spirit which ones He thinks you need; He will guide you to the right ones.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The next thing that helps our bodies continue in good health is exercise. Try to find the time to get at least 3-5 days of exercise a week. I know that some are thinking, I do not have the time, but please take the time. Get your children on a good exercise routine. If you make this choice and I believe you will, the Holy Spirit will show you the right program for you. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Remember, that our bodies are needed to do the will of the Father. We are needed to help bring people into the Kingdom of God. Glorify God in your body. Help others to reach their calling in Christ. Wow!!&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">WE ARE THE BODY OF CHRIST ON EARTH. LET&#39;S SHINE</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Remember to confess the Word over yourself daily. Confess it as you have it now, because faith is now!!!!</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csB0E2188C">I am the Body of Christ.&nbsp; I am redeemed from the curse, because Jesus bore my sickness and carried my diseases in His own body.&nbsp; By His stripes I am healed.&nbsp; I forbid any sickness or disease to operate in my body. Every organ, every tissue of my body functions in the perfection in which God created it to function. I honor God and bring glory to Him in my body. (Gal. 3:13, Matt. 8:17, 1 Peter 2:24, 1 Cor. 6:20)</span></p></td></tr>
