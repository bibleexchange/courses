I was taught when you go to church you wear a dress shirt and tie. My tie is probably made of silk. But, I am not going to strain at gnats. I am not going to touch what the devil says. Instead of arguing is this right or wrong or is that person right or wrong, but find out if the design of devil is involved.

The devil is always looking for opportunity to best tempt. Jesus had been fasting for 40 days. The stones were no problem for Christ, but He would not doing anything to satisfy the devil. There is nothing wrong with making bread out of stones. What is wrong is the suggestion of the devil. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You can know the difference between the devil the tempter and God the tester.
