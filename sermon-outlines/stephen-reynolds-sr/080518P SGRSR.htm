<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Isaiah 29:11-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isa 29:11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the
words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned,
saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 12 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned,
saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw
near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed
their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of
men:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous
work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of
their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall
be hid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from
the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who
knoweth us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 16 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be
esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He
made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no
understanding?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to marvel at the truth and understanding he brings
instead of the judgment he has brought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hold your heart in love with God and in love with truth that
you may have clear vision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.17 Isa 29:17 ¶ Is it not yet a very little while, and
Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be
esteemed as a forest?</p>
