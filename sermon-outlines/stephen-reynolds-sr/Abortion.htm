<p>Abortion      Ex 1:15- 2:10</p>

<p>The third oppression launched by the new king was a murderous law. But it
was overcome by a courageous mother who believed God. Pharaoh was furious. He
had launched every evil he could conceive. But no matter what he plotted,
Pharaoh's evil plans were overcome. He was left with only one other option: the
law of the land. Thus he passed a murderous law: all baby boys born to Israel
were to be drowned. Who were the executioners to be? All the Egyptians. Pharaoh
ordered <em><span style='font-style:normal'>all his people</span></em> to drown
all the baby boys they saw born to Israelite women, to drown them in the Nile
 River.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.2in'>How was this murderous law overcome? By
a courageous mother who believed God. This courageous mother was the mother of
Moses himself. What she did is so important that it is necessary to take a
whole study to cover her great faith. She and her faith are the subject of the
next outline. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.2in'>For now, the point to see is the evil
and ferocious persecution against God's people launched by Pharaoh.</p>

</span></span>He had enslaved the people of Israel, creating the most horrible

to stop their population growth, and to hold them forever as the slaves of Egypt.</p>

</span></span>He had also launched a murderous plot among the midwives to kill
all baby boys at birth.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.2in'>But note, God overcame the persecution.
God touched the heart of a believer, and she refused to obey the murderous law
of Pharaoh. She refused to kill her baby boy. She courageously stood against
the murderous law, and most likely, she stood against the well-intentioned advice
of friends who would have counseled her to obey the law lest she herself be
arrested and perhaps executed. She boldly took a stand and she set out to save
her newborn son, a son who was eventually to become the great deliverer of Israel

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Michael Jocobson, executive director of
the Center for Science in Public Interest, wrote for <em>Nutrition Action</em>
magazine:</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Alcohol can cause mental
retardation when it reaches fetuses. When cigarette smoking is combined with
alcohol, it can cause cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx. Alcohol can rot the
brain and liver, and leads to thousands of fatalities, falls, suicides, and
fires.</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>Smoking Mothers Have Premature Babies</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Babies born to smoking mothers have a
greater chance of being born prematurely and/or with low birthweight. Smoking
mothers have twice the chance of miscarriage or stillbirth. And, according to <em>American
Health</em> magazine, heavy drinkers (both male and female) can produce babies
with low birthweight, which are roughly five times more likely to die in the
first year and have higher incidents of respiratory problems and birth defects.</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>Smokers Contract Host Of Diseases</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>According to the U.S. Surgeon General,
the annual estimated number of smoking-related deaths is 400,000.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Effects—The smoking of tobacco products
is the chief avoidable cause of death in our society. Smokers are more likely
than nonsmokers to contract heart disease. Lung, larynx, esophageal, bladder,
pancreatic, and kidney cancers also strike smokers at increased rates. Some 30
percent of cancer deaths (130,000 per year) are linked to smoking. Chronic
obstructive lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are 10 times
more likely to occur among smokers than among nonsmokers.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Smoking during pregnancy also poses
serious risks. Spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, low birth weights, and
fetal and infant deaths are all the more likely to occur when the pregnant
woman/mother is a smoker.</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>New Secularistic Language</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Within the past decade we notice the
infusion of a completely new language into our society. It is a whole new
language that is devised to distort facts, confuse issues and persuade people
to believe lies. This language, used by the secular humanists in their attempt
to hoodwink the American people, is a new secularistic language.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>The words &quot;unborn child&quot; are
not used; the unborn child is referred to as a &quot;fetus&quot;. The word for
&quot;life&quot; becomes &quot;moment of viability&quot;. Fornication and
adultery becomes &quot;sexually active&quot;. Pregnancy is referred to as a
&quot;biological accident&quot;. &quot;Abortion&quot; is called a &quot;medical
procedure&quot;; &quot;abortion-on-demand&quot; is simply
&quot;pro-choice&quot;.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>And, &quot;pro-choice&quot; is
rationalized by the question: &quot;Why should any woman have to 'suffer'
because of a 'biological accident' when a simple 'medical procedure' can
eliminate the 'problem?'&nbsp;&quot;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>What Roe Vs Wade Means</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Only 11% of Americans know that because
of Roe v. Wade, abortions are legal for the duration of pregnancy, regardless
of a woman's reason for wanting one.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>But few Americans approve of
unrestricted abortion throughout pregnancy. There was a majority sypport for
abortion after three months of pregnancy only when the mother's life is
endangered and when the pregnancy resulted from incest.</p>

<p style='margin:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>Who Was Roe—Who Was Wade?</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Roe is Norma McCorvey of Dallas, and Wade is Henry Wade, the Dallas prosecutor. Ms. McCorvey was a cleaning woman
with a 10th-grade education, a failed marriage, no money and a child in 1970,
when she became pregnant again.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>She went to have an illegal, back-alley
abortion but was revolted by the conditions. She was advised to go to a lawyer
named Sarah Weddington, who was looking for a plaintiff to challenge. The
class-action suit was filed under the name Jane Roe to protect her identity.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Because of the slow legal process, Ms.
McCorvey never had the abortion, and she gave up her baby for adoption. She has
since worked in construction and waitressing jobs and remained anonymous until
1988, when she went public and started the Jane Roe Foundation.</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>Are Birds More Valuable Than Humans?</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>On the wall of the main post office in
downtown Tulsa, there are two posters which provide clear evidence of a queer
value system in effect in America.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>One poster is headed &quot;It is
Unlawful to Kill Eagles!&quot; The other says, &quot;It is unlawful to Kill
Scissortails!&quot; The first poster offers $1,000 as a reward for information
leading to the conviction of eagle killers. The second poster offers $500 for
the same information regarding the Oklahoma state bird. Other organizations
offer even greater monetary motivation to turn in known bird molesters and
killers.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Federal protection of eagles is not
limited to the live birds. It extends to their eggs, nests and dead carcasses
as well. Not only is it specially unlawful to kill these birds, but federal law
also prohibits the mere possession of one feather from an eagle without a
government permit.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Birds vs. humans. These laws protecting
birds are probably reasonable, but they, nonetheless, betray the lunacy of
current American values. For while it is illegal to molest or harm such
endangered species, it is totally legal in our nation to destroy human life by
abortion.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>If Leonardo were alive today, he would
be called the product of a broken home. He was an illegitimate child who never
saw his mother. His father later married a sixteen-year-old girl. For twelve
years, he was brought up first by his grandmother, then by two aunts. After
that, he went to live with his father and stepmother. Because of his father's
legal profession, Leonardo was considered better than the village children, so
he was never allowed to play with them. His early life, therefore, was very
unsettled, and he never knew what it was to enjoy the fun associated with
childhood.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>With that bad start, we would expect
that Leonardo would have become a dull, sullen boy with strong anti-social
attitudes. But Leonardo had one trait of character that saved him from this
fate. He had an active curiosity. As soon as he was old enough to walk, he
would hike all over the countryside, with his eyes, ears, and mind wide open.
The open fields, the woods, the birds and animals surrounding the Florentine village
 of Vinci fascinated him.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>There was no limit to his interests.
Plants, fossils, stars, and all other aspects of nature interested him. In
fact, he observed everything so carefully that he became an authority on dozens
of scientific and artistic subjects. Today, it amazes us how one man could have
possessed so many remarkable talents.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Leonardo could have gained fame in
several different professions. He was a &quot;Wright brother&quot; in the field
of aeronautics. He was also the Thomas Edison of the fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries. He was a leading astronomer, geologist, engineer,
botanist, and anatomist, as well as a famous author, illustrator, and
psychologist. Perhaps some reader is saying, &quot;But I know Leonardo de Vinci
only as the renowned painter of the well-known and intriguing 'Mona Lisa'—that
Florentine mystery lady with the most discussed smile in history.&quot;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>This is the story of the boy with the
bad start! He became one of the most remarkable and famous men of all time!</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>Graphic Film Shows Real Abortion</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>The film &quot;<em>The Silent Scream</em>&quot;
will probably not be shown in your local theater. Nor will it likely be rated R
although it literally focuses on sex and violence. Time characterized the film
as a potential hi-tech <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin,</em> Harriet Beecher Stowe's
indictment of slavery which literally changed the nation's attitude.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>One evidence that <em>Time's</em>
assessment is on target is that the doctor who performed the filmed abortion,
after viewing &quot;<em>The Silent Scream</em>&quot; at Dr. Bernard Nathason's
insistence, immediately resigned from the abortion clinic and has since
performed no more such &quot;reproductive services.&quot;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>The modern technology of real-time
ultra-sound shows the responses of a 12-week-old unborn child attempting to
escape the abortionist's suction curette. Her motions become desperately
agitated and her heart rate increases dramatically, as Dr. Nathason explains in
his compelling narration.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Once the director of the largest abortion
clinic in the world and a founder of what is now named the National Abortion
Rights Action League, Nathason has become one of the foremost champions of the
pro-life movement. He is an atheist.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>When Nathason was on their side, he was
an &quot;authority.&quot; Now, according to them, he is a &quot;fraud&quot;.
Because the film shows abortion from the victim's perspective, it is destined
to change the course of public debate.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Abortion has become big business. <em>Fortune
Magazine</em> estimates that $500 million is grossed each year from the
abortions themselves. Another source reports that aborted fetuses are being
sold at $25 a batch up to $5,500 a pound.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>The sale of late-term aborted fetuses
between within 10 years at one of our nation's hospitals brought in $468,000.
This money was used to buy a TV set, and cookies and soft drinks for visiting
professors.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Equally disgusting is the purchase of
fetal collagen by the cosmetic industry for its various beauty products.
Collagen is the gelatinous substance found in connective tissue, bone and
cartilage. It can be found in twelve leading shampoos and five hand creams in
stores throughout the United States. And unless the product's label stipulated
animal collagen, it probably contains human collagen. Though the thought is
horrendous, it is possible for a once expectant mother to beautify her skin and
hair with matter from her own dead child.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Lucrative also is the sale of fetal
tissue, which brings investors about one million dollars annually. According to
the &quot;<em>Village Voice</em>,&quot; estimates made several years ago
indicate that between 20,000 and 100,000 fetuses are being sold to drug
companies annually in the United States alone.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>It is ironic that a total of

poisonous gas, but then voted down Senator Jesse Helm's amendment to stop
federal funds from being used for abortion.</p>

<p style='margin:0in'><b>How Baby's Brain Grows</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>At birth a baby's brain contains 100
billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky
Way. But while the brain contains virtually all the nerve cells it will ever
have, the pattern of wiring between them has yet to stabilize.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Up to this point,&quot; says
Shatz, &quot;what the brain has done is lay out circuits that are its best
guess about what's required for vision, for language, for whatever.&quot;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Following that, it is up to neural
activity—no longer spontaneous, but driven by a flood of sensory experiences—to
take this rough blueprint and progressively refine it.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>During the first years of life, the
brain undergoes a series of extraordinary changes. Starting shortly after
birth, a baby's brain, in a display of biological exuberance, produces
trillions more connections between neurons than it can possibly use.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.25in'>Then, the brain eliminates connections,
or synapses, that are seldom or never used, starting around the age of 10 or
earlier, leaving behind a mind whose patterns of emotion and thought are, for
better or worse, unique.</p>
