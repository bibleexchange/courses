Thanksgiving</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the charge: be careful (anxious) for nothing. The idea is that the believer is not to worry or fret about a single thing. The word &quot;nothing&quot; means not even one thing. Humanly speaking, the Philippians had probable cause in the natural to worry and be anxious.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs2AEC9D57">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;They were suffering severe persecution (Phil. 1:18-19).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs2AEC9D57">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;They were facing a disturbance in the church, some disunity and quarreling (Phil. 1:27, &nbsp;42).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs2AEC9D57">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;They had some carnal members within their fellowship, some members who were prideful, super-spiritual, (don&rsquo;t know how to leave light behind them) and self-centered (Phil. 2:3-4; Phil. 3:12).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs2AEC9D57">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;They were facing some false teachers who had joined their fellowship, and the teachers were fierce in attacking the cross of Christ (Phil. 3:2-3, 18-19).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs2AEC9D57">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the believers were having to struggle for the necessities of life: food, clothing, and shelter (Phil. 4:19).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;They were facing about every trial and temptation imaginable, the kind of trouble that arouses anxiety and worry. Humanly, a person is going to fret, worry and suffer anxiety...</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he is either about to lose his job or lack food, clothing, or shelter.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he is persecuted, ridiculed, abused, or threatened.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he is surrounded by quarrels, disturbance, carnality, or false teaching.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csFCB0A72A"><span class="csC05134DD">In the midst of such circumstances, the only way a person can keep from worrying is to receive by faith supernatural power.</span></li></ul>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">This is the very point of Scripture. There is an answer to worry and anxiety, a supernatural answer: </span><span class="cs821257DA">the peace of God</span><span class="csC05134DD">. God will </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">enable</span><span class="csC05134DD"> the believer to conquer worry and anxiety. God will overcome the trials of life for the believer, no matter how terrible and pressuring they may be. God will infuse the believer with peace&mdash;with the very peace of God Himself&mdash;a peace so great and so wonderful that it carries the believer right through the trial. Of course, this does not mean the believer is not to be concerned about the problems of life. He is, but there is a difference between concern and anxiety or worry. Concern drives us to arise and tackle the problems of life with courage and diligence. Concern drives us to tackle and conquer all knowing that through Christ we can handle all things. Anxiety and worry cause all kinds of problems.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Job 34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Ro 16:20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
