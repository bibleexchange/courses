You say the wicked prosper and that I am wicked because I as a righteous man suffer adversity. I cannot listen to that kind of counsel.&rdquo; Job said that if there&rsquo;s a spot in my hands let my wife be a slave and his offspring turned over to others, he was completely free of guilt and shame. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;SIMON, SIMON&rdquo; v.31</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A true intercessor doesn&rsquo;t call one time and then say that&rsquo;s enough, but continues to Call.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;That your faith fail not&rdquo; v.32</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must believe God.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a process to learning. Here the Lord is saying &ldquo;Simon, Simon&rdquo; wanting to get his attention to teach him something. What is ahead, what is going to happen beforehand. Not going into trial ignorantly. Ignorance causes wickedness. You will never do well by accident. You must TRUST the Lord in order to do well. In the process of learning how to believe God it is impossible, difficult without God&rsquo;s help. I cannot do it on my own. What He puts inside of me, I must work out with fear and trembling. He works by faith and His Word.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;When thou art converted, strengthen the brethren&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The process the Lord is bringing us through is through learning.

It is not just ignorance, but WILLINGLY IGNORANT. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">WE CAN KNOW ALL THINGS IF WE SEEK HIM BECAUSE HE REVEALS.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How can we know what the devil desires and designs? By the Word of God. He desires to have that he might sift as weak. His plan is to get you to deny that you the Lord. The devil&rsquo;s desire is against God, against me loving God and serving God. If I feel any desire not to worship God that is God allowing us to sense the devil&rsquo;s desire. That is for the intercessor to catch a hold of and fight against. God is going to have some warriors that will fight the fight of faith. The true intercessor knows what it is to hold the garment and pray.&mdash;Joel 2:13 </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
