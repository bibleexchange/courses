It should be the slightest wrong decision should be crisis enough to get us to bear a burden in prayer and seek repentance. David prayed and built an altar of sacrifice, seeking the Lord to stop the judgment being executed against the nation. These events took place on the third day of the plague that was sweeping the nation.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Hearing that 70,000 people were fatally stricken by the plague, David went before the Lord in prayer and confessed his sin. </span><span class="cs588E7FF2"></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">IT TOOK A GREAT CRISIS</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

For the people were only as sheep. We have all made foolish choices, We must go to an old fashioned altar of repentence. When we are sincere before God, He sees the truly repentive heart and brings deliverance.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

A cry of faith and a repentive heart is enough to bring salvation. But God&rsquo;s purpose is not just to bring us to an altar to pray, but bring us into a life lived above sin and in obedience to God! There is a place to OBEY God. We fool only ourselves if we say prays and do not obey. It all begins in prayer and continues through a prayer of faith, but that faith msut be demonstrated in obedience.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">David built an altar of sacrifice in obedience to the instructions of the prophet Gad </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;God commanded the altar to be built on the very site where the plague had been stopped, that is, on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

Surprised at the king&#39;s visit, he asked why the king had come to his servant. (2 Samuel 24:19-25) David&rsquo;s purpose was to purchase the threshing floor. God&rsquo;s purpose was not just altar space, but God desired a TEMPLE.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(50 pieces of silver- 2Sa 24:24; 600 shekels of Gold- 1Ch 21:25) There was an immediate price paid. Not all was paid at first and not all was known what would be paid. But in this moment, give all we have and do all we know to do.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Araunah sensed the urgency for appealing to God to stop the plague So he offered to give the property to David, plus the oxen and wood necessary for the atoning sacrifice&mdash;all without any charge whatsoever. And in making the offer, he uttered the prayer that God would accept David&#39;s atoning sacrifice in behalf of the people. But David insisted on the basic principle for all worship and service: true sacrifice demands payment. David was unwilling to offer the Lord anything that cost him nothing. &quot;If there is no cost, there is no real sacrifice.&quot; Consequently, David insisted on paying for the property and the animals to be used in sacrifice.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Too many buy the threshing floor and then decide what they are going to do in life. We need to build an altar! We need God leading and directing us doing his will. We have got to have to the wisdom of God revealed to us. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thank God for the taste and the touch, but we need so much more! The more we recognize our own weakness, the more God&rsquo;s righteousness can be revealed. &lsquo;I made a foolish decision!&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t want the anger of God kindled against us because we refused to repent, but we want an altar.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus is faithful and he never fails. He gave himself for us. He never failed to build the altar. Christ&rsquo;s altar was not without great price! David could not give to God that which cost him nothing. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is trouble also to think we have anything to give or bargain with God. Christ is the one who made the sacrifice. Our repentance cannot be esteemed a sacrifice to us or it will not last.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">e.&nbsp;&nbsp;As quickly as he could, fighting against time to stop the plague, David bought the property and built the altar on the hill where the threshing floor sat. Soon afterward he offered the substitute, atoning sacrifice through the Burnt Offerings and the Peace or Fellowship Offerings </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting the substitute, atoning sacrifice offered by David, the Lord forgave David&#39;s sins and answered the prayer of His servant. The Lord stopped the hand of His chastisement and judgment.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we approach God through the substitute sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, God will forgive our sins. No matter what we have done and no matter how terrible the wickedness, God will have mercy upon us and accept us. And He will deliver us from the judgment to come. Through Jesus Christ&mdash;through His atoning, substitutionary sacrifice upon the cross&mdash;God will save us from sin and death and the judgment to come. This is the strong declaration of God&#39;s Holy Word:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ga 1:4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ga 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Eph 5:2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Titus 2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Heb 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. {for the: or, by the}</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1Pe 2:24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1Pe 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1Jo 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Isa 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">David had extended Israel&#39;s territorial borders to control more land than ever before or since, including up to this present day and time. Under his brilliant leadership and military genius, David had carried Israel to the height of its glory, a glory that would be experienced and enjoyed under Solomon&#39;s leadership, but a glory that would never again be achieved by Israel.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After purchasing the land upon which the future temple was to be built and sanctifying the holy ground with the offering of atoning sacrifices, the great book of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Second Samuel </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">could now be closed. With his task now finished, David could die and go to be with the Lord. All things had now been prepared for his son Solomon to take up the mantle of leadership and build the temple in all of its magnificent glory. Thereafter, down through the pages of history, God&#39;s people would always look back upon the life of David and draw enormous encouragement. For in the life of David we see a man who suffered as many trials and temptations as any person who has ever lived. From the earliest days of his life as a mere adolescent threatened by the king, he bore the trials and distress of being in constant warfare and conflict, often being hunted down as a fugitive, even by his own sons who were seeking to take his life and to assume for themselves the power of the throne. In looking at his life, we also see that the promises of God are fulfilled in the life of a person whose heart is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">right with God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The life of David serves as an example of a man who had a heart </span><span class="csC382D2BB">just like God&#39;s</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csC382D2BB">David foreshadowed the actions of Jesus, the ultimate son of David, who also gave sacrificially on a hill near Jerusalem for his people so that an even more tragic plague might be stopped. David&#39;s climactic sacrifice involved the use of wood and blood on a hill outside the city; so did Jesus&#39; sacrifice. David&#39;s sacrifice stopped a physical plague that had taken the lives of many Israelites; by Jesus&#39; wounds the new Israel likewise has &quot;been healed&quot; because &quot;he himself bore our sins in his body&quot;.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC382D2BB">Christ is our altar, our sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to find favour with God, to escape his wrath, and the sword, the flaming sword, of the cherubim who </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">keep the way of the tree of life. </span></p></body>
