<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Facing the Problem with the Promise</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Genesis 43:31-34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBlockText> 31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained
himself, and said, Set on bread.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:39.3pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:37.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:18.7pt'> 32 And they
set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians,
which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat
bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:39.3pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:37.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:18.7pt'> 33 And they
sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest
according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:39.3pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:37.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:18.7pt'> 34 And he
took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five
times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is obvious that Joseph’s knew and loved his brothers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joseph faced his problems with the promises of God. ‘God was
with Joseph’ When you have God’s Word and you face your problems with God’s
Word you are always going to come on top.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They drank and were merry with him. He was putting them to
the test. We so often are not aware that we are being tested. Remember: This is
just a test! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is obvious whom the Lord loves more than others. There is
no question who Joseph is exalting above the others. He set Benjamin so that he
received 5 times greater than what everyone else received. There is a close
relationship to be had with the Lord. He will give great things to those who
love Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it really obvious who we love the most? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is holy God. Hating the wicked and loving the righteous.
He hates sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>2Sa 3:39 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil
according to his wickedness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mr 14:38 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit
truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</p>
