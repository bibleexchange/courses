<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TEXT: Zechariah 9:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>God wants to do something in us so
He can do something with us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Knowing Jesus and having Him reveal
Himself to you is life-changing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The task, responsibity of what God
requires of me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Some people have it hard difficulty
just to make it to church. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In these last days is required that
which is beyond the ordinary. We have a responsibility to His Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Zechariah 1:13 -And the LORD
answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.
&lt;&lt;God is not interested in you laying in a bed of easee and not finishing
your responsibility ahead of you. The task is great and great strenght will be
required of the Lord. We must not be at ease always allowing others to bear the
burden and do the work. We have a responsibility to God until He shows His will
to us and reveals Himself in us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>His Word is good because it comes
in the fashion that we NEED it. God’s good Word won’t always make you just feel
good at first. It comes as we NEED it and not necessarily how we desire it. And
it is effectual in its work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>9:17 We have a responsibility to
receive a revelation of Who He is and for that to change us. What is it that
will put a joy inn our soul and not quit in the night hour? It is going to be
the Word of God given to us that will sustain us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>ENDURANCE, SUSTAIN, CONTINUANCE<span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span><span style='font-family:Woodcut'>KEY</span>.
Not just the quick, fast, feel good song or exciting emotions. And the Word of
God revealed to us is the key to our LONG DISTANCE success.</p>

rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to
every one grass in the field. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We must pray. We must know Him, His promises, His
Word, but it is going to take a fervent and prayer life. We must plant seed and
we must water it with prayer. Pray and not faint…catch the burden.
Extraordinary prayer. It is going to take an extraordinary prayer life in order
for God to work in finishing that which has been started. </p>

until it happens. Extraordinary prayer to help the unity of the Spirit and then
to keep it. And then to come to the unity of the faith. Eph. 4:3,13 If people
are going to believe they must be influenced by the Spirit of God and the Word
and not just our own zeal and excitement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Zechariah 8:19 --Thus saith the
LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the
fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah
joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. The
joy is to those that know what the fast is all about. That understand the
greatness of His love, goodness, and beauty. 8:20,21 I SENSE MY NEED TO SEEK
THE LORD. LET US. There is a unity that is needed. Matthew 18:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Let us go on the strength of the
Word that God has revealed to us. Inconsistent results in some places becauase
of excitement inspired action with no revealed Word. 8:22,23—God still reveals
Himself to the Jews even though their heart is hard. I will live an unfinished
life until the Spirit of God comes upon me as he desires. </p>
