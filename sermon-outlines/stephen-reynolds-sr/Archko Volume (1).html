		<p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Archko Volume</span></p><p class="csC4FAE482"><span class="cs8EBA521">&ldquo;But when he yielded up the ghost, he proved to all that he was hypostatical (that is, a human body) and the lodi curios had come from the iclandic covenant, and his trinitas unitas was all a sham.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs282FBE06"><span class="cs1B2EF427">It also contains a very unflattering description of Joseph [whom the Bible describes as a just man] alongside a glowing description of Mother Mary. And who allegedly pens these contrasting descriptions? Why, the great teacher Gammaliel himself! And since Archko relates a near-conversion of a pious and misunderstood Pontius Pilate; why not convert Herod as well? </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csC9E71A02">the Archko Volume describes the events of Jesus&rsquo; Birth and states that the shepherds saw strange lights and heard voices and that they felt afraid at first but then felt a great peace. This sounds similar to the Biblical account, but we are forced to consider upon further thought that bright lights are hardly angels. In fact, bright lights lend more credence to UFOs than angelic choirs. Too, we wonder that the Bible says that the angel specifically said, &ldquo;Fear Not!&rdquo; rather than that their fear simply faded away. Strikingly, there is no mention in the Archko Volume that the Babe would be lying in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes as a sign to the shepherds that they had found the Christ Child. On the other hand, there is considerable emphasis on a priest who seems to comprehend perfectly that Jesus&rsquo; birth is a fulfillment of Messianic prophecies and who allegedly defends both the Virgin Birth and Zacharias the father of John the Baptist to the Sanhedrin. As mentioned, the Archko Volume describes Joseph as a mean-spirited man who is &ldquo;as gross and glum as he looks,&rdquo; while the Bible Canon records that he was a just man.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
