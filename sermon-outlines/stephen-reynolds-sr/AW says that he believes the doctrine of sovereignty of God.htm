style='border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in'>Popularity Doesn’t&nbsp;Matter</span></a></span></h1>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Just as it is dangerous to follow a
preacher or teacher because they are popular, it is equally dangerous to follow
a preacher or teacher because they are unpopular.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>I have been a follower of Andrew
Wommack since 1998, when he rocked my world with a message called “Two Kinds of
Righteousness”. Back then he wasn’t on TV in Europe, and nobody in the circles
I moved in knew who he was.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Now Andrew is one of the leading TV ministers
in this nation and his ministry has garnered a measure of success and his Bible
Colleges are taking off and his conferences are growing, I actually know people
who have stopped listening to his ministry, stopped going to his conferences,
stopped being part of it all because “I’ve heard it all before”, “I’m on the
new thing”, “I want to be on the fringe”.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Sometimes the fringe is exactly where
it is happening. Sometimes it is just the lunatic fringe. Some people actually
like being unpopular and being persecuted – sometimes they deliberately choose
to go to a church that rejects tongues or healing or the grace message because
they enjoy the feeling of being rejected and being persecuted. It makes them
feel better than other people. Not being secure in their righteousness, they
like being around people they feel superior to because that assuages their
sense of guilt and inferiority.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Sometimes they come up with
increasingly outlandish revelations in the name of grace most of which tend to
universalism or a licentiousness which even our worst religious accusers
wouldn’t dream we are capable of. Just to stay persecuted. Just to stay on that
high of being on the “cutting edge”.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The fact is some days they will
praise you, some days they will crucify you. Learn to live immune to both
through faith in His work. Don’t let a need for popularity lead you to
disobedience, and don’t let a need for unpopularity lead you to disobedience.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Find out where you fit into the body
of Christ, get there and stay there. &nbsp;People left Tree of Life Church
because it was too unpopular, and people have left the church because it was
too popular. &nbsp;Being popular doesn’t mean anything – honouring God does.</span></p>

style='border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in'>Ever Wondered How Andrew
Wommack Ended Up in&nbsp;England?</span></a></span></h1>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This is how, in Andrew’s own words:</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>(Yes, this is another blog post in
light of Dave Duell’s imminent visit to Dagenham!)</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In September of 1989, I was
holding a tent meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was the night that
hurricane Hugo hit. The tent was flapping in the breeze, and we needed to drop
and tie it off. But just before the service ended, Pastor Dean Mellon gave me a
prophecy that changed my life and ministry.</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>He said, “you have a nation of
the world on your heart, and you know exactly which nation I’m speaking of”. In
less than a month, you will meet a man who will be a porter, a door opener to
the whole nation.</span></em></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>I knew exactly which nation the
Lord was speaking of, and I knew in my heart that the Lord was about to bring
my dreams and vision concerning the U.K. and Europe to pass. I’ve had the U.K.
on my heart ever since I took a trip to Europe in 1968. While in London, I
spent hours walking the streets, praying for the people and believing God that
someday I would get the opportunity to minister to them.</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>However, it’s not wise to just
take a prophecy and run with it. If it was really the Lord speaking to me
through this man, then it would come to pass without my help. Two weeks later
at our U.S. Ministers’ Conference in Buena Vista, Colorado, I noticed that Will
Graham from Rugeley, England was listed as an attendee. I figured Will was the
man the Lord had spoken about, but I didn’t say a thing to anyone.</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In the very first session, my
good friend, Dave Duell, was ministering and calling people forward for prayer.
He called Will to the front and said. “Will, God has made you a porter, a door
opener to all of the U.K.” BINGO! That was it. This had to be the man the Lord
had spoken to me about in Charlotte.</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>I told Will about that prophecy I
received in Charlotte and asked him what he thought. He said his church had
received a special offering to send him to the conference to get Dave and me
and bring us to England. Praise the Lord! A few months later we opened our
first international office in Coventry, England, and its been going strong ever
since.</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>We have distributed hundreds of
thousands of tapes and CDs through our European office and have thousands of
people on our mailing list. We minister in many churches and hold two
conventions in the U.K. each year. The Gospel Truth television program is
broadcast daily in the U.K. on the God Channel International, which also
reaches all of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</span></em></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The open doors to the U.K. and
Europe were a supernatural opportunity that came directly from the Lord. We are
committed to walking through every door the Lord opens for us and minster the
nearly too-good-to-be-true news of God’s love to hungry people throughout
Europe.</span></em></p>

<h1><span lang=EN style='font-size:17.5pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif'><a
href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2010/02/01/a-better-way-to-pray-andrew-wommack/"><span
style='border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in'>A Better Way to Pray
(Andrew&nbsp;Wommack)</span></a></span></h1>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Decades ago, I was participating in
an all-night prayer meeting bombarding the gates of heaven. I remember beating
the wall and yelling,&nbsp;<strong>“God, if You loved the people in Arlington,
Texas, half as much as I do, we’d have revival!”</strong> Immediately, my
lightning-fast mind realized that something was seriously wrong with my
theology.<strong> What was I thinking?</strong></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Did I really believe I loved these
people more than God did? No, not exactly. Like many Christians, I believed God
was angry with the human condition, and it was up to me to turn Him from wrath
and judgment. I was interceding, or so I thought, pleading with God on the
behalf of others. What could possibly be wrong with that? As I learned later, a
lot.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The things the Lord has
revealed to me about prayer since then have totally changed my life, and I’m
now seeing miraculous results.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:
10.5pt'> If you aren’t getting the results you know the Lord wants you to have,
maybe it’s time to consider a better way to pray. I’m not saying that anyone
who doesn’t pray as I do is “of the devil.” I wasn’t “of the devil” in the way
I used to pray. I loved God with all my heart, and the Lord loved me. But the
results weren’t there.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>First, we need to recognize
that God isn’t angry at mankind anymore. </span></strong><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'>He is no longer imputing or holding our sins against
us.</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“God was in Christ, reconciling
the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
committed unto us the word of reconciliation” </span></em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'>(2 Cor. 5:19).</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>We are NOW reconciled to God through
Jesus. That means we are in harmony and are friendly with God right now. He isn’t
mad; He’s not even in a bad mood. The war between God and man is over. That’s
what the angels proclaimed at the birth of Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Luke 2:14 says,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>These angels weren’t saying that peace
would reign on earth and that wars between people would cease. That certainly
hasn’t happened. They were proclaiming the end of war between God and man.
Jesus paid a price that was infinitely greater than the sins of the whole human
race.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>God’s wrath and justice have been
satisfied.&nbsp;<strong>Jesus changed everything. God isn’t angry. </strong>His
mercy extends to all people. He loves the world, not just the church, but the
whole world. He paid for all sin.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The Scriptures say in 1 John 2:2,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“And he is the propitiation for
our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In the Old Testament, God’s judgment
was poured out on both individuals and nations. In the New Testament,&nbsp;<strong>God’s
judgment was poured out on Jesus. That is the nearly-too-good-to-be-true news
of the Gospel. </strong>We no longer get what we deserve; we get what Jesus
paid the price for, if we will only believe.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Before I understood this, I would
say, “If God doesn’t judge America, He will have to apologize to Sodom and
Gomorrah.” Now I say, “If God judges America, He will have to apologize to
Jesus.” Understanding what Jesus did completely changes our perspective.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Second, Jesus is now the
Mediator. </span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>A mediator is
one who seeks to reconcile, or make peace between, two opposing parties. In the
Old Testament, man had not yet been reconciled to God through Jesus. The people
needed a mediator, someone to intercede with God on their behalf. That is where
we find people like Abraham and Moses pleading with God.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In Genesis 18:23-25, Abraham
interceded with God on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah:</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“Abraham drew near, and said,
Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be
fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place
for the fifty righteous that are therein? That be far from thee to do after
this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous
should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the
earth do right?”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In fact, Abraham actually negotiated
with God until He agreed not to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for the sake of ten
righteous people. But there weren’t ten righteous people in the whole city, and
only some of Lot’s family survived. A similar account is recorded in Exodus
32:9-12 and 14. Here God was furious with the people, and Moses interceded for
them:</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“The LORD said unto Moses, I have
seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: Now therefore let me
alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and
I will make of thee a great nation. And Moses besought the LORD his God, and
said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast
brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty
hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring
them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of
the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy
people…And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his
people.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Moses actually told God, “Repent!”
What nerve! What’s more amazing is that God repented. From these and other
stories in the Old Testament,&nbsp;<strong>modern-day “intercessors” believe
we, too, must stand in the gap, or mediate, between God and man.</strong> Just
as I did decades ago, they believe we must plead with God to save the lost, to
withhold His wrath from those He is ready to judge, and to be merciful to those
whose needs He is unwilling to meet because of their unworthiness.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>That couldn’t be further from
the truth</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>, but it is
what’s being taught in many churches today. It ignores the fact that Jesus is
now seated at the right hand of the Father (Heb. 10:12), ever making
intercession for us (Heb. 7:25). If Moses or Abraham could persuade God, don’t
you think Jesus could do at least as well?</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In 1 Timothy 2:5, we read,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“For there is one God, and one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”</span></em></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In the New Covenant, Jesus is
the ONLY mediator</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> needed
to stand between God the Father and mankind.&nbsp;<strong>Sin is no longer a
problem with God</strong>; it’s been atoned for, and we are now the
righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. That is how God sees us. If we understand
that, it will change the way we pray.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>It was appropriate for Abraham and
Moses to pray as they did because God’s wrath had not yet been appeased through
Jesus. Today, under the New Covenant, if people try to mediate in that way,
they are actually antichrist—against Christ. They are saying that Jesus was not
enough and are not esteeming what Christ has done.&nbsp;<strong>When Jesus
became our Mediator, He put all other mediators out of business—forever.</strong>
I know these words are strong, but they are the truth.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Satan is behind much of the wrong
teaching on “prayer.” Consider how crafty his plan is and the fruit it
produces. He has convinced believers to stay in their closets, taking the place
of Jesus in intercession. They spend hours pleading with God to turn from His
wrath, to pour out His Spirit, and to meet the needs of the people.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Meanwhile, families, coworkers, and
neighbors are going to hell and dying from disease. The Bible doesn’t say that
salvation comes through intercession, but by the foolishness of preaching (1
Cor. 1:21). And we are not told to pray for the sick, but to heal the sick
(Matt. 10:8) by commanding healing into their broken bodies.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>We have been deceived into
believing prayer is all about persuading God to release His power.</span></strong><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> We believe He can save, heal, and deliver but
that He is waiting on us to shape up and earn it. The truth is, we don’t
deserve it, and we will never be good enough. Because of Jesus, all that God
has is ours. That’s good news. We no longer need to beg or plead; we need to
exercise the authority He has given us and receive His blessings.</span></p>

really is a better way to pray. </span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:

only touched on this subject in this letter, so I encourage you to order my
book,&nbsp;</span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>A Better Way to

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This message is also available in a
CD or DVD album. In the book and albums, I talk about the primary purpose of
prayer; the importance of speaking to your mountain about God, not to God about

<h1><span lang=EN style='font-size:17.5pt;font-family:"Georgia",serif'><a
href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2009/09/13/romans-1-16/"><span
style='border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in'>Romans&nbsp;1.16</span></a></span></h1>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>For I am not ashamed of the
gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This is one of my favourite verses ever.
Everyone should memorize this verse in my opinion, it is so powerful. It is
life changing truth.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Paul starts by saying “I am not
ashamed of the gospel of Christ”.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The Greek word for ashamed is the
word </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>epaischynomai </span></em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>which means guilty, disgraced and embarassed.
How do we feel about the good news of Jesus Christ? Are we disgraced by it?
Does it embarass us?</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>I think it often does embarass us. I
am not talking about not sharing the gospel and being afraid to share the
gospel – you should never be afraid to tell people the good news. I think that
the gospel embarasses us as Christians because it is a message of entire grace
and no merit.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The gospel (Gk. </span><em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>euaggelion</span></em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'>) is the good news of Christ. It is the truth that we
don’t have to be spiritually dead, we don’t have to be sick, we don’t have to
be poor, we don’t have to be rejected because of the redemptive work of Christ
on the cross.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>I think Christians are embarassed of
the gospel because it is so unbelievable – as Andrew Wommack calls it, it is
the “too good to be true news”. So what we do is add a little to the gospel to
make it more acceptable and less embarassing: you have to go to church for it
to work, you have to be a good person, you have to change, you have to pray for
this long. None of this is the gospel – the gospel is that we are redeemed, we
are righteous, we are healthy, we are wealthy because of Jesus Christ and
because of His goodness and His brilliance.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Stop being embarassed of the gospel.
Tell people the truth: Jesus Christ has done it all. Jesus has paid the price
for every sin you have ever committed, ever will commit, and you are free in
Him if you believe in Him. You are saved by grace alone through faith alone in
Christ alone.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This gospel – this news that it is
all Jesus and not our works, not our righteousness, not our attitudes, but His
redemptive work on the cross – this gospel is the power of God unto salvation
to everyone who believes.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This is the most important truth you
can ever, ever receive: the power of God is in the good news that Jesus has
completely paid the price for us.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The power of God is not in fasting.
The power of God is not in prayer. The power of God is certainly not in binding
demons and screaming in tongues for hours. The power of God is not in our
holiness. The power of God is not in special people – charismatic superstars.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The power of God is in the gospel –
the good news that Jesus paid the price.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>If you know someone who needs
healing, you don’t need to pray and fast. You don’t need to bind the devil, you
don’t need to drag them to a crusade.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>You need to tell them the good news.
You need to tell them the truth that Jesus Christ has completely paid the price
for their healing. The power of God is in the good news.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Don’t be embarassed about the good
news. Tell people they can be healed – not because of their merit, but because
of Jesus. Tell people they can be wealthy because of Jesus – not because of
their background or any other reason. Tell people that they can be righteous
because of Jesus – not due to their actions, their prayer life, their anything!
It is all Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The power is only in what Jesus has
done. It is not anywhere else. If we don’t tell people boldly that Jesus has
done it all, then we will not see the power of God.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This is why the church at large does not
see the power of God. Galatians 3 says that we see miracles because of grace
and faith, not works of the law. We have made miracles subject to our holiness,
to our goodness. We have told people that they need to clean up their lives to
see the goodness of God, to see healings, to see wealth, to see salvation, to
be righteous.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>It is all untrue – in fact, Paul
calls it witchcraft in Galatians 3. It is witchcraft to say that you need to do
something to be saved other than believe in Christ and His redemptive work.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Get out of witchcraft, and get into
the gospel. Stop being embarassed about the gospel and tell people boldly that
Jesus has done it all. Then you will see the power of God – you will see people
born again, people healed, people released from poverty, from shame, from
rejection. You will see people who used to hold their heads down low lift them
high, their entire faces will change as the gospel renews their mind.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Stop trying to find the power of God
where it is not. Stop being embarassed that Jesus has done it all and you have
done nothing, are nothing and deserve nothing without Him! Admit it – you are
nothing without Christ. You can do nothing without Christ. You deserve nothing
without Christ.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Christ has done it all – paid the
total price so we, and the world, can be righteous, can be saved, can be
accepted, can be loved, can be redeemed, can be joyous, can be healed, can be
happy, can work miracles, can enjoy life in abundance. It is all HIM!</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>All we have to do to enjoy salvation
(which in the Greek means healing, peace and prosperity) is believe. That is
the greatest truth in the Bible. It is the most wonderful truth in the
universe. That is the most important truth you can ever realize.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>A true revelation of God’s
Word is the single most important element of a victorious Christian life. </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The Word of God often refers
to itself as a seed. </span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>There
are a total of forty-four verses in the New Testament where the Greek word
“sperma” was translated “seed.” This is the same word from which we derive our
English word “sperm.”</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>To conceive and give birth to the
miracles you need, you must first plant God’s Word like a seed in your heart. <strong>Conception
cannot take place without first planting the seed. </strong>There has only been
one virgin birth, and the birth of you’re miracle won’t be the second.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>I constantly meet Christians who pray
and believe for God’s intervention in their lives, but remain frustrated with
the results. It’s because <strong>they are missing the seeds of conception;
they just don’t know God’s Word</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In Mark 4, the Lord taught three
parables which illustrate that the Word is to the kingdom of God what a natural
seed is to a harvest. The first of these parables, the story of the sower, is
the key to unlocking all the Word of God (Mark 4:13). If we don’t understand
these truths, Jesus said we won’t understand any of His other parables.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>There are many life-changing truths
in these parables, but one fact must be understood to get the full benefit of
this teaching. The Lord used the comparison of His Word to a law of nature that
is unchangeable, not an institution of man.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Here’s what I mean. <strong>You can
cheat or manipulate nearly all systems that men have created.</strong> The
legal system can be beaten, letting the guilty go free. Our educational system
can be beaten, passing students who haven’t really learned the material. <strong>But
you can’t change seedtime and harvest.</strong></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>What if a farmer waited until he saw
his neighbors reaping their crops before he sowed for his crop? Regardless of
how sincere he was, or the justification for not sowing his seed at the proper
time, he would not reap a crop overnight. <u>The law of seedtime and harvest
cannot be violated</u>.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This is why our Lord chose to compare
the way His Word works to a seed. There is a germination process of the Word of
God in your life that takes time and can’t be avoided. In the second parable of</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Mark 4, Jesus said in verses 26-29,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“So is the kingdom of God, as if
a man should cast seed into the ground; And should sleep, and rise night and
day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth
bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the
full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he
putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.”</span></em></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The seed is the Word of God
(verse 14), and the ground is our hearts (verse 15).</span></strong><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> Our hearts were created by God to bring forth
fruit when His Word is planted in them. Just as a seed has to remain in the
ground over time to germinate, so the Word of God has to abide in us.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Jesus said in John 15:7,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“If ye abide in me, and my words
abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>What would happen if you planted a
seed in your garden and then dug it up each morning to see if anything was
happening? It would die and never produce fruit. You have to have faith that
the seed is doing what God created it to do.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Some people put God’s Word in their
hearts for a day or two, but <strong>if they don’t see fruit almost
immediately, they dig up the seed through their words and actions</strong> and
wonder why it didn’t work. You have to leave it in the ground over time. Then,
there are also different stages of growth.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Mark 4:28 says,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“First the blade, then the ear,
after that the full corn in the ear.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Many people are impatient, wanting to
bypass the growth cycle and get the full ear right now. I’ve actually had to
tell people that what they were believing God for was not going to happen, not
because the vision wasn’t good, but because they were expecting a complete ear
of corn immediately.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>For example, one of our Charis Bible
College students came to me who had never held a job, had been in a mental
hospital, and had lived on welfare his whole life. When he heard the teaching
on prosperity and vision, he started dreaming big. He had a plan to buy and
renovate an old hotel. The total cost would be over four million dollars.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>It really was a grand plan. I
complimented him for the fact that he was dreaming and told him to keep
dreaming big. Then I told him that it might work for someone but it wouldn’t
work for him. Why? Because this person had never believed for a dime before.
There has to be </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“first the
blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>You may think that’s not so. It’s
possible that he could have won the lottery or the </span><em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'>Publisher’s Clearing House Sweepstakes.</span></em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> It’s possible, but that wouldn’t have been
God. God’s kingdom operates on laws, like the laws that govern the fruit-bearing
process of a seed. <u>God will not give you the full ear of corn if you haven’t
seen the first blade</u>.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>That’s the way God’s kingdom works.
And <strong>this is precisely the reason most people don’t see God’s best come
to pass in their lives</strong>. They think that since God loves them, He will
just grant their request regardless of whether they put the miracle of the seed
to work or not.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Look at what happened after Jesus
taught His disciples these principles of the seed.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Mark 4:35 says,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“And the same day, when the even
was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>In a sense, Jesus was giving them a
test. On the same day that He taught them the principles of God’s Word as a
seed, He gave them a seed. He said, </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:
10.5pt'>“Let us pass over unto the other side.”</span></em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'> He didn’t say, “Let us go halfway across and drown.”
The disciples had a seed from the lips of the Creator that gave them authority
over the creation.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>What happened? A two-hour trip turned
into a fight for the disciples’ lives. Instead of using the seed the Lord had
given them, they did all they knew to do in the natural and then got put out
with the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>They said in verse 38,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“Master, carest thou not that we
perish?”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This wasn’t a cabin cruiser. Jesus
was in an open boat full of water (verse 37) sloshing all around Him. He was
well aware of their plight and yet was trying to sleep. They wanted Him to pick
up a bucket and bail or row or do something.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>How did Jesus respond? Did He
apologize and say, “I’m sorry guys. I was really tired”? No!</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Instead He said, </span><em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have
no faith?”</span></em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> (verse 40).</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Jesus was telling them that they
should have stilled the storm. <u>If they would have operated in faith instead
of fear, that’s exactly what they could have done</u>.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The Lord did His job by giving
them the seed of His Word.</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>
Their job was to take the seed and make it work. Instead, they doubted Jesus’
love for them and thought He wasn’t pulling His weight. Likewise, we often
complain to the Lord, “Don’t You love me? Why aren’t You healing me or
prospering me, etc.?”</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>God has done His part; He has given
us the Word. For example, the Lord doesn’t give us money directly. Deuteronomy
8:18 says that the Lord gives us the power to get wealth. <strong>The power is
in His promises, His Word.</strong> As we plant those promises in our hearts,
the truth of His Word germinates and prosperity comes.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Healing operates the same way. There
are numerous scriptures that get the point across that God’s Word is health to
all our flesh. Here’s two:</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“For they are life unto those
that find them, and health to all their flesh”</span></em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'> (Prov. 4:22).</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“He sent his word, and healed
them, and delivered them from their destructions” </span></em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'>(Ps. 107:20).</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Yes, a person can get healed without
planting God’s Word in their heart. It comes through the prayers of others with
the gifts of healing (1 Cor. 12:9), but it is not God’s best. We should never
be too proud to ask for help, but <u>the proper way to get healed is to take
God’s promises of healing and plant them in our hearts until they release their
life-giving power into our physical bodies</u>.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This law of seedtime and
harvest operates in every area of our lives.</span></strong><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'> If we will plant God’s Word in our hearts, then allow
the seed to germinate and the plant to grow to maturity, we will reap the fruit
of a harvest. That is God’s best!</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>I cannot tell you strongly
enough how important it is that you know God’s Word and that you plant the seed
of His Word</span></strong><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> in your
heart long before you need the fruit of the harvest. <strong>It could mean the
difference between prosperity and poverty, or even life and death. </strong>I
believe this is so important that it’s the very first class I teach to new
students at CBC every year.</span></p>

<p><u><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>My teaching series </span></u><em><u><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>A Sure Foundation</span></u></em><u><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> will help you understand the power and
importance of God’s Word in your life. It will help you go beyond the
“touchy-feely,” emotion-based thinking that many mistake for faith. It’s not
about what you feel; it’s about what has been planted in your heart and come to
full fruit. It’s the foundation to receiving the promises of God</span></u><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>So, make this year your personal <strong>Year
of the Bible</strong> and build a sure foundation in your own life. It will be
the best decision you have ever made.</span></p>

style='border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in'>The War is Over
(Andrew&nbsp;Wommack)</span></a></span></h1>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Did you know that most Christians
still believe their relationship with God is dependent on their performance?
They believe answered prayers and God’s blessing in their lives are in direct
proportion to their holiness and ability to overcome sin. If they attend
church, pay their tithes, read their Bibles, and control their flesh, they have
somehow earned the blessing of God.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>That may sound reasonable at first,
but that line of thinking will destroy your confidence in God and couldn’t be
further from the truth. The truth is, sin isn’t even an issue with God. That
may seem like a radical statement, but it is exactly what the Word teaches.
Romans 3:4 says,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“Yea, let God be true, but every
man a liar.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>When Jesus came on the scene, one of
the first things He had to do was counter all the religious traditions and
doctrines of His day. Paul recognized the same problem. He said in Romans
10:2-3,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“For I bear them record that they
have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of
God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have
not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Just because people are zealous or
religious does not mean what they believe is correct. One of the most
misunderstood doctrines in the Bible is what really happened when Jesus came to
earth, fulfilled the Law, and was sacrificed for our sins. When He said in John
19:30 </span><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“It is finished,”</span></em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> everything changed.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Jesus forever changed the way God
relates to mankind. Sure, there are scriptural examples of God’s catastrophic
judgment on sin. But God’s greatest act of judgment was when He placed His
entire wrath upon Jesus for our sins. This forever satisfied God’s wrath. Since
that time, God hasn’t been judging our sins (2 Cor. 5:19). God’s not angry with
us; He’s not even in a bad mood.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Look at the angels’ joy at the birth
of Jesus in Bethlehem. Luke 2:13-14 says,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“And suddenly there was with the
angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>This scripture is very familiar to
many, yet there is a lot of misunderstanding about what it’s saying. Some
translations say they were proclaiming “good will among men” or “peace to men
of good will.” Basically, this passage has been interpreted that Jesus was
bringing peace on earth among people. But that’s not why these angels were
praising God. If that interpretation were true, then Jesus’ own words in
Matthew 10:34-36 would contradict this. He said,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“Think not that I am come to send
peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a
man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and
the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man’s foes shall be they
of his own household.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Jesus Himself said He was not sent to
bring peace on the earth among people. The peace that the angels were praising
God for (Luke 2:13-14) was peace BETWEEN God and man. They were announcing the
end of God’s war on sin. Peace now reigns between God and man.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Prior to Jesus’ coming, God’s wrath
was against man for his sins. It wasn’t total wrath. Even in the Old Testament,
we see God’s mercy and grace. Yet the Old Testament Law was a ministry of wrath
(Rom. 4:15; 2 Cor. 3:7, and 9), and man’s sins were held against him. But when
Jesus came, God quit holding man’s sins against him. This is exactly what 2
Corinthians 5:19 and 21 say,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“To wit, that God was in Christ,
reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them;
and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation…For he hath made him to
be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God
in him.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>The word “reconciliation” is talking
about making peace. God was no longer holding us accountable. Instead, He
imputed our sins to Jesus, making Jesus accountable for our sins. Jesus became
what we were so we could become what He was—the righteousness of God.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Jesus was like a lightning rod that
drew all the judgment of God unto Himself. He not only bore our sins; He
actually became sin (2 Cor. 5:21). Jesus said in John 12:27-32:</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“Now is my soul troubled; and
what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I
unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people
therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An
angel spake to him. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me,
but for your sakes. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of
this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
men unto me.”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Many have thought John 12:32 means
that if God is properly glorified in our preaching, then He will draw all
people to Himself. But that is not what this scripture is saying.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>If you look in the </span><em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>King James Version</span></em><span lang=EN
style='font-size:10.5pt'>, notice that the word “men” in verse 32 is
italicized. That means it wasn’t in the original language. The translators put
this word in italics to let people know this was their addition, but it wasn’t
a part of the text. If you take this verse in context, I believe the Lord was
saying that He would draw all JUDGMENT to Himself. Jesus, like a lightning rod,
attracted all of God’s judgment for all of mankind’s sins for all time unto
Himself.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>All the murder, all the perversion,
every vile and rotten sin imaginable, all sickness, and all disease ever known
to mankind actually entered into His physical human body. Isaiah 52:14 talks
about the crucifixion of Jesus and says that He was marred more than any man,
to the point that He was unrecognizable as a human being.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>That could not have happened just
from physical beatings, especially since the Word says that not a single bone
was broken in His body (Ps. 34:20 with John 19:36). I believe His body was
completely disfigured from cancers, tumors, diseases, deformities, and anything
else that human beings have ever suffered.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Jesus didn’t ask for the cup to be
taken from Him just because of the physical pain He would suffer, but because
He did not want to become sin. He hated becoming what He came to redeem us
from. And the worst of all Jesus’ sufferings was total rejection from His
Father. Matthew 27:46 says,</span></p>

<p><em><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>“And about the ninth hour Jesus
cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”</span></em></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>God the Father forsook Jesus so that
you and I would never be forsaken. All that we would have suffered through
billions of years in eternity—the grief, the pain, and worst of all, the
complete separation from the presence of God—Jesus experienced. And He
experienced all of this for us. The judgment was made and the sentence carried
out. The price was paid in full, once for all.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>When we say God is still judging us
for our sins as individuals or corporately as a nation, we are saying that the
price Jesus paid wasn’t enough. Therefore, a judgment must again be made and a
sentence passed. That would be “double jeopardy,” and that is not what the
Bible teaches.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>Some of you may not like this, but
it’s true. Sin isn’t a problem with God anymore. It’s the church that has made
it a major deal. Neither past, present, nor future sins can separate us from
God. The only people who will go to hell are those who have spurned and
rejected the greatest sacrifice that has ever been made. In heaven, we won’t
answer for our individual sins; Jesus already has. We will answer for our
acceptance or rejection of Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>You might now be thinking, </span><em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>You’re just giving people a license to sin.</span></em><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'> Well, it seems to me that people are doing a
pretty good job of that without a license. What I’m saying will not free you to
sin; it will free you from the condemnation and the guilt that comes when you
do sin.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.5pt'>To continue in sin is just stupid.
You’ll be opening the door for Satan to have an inroad into your life (Rom.
6:16). If you sin, you will suffer the natural consequences of it, but it will
not be because of the judgment of God.</span></p>
