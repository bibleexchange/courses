Both are revelations of the outpouring of the Spirit of God.&nbsp; Pentecost is the time when the earnest of the Spirit was poured out (Eph 1:14; 2 Cor 1:22 and 5:5).&nbsp; The Jubilee signifies a greater outpouring, that is, the fullness of the Spirit.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Thus, while Pentecost is a down payment of a Jubilee, or the promise of a Jubilee, both are depicted by the number 50.&nbsp; The barley is valued at 50 shekels of silver, and this associates the barley with the outpouring of the Spirit, both in its earnest and its fullness.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This is consistent with the revelation of the overcomers who attain to the firsts resurrection; or, if they are alive at the end of the age, their &ldquo;change&rdquo; (transfiguration) without dying.&nbsp; It is also consistent with the revelation of the &ldquo;unleavened bread&rdquo; at Passover and the flax (white linen &ndash; of righteousness) ripening at the same time, which is used in the priestly garments.&nbsp; All of these details point to the fact that the barley company is raised first among God&rsquo;s creatures.&nbsp; James 1:18 says,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Of His own will begat He us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures (&ldquo;creation&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the book of Revelation, we are told of the 144,000 who sing a new song before the throne of God.&nbsp;

(Judges 6:8-10)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When Gideon finally mustered his army of 300 against the host of the Midianites, he wanted confirmation that this was not just his own carnal plan.&nbsp; After all, the situation seemed hopeless.&nbsp; So God told him to spy out the enemy camp to receive his confirmation.&nbsp; Judges 7:13,13 says,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, </span><span class="cs79659084">a cake of barley bread</span><span class="csA7555675"> tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And his fellow answered and said, this is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; for into his hand hath God delivered Midian and all the host.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Thus, Gideon and his army represent the barley company, the overcomers who will inherit the promise of God at the end of this present age.&nbsp; The manner in which Gideon&rsquo;s army defeated the enemy tells us how the overcomers of today will receive the promise.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Each of the men in Gideon&rsquo;s army was given a trumpet and a torch inside an earthen jar, or pitcher.&nbsp; With little oxygen in the jar, the torches could only glow.&nbsp; At the signal, they blew their trumpets and broke the jars, holding up the torches in the air, causing them to burst into flames.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The trumpet signifies the first resurrection of the dead at the Feast of Trumpets.&nbsp; The torches within the pitchers signify the presence of God in our bodies, which are the earthen vessels.&nbsp; At the appointed time, after blowing the trumpet for the first resurrection, these bodies of death will be broken, and the glory of God will burst into view, even as Jesus was transfigured before His disciples.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When Paul was expounding upon the transfiguration of Moses (2 Cor 3 &amp; 4), he made reference to this battle of Gideon by saying in 2 Cor 4:6,7:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But </span><span class="csC57700C4">we have this treasure in earthen vessels</span><span class="csA7555675">, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">Elisha Overcomes Death with Barley</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Barley is a hardy plant that can withstand drought and extreme heat and cold.&nbsp; So when the Scriptures talk of grain or meal in time of drought, it generally refers to barley, for wheat cannot grow under such severe conditions.&nbsp; In this way barley is a very good symbol of the overcomer, who will flourish in &ldquo;times of drought&rdquo; in between revivals when the Spirit of God does not appear to be moving.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In contrast, the wheat company languishes when God seems to hide His face for a time.&nbsp; Like Israel under Moses, they tested God by saying, &ldquo;Is the Lord among us or not?&rdquo; (Ex 17:7)&nbsp; They do not understand that our faith is not tested while God is moving miraculously, but in those times when He is silent.&nbsp; Thus, in the time of drought, the wheat dies.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There was a drought in the days of Elisha that teaches us more about the spiritual principles of barley.&nbsp; 2 Kings 4:38-41 says,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a dearth (drought) in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, O thou man of God, there is DEATH in the pot.&nbsp; And they could not eat thereof.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But He said, Then bring MEAL.&nbsp; And he (Elisha) cast it into the pot, and he said, Pour out for the people that they may eat.&nbsp; And he cast it into the pot, and he said, Pour out for the people that they may eat.&nbsp; And there was no harm in the pot.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Since this event occurred in a time of drought, the &ldquo;meal&rdquo; which they used was no doubt BARLEY.&nbsp; (Wheat cannot withstand drought.)&nbsp; And so the barley was used to </span><span class="csC57700C4">overcome death.</span><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp; It pictures resurrection of the dead.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">Jesus Feeds the Multitude with </span><span class="cs79659084">Barley</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In John, Chapter 6, Jesus fed the multitude with &ldquo;five barley loaves and two small fishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; (John 6:9)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Vs 12&nbsp; When they were filled, He said unto His disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, </span><span class="cs79659084">that nothing be lost!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves that remained over and above them that had eaten.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The overcomers will inherit the first resurrection.&nbsp; But first, they are the barley bread in Jesus&rsquo; hands that must be broken to feed the multitude.&nbsp; It is not time to be victorious yet.&nbsp; It is the time to die.&nbsp; It is not yet time to enjoy a good reputation among the brethren, but to be made &ldquo;of no reputation&rdquo;&nbsp; (Phil 2:7), following the path Jesus trod.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The barley call is not only a call to righteousness, but to brokenness.&nbsp; It is not a call, as yet, to victory, but to the despair of death.&nbsp; It is not a call to the throne, but to the dungeon and the wilderness.&nbsp; And when all self-righteousness is gone, when all impatience has run its course, then is death conquered by Life!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
