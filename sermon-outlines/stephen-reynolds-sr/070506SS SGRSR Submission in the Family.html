We believe him. This is not a mere mental assent, but we must BELIEVE Him in order to receive it. If God gives me something by faith, can I now act anyway that I want? What do we have to do with this flesh. We must crucify this flesh. Humble ourselves. V. 9 Be afflicted. How many know how to afflict your soul properly? Crucifying the flesh properly without becoming a nervous wreck. We cannot meet the requirements on our own strength. I must lose my mind at the cross! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We are praying and asking God for direction.

His requests are requirements. If you try to do what Hosea did you will end up in big trouble.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How difficult is it for a husband to submit to his wife? Always doing what she wants? That is frustrating. We need to learn </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">submission to God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. In submitting to God, we find our place.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB3CD4B93"><span class="cs91EF8B52">HUSBANDS</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: Remember, whether it is true or not or makes sense or not, the fact is what your wives are FEELING is VERY REAL to them. You can talk and talk and what she feels will not change until certain things are done. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Hosea 1:2</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea.

God is not just saying go get you a girlfriend, but he is saying a wife, this is the one you are going to be with for the rest of your life! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is something in our heart and spirit that must be there to help the destitute and see to it that they are saved and stay saved.

We need to have a great faith in God. Thank God for men of faith wisdom and example, but let&rsquo;s be attached to the Lord. This same rule applies to Husband and wife. Paul said, &ldquo;Live as though you were not.&rdquo; There is a place where we can be strength to her. When was the last time you held your wife&rsquo;s hand? Kissed her? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Bro.
