All the tribes must go up together. &nbsp;It is a kind law that enjoins social worship; we need each other to stimulate. &nbsp;&quot;O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.&quot; &nbsp;God has made us so that we shall be greatly influenced by each other, both to good and evil. &nbsp;It greatly concerns us to cultivate such a spirit. &nbsp;To this end we must cherish an affectionate behaviour in our common intercourse -- bear, forbear, and forgive; and, whatever differences we may have, not suffer them to hinder our worship. &nbsp;The tribes, as we have seen, had their differences; yet they were there. When all Israel met at Hebron to anoint David king, what should we have said if some had kept away because others went? 3. &nbsp;Our business, when assembled, </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

There she would be chained to the wall with a leg iron. Appalled by what he saw, he instead prepared a private, two-room apartment for her in the basement of Scotchtown.

			<span class="csBC47F217">Why Was The Declaration of Independence Written?</span></h3>
		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csC05134DD">Our original thirteen colonies used to be ruled by Britain, even though they were thousands of miles apart. They became increasingly unhappy with the King George III&rsquo;s rule and wanted to break away and form their own self-governing nation.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csC05134DD">The purpose of the Declaration was to declare the colonies free and independent of Britain&#39;s oppressive and deadly rule over them. The colonies had no say in their own government. A common protest at the time was against &quot;Taxation without representation&quot;.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csC05134DD">The Declaration&#39;s text includes familiar lines we&rsquo;ve heard, &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csC05134DD">But further down in the document are the accusations against the King of Britain, describing why the colonies wanted to break free from Britain. These probably aren&rsquo;t so well known as the rest of the text of the Declaration, but they are a fascinating peek into what the early colonists endured and fought for us all to be free from.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csC05134DD">They noted such acts as the King sending people to harass the colonists and eat all their food, protecting his military troops from murders they committed against the people of the colonies, cutting off trade between the states and the rest of the world, destroying the lives of their people, unfair taxation, and much more, all documented in the text of the Declaration.</span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csBC47F217">Why do we Celebrate Independence Day?</span></h3>
		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csC05134DD">If there had been no independence from Britain, we would still be ruled by them today. Things might be just as bad -- or even worse -- than they were back then. The original colonists endured a lot of hardship and tragedy while under British rule. They suffered even more hardship and loss during the Revolutionary War, fighting for an independence they believed in and wanted for us so strongly.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csC05134DD">We celebrate Independence Day to remember that our freedom today was the heartfelt dream of men more than 200 years ago and came at no small cost.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
