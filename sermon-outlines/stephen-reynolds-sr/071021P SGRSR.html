But I can say from the grace of God and knowing from the past and the Word established in our heart no matter how dark the day or difficult the task one day we are going to be with Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The worst and hardest times are probably ahead of us. If we trust him when it is done we will be able to look back on the day and rejoice in the glorious things He has done. I see a shallowness in their voice in verse 17. There was not the heart reflection of the greatness of God that could have been done in their lives. There is no indication tha the people really received what He was doing. People here grasping and holding onto things that they love more than God. Don&rsquo;t just let the rejoicing be a feeling of the moment. Be ready. Do everything you can to say that Jesus Christ is Lord, Saviour, Healer.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must not be caught up with the negative.

He will save and he will hear but then as you look there you will see in this case things have gone to a different Level&mdash;God has not changed---people have changed! They have gone to a different level and lost faith in the things of God. It is our responsibility, that understand the things of God to know when the Lord touches a soul, immediately it is strengthened.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;1Behold, the LORD&#39;S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;2 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sin has caused the problem in people&rsquo;s lives. The problem is not God ear being deaf for He can hear and will hear. Psalm 34 &ndash;this poor man cried&hellip;! God will hear, can hear. The problem is men hold onto their sin and while they desire sin it keeps them blinded, deaf, bound in a condition that they don&rsquo;t believe that God hears them. God WILL hear the cry from the repentant heart. DAVID KNEW GOD HEARD HIM. All the struggle was in his own heart---God won&rsquo;t hear me, save me, deliver me. GOD&rdquo;S HAND IS NOT SHORT&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">None of us are beyond change if we just neglect the power that God has given us.

God can do it. As long as we please, obey, praise Him He is going to work and make our adversary to be ashamed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As you surrender to the Lord, You must reach out to the souls of men that don&rsquo;t understand true salvation.
