so the first religious talk of converted men must always be in figures. Not the
epistles of Paul, which are mostly doctrinal, but the words of Jesus, must
first be applied to the sinner, before he is enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
and understands the mysteries of the kingdom. And I believe I have hit upon the
reason why our Master used this figure, and talked to Nicodemus with metaphor
after metaphor, and figure after figure, because the root of all language must
be in figures.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But some will have
it that the preaching of the cross not only cannot save, but will increase the
evil. Old physicians tell us that brass was the most likely thing in the world
to make people die the quicker; the sight of anything that is bright would have
the effect of making the poison yet more strong in its effects, so that it
would be death at once to look upon brass. And yet strange to say, to look at
the brazen serpent saved them. &quot;Now,&quot; says the infidel, &quot;I
cannot see how men are to be saved from sin by the preaching of Christ.&quot;
&quot;Truly, sir,&quot; he says, &quot;you go and tell men that though they
have sinned never so much, if they do but believe, their sins shall all be
washed away! Why they will take advantage of that, and they will be more wicked
than ever they were. You tell men that their good works are of no avail
whatever, that they must rest on Christ alone!&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; says the
sceptic, &quot;my dear fellow, it will be the destruction of all morality;
instead of a cure, it will be a death. Why preach it?&quot; Ah, the preaching
of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved, it
is Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. I cannot, myself, but admit,
that at first sight the brazen serpent seems to be the most absurd invention,
in itself, for curing those who were bitten, that ever mind of man could have
invented; and yet I see in the brazen serpent, when I come to study it, the
highest wisdom that even God himself could develop. I grant you that the cross
of Christ also does in its outward appearance seem to be the simplicity of
simplicities; something which any one might have thought of, but which would
have been beneath their thought. But when you come to study and understand the
marvellous scheme of God's justice vindicated, and man pardoned through the
atoning blood of the cross, I say, that not even the mighty intellect of God
could have conceived a wiser plan, than the wisdom of God displayed in Christ
Jesus crucified.<br>

much as those who heard of the brazen serpent might have despised it, yet there
was no other means of cure. And, now hear me for one moment, while I tell the
whole story of salvation. Men, brethren, and fathers, we are born of a sinful
generation, and we have ourselves increased our guilt, for us there is no hope;
do what we may, we cannot save ourselves. </span></p>

there is a kind of heavenly influence poured forth from vestments when well
worn; and that to see the priest discharge his functions in a holy and reverent
manner, is a most excellent way of impressing souls. They will have us believe
that holly at Christmas time is a most heavenly and spiritual thing. They teach
us that our passions will be carried to heaven by these little sprigs of green;

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>IV. And now, dear
friends, I have almost concluded; but I have come to that part of the discourse
which needs most of power. WHAT WERE ISRAEL TO DO? What are convinced sinners
to do? The Israelites were to look; the convinced sinner must believe. Do you
picture Moses with his reverend head standing erect, and boldly crying out with
all his might—&quot; Look, look, look!&quot; Do you see him, as with his right
hand he grasps the pole, and lifts it up, and marches with it through the camp
like a great standard-bearer, pointing with his finger, and speaking with hand,
and eye, and lip, and foot, and every part of the body, as he passionately bids
poor bitten Israel to look? You can, perhaps, conceive the scene as men roll
over one another, and the dying and almost dead behold the brazen serpent. and
begin to live. Now note, there may be some in the camp who would not look; they
obstinately shut their eyes, and when the pole was brought near them they would
not look. Perhaps it was through unbelief; they said, &quot;What was the use of
it? it could do them no good!&quot; There is the wretch, the pole is before
him, and yet he will not look. Well what will become of him? Oh, the
death-pangs are upon him; see how death is twitching him! How his flesh seems
to writhe in agony! He has shut his eyes with all the force and passion he can
command, lest they should be opened on that brazen serpent, and he should live
I Ah! my hearer, and I have such an one here to-day. I have many here who will
not come to Christ that they may be saved—men, who when the gospel is preached
to them resist it, despise it, and reject it. Though the reception of the
gospel be all of grace, yet the rejection of it is all of man. And I have some
here who have often been touched in their con science; they have often been
moved to believe, but they have been desperately set on mischief, and they
would not come to Christ. Ah, sinner, thou little knowest how direful thy doom
shall be. Thou mayest this day tell me thou dost not believe on the Saviour;
thou mayest turn away thine ear from the warning, and say, &quot;What need to
make so great a noise about it? I would rather die than believe; for I do not
think that Christ can save! What good is there in it?&quot; Ah, sir, you may
reject me; but remember there is a greater preacher than I am coming to you
soon. He with a skeleton arm, and bony finger, and cold speech, he will freeze,
and yet convince! It is one called Death! Look me in the face to-day; and tell
me I preach you a lie—you can do that easily! Look death in the face to-morrow,
and tell him that, and you will find it harder work. Ay, and if you have the
fool-hardiness to do that, you will not look at the face of the Great Judge,
when he shall sit upon the throne, and tell him that his gospel was not true;
for affrighted and alarmed, you shall rush hither and thither to hide
yourselves from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne. Perhaps there
were some in the camp who said they would look by-and-by. &quot;Oh,&quot; said
they, &quot;there is no need to look now; the venom has not yet worked its
effects: we are not yet dead; a little longer!&quot; And ere they uttered the
last word they were stiff and clay-cold! How many do the same? They will not be
religious yet; another day, another hour. They believe they can be pious when
they like, which is a fallacy; and therefore they will postpone the matter as
long as they may. How many have postponed the day of salvation, until the day
of damnation has come, before they had repented! Oh, how' many have said,
&quot;A little sleep, a little folding of the hands!&quot; and they have been
like men on shipboard, when the ship was foundering, who would not escape while
they might, but still tarried on deck; at last a sea swallowed them, and they
went down alive into the depths. Take heed of procrastination; delays are
dangerous, and some delays are damnable! Look hither, look hither to Christ
bleeding on cross. Look now, for the Spirit saith, <i>&quot;to-day:</i> if ye
will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the day of provocation.&quot;<br>

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I doubt not, there
were some there who tried physicians: &quot;Look at the brazen serpent?&quot;
said they, &quot;not we. Doctor, come hither, bring your balsam; can you not
take the caustic and burn out this poison from my arm, and then pour in some
cordial that will save me? Physician, have you no antidote that might cool my
blood? Ah. I laugh at that brazen serpent; I will not look at it; I trust to
your skill. O learned physician!&quot; And how many now do the same? They say,
&quot;I will not believe in Christ; I will try and do better; I will reform myself,
I will attend to all the ceremonies of the church. Can I not help myself, and
so improve myself that I shall have no need of Jesus?&quot; Ah, ye may try; ye
may lay that flattering unction to your souls, and film the ulcerous wound, but
all the while dark corruption shall sleep within, and shall at last break out
in sore flames upon thee; when thou shalt have no time to attempt a cure, but
shalt be swept away—not to the hospital of mercy, but like the leper, without
the city, thou shalt be cast away from hope of blessedness.<br>

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It may be there
were some who were so busy looking at their sores, that they did not think of
looking at the serpent. Poor creatures, they lay in their misery, and kept
looking first at that wound on the foot, and then at that one on the hand; and
crying over their sores, and never looked at the serpent. Scores and hundreds
perish in that way. ' Oh,&quot; says the sinner, &quot;I have been so
sinful!&quot; Man, what has that to do with it? Christ is all meritorious, look
at him. &quot;No, no,&quot; says another, &quot;I cannot look at Christ. Oh,
sir, you do not know what crimes I have committed; I have been a drunkard, I
have been a swearer, I have been a whore-monger, or what not; how can I be
saved!&quot; My dear man, your wounds have nothing to do with it: it is just
Christ on the cross. If any poor creature, bitten by the serpent, had said to
me—&quot; Now it is no good my looking there; see how often I have been bitten;
there is a huge serpent twisting round my loins, there is another devouring my
hand, how can I live?&quot; I should say to him, &quot;My dear fellow, do not
take any notice whether you have got one serpent or fifty serpents, one bite or
fifty bites; all you have to do is to look. You have nothing to do with these
bites, except that you have to feel them, and perish by them unless you look.
But just look straight to Christ.&quot; And now thou chief of sinners, believe
in the Lord Jesus; and be thy sins never so many, he is able to save unto the
uttermost, them that come unto God by him. And yet how many perish through those
divers delusions, with the gospel before their very eyes, lifted up on the pole
so plainly that we wonder they do not see it.<br>

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And now I must
tell you one or two sweet things for the encouragement of the poor sinner. Oh,
you that are guilty this morning, and know that you are so, let me say to you,
&quot;Look to Christ.&quot; For remember the brazen serpent was lifted up, that
every one in the camp who was bitten might live; and now Christ is lifted up to
you, that &quot;whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal
life.&quot; Sinner, the devil says you are shut out; tell him that
&quot;whosoever&quot; shuts out none. Oh that precious word,
&quot;whosoever.&quot; Poor soul, I see thee clutch at it and say, &quot;Then,
Sir, if I believe, he will not cast me away.&quot; I see the harlot in all her
guilt bemoaning her iniquity; she says it is impossible that Christ should
save. But she hears it said, &quot;Whosoever,&quot; and she looks and lives!
Remember, it mattered not how old they were, nor how much bitten they were, nor
whereabouts in the camp they lived; they did but look and live. And now ye that
have grown grey in iniquity, whose hairs might rather be black than white, if
they showed forth your character, for it has been blackened by years of vice.
Remember there is the same Christ for big sinners as for little sinners; the
same Christ for grey heads as for babes; the same Christ for poor as for rich;
the same Christ for chimney sweeps as for monarchs; the same Christ for
prostitutes as for saints: &quot;Whosoever.&quot; I use broad words that I may
take a broad range, and sweep the whole universe of sinners through—whosoever
looketh to Christ shall live. And remember it does not say that if they looked
but little they should not live. Perhaps there was some of them so bitten that
their eyelids were swollen and they could scarcely see. Old Christopher Ness
says, &quot;There may have been some of them that had so little sight that they
could but squint from one eye.&quot; Says he, in his strange language, &quot;If
they did but dart a little glance at the brazen serpent, they lived.&quot; And
you who say you cannot believe; if God gives you only half a grain of faith,
that will carry you to heaven. If you can only say, &quot;O Lord, I would
believe, help thou mine unbelief;&quot; if you can but put out your hand with
Simon Peter, and say, &quot;Lord save, or I perish,&quot; it is enough. If you
can only pray that poor publican's prayer—&quot; God be merciful to me a
sinner,&quot; that will do. And if you cannot sing with some of the old
experienced saints— </span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
now poor soul I have almost done. But I cannot let thee go. I see thee with the
tear in thine eye; I hear thee confessing thy guilt, and bemoaning thy sin; I
bid thee look to my Master and live. Be not afraid to try my Lord and Master. I
know what thy bashfulness is; I have felt the same, and thought he never would
save me. Come soul, thou art in secret now with thyself; for though there be
thou sands around thee, thou thinkest I am speaking alone to thee. And so I am.
My brother, my sister, you are weeping to-day on account of sin—look to Jesus.
And for your encouragement note these three things. Note first that Jesus
Christ was put on the cross on purpose for you to look at. The only reason why
he died, was that poor sinners might look at him and be saved. Now, my dear
brethren, if that was Christ's purpose in being hung on the tree, you need not
think you may not do it. If God sends a river, and sends it for us to drink of,
will you disappoint him in not drinking? No, rather you will say. &quot;Did he
design me to drink it? Then will I drink it.&quot; Now, Jesus hung on the cross
on purpose to be looked at. Look at him, look at him, and live. Remember again
for your encouragement, he asks you to look; he invites you to believe; he has
sent his minister this day, even to command you to do it; he has said to me,
&quot;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature; he that
believeth and is baptized, shall be saved.&quot; Now I need not simply say that
my Master's door is wide open for you; I will say something more: he has told
me to ask you to come in. Wisdom crieth aloud, she uttereth her voice in the
streets, she inviteth you; she saith, &quot;My oxen and my fatlings are killed,
all things are ready, come ye to the supper.&quot; Yea, my Master has given
instructions to his Holy Spirit that if men will not come of themselves, he
should compel them to come in that his house may be filled. Then, poor sinner,
you must be welcome, he will have enough sinners to fill his table; and if he
has made you feel your sinnership—come and welcome, sinner, come. And my last
encouragement is this: Come to my Master and try him, because he promises to
save you. The promises of Jesus Christ are all of them as good as oaths; they
never fail. He says—&quot;Whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have
everlasting life.&quot; Now, if I had here a man who declared himself to be the
vilest wretch on earth, I would say to him—Young man, I am very fond of proving
the truthfulness of God's promises; now God says, if you believe you shall not
perish. My dear friend, when a common sinner tries, and it does not fail, it is
some proof of its truthful ness: but you are an extraordinary sinner. Now, thou
extraordinary sinner, venture thyself on this promise; he says thou shalt not
perish; come and try him. And remember, God must undeify himself, and cease to
be true, before he can ever damn a sinner who has believed in Christ. Come risk
it, thou who art so laden with sin that thou staggerest under thy burden; fall
down on the simple promise, &quot;He is able to save to the uttermost.&quot;
Just cast thyself wholly on Christ, and if thou art not saved, God's book is a
lie, and God himself has broken his truth. But that cannot be. Come thou and
try it. &quot;Whosoever believeth in Christ shall not perish, but have
everlasting life.&quot;</span></p>
