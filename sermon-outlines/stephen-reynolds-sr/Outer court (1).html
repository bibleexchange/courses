These linen curtains were suspended from sixty pillars, twenty of which stood on the south side, twenty on the north, ten on the west, and ten on the east. The Scriptures do not expressly state of what these pillars were made, but there is good reason to conclude they were of shittim wood. This open space, in which the priestly compartments and the dwelling-place of Jehovah stood, formed the third division of the Tabernacle as a whole, and was designated &quot;the Court.&quot; The Court was in form a parallelogram, or double square, being twice the length of its breadth. On its eastern side was a gate or entrance, which was also made of fine linen, but rendered attractive by the same beautiful colors which were wrought into the Veil.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is striking to note that neither the Court nor the Holy Places were paved. The Tabernacle rested upon </span><span class="csA657E9A2">the bare sand of the desert</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. This was in significant contrast from its golden-sheeted sides and beautiful inner ceiling. Thus, more than a hint was given for the priests to look up, where all was glorious and gorgeous, and tells us that there is nothing down here to satisfy the heart. In striking contrast from the Tabernacle we read of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple that &quot;the floor of the House he overlaid with gold, without and within&quot; (1 Kings 6:30), foreshadowing the blessed fact that in the Millennium this world will no longer be a wilderness to God&rsquo;s people; for when Christ is present in it again, then shall be fulfilled that word, &quot;As truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord&quot; (Num. 14:21).</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Immediately around the Court of the Tabernacle were the tents of the Levites; beyond, but encircling them, were grouped the twelve Tribes, three on either side; thus forming a square of vast extent. Consequently, even the Court itself was thoroughly screened from the eyes of the wilderness nomads. The Tabernacle therefore formed the center of Israel&rsquo;s camp. Outside the Tent, a fire was kept constantly burning, on which the bodies of the sin-offerings were consumed, and where the refuse was destroyed. In contemplating the Court, let us notice:</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. Its Hangings.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of a hundred cubits long for one side&quot; (v. 9). As we have before pointed out, the &quot;fine linen&quot; is the emblem of righteousnesses (Rev. 19:8). The spotless white walls which surrounded the Tabernacle on every side were a standing witness to the holiness of Him whose dwelling it was. This was in striking contrast from the unholiness of those who inhabited the surrounding tents, which were made, most probably, from goats&rsquo; hair, of a very dark color. There is a reference to this in Song of Solomon 1:5: &quot;I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem; as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon&quot;: black as the tents of Kedar, comely as the curtains of Solomon. The dark-colored cloth woven from goats&rsquo; hair is commonly used for making tents in the East to this day. There would be, then, a most vivid contrast between the white linen surrounding Jehovah&rsquo;s dwelling-place and the dark fabric of the Israelites&rsquo; tents.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The white walls of the Tabernacle&rsquo;s Court served both as a barrier and a protection. To those without, the holiness, of which it spoke, was an exclusion to all who would approach the Divine Courts otherwise than as God Himself had ordered. To those within, it served as a shield, a shelter, an adornment, a glory, a defense. It was the thought of these spotless curtains around the sacred precincts, in which stood the atoning altar and the cleansing laver, which moved David to sing, &quot;How amiable are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth, for the courts of the Lord&quot; (Ps. 84:1, 2).</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. Its Pillars.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These were sixty in number, placed at intervals of five cubits all around the Court. </span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The material from which they were made is not expressly stated. The words of v. 10, &quot;and the twenty pillars thereof (i.e., of the south side) and their twenty sockets shall be of brass,&quot; have led some to conclude that the pillars themselves were made of brass; but it is to be noted that the words &quot;shall be&quot; are supplied by the translators, there being no verb in the original&mdash;the modifying clause &quot;of brass&quot; referring only to the &quot;sockets.&quot; That the columns themselves were not made of brass seems clear from their omission in Exodus 38:29-31. Nor were they made of silver, for that metal was only used in the foundations and in the upper ornamental parts; whilst gold was employed in covering boards in the Tabernacle and in the construction of certain vessels inside, but was not found at all in the Court.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We believe that these &quot;pillars&quot; were made of shittim wood, and that, for three reasons. First, the other &quot;pillars,&quot; i.e., those used for the door and for the support of the Veil (26:32, 37) were of wood, therefore in the absence of any word to the contrary here, we naturally conclude that these also were made of the same material. </span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Second, because from a careful comparison of the twenty-nine talents of gold (Ex. 38:24), the hundred talents of silver (Ex. 38:25, 27). and the seventy talents of brass (Ex. 38:29 with the sizes of the different vessels and the amount of metals required for them, it seems clear that they would not leave sufficient to make sixty pillars for the Court out of the remainder. Third, the typical meaning of the Court requires &quot;wood&quot; rather than one of the metals.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A &quot;pillar&quot; speaks of support and strength. The sixty which were stationed around the sides of the Court sustained the white curtains. There is a word in Song of Solomon 3:6, 7 which seems to borrow its imagery from our present type: &quot;Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchants? Behold his bed, which is Solomon&rsquo;s; three score valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.&quot; Note first the allusion to &quot;the wilderness!&quot; There a procession is seen: a palanquin or curtained-litter (for this is the literal meaning of the Hebrew word here rendered &quot;bed&quot;) is seen, surrounded by all the marks of royalty and majesty; sixty mighty ones are about it. The &quot;litter&quot; was the temporary resting-place of the king. So the Tabernacle was God&rsquo;s resting-place, in the midst of Israel, during their wilderness wanderings. The &quot;ark&quot; was the symbol of His presence, and as 2 Samuel 7:2 tells us &quot;the ark of God dwelleth within curtains,&quot; while in Numbers 10:33, 35 a &quot;resting-place&quot; is also mentioned in connection with it. Around the ark in the Holy of Holies, were these sixty pillars of the Court, like the &quot;sixty valiant men&quot; about the wilderness resting-place of Solomon. The typical significance of this will appear in our next division.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. Its Meaning.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Like everything else connected with this first dwelling-place of God on earth, the antitypical significance of the Court is found in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and in Him alone. It is really pitiful to witness the attempts that have been made to refer the curtains and the pillars to the saints of this New Testament dispensation. Neither individually nor in their corporate capacity are they here in view. The Court is called the &quot;Tent of the Congregation&quot; (Ex. 39:40); it was the appointed place of assembly, where the Israelites came together and worshipped Jehovah, and where He met with them (Ex. 29:42, 43). Now it is in Christ, and in Him alone, that God and His people meet together. The Court, then, spoke of Christ as the Meeting-place between God and His people.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Court foreshadowed Christ on earth tabernacling among men, accessible to all who sought Him, but His glory beheld only by those who drew near in faith (John 1:14). In the opening paragraphs we have pointed out that the Court was unpaved, the Tabernacle resting upon the bare earth of the desert. This pointed to Christ as &quot;a Root out of a dry ground&quot;&mdash;Israel (Isa. 53:2). But although the floor of the Court was the dust of the wilderness, yet was it a sacred enclosure, so that he who entered it stood on holy ground; from Leviticus 16:6, 16 we learn that even the Court itself was termed &quot;the holy place.&quot; This tells us that Christ, though &quot;a Root out of a dry ground,&quot; was none other than &quot;the Holy One of God.&quot; We may add, these linen hangings were suspended from pillars seven and a half feet in height, so that all on the outside would be prevented from seeing what was done on the inside; thus making it a truly separated and holy place.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The distinctive spiritual significance of the Court is intimated by its order of mention in Exodus 27. First there is a description of the brazen altar (vv. 1-8), and then follow the details concerning the Court. This is very striking. </span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The natural order would be to have told of the Court first, and then of the altar which stood within it. But here again God&rsquo;s thoughts are different from ours. As we have seen, the altar speaks of the place where sin was dealt with: the consequence of this is, that entrance is afforded into the place where God meets with His people. Thus, that which the altar typified was the basis of the privileges foreshadowed by the Court.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;As soon as the Israelite entered the sacred precincts, the first object to meet his eyes was the standing witness to both the justice and the grace of God. The altar testified that his sins had been put away through the sacrifice offered thereon. It was there God showed, typically, that He is just and the Justifier of the believing sinner (Rom. 3:26).</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2059935B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2059935B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ps 65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.</span></p><p class="cs2059935B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ps 100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.</span></p><p class="cs2059935B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is to be carefully noted that </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">the Court was for an elect and redeemed people</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. There are several references in the Psalms to this: &quot;Blessed is the man whom Thou choosest, and causest to approach unto Thee, that he may dwell in Thy Courts&quot; (Ps. 65:4); &quot;Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His Court with praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His name&quot; (Ps. 100:4). But most blessed is it to note that in the Old Testament types of the Court there was a definite hint and foreshadowing of Gentiles also entering into and partaking of God&rsquo;s grace (Lev. 17:8, 22:18; Numbers 15:14-16). The &quot;stranger&quot; had the same liberty of approach to the altar as had an Israelite. Thus, at that early date, it was intimated &quot;there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&quot;<br/>(Rom. 10:12, 13).</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The sixty pillars around the Court told of the strength and sufficiency of that Refuge into which the believing sinner has fled: &quot;The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it and is safe&quot; (Prov. 18:10). That the pillars were made of &quot;wood&quot; was in harmony with the promise, &quot;And a Man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest&quot; (Isa. 32:2). That these pillars were sixty in number (5 x 12 or grace and perfect government), tell us it is the grace which reigns in righteousness by Christ Jesus that is our defense. This. like the sixty valiant men about Solomon&rsquo;s litter, is a guard of honor around us, so that none can lay anything to our charge. That there was an interval of five cubits between each pillar, intimates that no matter which aspect of our salvation we contemplate, all is of grace alone. The spotless white hangings suspended from them, depicted the fitness of the Lord our Righteousness to be the One in whom His God and our God could meet with us.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. Its Dimensions.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In contemplating this we must first consider the measurements of the linen hangings which surrounded the Court, and then the space enclosed by them. From v. 9 we learn that the linen hangings were a hundred cubits long on the south side, ditto on the north side (v. 11), fifty on the west side (v. 12), and thirty on the east side (vv. 14, 15)&mdash;the other twenty there being accounted for by the &quot;gate,&quot; which differed from the curtains on either side of it, in that it was of &quot;blue and purple and scarlet&quot; (v. 16). Thus there was a total length of these white hangings of two hundred and eighty cubits. The factors of this total would be 7 x 4 x 10, which speak of perfection on earth, seen in human responsibility fully discharged.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is striking to note that the length of the white hangings surrounding the Court was identical with the length of the curtains which were spread over the inner Tabernacle. &quot;The curtains of the Tabernacle present Christ, Christ in His nature and character, and Christ in His future glories and judicial authority; but as so presented He was for the eye of God, and for the eye of the priest. As such He could not be seen from without, only within. The fine twined linen hangings (of the Court) present Christ also, but not so much to those within as to those without. They could be seen by all in the camp. It is therefore the presentation of Christ to the world, Christ in the purity of His nature. He could thus challenge His adversaries to convict Him of sin. Pilate had to confess again and again that there was no fault in Him; and the Jewish authorities, though they sought with eagle-eyed malice, failed to establish, or even produce, a single proof of failure. Not a single speck could be detected upon the fine twined linen of His holy life, His life of practical righteousness which flowed from the purity of His being&quot; (Mr. E. Dennett). Thus, the linen hangings of the Court being of equal length with the Curtains of the inner tabernacle tell us that Christ manifested on earth the same holiness as He had and does before God in heaven!</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The linen hangings which formed the walls of the Court were divided by &quot;pillars,&quot; which were erected at intervals of five cubits: note in vv. 9, 10 there were &quot;twenty&quot; pillars for the &quot;hundred cubits&quot; of linen on either length. The white linen spoke of righteousness, five is the number of grace; thus, these measurements pronounced that the grace of God to poor sinners is not bestowed at the expense of justice, but, as Romans 5:21 declares, &quot;As sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness, unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot; Five is, again, the dominating number in the measurements of the enclosure: as 5:18 tells us, &quot;the length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits.&quot; How small was the Court in comparison with the camp! Hebrews 13:13, read in the light of that whole Epistle, indicates that the &quot;Camp&quot; refers to the religious world, Christendom&mdash;the sphere of nominal Christian profession. The smallness of the Court in contrast from the vastness of the Camp (for how few was accommodation provided!) contains more than a hint of the fewness of those, from among the crowds of professing Christians, that really enter God&rsquo;s presence! God&rsquo;s &quot;flock&quot; is only a &quot;LITTLE one&quot; (Luke 12:32); only the &quot;few&quot; are in the Narrow Way (Matthew 7:14). Are you one of the favored &quot;few&quot;?</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="cs91EF8B52">5. Its Sockets.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;And their sockets of brass&quot; (v. 18). This detail needs no lengthy comment. The &quot;sockets&quot; formed the foundation for the pillars. The &quot;brass&quot; of which they were composed speaks of endurance, capacity to bear the action of fire: type of Christ suffering, but not being consumed by, the outpoured judgment of God upon the sinner&rsquo;s Substitute. Thus, once more, are the saints reminded of that upon which all their blessings are based.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="cs91EF8B52">6. Its Hooks and Fillets.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;The hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver&quot; (v. 11). These &quot;fillets&quot; were connecting-rods from pillar to pillar, and the hooks would link the linen hangings to the fillets. They bring out a most important detail in our present type. As we pointed out in an earlier article, &quot;silver&quot; is the symbol of redemption, and it was through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus that Divine righteousness and Divine grace were united. There is an inseparable connection between Christ our Righteousness and Christ our Redeemer: these two must never be separated. Righteousness could never have been imputed to us unless the Lord Jesus had ransomed us by His blood. The worshipping Israelite would see that the boards of the Tabernacle owed their stability to the fact that the atonement-money had been paid, for they rested on silver sockets. He would also perceive that the fine linen curtains of the Court hung securely from silver chapiters and rings, made from the same ransom-money. Beautifully has this been commented upon by one writing of the blessedness of those who had entered the court:&mdash;&quot;While outside, the wall shut off, now that he is inside, it shuts him in. Instead of being opposed by &lsquo;righteousness,&rsquo; he is now surrounded by it. God is just, and as long as the sinner is rejecting Christ He must be against him; but once the latter has come to Him through Christ all is reversed; He is &lsquo;just, and the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus (Rom. 3:26). But how can this be? It can be in the way set forth in this fine linen wait; the linen (&quot;righteousness&quot;) was not suspended to the brass (&quot;judgment&quot;), but was connected with it by means of silver rods that joined pillar to pillar. Thus, typically we have the truth as it is plainly stated in Romans 3:24, &lsquo;Being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus&rsquo;&quot; (Mr. C. H. Bright).</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thus, the redeemed Israelite who entered the Court was shut in by walls of righteousness upheld by the tokens of redemption. This is the blessed portion of every sinner who has fled to Christ for refuge. Because Christ was made sin for him, he has been made &quot;the righteousness of God in Him&quot; (2 Cor. 5:21). &quot;For as by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous&quot; (Rom. 5:19). The Christian is vested with that which meets every requirement of God&rsquo;s holiness. What cause, then, has each believing reader to join with the writer in saying, &quot;I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness&quot; (Isa. 61:10).</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="cs91EF8B52">7. Its Gate.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;And for the gate of the Court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four&quot; (v. 16). This &quot;hanging&quot; which formed the entrance to the Court is closely connected in thought with the Veil and the Gate of the Tabernacle. Each of them served as a door, hiding the interior from one approaching from the outside. All were made of the same materials, and the colors are mentioned in the same order; the dimensions of all were alike, each measuring one hundred square cubits. The same truth was embodied in each of these typical curtains: there could be no access to God of any kind&mdash;whether of comparatively distant worship, or of closer intimacy&mdash;except by Him who said &quot;I am the Way.&quot; The Israelite who came to the brazen altar with his offering must pass through this gate of the Court; the priest who placed incense on the golden altar must enter by the door of the Tabernacle; the high priest who entered the Holy of Holies on the day of atonement must do so through the Veil, thus realizing the thrice repeated proof of the only way of access to God.</span></p><p class="cs9B62C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The antitypical teaching of the Gate is brought before us in John 10:9, where Christ says, &quot;I am the Door, by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved.&quot; But as another has observed, &quot;It is not thinking about the Door, or believing that He is the Door, but entering the Door, that saves. Many need help right on this point. There are (figuratively speaking) crowds of semi-believers around the Gate. They believe it is the Gate, and the only one, but they do not take the step. They are always saying, &lsquo;Let me hide myself in Thee,&rsquo; instead of hiding, in Him once for all. Oh! why not dare to trust Him now, at once and forever? You say that you do not feel that He accepts you . . . How can you, as long as you remain outside? Jesus makes no promise to the one who does not enter, but to the one who does. Enter in, and then, feeling or not, you may know that you are saved, because He says so. The Altar was inside the Gate, not outsider How, then, can you know that you are saved until you enter? Come, just as you are, in all your sinfulness, with no feeling, with no consciousness of any &lsquo;marks of grace,&rsquo; and as a sinner believe in the sinner&rsquo;s Savior.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="border-collapse:collapse;">

		<p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Between them and the Tabernacle was a wall of fine twined linen, at least 7 feet 6 inches. high, supported by 60 pillars, forming a rectangle. The foundation for each pillar was a socket of brass (bronze), every pillar being headed with a cap overlaid with silver. A silver connecting bar held the pillars at equal distance, secured by silver hooks and brass tent pegs.</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The wall of white linen, standing out so clearly against the yellow sand, tells that the One in the midst was &ldquo;Jehovah Tsidkenu&rdquo;&mdash;The Lord our Righteousness (Jer. 33:16). It was a wall of separation. Jehovah had said, &ldquo;that I may dwell among them&rdquo;; yet He was separate, approachable in one appointed way. Of Immanuel&mdash;God with us the writer to the Hebrews says, &ldquo;For such a high priest became us who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners&rdquo; (Heb. 7:26). The pillars of the wall were founded in brass (bronze) sockets, speaking of judgment of Israel&rsquo;s unrighteousness; (the brazen altar was the place where sin was judged by sacrifice). The same thought of judgment is conveyed by John&rsquo;s vision of our Lord in Revelation 1:15, &ldquo;And his feet like unto fine brass . . .&rdquo; He is in the midst of the seven churches, judging them, saying&mdash;&ldquo;I know thy works . . .&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yet the silvered caps and bars also teach of redemption. Again, the Israelites paid redemption money for the firstborn (Num. 3:50). Later, Peter wrote &ldquo;Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold . . .But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot&rdquo; (1 Peter 1:18,19).</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The wall of white was broken on the east side by a door or gate with hangings of blue, purple and scarlet, which was plainly seen, so the repentant Israelite drawing near with his sacrifice would find the entrance.

I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me&rdquo; (John 10:9; 14:6). Today, the sinner comes bringing no sacrifice, for the Lord has opened the way in by the sacrifice of Himself (Heb. 9:26).</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.

Four was the universal number suggesting the way was open to all kinds of men, both Jew and Gentile, but not every man. When the Lord was dealing with Nicodemus He stressed this aspect of salvation, saying &ldquo;For God so loved the world . . .&rdquo;, not only Jew, but Gentile.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Profound so simple. Teaching about the strait gate and the narrow way. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it&#39; (Matt. 7:13,14).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;The illustration Jesus used is easily understood and filled with meaning, but revelation, teaching and guidance by the Holy Ghost is needed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ps 118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Joh 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some 700 years before Christ, Isaiah prophesied about this way, saying, &quot;And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein&quot; (Isa. 35:8).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To the one with a humble mind and heart the significance of Jesus citing a gate and path is readily comprehended. On the other hand, His teaching about the dimension of the road to heaven entails divine truths that must be revealed by the Spirit to be understood. They are not meaningful to the natural mind.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus said that the strait gate and narrow way lead to life. This life is the abundant life (John 10:10) There is only one way that leads right to heaven. The strait gate and narrow road of holiness. the strait gate and narrow way faithfully reflect the true dimension of heaven&#39;s door.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The strait gate and narrow way are the dimensions of what God&rsquo;s plan is. The councils of Heaven did not just decide to make the way of salvation hard; God is not mean-spirited. The narrow way is the dimension it is because it corresponds to the Father&#39;s holiness. It is a reflection of God&#39;s righteousness.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The first attribute of God is holiness (Lev. 11:45,46; 1 Pet. 1:16), and the second is love (1 John 4:8). These two attributes of the Almighty do not conflict but rather compliment each other. Because God loves mankind He did not withhold from man the measurement of the way that leads to His holy presence. God wants man to be with Him in eternity and share in His glory. That is why the way has the dimension it does.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is no hint in Jesus&#39; words that the strait gate and the narrow road may vary slightly from one another in their width. Jesus said, &quot;I am the door&quot; (John 10:7), and He also said, &quot;I am the way&quot; (John 14:6). There is no variance between Christ the Door and Christ the Way. The passage through the door, or gate, is so strait that there is no room for the flesh to pass through. Once having entered through the strait gate, the road beyond retains the same dimension. Having come in through the strait gate, it will not be grievous to walk the narrow way.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As Christ laid down His life, so must the seekers and knockers at the gate forfeit their lives (Matt. 16:25) to enter the kingdom. As one stands before the strait gate he surrenders everything to the Lord that he might gain entrance. Having become penitent and broken by Holy-Ghost conviction, there is no plea bargaining and no reservations stipulated. With a broken heart and contrite spirit (Ps. 34:18) one divests himself of his fleshly baggage on the world side of the strait gate. He does this willingly because his heart is being made new. He now knows that there is no other way unto salvation. He resolves to forsake the world and all its lusts, deny self, take up his cross, and follow the Lord Jesus. This he promises to do until his dying breath. This latter promise pertains to walking the narrow way.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is imperative that one does not begin to think that the way is broader than the gate. The Scriptures give no other thought but that the door of heaven is the same dimension as the strait gate and narrow way. Some today would like to make the way just a little broader than the strait gate, but this was not their confession of faith when they entered through the gate. Somewhere along the way they began to chafe at the flesh-restricting dimension of the way They listened to the cries of the crucified old man and had sympathy on him. It is at this point that the narrow way begins to appear as bondage, rather than providing liberty </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the flesh.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How many Christian professors will travel a broader way only to bump into the doorposts of heaven and fall to the left-hand side? According to Jesus, the number will be more than a few (Matt. 7:22,23). The strait gate and narrow way alone lead directly into the glories of God&#39;s dwelling place.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">While the way is not wider than the gate, neither will it be any narrower Having come in through the strait gate by repentance and faith, one can know he will find no place in the way that will be impossible if he keeps that same spirit.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That &quot;there be few that find it&quot; tells us that this gate is hidden. We understand from these words that many &quot;seek&quot; to find it, but only a few are successful. The failures are due to not seeking with the whole heart (1cr. 29:13). People do not just happen upon the narrow way casually This apparently is the meaning of Isaiah&#39;s words, &quot;though fools, shall not err therein:&#39; Those who are presumptuous or less than sincere about the things of God will not inadvertently stumble onto this way. The strait gate is hidden to human wisdom and thinking, but it is revealed to the honest, searching heart.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God has not hidden the strait gate and narrow way to exclude anyone--except the fleshly minded (1 Cor. 15:50). When Adam and Eve transgressed in the garden of Eden, God &quot;placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life&quot; (Gen. 3:24). This was done so that man would not eat of the tree of life in his fallen state and thereby be consigned to a &quot;living&quot; death. Likewise, He has &quot;hidden&quot; the entrance to the narrow way so that only the truly penitent and humble find it. This is a safeguard against deception.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some today might feel that the ministry or brotherhood is denying them entrance. As a result they come into trials, and some turn away. But the church&#39;s task is to prove whether one&#39;s spirit and life is such that indicate one has truly found the strait gate. And thus she endeavors to speak the truth. She must not do any less, lest men be given a false hope.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is the essence of the straitness of this gate and narrow way? It is in denying oneself of many &quot;things,&quot; or is it only the heart that matters? The answer is neither if considered separately and alone, but both when one&#39;s motivation is examined. The cause, or root, of sinning must receive the focus here. James writes that &quot;every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death&quot; (James 1:14, 15). This lust, which is strong selfish desire, is going to bear evil fruit unless it is continually mortifled (Rom. 8:13). There is not room on the narrow way for the manifestations of self. The narrow way will not accommodate &quot;the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&quot; (1 John 2:16).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The two greatest commandments are to love God supremely and to love one&#39;s neighbor as himself. Jesus said that everything else derives from these (Matt. 22:44; see also Rom. 13:9). To love God and our fellowmen as Jesus taught means we will seek their highest well-being and happiness above our own pleasure. If one chooses his own satisfaction ahead of God&#39;s honor and glory, or at the expense of someone&#39;s grief or disappointment, he deems himself more worthy of satisfaction than God or his fellowman. Such a person manifests gross pride. This deference to selfishness because of pride is the essence of all sin.

Abel, by faith, offered an acceptable sacrifice, even a lamb slain (Gen. 4:4). So the writer to the Hebrews continues the theme in referring to the great Anti-type, &ldquo;Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many . . .&rdquo; (Heb. 9:28).</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csC382D2BB">&ldquo;Not all the blood of beasts<br/>On Jewish altars slain,<br/>Could give the guilty conscience peace,<br/>Or wash away the stain.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,<br/>Takes all our guilt away;<br/>A Sacrifice of nobler name,<br/>And richer blood than they.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Brazen Altar was the largest piece of furniture in the Tabernacle, 7ft. 6ins. long, 7ft. 6in. in width and 4ft. 6in. high, overlaid with brass on shittim or acacia wood. Smoke ascending from the sacrifice may have been a figure of the offerer rising to fellowship with God, while Peter wrote, &ldquo;Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. . .&rdquo; (1 Pet. 3:18).</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When our Lord cried at the end of His atoning work, after hanging on the Cross for six hours: &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; it was a cry of triumph; the irrevocable claims of a holy God had been met once for all. &ldquo;Mercy there was great and grace was free, Pardon there was multiplied to me. There my burdened soul found liberty, At Calvary.&rdquo; The tabernacle sacrifices were only types, often offered, pointing to the once and for all offering of the Lamb of God. Some, who in scorn and unbelief want to come to God in their carnal way, come even as Cain did. However, the Brazen Altar in its position was accessible, unavoidable and unmistakable; while regarding the Lord Jesus Christ it is written, &ldquo;Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I think the four horns of the altar, one at each corner, typify Christ&rsquo;s atoning work being efficacious and powerful and that He is &ldquo;able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him.&rdquo; The beasts were bound to the horns of the altar when brought to be sacrificed; but when </span><span class="csC382D2BB">our </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Lamb was sacrificed He was bound to the Cross by cords of love; praise His name!</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God commanded the Israelite who brought his sacrifice to the brazen altar, to &ldquo;offer it without blemish before the LORD,&rdquo; to &ldquo;lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation&rdquo; (Lev. 3:1,2). Here, the doctrine of Atonement is clearly shewn in type; &ldquo;he shall offer it . . . and kill it.&rdquo; The doctrine of Substitution is also taught, &ldquo;he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering,&rdquo; by faith transferring his sins and their penalty of death to the sacrifice. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Part 2</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">IN Part 1</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">reference was made to the Outer Court of the Tabernacle as being the great wide space between the tents of the children of Israel and the white linen wall of the Inner Court. Here, Moses and Aaron pitched their tents along with the Levites. They and they alone were allowed beyond the brazen altar to serve in the holy things. They are typical of believers today, concerning whom the Lord said, &ldquo;Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit&rdquo; (John 15:16).</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When I was new in the Christian pathway I often heard the phrase, &ldquo;you are saved to serve:&rdquo; how true and relevant; for is not this needed today&mdash;a sense of service in the local church? So, the typology of the Tabernacle, having clearly set forth the Way of Salvation for the sinner, and by the one Wall of Separation teaching of God&rsquo;s holiness and our sinfulness, and through the One Gate pointing to the only way of admission to heaven and by One Altar shewing the one way of propitiation and atonement, now sets forth through</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">The Brazen Laver</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">the Way of Service for the saints. In Exodus 30:17-21 and 38:8 we have typified the first step of the believer-priest for service in holy things. The position of the Tabernacle in relation to the children of Israel made clear, that although it was in the center, the Israelites were to pitch their tents afar off (Num. 2:2). The only approach to Jehovah was via the Gate and the Altar. Paul applies the spiritual truth of this when writing to the Ephesian church, &ldquo;But </span><span class="csC382D2BB">now </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were </span><span class="csC382D2BB">far off are made nigh </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">by the blood of Christ&rdquo; (2:13). Nevertheless, before service there must be cleansing, as illustrated by the Laver.</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This was a large vessel to which the serving priest would come. While no details regarding its shape are given, we find the material from which it was made was entirely different from that used for other vessels. They were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold or brass, or as in the case of the seven-branched candlestick, of pure gold. The Laver was made of the polished brass mirrors of women who willingly gave up these essential items, as they did many other things for the construction of the Tabernacle (Ex. 38:8; 36:6).</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Laver is thought to have consisted of a very large bowl, standing on a pedestal. Low down around the side were taps for the priests to wash their hands and feet </span><span class="csC382D2BB">at </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(not </span><span class="csC382D2BB">in</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">),</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">as water ran from the taps into the saucer-shaped pedestal (Ex. 30:18,19). Being in position between the Brazen Altar and the Tabernacle, it was as a sentinel, forbidding to touch holy things before cleansing. At the altar, the blood of the sacrifice was shed, typifying the once and for all washing of the whole person in the blood of Christ. At the brazen laver, the washing of hands and feet (not the body) is a type of cleansing by the Word of God through the Holy Spirit (Eph. 5:26), of daily application of God&rsquo;s Word cleansing heart and conscience for His service in witness and work.</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The increasing problem today for us as believer-priests is how to live a positive Spirit-filled clean life before men in this world. We face impurity, defilement and contamination in &ldquo;this present evil world,&rdquo; including impurity from within our own hearts (the old man). Defilement from books, television, cinemas, advertising, newspapers, magazines, contamination in our contacts with home, neighbors, business, school, colleges, etc., has to be faced. Yet we are exhorted, &ldquo;Let your conversation&mdash;daily walk&mdash;be as it becometh the gospel of Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:27).</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So how can we as believers maintain a holy calling, conversation, conduct, character? I believe the answer is in an understanding of the gracious and practical provision made for us in the application of the Word of God by the Holy Spirit, as typified in the cleansing of hands and feet at the Laver. When the Lord Jesus Christ, on the night of betrayal, said to His disciples, &ldquo;He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit,&rdquo; He was speaking to those who possibly had washed in preparation for the Passover, but in coming to the Upper Room had walked through dusty streets and therefore required that their feet be washed in water, which was usually provided by every Jewish household before the eating at the Passover table. So believers need both the washing typified by the brazen altar and the daily cleansing of which the brazen altar teaches (cf. 1 John 1:7,9), even through God&rsquo;s Word.</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A mere reading the Word of God, of course, cannot do this, but coming to our Bibles we prayerfully take up the promise, &ldquo;Howbeit when He, the Spirit of truth is come. He will guide you into all truth (John 16:13-15). We remember our Lord&rsquo;s own prayer, &ldquo;Sanctify them through Thy truth; Thy word is truth&rdquo; (John 17:17). In conclusion let us come back to the gracious words, &ldquo;Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them,&rdquo; a sinful rebellious people; yet in Sovereign Grace He deigns to dwell among them. For us the veil has been rent at Calvary, and by faith we go beyond the Brazen Laver, into the Holy Place, and through the veil into the very Holy of Holies, not to a blood-sprinkled ark, into His very Presence, by the blood of Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Meanwhile, let us always remember that our worship, service and witness can only be pleasing to our God as we are washed and cleansed daily by the application of the Word through the Holy Spirit. He says, &ldquo;Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord&rdquo; (Isa. 52:11).</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Finally, in answer to those who reject or neglect typological teaching, let us say, &ldquo;take heed;&rdquo; Jehovah had graciously said to Israel, &ldquo;let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them,&rdquo; and we go on to notice what He sovereignly says in Exodus 25:40, &ldquo;And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.&rdquo; To Moses there was revealed God&rsquo;s Pattern or Plan; a visual pattern of heavenly things! The writer to the Hebrews records, &ldquo;It was therefore necessary that the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">pattern of things in the heavens </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">should be purified with these . . .&rdquo; (Heb. 9:23). A man building a model or a woman knitting a pullover will work according to the pattern at first supplied; they must do in order to obtain the final result. As this is necessary, should we not then take heed to the pattern of the heavenly things shewn in Old Testament scriptures? Are not Paul&rsquo;s words to Timothy, referring specifically to the Old Testament, as relevant today, &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">All </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness&rdquo;? Indeed!</span></p><p class="cs4F12C203"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In relation to this, the epistle to the Hebrews cannot be understood unless we have a good knowledge of the Tabernacle typology. The writer refers again and again to this and brings the application to a climax in chapter 10:19, &ldquo;Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated for us, through </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the veil</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">,</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">that is to say, His flesh.&rdquo; It was death for the high priest to enter within the veil except on the Day of Atonement, and then not without blood, and according to a special procedure. It was the curtain between a holy God and sinful man. Yet while the priest, serving in the holy place dare not go beyond it, our great High Priest, having completed His atoning work on the Cross, cried &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo; And &ldquo;behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom&rdquo; (Matthew 27:51). What a precious privilege is ours today. Having &ldquo;boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus&rdquo; let us make sure that we continually avail ourselves of precious things. Let us take unto ourselves the wonderful pattern of heavenly things and, applying its lessons to our daily lives, be &ldquo;Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3A4479F6"><span class="csA7555675">But the most remarkable altar mentioned in the book of Genesis is that which Abraham built for the sacrifice of his son Isaac, from which we glean several particulars relative to the patriarchal worship. The altar was evidently something district for the wood by whose fire the sacrifice was to be burnt, for Abraham &quot;built an altar and laid the wood in order,&quot; which he had brought with him from Beersheba, as if he could not count upon finding it at the place. The victim also was bound, laid upon the wood, and there slain. This was contrary to the practice under the Levitical dispensation, when the fire on the top of the altar was kept continually burning, and the animal was killed before being carried up to it; but it is probably alluded to in averse of the Psalms, which has given much trouble to commentators who have tried to reconcile it with the precepts of the Mosaic law --- &quot;Bind the sacrifice with cords unto the horns of the altar&quot; (Ps. Cxviii. 27). To this simple patriarchal ritual belong also the rules about the construction of altars given to the Israelites shortly after they left Egypt (Exod. Xx. 24-26). While sojourning in that country they do not seem to have offered any sacrifice to Jehovah, till, just as they were leaving it, they were commanded to sacrifice the Passover. It is not unlikely that they might have despised the simple altars of their forefathers, a tried to imitate those which they had seen in Egypt, as they so soon copied their late oppressors in a still graver matter, the making a supposed likeness of the Deity. They were therefore ordered to make their altars of earth. Stones might also be used, but they were not to be hewn, nor were the altars to be so high as to require the offered to go up by steps to arrange the sacrifices upon them.<br/><br/>The first altar that is mentioned as having been built after these directions were given, was the one for the solemn covenanting sacrifice between God and the Israelites (Ex. Xxiv. 4-8). There it is mentioned that Moses &lsquo;builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel/&quot; Its being under the hili may have been a significant protest against the prevalent heathen error of localizing the Deity in the sky, and the twelve pillars or rough blocks of stone appear to have been a principal part of the materials used in constructing it. They may be compared with the &quot;twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,&quot; with which Elijah built his altar on Carmel (1 Kings xviii. 31). We see, to learn from these examples that when an altar was to be constructed for a special occasion, it was fitting hat it should bear a symbolism of all in whose name the sacrifice was offered. It is to be observed that this precept about making altars of earth or of unhewn stones was anterior to the Levitical ceremonial, and was superseded by it. After the sin of making the golden calf, the whole ceremonial of the worship of the Israelities was altered. According to the new ritual, two different altars were required, and they were permanent, being carried about in the people&rsquo;s wanderings, and replaced by others, similar, but larger and more costly, when the ark was placed in the temple on Mount Moriah.<br/><br/>The first of these altars was that for burnt offerings. For the tabernacle this was hollow, made of boards of shittim-wood, covered with brass. It was three cubits or about five high, and five cubits or eight feet square. It had a horn at each corner, and was carried about by means of staves. The corresponding altar in the temple was of greatly larger dimensions, ten cubits or about 18 feet high, and in the first temple 20 cubits square, and in the second 24 cubits. The tradition of the Jew is, that it was 32 cubits (about 50 feet) square at the base, contracting to 24 at the top, by several ledges round it at different heights. It must therefore have been an immense structure, and though called &quot;an altar of brass,&quot; was probably built of stones, and merely covered with plates of that metal. From the account of the building of the altar in this second temple given in 1 Macc. Iv 45-47, it is probable that it consisted merely of a mass of masonry of the proper form. Ezekiel, in his vision of the temple, gives a description of the altar of burnt-offerings, from which we learn that it was surrounded by several ledges or steps, each a cubit broad. The uppermost of these was two cubits (about 3 feet) below the top of the altar, so that, standing upon it, the priest was able to arrange the sacrifice upon the fire, which was kept always burning, to supply it with fuel, and to remove the ashes. The lower ledges were to enable him to sprinkle the blood on the sides of the altar, which (according to the Levitical ritual) was sometimes on the lower part. The lowest step is said to have had a raised ledge on the outside, by which the blood poured upon it was confined till it ran through a hole into a subterranean pipe.<br/><br/></span></p><p class="cs3A4479F6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3A4479F6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611"><br/></span><span class="cs2C663CEE">The Cross and Consecration</span><span class="cs9FF1B611"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs9FF1B611">&nbsp; &quot;God ... hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice&quot; (Ps. 118:27). </span></p><p class="cs3A4479F6"><span class="cs9FF1B611">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &nbsp;young man, tried again and again to give himself fully to the Lord, but without success. He was perfectly sincere, but he continued perfectly miserable. He was one of those many young people who are continually consecrating themselves to the Lord. At length he came to discover that he had missed the very basis of consecration. He found light through God&#39;s own &quot;consecration&quot; of the Old Testament priests. When he beheld the blood placed on the priest&#39;s ear, on his thumb, on his toe, and saw him sprinkled all over with blood, he came to understand his union with &quot;Christ made sin.&quot; He saw death written all over him. He felt the awful doom and death to which Calvary committed him. He came to understand his identification with Christ. He saw himself one with the Crucified in His death and resurrection. This death-life union changed his whole conception of surrender to Christ and laid the foundations in his life for a successful and abiding consecration. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an experience is not uncommon among Christians. They have been justified by faith and have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. But they have not realized the implications of the Cross. In some of our best churches they have been immediately taken from the justification of Romans 5:1 to the truth of consecration as set forth in Romans 12:1, 2. We would not be overcritical in that which is well meant; but to ignore or pass over the teaching and amazing declarations of our union with Christ as set forth in Romans 6 to 8 is not really the, proper approach to consecration. Such a skirting of these underlying truths brought many years of misery to my ministerial friend. He knew not the way of victory over sinful self. All unconsciously he was attempting in the energy of self to lay his all on the altar. When he came to see that he was already the Lord&#39;s through his life-union with Christ--already crucified and risen with Christ, &quot;dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord&#39;!--he then had a sure basis for presenting himself unto God. At last he had found the blessed secret of success.</span></p><p class="cs3A4479F6"><span class="cs9FF1B611">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Abraham Lincoln delivered his address at the dedication of the battlefield cemetery in Gettysburg, November 19,1863, he said: &quot;We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives.... But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow--this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. ... It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work . . . to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs5D6F5672"><span class="cs9FF1B611">We speak of Christian consecration. &quot;But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow--this ground&quot; of our already redeemed lives. In His laid-down life the Crucified has already &quot;consecrated it (us) far above our poor power to add or detract.&quot; Let us fix our eyes upon Christ. We have already been fastened to the Crucified. Let us believe that if we be dead with Him we shall also live with Him. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessed truths clustering around our death-resurrection union with Christ, as set forth in Romans 6 to 8, lay the basis for a successful consecration, as so clearly set forth in Romans 12:1,2. Having been so completely redeemed and &quot;accepted in the beloved,&quot; Christ now beseeches us by His own infinite and many tender mercies to present our bodies a reasonable, living, holy, acceptable sacrifice to Himself. As we lay our hands upon the sacred and holy head of our Burnt Offering we know (let it be the language of a lively faith) that in Him we are a sweet savor unto God--a sweet savor of perfect obedience, perfect consecration, and perfect sacrifice &quot;far above our poor power to add or detract.&quot; What power! What persuasion! What perfect peace! His is the perfect satisfaction--a sweet savor offering made by fire--ours the sweet privilege of being burned out for Him. Can we not trust Him? Shall we not let Him carry us where He will? O hesitating believer, are we not ready to sign away our rights and reserves for all coming days? Come. Give Him all. &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&quot; The Lord loves a hilarious giver. Let us launch forth with Him on any uncharted sea. Those who sail the high seas in treacherous times commit themselves to His Majesty the King: &quot;At your service, Sir, with scaled orders.&quot; It was George Whitefield who said: &quot;I give up myself to be a martyr for Him who hung upon the Cross for me. I have thrown myself blind-folded and, I trust, without reserve into His almighty hands.&quot; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Ahn, that heroic lady of Korea, had argued with God for some seven years against going to the Japanese Diet and warning that nation against persecuting the Christians for refusal to bow at the Shinto shrines. When she finally yielded to obey God&#39;s call, she sold all her possessions and bought a one-way ticket for Tokyo--to do and die. We say that consecration is &quot;for service or sacrifice.&quot; To Miss Ahn it was both. Hers would be a trip to death. She bought a one-way ticket, to return nevermore--by love compelled to obey, to go, to do, and, if necessary, to die. Oh, to be so sweetly constrained by Calvary&#39;s awful compulsion that we can hold out no longer, can no longer resist its attractive force! We are drawn to death--with appetites whetted to eat of the Great Sacrifice. Ah, this is life indeed, life more abundant, the life that is hid with Christ in God--&quot;He that eateth me, even he shall live by me.&quot; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another aspect that is all-important. Frances Ridley Havergal has said: &quot;Full consecration may in one sense be the act of a moment and in another the work of a lifetime. It must be complete to be real, and yet. if real it is always incomplete; a point of rest, and yet a perpetual progression.&quot; Let us not be deceived, we shall often be compelled to say with the Psalmist: &quot;God is the Lord, which hath shewed us light (conversion): bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar (consecration).&quot; It will cost us all we have and all we am to keep in this consecrated mind. We shall be forced to cry out again and again as we fear the fire and feel the sacrificial knife, &quot;Bind me, blessed Savior, as a sacrifice--fasten me with Thy cords of constraining love lest I finish my course with shame. Let me not begin to make provision anywhere for the flesh--let my offering continue to be a burnt offering--a whole burnt offering, yea, a continual burnt offering. Let me never come down from the cross to save myself. Fix me, fasten me, bind me with Thine own cords to Calvary, a continual burnt offering.&quot; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A missionary friend returned to his field seeking a fresh anointing. He says: &quot;The Lord searched my heart and my possessions to see if anything had become dearer to me than Himself. &#39;Lovest thou me more than these?&#39;--meaning my wife and boy. I hesitated. I felt as though He had laid before me an execution warrant and was waiting for my signature. There was a terrible fight in my heart: surrender meant death. After a long struggle and by His grace, I made the surrender and I did it with the fullest expectation that this meant the end of their earthly lives. After a few weeks, while returning to our little Japanese house alone, the thought flashed into my mind, &#39;The boy is sick.&quot; He was all right when I left home, healthy and well.
