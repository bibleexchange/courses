<p class=MsoNormal>Tried with fire here or hereafter.  Self-denial and
endurance of our Lord's will, must be the salt and the fire of our sacrifice in
this life, or else the endless woes of the wrath of God shall be both
preserving salt and consuming fire to us in Hell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It is far better to accept the
light afflictions of today, than to endure the fierce flames of perdition
forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fire and salt of the Lord is - <b><u>PERFECT</u></b> <b><u>JUDGMENT</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those who don’t present themselves as <b><u>living
sacrifices to God's grace</u></b>, shall be made for ever <u>dying sacrifices</u>
to his <u>justice</u>, and since they would not give honor to him, he will get
him honor upon them if they will not be salted with the salt of divine
grace.     Rom.12:1; 2:2; 9:21,22; II Tim. 2:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They would not admit  their corrupt affections, they would
not submit to the operation, could not bear the corrosives that were necessary
to eat out the proud flesh, it was to them like cutting off a hand, or plucking
out an eye; and therefore in hell they shall be salted with fire; coals of fire
shall be scattered upon them (Eze 10:2), as salt upon the meat, and brimstone
(Job 18:15), as fire and brimstone were rained on Sodom; the pleasures they
have lived in, shall eat their flesh, as it were with fire, Jas 5:3. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The pain of mortifying the flesh is
no comparison to the punishment for not mortifying it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Compare salting with burning. Salt
will hurt but will produce a cure; fire will purify or punish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The fire of hell shall not be
quenched, by the power of God it shall be made to last forever.
Mt.10:28;Jn.3:36;Jude7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Those that are cast into hell, will
find the fire to have not only the corroding quality of salt, but its
preserving quality; whence it is used to signify that which is lasting: a
covenant of salt is a perpetual covenant, and Lot's wife being turned into a
pillar of salt, made her a remaining monument of divine vengeance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This will certainly be the doom of
those that do not crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts.</p>
