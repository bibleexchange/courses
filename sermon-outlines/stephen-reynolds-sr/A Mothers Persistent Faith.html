And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">2Ki 4:18 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;19 And he said unto his father, My head, my head.

And he arose, and followed her.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;33 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">2Ki 4:35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

				<li class="cs1D1A7943"><span class="csA521DC07">While ministering there, she invited the prophet to join her and her family for a meal. He accepted her kindness, and a close bond of friendship was developed between him and her family. </span></li><li class="cs1D1A7943"><span class="csA521DC07">She left an open invitation for him to stop by anytime he was passing through their city, and this was quite often. For Elisha frequently passed through Shunem as he traveled to Jezreel and other cities in the surrounding area of Israel. </span></li><li class="cs1D1A7943"><span class="csA521DC07">His visits became so frequent that the Shunammite woman encouraged her husband to add a room to their house where Elisha could stay when he needed overnight accommodations.</span></li></ol>

Because of her generosity, Elisha wanted to do something very special for her. Sending his servant to summon her, he asked if he could request a special political or legal favor from the king for her? Or, knowing that her husband was quite aged, could he perhaps request a special military guard from the army commander to protect her?</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Graciously the woman declined, </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">she had no special needs, </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">she lived among her relatives, both they and her neighbors were caring. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">She left Elisha and returned to her household duties.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Elisha turned to his servant and asked for a gift suggestion from him (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:14</span><span class="csA521DC07">). The servant replied that the woman was childless and her husband was very elderly, so she probably would never have children. Immediately Elisha summoned the childless woman and promised that God would give her a child within one year (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:15-17</span><span class="csA521DC07">). Standing in the doorway, the woman was utterly shocked, but no doubt flooded with a sense of excitement. Nevertheless, she objected to Elisha&#39;s promise because she feared disappointment, a broken heart. She objected, asking for Elisha not to mislead her, not to break her heart with such a promise. But she soon was with child and bore a son just as Elisha had promised.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs24168C14"><span class="csA521DC07">Years later the woman&#39;s heart was broken with an overwhelming</span></li></ol>

The child suffered a violent headache while he was out playing in the fields where his father was working. Immediately the father put the child in the arms of a servant and instructed him to carry the child home to his mother. All morning the mother tenderly held the child in her lap, but he died at noon (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:20</span><span class="csA521DC07">). </span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

As quickly as she could, she asked her husband for a servant and donkey so she could make a quick visit to Elisha. Somewhat perplexed, the husband asked why she needed to make the visit since it was not a religious holiday. Well&hellip;he gave her permission to make the quick trip. As rapidly as she could, she rushed to Elisha, the prophet of God, from whom she would </span><span class="csF42C4B08">seek help</span><span class="csA521DC07"> in her desperate and helpless hour of need.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman&#39;s faith in God and in His prophet Elisha was apparently unlimited (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:24-31</span><span class="csA521DC07">). The mother rushed to Mt. Carmel where Elisha lived. Spotting her off in the distance rushing toward him, Elisha sent his servant to meet and greet her. But she refused to be delayed by conversation with the servant (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:25-26</span><span class="csA521DC07">). As soon as she reached Elisha, she quickly slipped off her donkey and rushed up to him, kneeling to the ground and grabbing his feet (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:27</span><span class="csA521DC07">). Gehazi rushed over to push her away, but Elisha stopped him. For he sensed the mother&#39;s bitter grief and sorrow. Pouring out her soul to Elisha, she expressed that her pain was worse than having no child at all. In fact, when Elisha had promised the child, she had asked him not to raise her hopes (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:28</span><span class="csA521DC07">).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Without even taking time to respond to his dear friend, Elisha turned to his servant Gehazi and instructed him to rush to the boy. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">2Ki 4:29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and </span><span class="csF42C4B08">lay my staff upon the face of the child</span><span class="csA521DC07">.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">But the mother refused to leave unless Elisha himself went back with her (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:30</span><span class="csA521DC07">). her </span><span class="csD3860DFD">persistent faith</span><span class="csA521DC07">: </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">2Ki 4:30 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">her faith was in the Lord and in His prophet, not in the prophet&#39;s servant. Filled with </span><span class="csD3860DFD">persistent faith</span><span class="csA521DC07">, she swore, taking an oath before the Lord that she would not leave Elisha unless he went back with her. Filled with compassion for this dear mother, Elisha arose and followed her to the home he had visited so often, the home where death now ruled.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Rushing on ahead, the servant Gehazi reached the dead child and laid the staff on the boy&#39;s face. But there was no response. The boy was not restored to life. So the servant rushed back to meet Elisha and the boy&#39;s mother to report what had happened.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The miraculous reward of the woman&#39;s </span><span class="csD3860DFD">persistent faith </span><span class="csA521DC07">(</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:32-37</span><span class="csA521DC07">). Finally arriving at the home, Elisha found the boy lying on the bed in the room that had been prepared for the prophet&#39;s visits. Shutting the door, the prophet began to pray to the Lord. At some point he stretched his body out upon the boy face-to-face, and the dead child&#39;s body began to grow warm (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:33-34</span><span class="csA521DC07">). Getting up off the child, Elisha began to pace the floor, continuing to pray (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:35</span><span class="csA521DC07">). Then once again he stretched out his body upon the boy. Immediately the boy sneezed seven times, and God revived the dead child. At that point, Elisha instructed his servant to call the woman (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:36-37</span><span class="csA521DC07">). As she entered the room, her first sight was of Elisha holding the child in his arms; then she heard the prophet instruct her to take the child. But this she did not do. Rushing toward the prophet and her son, she fell at Elisha&#39;s feet and bowed to the ground showing gratitude and worship to the Lord. Before long she arose and tenderly took her son into her arms. She then went out to spend some precious moments with the son who had been raised from the dead and given life by the power of God (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Kings 4:36-37</span><span class="csA521DC07">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">What a hope! To be raised from the dead! This is the wonderful lesson for us in this passage. God is going to raise the dead: all believers to live with Him eternally and all unbelievers to be separated from Him eternally. The wonderful hope of believers is the glorious resurrection when the Lord Jesus Christ returns to this earth. When we are raised from the dead we will receive our </span><span class="csD3860DFD">permanent bodies</span><span class="csA521DC07">, bodies that will be perfected, free of all disease and aging, pain and suffering, deformity and defect. Just as this small child was raised from the dead and returned to the Shunammite mother, so we will be raised from the dead.
