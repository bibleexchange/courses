Reynolds, Sr.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">May 14, 2006</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Sunday Night</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Title: Piercing Their Conscience</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Text: </span><span class="cs680D5D61"> 2 Corinthians 4:2</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs680D5D61">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">To be an Overcomer you must be one that has come through some hard places.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Your carnal mind will never encourage you to pray or to keep the fire burning in your soul.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Follow after what the Holy Ghost is doing. Is my life a visual expression of Jesus?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Our lives need to show a clear unwavering stance, by manifestation of the truth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">There are many that use the Word of God deceitfully.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">We have the promises and an open door, but there is a process and stages of growth that we must pass through. The power of the Holy Ghost can take me there. (OVERCOMING) Don&rsquo;t misapply the truth. Stay in line with the truth. </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> Yes He requires some things of me, but unless He works something in me then I will never change. All we&rsquo;ll have is a good though, good person, good opinion that in time when the pressure gets high will crumble and faint. We should not be excusing our sin as we do in this hour. Sin is wicked and evil in the sight of God. Don&rsquo;t&rsquo; excuse your sin. We give too much great to our carnal mind. Give God the praise that is due His name, If you are hurting then give God the praise and not your hurt. &ldquo;My soul will wait upon the Lord.&rdquo; Without His power and grace working in my heart I can do nothing. With Him working He will bestow in abundance His power and the promises will be made complete in my heart. I need His mercy. I need God to be merciful to me. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The things that I have allowed myself to be involved with is WORLDLINESS. Not questionable, you know it wrong, and in the face of truth you must make a decision. In the face of people&rsquo;s rejections we can show them Jesus and be REAL. V. 1 God has been good to us. We have received His mercy. He sends His messenger that we might know that His mercy will work for us again.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">To us that want to be that piercing messenger to the conscience of others, FAINT NOT. You will be tested.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">WE are out to see conviction in their hearts and show them Jesus. Not to condemn them only of their sin, but show t hem Jesus and let His words life in us to convict Him. It is worth it when God sets three men down and tells us to testify. Jobs comforters gave some good advice in some areas, but God did not send them to Job. Some things that God has sent to us is not for everyone else. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Faint not has to do with NO DOUBTING. It is those little thing sthat creep into the corners of our &nbsp;minds that cause us to doubt. How can a man read in the bible thirty sixty hundred and not see there is a difference. That was your deal that was what you believed me for. He si greater than for just one penny all day long. There is an experience to know God far great than we have known God to this point.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Let us be near Him as His messenger and laborer. Let us not allow this to become a business or a job. He will reveal Himself and He will do what is right with us if we can understand His promises. IF there isa question then get hos questions answered. God will sometimes puts us through some extreme tests to see how weak we really are. If we rely on His mercy we don&rsquo;t have to faint.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">v. &nbsp;2 NO DISHONESTY&mdash;beings shamed; having shame; being disgraced ROMANS 1:16 Going to Hell with doubt is one thing, but it is another thing to go there with blood on your hands. You don&rsquo;t have to go that way. Tjhere is more for you. Some of us has taken this Bride message out of its base without setting down and asking God to help us attain to a life that is sinless. We are not event rying to &nbsp;get rid of sin and worldy activities. The Bride should not be something you have knowledge of alone, but you must receive it as a reality in your spirit where God is the closest one to you. The messenger shaming the message.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Not walking in craftiness. Luke 20:23. We don&rsquo;t love as we should, because we do not understand truth as we should. &nbsp;Lu 20:</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> God is dealing. We are not after one individual tonight, but the Holy Ghost can walk through this congregation tongith and touch things in your spirit. YOU KNOW BETTER. &nbsp;And Jesus says, WHY TEMPT YE ME? Trying to act one way while they do another. Job 5:13; I Cor. 3:19 </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Hold up the standards and Godly living higher than ever. Through the Sprit you are sanctified and the things that you once do you are justified. We need to harden our hearts to sin and not toward people. God is not an austere that is stern and hateful. There is no darkness in Him His nature is light. There is no compromise in Him. Hate sin and don&rsquo;t get tempted by it. Ephesians 4:14-</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> Don&rsquo;t walk in darkness. NO craftiness, no subtility. People are compromising with the things of this world. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">2 Cor. 4:2 No handling the word of God deceitfully. It is one thing to never hear the truth and is another thing to hear it and it doesn&rsquo;t touch you.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">SOS 3:9</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs8C9D0446">King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Song 3:10 </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">PAVED: Embroidery of bright shining stones. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Who do we really love? PROVE IT, don&rsquo;t just say it. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">God doesn&rsquo;t bless us with Good clean feelings just to make us feel good. He gives it to us because we need it. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Sometimes we say too much. </span></p></body>
