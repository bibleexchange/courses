"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most emotional
subjects and the closest to our hearts is that of sons and fathers. Parents
have much invested in their children and they occupy an important part of our
being. We spend about eighteen years of our lives providing for and having our
children as a primary focus, they are most of our hopes, aspirations, and
dreams. We would gladly give our lives for our children, our love for them is
so deep and profound. Indeed, children present a great challenge and
responsibility (Eph. 6: 4). Children are presented in the Bible as a blessing
and delight (Ps. 127: 3-5). They genetically represent us and continue our seed
after we cease the activities of this world. There are many extant false
notions regarding children. Not only are these beliefs erroneous, but they are
also such that often add to the heartache and grief sometimes associated with
children. These beliefs are rampant within and without the Lord's church and
characteristic of all types of people. We shall observe some Bible truths about
children and also challenge some of the false beliefs by considering some godly
sons of ungodly fathers and some ungodly sons of godly fathers. Does it appear
that I have made a mistake in my wording and grouping? Should it have only
been, godly sons of godly fathers and ungodly sons of ungodly fathers? Many
believe that children absolutely are what they are taught and what they see as
a role model. The Bible does emphatically teach the immense importance of godly
parenting, please do not misunderstand me, but the Bible also teaches
&quot;free moral agency.&quot; If children are simply and only a product of
parental influence, then children would not be responsible for how they turn
out as adults, the parents would shoulder total responsibility. However, the
Bible presents children (&quot;adults&quot;) as responsible and answering for
themselves (Prov. 13: 1, see addendum). </span></p>

reflect their training without active participation, choice, and personal
contribution, this scenario would present an incongruity. </span></p>

example of a godly son of an ungodly father. Josiah stands out in Bible history
as one of the most eminent kings of Judah. Josiah was eight years old when he
began his &quot;reign&quot; (2 Kgs. 22: 1). Josiah was an unusually righteous
and godly man (2 Kgs. 22: 2). Josiah addressed idolatry and made sweeping
reforms (2 Kgs. 23). Both Josiah's grandfather and his father, though, were
infamously wicked (2 Kgs. 21: 16-18; 18, 20-22). </span></p>

wicked father. Hezekiah was the second righteous king to reign over Judah. We
read of his reign in 2 Kings 18. Hezekiah was a great and godly man. However,
as spiritually great as Hezekiah was, his father, Ahaz, was ungodly (2 Kgs. 16:
2, 4). </span></p>

Judah's first righteous king (I Kgs. 15: 8, 11-14). The amazing matter is how
Asa was so godly while his father, Abijam, was so wicked (I Kgs. 15: 3). </span></p>

person, caring and sensitive (I Sam. 18: 1, 3, 19: 2, 4, 5, 20: 4, 9). Saul, to
the converse, was denounced as a spiritual rebel (I Sam. 15: 26). </span></p>

&quot;…and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right
in the sight of the Lord his God, like David his father…(Jotham was literally
the father of Ahaz, 2 Kgs. 15: 38, dm) but…made his son to pass through the
fire, according to the abominations of the heathen…and he sacrificed and burnt incense
in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree…&quot; 2 Kgs.
16: 2-4). The wicked behavior of Ahaz is in sharp contrast with the godly life
of his father, Jotham (2 Kgs. 15; 33, 34). We read thus of Jotham: &quot;And he
did that which was right in the sight of the Lord…&quot; (2 Kgs. 15: 34,

wicked men mentioned in the Bible and, yet, his father was the godly Hezekiah.
Mannasseh has gone down in history as probably being the worst king to ever
reign over Judah (2 Kgs. 21: 1-7, 11, 12, 16). The wicked deeds of Mannasseh
are both aggressive and reprehensible to the point that most would think that
surely Mannasseh had to have had a terrible childhood that promoted and
nurtured degeneracy. However, it would be difficult to read of a more righteous
father than Hezekiah (2 Kgs. 18: 5-7). </span></p>

righteous prophet and judge than Samuel is not seen in the Bible and, yet,
Samuel had two of the most wicked sons, Joel and Abijah. Joel and Abijah did
the unthinkable by taking bribes and perverting justice (I Sam. 8: 2-5).
Notwithstanding, the virtuous nature of Samuel is not questioned or marred (I
Sam. 16, Ps. 99: 6, Heb. 11: 32). </span></p>

godly father is seen in Esau and Isaac. Esau frivolously sold his birthright,
which resulted in enormous consequences (Gen. 25: 27-34, Heb. 12: 16, 17).
However, Isaac is consistently presented as spiritually stable (Matt. 22: 32,
Heb. 11: 20, Gal. 4: 21-31). The fact of the matter is, there are more ungodly
sons of godly fathers mentioned in the Bible than godly sons of ungodly

environment and physical heredity as of great importance, the Bible also
presents man as the master of his own destiny (Gen. 4: 7). Man can and often
does rise above a spiritually disadvantageous background. To the contrary, some
reject all the spiritual advantages that were offered to them by their parents.
Parents and children each have their respective responsibilities and each must
give an account (Eph. 6: 1, 4).</span></p>

to their grave sorrowing over a child that did not turn out as desired. To
compound their grief, some have unjustly blamed themselves. Some are heard
charging, &quot;if the children do not turn out to be Christians, it is the
parent's fault, they have failed!&quot; Beloved, it could be that the parents
will give an account and are part of the failure, however, this conclusion that
fault must automatically be assumed is faulty and even sinful. </span></p>

good model for study. Eli and Samuel both had sons who turned out badly. In the
case of Eli, we read: &quot;For I have told him that I will judge his house for
ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile,
and he restrained them not&quot; (I Sam. 3: 13, cp. 2: 12-17). Eli is held
accountable for the conduct of his children because he had failed to exercise
parental duties. </span></p>

great disappointment and spiritual hindrance to the cause of God. We read of
Samuel's sons: &quot;And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside
after lucre, and took bribes and perverted judgment&quot; (I Sam. 8: 3). While
Samuel's sons were a manifest hindrance, Samuel was not held responsible for
their conduct and he continued to be used by God (I Sam. 8ff.). </span></p>

extreme views add to the hurt already experienced by grieving parents, but such
views often disrupt whole churches. Godly elders are sometimes told, &quot;You
must resign because your thirty year old child denounced Christ!&quot; Such
views are usually a misunderstanding of &quot;faithful children&quot; and
&quot;ruleth well his own house&quot; (Tit. 1: 6, I Tim. 3: 4, I believe
&quot;faithful children&quot; in Titus 1: 6 is tantamount to &quot;ruleth well
his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity&quot; in I
Timothy 3: 4. Hence, &quot;faithful children&quot; is referring to the father's
rule and the children's subjection, therefore, &quot;faithful children&quot;
does not mean &quot;Christians,&quot; as such). The overseer must indeed rule
his own house (control and superintend), but this &quot;rule&quot; does not
mean that he can order, demand, and make his children form a saved relationship
with Christ, no more than he can order, demand, and make the members where he serves
maintain a saved relationship (see I Tim. 3: 4, 5). Such a view contradicts
free moral agency. Also, this rule pertains to his house or his children who
are under his immediate rule, those at home.&nbsp; (For a more complete study

our nurturing and ourselves. Bringing a child into this world is a great
spiritual responsibility that demands much prayer, thought, and provision, both
material and spiritual. One of the worse things that I can imagine as a parent
is to see one of my children be told on that &quot;Great Day,&quot;
&quot;Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
and his angels&quot; (Matt. 25: 41). However, even worse would be the
realization that I contributed to their rejection by failing to responsibly
exercise my duties as a parent. &quot;And, ye fathers, provoke not your
children to wrath,&quot; wrote Paul, &quot;but bring them up in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord&quot; (Eph. 6: 4). </span></p>

containing the statement, &quot;Train up a child in the way (literally, &quot;a
way,&quot; dm) he should go: and when he is old he will not depart from
it&quot; is what scholars call a general Proverb (there are proverbs that are
absolute and allow no exception, see Proverbs 6: 32). Proverbs 22: 6 falls into
the same category as, &quot;Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and
obtaineth favour of the Lord&quot; (Prov. 18: 22). While Proverbs 18: 22 is
often true, there are recognized exceptions, Proverbs 21: 9. In like manner,
Proverbs 22: 6 is not meant to be understood as an absolute statement,
containing no exceptions to the rule. To apply 22: 6 to the spiritual and allow
no exceptions is to teach &quot;once saved, always saved,&quot; preclude free
moral agency, and create a circumstance of ineludible biblical contradiction. </span></p>

"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term &quot;elder&quot; is
used two ways in the scriptures: There are those who are elders simply because
of age, older men and women (I Tim. 5: 1, 2). There is also the official use of
the word &quot;elders&quot; to denote special men who meet certain
qualifications and are appointed to the work of overseeing the congregation
where they serve (Tit. 1: 5; I Pet. 5: 1-4). It is this latter use of
&quot;elder&quot; that we shall herein explore. The scriptures do not teach the
modern denominational &quot;pastoral system of government&quot; in which the
local preacher presides over the local church. Rather, &quot;And when they had
ordained them elders in every church…&quot; (Acts 14: 23). It is evident that
these special men were very important to the well being and function of the
early church (Acts 11: 30; 15: 4; 20: 17; I Pet. 5: 1-4). In fact, the local
church is not fully organized in government unless there are elders present
(cp. Tit. 1: 5). Elders and preachers or evangelists are not necessarily the
same men. One can be an elder/preacher (if they meet the extra qualifications)
or one can be simply an elder or preacher. Timothy was an evangelist who worked
with the elders in the church at Ephesus (I Tim. 5: 17-22, 2 Tim. 4: 1-5).
Peter was an apostle (preacher) and elder (I Pet. 5: 1-4). In the case of
elders, there was always more than one or a multiplicity (Acts 14: 23, Phili.
1: 1). </span></p>

"Times New Roman",serif'>. The organization of a local church consists of
bishops (elders), deacons, and members (Phili. 1: 1). The need of elders is
seen in the work God has assigned to them. Elders are to be examples to the
flock, take the oversight (superintend), and take heed to the flock (I Pet. 5:
3; I Pet. 5: 2; Acts 20: 28). Elders have the responsibility of tending to the
flock, watching for grievous wolves, and stopping the mouths of vain talkers or
purveyors of error (I Pet. 5: 1, 2, ASV; Acts 20: 29-31; Tit. 1: 9-11). Elders
are not businessmen simply in charge of the secular or monetary workings of the
local church, but rather they are to be engaged in a spiritual work of soul
keeping. </span></p>

terms used to denote the leaders of God's people</span></b><span

Greek words used regarding the overseers of God's people. There is the word
presbuterion or presbuteros. From this word we have the English word
&quot;elders&quot; and &quot;presbytery&quot; (Tit. 1: 5; I Tim. 4: 14).
&quot;Overseer&quot; and &quot;bishop&quot; are derived from the Greek
episcopos (Acts 20: 28; I Tim. 3: 1). From poimen we have the English
&quot;shepherd&quot; and &quot;pastor&quot; ( I Pet. 5: 2, 4; Eph. 4: 11).
These three Greek words and the resultant six English words all denote the same
function and group of men. Presbuteros (elders/presbytery) suggests one who is
mature in age and spiritual development. Episcopos (overseer/bishop) involves
ruling ability (Heb. 13: 7, 17, cp. I Tim. 3: 4 and 5: 17), and poimen
(shepherd/pastor) indicates the care and watchfulness these men are to give to
the flock, the local church. </span></p>

qualifications that perspective overseers must meet (as I have them arranged).
These requirements are listed in I Timothy 3: 1-7 and Titus 1: 6-9. These qualifications
are not optional and all of them are required (the word dei, &quot;must&quot;
means &quot;it is necessary,&quot; see I Tim. 3:2, 7). We shall at this point
list them. Since most of the controversy revolves around &quot;the husband of
one wife&quot; and &quot;faithful children,&quot; I shall leave these domestic
requirements until last so more detailed treatment can be given to them.</span></p>

Paul wrote, &quot;This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a
bishop, he desireth a good work&quot; (I Tim. 3: 1). The prospective shepherd
must rule well his own house (vs. 4, see vs. 2, &quot;husband of one
wife&quot;). The scriptures are plain regarding the leaders of the church being
male. The role of women in the church is not that of leadership (I Tim. 2: 8
ff.). The movement in the denominational world and even in some churches of

The Holy Spirit could have worded this requirement a number of ways. For
instance, He could have said &quot;the bishop must be married.&quot; This would
mean that he is required to be married, but would not have precluded polygamy
(more than one wife). He could have said, &quot;the bishop must not be a

required a marriage state. &quot;The bishop must have been married only
once,&quot; was another choice. This would prohibit polygamy, but would not

possible constructions, the Spirit wrote, &quot;the bishop must be the husband
of one wife.&quot; This construction requires marriage (present marriage) but
forbids polygamy. </span></p>

with the Greek grammar is when they use such works as <u>Young's Analytical
Concordance</u>, they see teknon listed as the word in I Timothy 3: 4 and Titus
1: 6 (teknon is either nominative, accusative, or vocative singular or genitive
or ablative plural, see the declension of omicron nouns using ergon in <u>Beginner's
Grammar of the Greek New Testament</u>, 5th Edition, pg. 33, 34, by William
Hersey Davis). Rather than providing grammatical detail, Young's concordance
just presents the nominative singular form of our word. However, the actual
word in I Timothy 3: 3 and Titus 1: 6 is tekna, plural in number. Plurals and
singulars are not interchangeable. However, this is not to say that the plural
does not include the singular. A determination of the singular application or
inclusion when the plural is used is more a matter of interpretation.</span></p>

what is called plurals of class. Plurals of class involve the plural form being

Lunemann, pg. 175 and <u>A Grammar of the Greek New Testament</u>, by A. T.
Robertson, pg. 408, Heb. 1: 2; 9: 8, are given as examples of plurals of
class). There are a number of examples that fall under the heading of plural of
class. For instance, the children (tekna, plural) of a widow are to assist
their mother/widow (I Tim. 5: 4). We know that tekna in this case includes
teknon (a single son/grandson) because verse eight mentions a single son or
grandson. However, there is not anything in the context of I Timothy 3: 4 to
indicate the presence of the plural of class (the scriptures recognize plurals
and singulars, Gal. 3: 16, notice &quot;seed,&quot; opermati, and
&quot;seeds,&quot; opermasin). It must be remembered that plural of class is
the exception and not the rule. Just because plural of class occurs in some cases
does not mean it can be argued as present when there is no reason for such an
assignment. </span></p>

Paul had no other way to have worded this qualification. If the Holy Spirit had
said, &quot;having a faithful child,&quot; then more than one child would not
be permissible.&quot; This argument sounds convincing and lends credence to the
plural contains the singular; therefore, the elder may have only one child and
serve. The problem is the Holy Spirit could have easily worded the requirement
so that one child or a plurality would be meant. In fact, the Spirit did
precisely this in the case of the domestic requirements for deacons. A
prospective deacon may have one child or children and be qualified. Consider
the construction of the requirement: &quot;Let the deacons be the husbands of
one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well&quot; (I Tim. 3: 12).
Notice how the Spirit used &quot;deacons&quot; (plural) with
&quot;children&quot; (plural). The plural used with the plural means one or
more children are meant. In the case of the elder, though, you have this
construction: &quot;One (singular, dm) that ruleth well his own house, having
his children (plural, dm) in subjection with all gravity&quot; (I Tim. 3: 4,
see vs. 1-3 and Titus 1: 6). It is evident that Paul wanted the plural in the
case of the children understood as more than one child. As far as the reason
for requiring more than one child, I can only speculate. I do know that there
is by far more challenge in raising children (addressing the problems they have
with each other) than in raising just one child. The elder will be dealing with
people (plurality) in the church and often having to address their conflicts
and relationship problems. Having raised children (plural) better qualifies him
for the task he will be facing. </span></p>

&quot;faithful&quot; (pistos, Tit. 1: 6) does not inherently mean Christian.
Instead of pistos (pista), Paul could have written christianos (Christian) in

KJV) is found sixty-six times in the Greek New Testament. Although pistos is
used in connection with those who believe in God, it has the basic meaning of
reliable. Vine comments thus on the passive and active meaning of pistos:
&quot;(a) Passive, faithful, to be trusted, reliable, said of God…Active,
signifying believing, trusting , relying…&quot; (<u>Expository Dictionary of
New Testament Words</u>). One can readily appreciate how pistos is used
relative to Christians. Paul addressed the Ephesian Letter to the
&quot;faithful (pistos, dm) in Christ Jesus&quot; (Eph. 1: 1). The saved are
here said to be reliable and trusting, they rely and trust in God. As is the
case with so many &quot;ambiguous&quot; words, though, the usage in a
particular setting determines the full meaning. Paul had been found pistos by
the Lord (I Tim. 1: 12). Here pistos is used of Paul while he was Saul of
Tarsus, before he was a Christian (Acts 9; 22; 26). Even before Saul was a
Christian, he possessed certain qualities that constituted pistos. Saul was
trusting in the rule and discipline that he had accepted as a devout Jew. We
read of a &quot;faithful&quot; (pistos) and &quot;wise&quot; servant, one who
was reliable in the charge of taking care of the assigned household (Matt. 24:
45). Regarding stewards in general, faithfulness (pistos) was required (I Cor.
4: 2). As noticed, pistos can and is used to describe reliability regarding the
Christian in his relationship with God and to a number of relationship
applications that do not immediately involve being a Christian. Again, the
particular usage and context must decide the application of pistos. </span></p>

in mind the subjection of the children to their father's rule when he wrote to
Timothy (I Tim. 3: 3, 4). In view of pistos being &quot;ambiguous&quot; and the
context determining the exact application, I submit that Paul had in mind
subjection to the father's rule when he wrote to Titus &quot;faithful children.&quot;
In fact, the converse or opposite in Titus 1: 6 is not simply non-Christian but
&quot;riot and unruly.&quot; Riot (asotia) means profligacy and unruly
(anupotaktos) means not subject to rule (<u>Expository Dictionary of New

established their own households (cp. Gen. 2: 24). It is also apparent from
both texts that all his children under his rule are to be pistos. The man rules
his house and his children are not out of control. In some families the
children rule. I spent a short time with an &quot;elder&quot; who had three
children. Two had been baptized but all three were not subject to his rule. He
issued orders but they disobeyed and mocked him. Not long after my stay, the
church experienced division, the elders were not ruling (two out of the three
were not). </span></p>

challenge of avoiding extreme positions anytime we study the scriptures. Some
want to compromise in setting aside qualifications that God has bound, in the
case of elders, others attempt to bind where God never bound. The view held by
some requires matters of elders that are beyond their control. Men can teach
their children, set a good example, and exercise headship (rule), however, they
can not always be held responsible for any of their children not being
Christians, especially those who are out on their on (it is recommended that

between the domestic and spiritual rule of elders (I Tim. 3: 3, 4)? Those who
want to bind the children being Christians and claim a man is disqualified if
ever he has a child to go astray, will not make a consistent argument regarding
the spiritual side of the comparison, the rule in the local church.
&quot;Elders cannot be held responsible for a member who falls away, especially
after they have done all they can to teach and persuade,&quot; they explain and
I agree. However, these same people often claim that anytime a child goes
astray, the man ceases to be qualified. While parents exert great influence on
their children, we must realize children have minds of their own, especially
when they go out on their own (see Prov. 3: 1-12, 4: 1-13). We tend to forget
that children are held responsible which is indicative of their own free moral
agency, &quot;…A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the
heaviness of his mother, &quot; wrote the wise man (Prov. 10: 1). The Law of
Moses did not automatically assign failure to parents whose children did not
turn out right (Deut. 21: 18 ff., see Ezek. 18: 1-13). Godly fathers must rule
but they cannot legislate Christianity (each person elects to become a
Christian). While this is the case, most children at home who are of
accountable age will probably become Christians (cp. Acts 10: 2, 44-48; 16:
34). Alas, many of these will fall away when they are removed from their
father's influence. </span></p>

time is spent observing only whether or not the children have been baptized
instead of observing the father's rule (they are not exactly the same thing).
Men are too often appointed who have children who have been baptized (often the
result of their mother's teaching), but they have no ruling ability (cp. Heb.
13: 7, 17, I Thes. 5: 12, I Pet. 5: 2, 3). As a result of lack of ruling
ability (the very thing required in I Timothy 3: 3, 4 and Titus 1: 6),
insurrections commonly occur in local churches (cp. Tit. 1: 9-11).</span></p>

Samuel and Eli as fathers is very profitable (I Sam. 8; 3). Eli's sons did not
turn out well. Eli was held responsible for the behavior of his sons (I Sam. 3:
13). After a similar fashion, Samuel's sons were a disappointment. However,
Samuel continued to serve in his capacity as leader of God's people with God's
approval (I Sam. 8). What was the difference in the circumstances involving Eli
and Samuel as fathers? In the case of Eli, we are expressly told, &quot;and he
restrained them not&quot; (I Sam. 3: 13). However, it is evident that Samuel
exonerated himself in regards to his parental duties. Samuel is one of the
greatest men mentioned in the Bible, one of the few regarding whom no fault is
stated. In the person of Samuel we can see the principle of &quot;…neither
shall the father bear the iniquity of the son…&quot; (Ezek. 18: 20). In fact,
Ezekiel presents an unquestionably godly father producing an ungodly son (Ezek.
18: 5-13). The ungodly son in no way diminished from the godliness of the
father. Some have erroneously used Proverbs 22: 6 in an effort to prove that
when a child goes astray, the parents are to blame. However, Proverbs 22: 6
(&quot;Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old he will not
depart from it&quot;) is stating a general truth and not an absolute law (cp.
18: 22 with 21: 9). What I am attempting to say is, the prospective elder's
family must be considered, but he is not to be automatically rejected because
&quot;he has a child who has fallen away.&quot;&nbsp; (It is recommended that

font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&quot; (click on to read), but there is
much misunderstanding relative to this subject so that the truth needs to be
clearly set forth. Also, the office (function) of deacons is involved in the
organization of the church that Jesus built (cp. Phili. 1: 1). For some reason,
many tend to doctrinally and practically intermingle the separate functions of
preacher, pastors, and deacons. A preacher can also serve as one of the
pastors, but he is not &quot;the&quot; pastor (cf. I Pet. 5: 1, 2). Elders,
pastors, or overseers are always spoken of in the plural relative to serving in
a local church (cp. Acts 14: 23). Deacons and elders are clearly distinguished
as different men with different attendant work. There are three Greek words
used regarding the overseers of God's people. There is the word presbuterion or
presbuteros (denoting age and maturity), episcopos suggests the ruling ability
of overseers, and poimen involves the responsibility of these men to shepherd
the flock (Tit. 1: 5, I Tim. 4: 14; Acts 20: 28, I Tim. 3: 1; I Pet. 5: 2, 4,
Eph. 4: 11). These men are called, respectively, elders, presbytery; overseers,
bishops; and shepherds, pastors. Based on these three Greek words, we see that
these men are older and that their work consists of overseeing and shepherding
the flock or local church. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Deacon&quot; is derived
from the Greek diakonos. Diakonos simply means &quot;servant.&quot; We read of
domestic servants, civil servants, and then, the focus of our study, deacons in
the church (Jn. 2: 5, 9; Rom. 13: 4; I Tim. 3: 8, the minister, diakonos, of
the gospel is a servant pertaining to teaching the word, I Tim. 4: 6). All
Christians are servants, but deacons are special servants who, like elders and
preachers, meet specific qualifications (I Tim. 3: 8-10, 12). The
&quot;likewise&quot; shows that just as the men who have met certain
qualifications and are appointed by the church to oversee; deacons also must
meet certain qualifications and be appointed by the church (I Tim. 3: 8, see
vs. 1-7). Notwithstanding the separation made in the scriptures between elders
or pastors and deacons, some teach that deacons may oversee a local church.
Denominations that have the pastoral system of government (the preacher
oversees the church), often recognize deacon oversight, especially in the
absence of a preacher (&quot;pastor&quot;). Consider the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&quot;They
(deacons, dm) are to have charge of the sick and needy members, and are also to
act as counselors and assistants to the pastor in advancing the general
interests of the body. In the absence of a pastor it becomes the duty of the
deacons to conduct the devotional meetings, provide for the supply of the
pulpit and administer the affairs of the body generally&quot; (<u>The Hiscox
Guide for Baptist Churches</u>, pg. 72). </span></b></p>

margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word diakonos is
indicative of the work of these special men (see the addendum regarding
deaconesses and other matters). In view of the spiritual oversight of elders,
the work of deacons is primarily physical (there is spiritual administering
also involved, see I Tim. 3: 13). H. E. Phillips wrote thus regarding their
work:</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&quot;The
administration to the physical needs of the church goes further than just to
the looking after the widows, orphans, and the poor (Phillips has earlier
referred to Acts 6, dm). Constant service is needed at every worship service.
Ushers are needed. The preparation of the building and all elements of the
worship, such as the emblems for the Lord's Supper, the distribution of song
books, distribution of tracts, etc., must be done. This is directly the work of
deacons. The preparation of the building, heating or ventilation must be done.
The general care of the grounds and buildings come directly in line with the
nature of the work of the deacons. In general the nature of the work done by
deacons is easily determined, but specific duties are assigned by the
elders&quot; (<u>Scriptural Elders and Deacons</u>, pg. 272). </span></b></p>

"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have pointed to the
example of the seven men who were appointed to serve the material needs of the
widows in Acts 6 as an example of deacons. While these men are not called
&quot;deacons&quot; as such, we do find the resident words diakonia
(&quot;ministration&quot; in verse one) and diakonein (&quot;serve&quot; tables
in verse two). These seven men also had to meet certain qualifications. Indeed,
their work would be similar to the work deacons would later perform; however,
the qualifications are different. For instance, there are no domestic
requirements found in Acts 6: 3, 5 compared to I Timothy 3: 12. Therefore, I
would not refer to these seven men as being deacons in the &quot;official&quot;
sense of the word. </span></p>

careful in the selection of elders, but careless in the matter of deacons. This
ought not to be for several reasons. First of all, there is equal stress placed
on the must of these men meeting qualifications before their appointment.
Second of all, new elders are usually selected from those already serving as
deacons. These nine requirements, as mentioned, must be in place anterior to
the appointment, they are not to be appointed and then allowed to &quot;grow
into the requirement.&quot; As with elders, these requirements must be
individually possessed, not simply collectively possessed. Let us now briefly
consider each of these nine qualifications.</span></p>

&quot;likewise&quot; (hosautos) indicates the seriousness of prospective
deacons possessing these requirements (see the repeated occurrence of
&quot;must,&quot; dei, vs. 2, 7). &quot;Grave&quot; (semnous) is reflective of
a basically serious man as opposed to a flippant, silly sort of personality. </span></p>

a local church as he moves among the members saying contradictory things. </span></p>

&quot;Not given to wine&quot; (I Tim. 3: 3). Some have fallaciously concluded
that in the case of the elder, he must not drink alcohol; while in the case of
the deacon, he may drink, but not &quot;much.&quot; The language in verses
three and eight is different. &quot;Not given to wine&quot; in verse three is
mn parionon and &quot;…not given to much wine&quot; in verse eight is, mn pollo
oino prosechontas. Hence, literally &quot;not (mn) given to wine
(parionon)&quot; (vs. 3) and &quot;not (mn) to much (pollo) wine (oino) given
or addicted (prosechontas)&quot; (vs. 8). Rather than concluding that in the
case of the elder, he must not drink alcohol; while in the case of the deacon,
he may drink but not &quot;much,&quot; the conclusion should be, using this
logic, that the elder is not to be &quot;given&quot; to any amount and the
deacon is not to be &quot;given&quot; to much wine. While the wine prohibition
for both elders and deacons may involve excess, the Bible teaches against the
&quot;recreational&quot; use of strong drink to the point of total avoidance
(Prov. 23: 31, 32). Paul's focus in the case of deacons and elders,
respectively, appears to be excess and the effect of fermented drink (I Tim. 3:
8, 3, see the American Standard rendering of verse three, &quot;No

prospective deacon must have an established track record before he is
considered (I Tim. 3: 6). Appointing a man to serve as a deacon before he is
prepared is not only unscriptural and injurious to the church, but it can be
very discouraging to the man. I say this because he will not have the ability
to perform his work. In the language, &quot;use the office of a deacon&quot; or
&quot;let them minister&quot; (Marshall, <u>Nestle Greek-English Interlinear</u>),
Paul is showing that there is work to be done as opposed to simply being a
figure head or only holding an honorary position. </span></p>

them so high that they are unattainable. In this latter vein, some believe
&quot;blameless&quot; means without sin. This cannot be the idea because
&quot;all sin&quot; (I Jn. 1: 8-10). The meaning of &quot;blameless&quot;
(aneykletoi) is simply that the man being considered does not have some fault
to which others can point. Translations that translate aneykletoi
&quot;irreproachable&quot; do justice to the original. </span></p>

our study, the organization of local churches involves the &quot;saints,&quot;
the &quot;bishops,&quot; and the &quot;deacons&quot; (Phili. 1: 1). While it is
true that all of the requirements for being a deacon are generally taught regarding
all Christians, except the marriage and children qualification, deacons have a
serious work to perform and can either be an asset or liability, depending on
how well they possess these requisites. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>: In a study of
&quot;deacons,&quot; the question is often raised about &quot;deaconesses&quot;
(female servants of the church). Some would hastily say that the Bible knows
nothing of &quot;deaconesses.&quot; The truth of the matter is
&quot;deaconesses&quot; are mentioned. Paul referred to &quot;…Phebe our
sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea&quot; (Rom. 16:
1). &quot;Servant&quot; is from diakonon. The grammar of diakonon in Romans 16:
1 is &quot;accusative, singular, masculine and feminine&quot; (<u>The
Analytical Greek Lexicon</u>, pg. 91). Phebe, then, was a deacon or deaconess,
as we would say in English. The question, though, is what was meant. Was Phebe
simply a female servant who ministered in some way or was she a one of special
women who served equally along side of deacons. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some believe I Timothy 3: 11
is referring to deaconesses. The verse is literally rendered, &quot;Women in
like manner <b><i>must</i></b> be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in
all things&quot; (ASV). The common position is that these women were the
deacon's wives (see vs. 8-10, 12). If so, why was there nothing said regarding
the wives of elders? Others contend that the women were the wives and the
deacons and elders. However, why are they only mentioned in the middle of the
qualifications for deacons? A growing number are of the persuasion that the
women were deaconesses, female deacons. If this is the case, why are they not
separately and clearly mentioned and addressed as were the elders and deacons?
Could it be that these women were not necessarily the elders or deacon's wives
or female deacons as such, but that these women were simply female servants who
might assist the deacons? In view of the social distinctions and barriers
especially in the First Century society regarding men and women, deacons would
have had a number of impediments in assisting the female sick and infirm, etc. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I certainly have to
admit the existence of female servants in the early church, I do not believe
these women were deaconesses, on an equal level with deacons. Again, the fact
of female servants such as Phebe who were used by churches cannot be denied,
but even these women would have to meet certain requirements (perhaps I Tim. 3:
11). If I Timothy 3: 11 is referring to deaconesses just as verses 8-10 and 12
are referring to deacons, why the qualification difference? For instance, they
are not required to be married or have children as is the case relative to
deacons. One danger in officially appointing women to serve as deacons, besides
the foregoing matters, is that such can be just one step away from appointing
them to serve as elders, knowing how man thinks and works (women are excluded
from serving as elders, I Tim. 3: 1-5, I Tim. 2: 12-15). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On occasion the question is
raised regarding a church having deacons but not having elders, is such
scriptural? Many point to Acts 6: 1-7 and argue that the church in Jerusalem
had deacons but no elders. To make this argument, certain matters must be
assumed. First, these seven men are not called &quot;deacons&quot; and the
qualifications are not the same as those found in I Tim. 3. Second, while
&quot;elders&quot; as applied to &quot;bishops&quot; is not mentioned until
Acts 11: 30, it is apparent that elders were already in place in Judaea. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a present and real
danger with a church having deacons in the absence of elders. Without rulers
(bishops, elders, Acts 20: 17, 28, I Tim. 3: 4, 5), a church tends to place
more overseeing duties on deacons and deacons themselves face the risk of
moving into the position of oversight. Deacons, I repeat, have no spiritual
oversight of a local church assigned to them in the scriptures. </span></p>

margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some also ask about the case
of just one man being qualified to serve as a deacon, should the church appoint
him? All I can say is that such male servants are spoken of as in a plurality.
The same is the case regarding presbyters or bishops (Acts 14: 23). </span></p>
