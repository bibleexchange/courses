Fannin and Samuel Houston for assistance had gone unheeded and thought to be exaggerated. No relief from them was sent. As the Battle of the Alamo was in progress, a part of the Texas Army had assembled in Gonzales under the command of Mosely Baker in the latter part of February. From this army, a gallant band of 32 courageous men under the command of George C. Kimble left to join the garrison at the Alamo. Making their way through the enemy lines, these 32 men joined the doomed defenders and perished with them.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">On March 2, 1836, during the siege of the Alamo, Texas independence was declared.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">On March 6, 1836, the document was signed with the blood shed at the Alamo. It was under such conditions that Travis and his men fought off the much larger force under Santa Anna.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">Joe 2:17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and </span><span class="cs43A01114">give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them</span><span class="cs71C8385E">: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs60E2BDE1"><span class="cs71C8385E">The Altar of Liberty</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;It was with the love of liberty in his voice and the courage of the faithful and brave that Travis gave his men the none too cheerful choice of the manner in which they wished to die.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">Realizing that no help could be expected from the outside and that Santa Anna would soon take the Alamo, Travis addressed his men, told them that they were fated to die for the cause of liberty and the freedom of Texas. Their only choice was in which way they would make the sacrifice.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;He outlined three procedures to them:</span></p><p class="cs24C73A18"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;First, rush the enemy, killing a few but being slaughtered themselves in the hand-to-hand fight by the overpowering Mexican force; </span></p><p class="cs52F6FAD7"><span class="cs71C8385E">Second, to surrender, which would eventually result in their massacre by the Mexicans, or, </span></p><p class="cs8B78FAA0"><span class="cs71C8385E">Third, to remain in the Alamo and defend it until the last man, thus giving the Texas army more time to form and likewise taking a greater toll among the Mexicans.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">The third choice was the one taken by the men. Their fate was death and they faced it bravely, asking no quarter and giving none. The siege of the Alamo ended on the dawn of March 6, when its gallant defenders were put to the sword. </span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">It was not an idle sacrifice that men like William Barret Travis, Davy Crockett and James Bowie made at the Alamo.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;It was a sacrifice on the altar of liberty.</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB13BA0AF"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="585" style="border-collapse:collapse;">
