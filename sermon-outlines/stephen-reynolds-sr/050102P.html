The Believer&rsquo;s Hope. &nbsp;There is something to hope for. There is a stirring of our faith to reach for things that we haven&rsquo;t seen and attained to before. His word is going deeper than it has ever gone before. This is the work of His Grace.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A world without God is without hope. &nbsp;The world without God has a wish has thoughts but there and he talks their big guns. &nbsp;The thoughts that we have tonight are based on the authority of the word of God. &nbsp;And I got for the Holy Ghost to teach us and take us beyond the surface Scripture interpret Scripture and he gives us insight that we may have clear understanding the way he is simple to do those otherwise to those that are willing to trust God and hope to God. &nbsp;I believe that there is an experience to the brings hope. &nbsp;And it makes that abound more and more as we grow and develop and sometimes we grow in certain areas and we grow without his help. &nbsp;We grow because of what we are for it. &nbsp;And it is unnecessary growth just like in the natural divine jester will come by and cut off the unnecessary growth because he&#39;s looking to produce fruit that will honor him and glorify him that all dumb by him. &nbsp;He&#39;s not looking just for something to be done but he is looking for his life his wisdom his grace and mercy working in our hearts. &nbsp;And all the things we try to add and put him in the Lord recognizes what is his working with these of him. &nbsp;And once of ourselves. &nbsp;He cuts away all the unnecessary growth in the things that would hinder good fruit from growing and developing. &nbsp;I think of first love in his care and helping us.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I like for you determine me to Psalm 119 verse 13. &nbsp;Some 119 verse 113. &nbsp;The way simple. &nbsp;When you follow the Lord. &nbsp;He says I hate vain thoughts. &nbsp;I hate being thoughts. &nbsp;He learned the thoughts were leading him to a dead end. &nbsp;The thoughts were leading him to areas where there were no fulfillment. &nbsp;There are thoughts that are empty their vain. &nbsp;And he went to heat them. &nbsp;Until you get to that place justice but the chair is saying just a few minutes ago where you hate saying you hate the thoughts of the flash you hate the thoughts of evil you hate the thoughts of this world and to you hated and you love God and you want him more than anything else the struggle will continue. &nbsp;The struggle and it&#39;s when you can understand who he is and what he&#39;s saying. &nbsp;He says I hate faint thoughts but Taiwan do I love. &nbsp;There&#39;s a process where you meditate and you think. &nbsp;And makes a difference for allow your mind and your emotions to carry you. &nbsp;David says I&#39;m not a leftist mind be carried away be in a place that is feigned NMC and discouraging and this pressed. &nbsp;He says I hate faint thoughts. &nbsp;If he thoughts that are just of my mind of my doings I love thy law. &nbsp;I want the law of God working in my members and working in mind my teaching me in developing mean making me to grow. &nbsp;And if we are willing to have the word of God in our life and follow all the laws of God you&#39;ll find that in a right growth god will give you understanding. &nbsp;God is requiring us to follow him just because he is calling us with courts of love in mercy and kindest cut is a good to us and however not we understand how good God is meant to us he is not willing to reveal his goodness to us and to we understand what he has given us it takes a taste of his goodness to open our eyes. &nbsp;But to lose we respond to that there&#39;s no guarantee of having any more. &nbsp;So many times people were main interests are in area and they&#39;re looking for God to do more and he is looking for us to do to do our part David says I hate vain thoughts. &nbsp;I hate just waiting and thinking that God is going to do this in God&#39;s couldn&#39;t do that and think that the SYSCON happened. &nbsp;I hate those thoughts. &nbsp;I want to know God. &nbsp;I want God to speak something within my heart and the demise. &nbsp;So that I&#39;m not going by guessing. &nbsp;Am wishing that God will do something I want to have God&#39;s promise. &nbsp;I want God to promise me something. &nbsp;And if I&#39;m going to have God promised me something I must be the place to be worthy of receiving that promise. &nbsp;God develops us as we keep his commandments and would love his law. &nbsp;He helps us understand his law understand his provision understand his promise how they times people live their lives the way they want to live and then expect God to reveal truth to them. &nbsp;They want to know the promises of God while they live according to the police in this world. &nbsp;Cox is a mark on the share my word with swine. &nbsp;I&#39;ll not cast my pearls before swine. &nbsp;He&#39;s not going to cast his exceeding great and precious promise since to those that will not abide in the law and the Word of God. &nbsp;And in verse 14 for thou art my hiding place I hope I hope I worked. &nbsp;I hope that my word by law do I love. &nbsp;You see he had confidence in the law of God and he had no confidence in himself. &nbsp;The law of God what is obeyed what is adhered to the loft outputs righties and Puritans edged the surety and our heart so that the confidence is not self-confidence but confidence in God confidence in him. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Psalms 31 verse 24. &nbsp;Be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all you do hope in the Lord. &nbsp;Hope in the Lord and he will give you strength. &nbsp;Hope in the Lord and he was trying to encourage. &nbsp;Be of good courage she will strengthen your heart. &nbsp;Old he that hope in the Lord the Lord. &nbsp;God wants to do something in your heart. &nbsp;He wants to give you an experience. &nbsp;You can have a hope that is based on an experience that cannot be touched that cannot be effected by man or by circumstances. &nbsp;Hold that as an anchor for the soul that is experiencing God his life his mercy his grace his strength in our hearts. &nbsp;It is not just the surf is where you feel good and you go away believing that you are Christian but you come to know the words and you come to know God to work something in your spirit and in your heart that will build the whole encourage where you can stand no matter what the storm takes place tomorrow or the next day the matter what the storm these are the circumstances are we hope in God and to those that hold and God he strengthens their heart and he give to courage. &nbsp;All you that hope in the Lord he will strengthen your heart. &nbsp;There&#39;s a commitment and our heart on all parked to be of good courage be of good courage that is you do what you know to do. &nbsp;Apply the truth love the law. &nbsp;Peak region spared when the world says again that she do lie in steel and do all these things at the law says not to do the old law of God comes forcibly to our heart with great conviction I will stand alone with the word and let the world go by. &nbsp;It takes purchase stand for truth in the hour that we lived in. &nbsp;And the Lord said unto Joshua be strong and of good courage you didn&#39;t need it. &nbsp;You need all the courage he can muster up and if you&#39;re willing to be courageous and you&#39;re willing to be courageous obedient he will help you. &nbsp;Israel did not get it like Josh or guided foreign Joshua died those that still the Josh or they lost to encourage a luster strength and they did that was right in their own eyes. &nbsp;God is not wanting us to go by what we see or feel them wish them the desires of the flesh in the city&#39;s physical eyes but he wants us to get a promise. &nbsp;We need a promise. &nbsp;I can teach you the revelation that God has for you I cannot make you see it but God can do it if you desire that. &nbsp;You encourage began to grow and develop in your heart and you watch God strengthen your heart. &nbsp;See if you get to scourge and disgruntled that the plane and ask questions why this why that and allow the trials to test a contentious spirit and distress you you cannot expect God to work to that. &nbsp;David said it&#39;s all lying words. &nbsp;It&#39;s all in thoughts. &nbsp;Solomon said its vaccination is spirit. &nbsp;All is vanity and vexation to spirit why? &nbsp;Because he loved the flesh to rule his thoughts. &nbsp;If you do away with the flesh to lock up to the flesh to want my site or if any. &nbsp;In a faith will build and give you a whole that cannot be seen and cannot be understood by any fleshly means. &nbsp;A hope that is not seen by the flesh feast will take and give you a hope that you can stand it any hard place in a hope will be strong it is based on a real experience of Jesus Christ in your heart. &nbsp;And in your life. &nbsp;We&#39;re not talking just about a feeling of warmth is that comes over you as you would inspire by reading the Bible but we&#39;re talking both faith accept Jesus as your personal savior to take up his abode in your hot life if you got encouraged to accept Jesus as your savior in the hour that we&#39;re living in an live for him completely you&#39;ll find that he&#39;ll strengthen your heart he&#39;ll strengthen the inner man. &nbsp;And he&#39;ll develop you fully completely inside.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Moments Chapter 5 and verse two. &nbsp;But home also with access by faith into disgrace form we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. &nbsp;We have access to this grace by faith. &nbsp;Believed to have Kurds have confidence use the answer. &nbsp;There is a place in God we can know him you can have life and you can have victory and you can have power and wisdom working in your heart. &nbsp;And as you see the glory of God growing and developing in your spirit you need to rejoice. &nbsp;Rejoice in that rejoice in the hole. &nbsp;Rejoice in hope of the glory of God that is Scott is what he has begun he is going to finish. &nbsp;What he has started he will complete. &nbsp;Rejoice in the glory of God if all you see is Romans 323 of you sending and coming sure of the glory of God and you look to yourself and you look demand is so if you look to man there is a big question their questions everywhere why how? &nbsp;And is just an impossible situation but wouldn&#39;t you begin to see what Paul saw and begins a see that Christ in you is the hope of glory and you begin to rejoice in his righteousness and you begin to rejoice in his law David saw and he says I love the law of God to love God works Puritanism my soul. &nbsp;The law of God changes me. &nbsp;The things that I struggle with now I find her purity in my mind and in mice. &nbsp;I find a freedom in the liberty something that I cannot do for myself the Word of God has worked and made me three inside. &nbsp;And I&#39;ve been to glorify God. &nbsp;Impulse of the same thing when he said rejoice rejoice with this whole rejoice in you rejoice in the glory of God. &nbsp;In verse two is says by whom also in taxes if a into this grace were released and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. &nbsp;We&#39;ll not short of his glory rejoicing in him praising him exulting in worshiping him magnifying him magnifies law. &nbsp;Don&#39;t just a great things about the law. &nbsp;We magnify the law by obeying the law. &nbsp;In the world sees us live by it and they disdained a lot of the disdain you as a believer but we have a hope that is against what they see that is beyond what they understand in the glory of glob God will be revealed may not see at this time but I believe that&#39;s some kind. &nbsp;Some in this hour can be storm start. &nbsp;I believe that God is going to raise up some soul winners in this last day Christ and that&#39;s the hope of glory that God will be glorified like he wasn&#39;t John chapter 9 when there was a boy bond born blind in 40 years old he saw the glory of Claude Connick come into his heart into his life no one gave him physical vision but gave him spiritual vision of who Jesus was he is more than a man. &nbsp;He is more than just a healer blind eyes. &nbsp;Something within his spirit came open in his eyes of his soul came to life and began to talk about Jesus as the son of God and as a giver of life. &nbsp;He exulted him them worshiped him and he want to be with him. &nbsp;Didn&#39;t matter if it cost him his life. &nbsp;Before he was just blind but now he was under the danger of losing his life. &nbsp;Let me lose my life but keep my eyesight by faith. &nbsp;I don&#39;t fear as Paul says I don&#39;t fear what mention do unto me where to trust God were in a believed God. &nbsp;And I believe that the Lord is going to keep us buys power. &nbsp;There&#39;s overcoming our homecoming dance overcoming opposition overcoming persecution overcoming trouble I don&#39;t think that we stood against the lies that I just beyond the horizon that it just about here coming against as we&#39;ve been lied about there been a lot of things I said things negative and derogatory against the people of God it is going to get worse not easier and it&#39;s going to be some fiery trials but is not vain thoughts that deliver you from the hour of trial but it&#39;s hoping in the glory of God and rejoicing in it. &nbsp;We are not just wishing that God would do something we are believing God is going to do something. &nbsp;And I believe is going to force is going to get dark is going to get worse dark we have been told that is getting worse the watchmen on the wall would like to strip you of believing in a hope of God they want you to believe that Jesus is returning just something I take a set everyone away. &nbsp;But I believe in my spirit that there is a promise and I cannot altogether see it with my eyes I see something in my spirit of the blessed hope that Christ will reveal himself in a spirit to reveal himself fully and we can have the life of Christ and the wisdom of God and the knowledge of God in the purity of God to form this in our hearts. &nbsp;We&#39;ve been waiting a long time. &nbsp;There is still much to be done. &nbsp;There&#39;s much to be accomplished the more we look in the manner in the more we read our Bible the more we see needs to change but yet there&#39;s something inside that you can see. &nbsp;There&#39;s a whole believing building there is an anchor working. &nbsp;Rejoice in the glory of God. &nbsp;Believe God worshiped God praise God serve God live for Jesus. &nbsp;Opened him that hope is an inspiration to our faith and it begins to strengthen our faith. &nbsp;The safety of us hold and when hope goes to work to strengthen our faith to me need to have faced this Truscott every step of the way. &nbsp;Romans the fourth captain the 13th for says it wasn&#39;t always easy for a broom. &nbsp;It says who against hope believed in hope. &nbsp;He had nothing to hope for but faith gave something to hope for. &nbsp;He believed God to righteousness and his faith went to work to produce the characteristics of Christ and he against hope believed in hope. &nbsp;And he has told police working in his heart Abraham it strengthened his heart. &nbsp;Abraham keep going Abraham don&#39;t go by what you see a feel vocal by which he known the natural buckle by the promise. &nbsp;And he began to hold the promise of God that have a son is commissioned art and he can look at the promises of God that he gets given to you promise of overcoming power in these last these of total deliverance of complete salvation you can hold to that. &nbsp;I&#39;m going to receive complete salvation. &nbsp;By what authority do staff will eye on you good love it you to believe that. &nbsp;The matter what you see or feel about yourself you got to hope in that word. &nbsp;It&#39;s gotta be a hope that that worked. &nbsp;And if it isn&#39;t just because you heard the preacher preaching hate you must know by the experience that is working inside of you.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Romans five in verse three cents and not only still but we glory and tribulations known the tribulation work of patients and patients experience and expands hope. &nbsp;We not only rejoice in the glory of God but we also glory in tribulation because tribulation is working something inside of us that helps us understand that only God can do it only God can help us. &nbsp;Sometimes the blessings of God on the outside of our life to close the way where the houses that we live in the cars that we jive to people that we live his live with excess field that we are blessed Christians but when tribulation comes by and begins to strip away from you to close the Chalfont and the cars had to drive him the houses that you live in and the people of the UF with you find in the midst of tribulation the outside everything has changed but inside Jesus is still the same. &nbsp;And it becomes more real to you. &nbsp;His word becomes more real to you. &nbsp;And the naturally have nothing to hold true but inside you have everything to hold two. &nbsp;God wants us to rejoice in him. &nbsp;Rejoice in his glory. &nbsp;Rejoice in his word. &nbsp;Don&#39;t tribulation rob you of the blessing. &nbsp;The true blessings of God robbed you of the hope of the promise of receiving the full list. &nbsp;Believe it. &nbsp;Trust him. &nbsp;Your faith and hope can be shaken pared it is going to be shaken by tribulation in this hour by tribulation and fiery truck was there if you let Charles J. Q. you not to make it. &nbsp;But if you missed in the process to begin to love the process even to love God and his word in his ways you&#39;ll find that you don&#39;t base things unfeeling since fights and natural understanding but you base it on is promise he knows what he&#39;s doing. &nbsp;He is all-powerful that won&#39;t change. &nbsp;Nobody is going to take that from me. &nbsp;He is all-powerful he is always his own knowing he&#39;s everywhere at all times. &nbsp;He is everywhere present and nowhere absent. &nbsp;He is ever present help in time indeed. &nbsp;No matter who fail should Jesus will never fail you. &nbsp;And if you got that old it is an anchor for your sole tribulation will only prove that to be true. &nbsp;But if there&#39;s a question of doubts and I&#39;m believed in your heart and you don&#39;t know where you stand that got you to understand a truce properly defined in the midst of the trauma tribulation that all that&#39;s Ross and all that fell in all that confusion with the doorstep and if there is nothing left your empty your feigned David says I hate to be like this. &nbsp;Coming up empty coming up short not knowing God not knowing how to trust God until he got to a place to trust God to pray and to know him and he says I love to the laws got it makes a strong could use me confidence in his eye of confidence in the Lord of strengthen my heart and hope in him I trust in him more it builds and builds and builds and builds. &nbsp;He had something inside that he could not feel what he put on that which is on the outside. &nbsp;When the blood cells on occupant right back off. &nbsp;It didn&#39;t feel the same day there&#39;s something about that I don&#39;t want that I want what I felt the battlefield that I faced a ready want to face the power of God the presence of God and the lifeguard. &nbsp;The Charles and the tests won&#39;t take that from you. &nbsp;It&#39;ll only make it more real but if you don&#39;t love his presence you don&#39;t love his power unit wealth is provisioned the trial will only bring that out. &nbsp;You can say with words and tests more than I love God and I believe that he is all powerful but that if there are doubts and fears of questions with you heart the fire trial will bring it out. &nbsp;And Abraham who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations. &nbsp;And he needed to have many one song before he could be the father of many nations. &nbsp;He&#39;s got this whole and in the deadness of his body and his wife&#39;s will was staring him in his face he said I&#39;m not a look at that I&#39;m going to look at the promise and I&#39;m going to believe God. &nbsp;So what you got to do tonight is accept the challenge and the Word of God there is a whole promise to what spared that we can be like him. &nbsp;In his car in disgrace can be fully developed in our life but you can&#39;t look at yourself in the way things are going you cannot look around you in charge by the natural you got to hold to the promise you that Senator adhere to the word paired cut helps to look this word to love him. &nbsp;Some 33 and 18 says behold the eyes of the Lord upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy. &nbsp;There is a godly fear that is missing in the lives of people today they have gone far from having the fear of God. &nbsp;They have listened to the signs into the symbols of no fear they might not thought to much about it but it has affected his generation with their fear of God is missing. &nbsp;But often as Greece and his mercy will release of voices if you are willing to hope in him you might not be able to see anyone that would gather in from you when you speak but just keeping faithful and obedient to the Lord fear him and he&#39;ll use you in this hour. &nbsp;I thank God that there&#39;s still some that are willing to bear voice and that will raise her voice I could drop against against unbelief in doubt and sinful actions. &nbsp;That will speak against same not to say you just need repentance in but will name sandpit than the things that people are living contrary to the Word of God. &nbsp;Sometimes people allow viewing caught their hands when you speak messages about repentance and true repentance but when you actually begin to name the sin of what they need to repent of they get upset and they speak against you but we need to be willing to repent of our ways repent of our doings and not just a know it seems that the world is doing but God wants every content in our motives of our heart and our mind motive here before him so he gets all the owner and the glory gets all the praise and worship.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some 38 a verse 15 for the Lord do I hope. &nbsp;I will hear a Lord my God. &nbsp;Some 39 in first sentence is now Lord, what wait I for my hope is it me? &nbsp;The world around us is hoping in wishing and desiring for so many different things. &nbsp;Material blessings material possessions mean so much to people. &nbsp;When I going to hole for this world? &nbsp;I believe it is wise for people to take care of yourselves you need to use wisdom to take care of yourself as a believer but it is not wise to prepare for 20 and 30 years ahead in these last days. &nbsp;This is a time overcomer will recognize there&#39;s a better hope how blessed hope it is more than just waiting for the return of Christ but Christ wants to come into your heart and life and be fully developed in you and bring it to a place where you walk with him and he says if you walk with him for that level to the experiments you&#39;ll be like a unique. &nbsp;You&#39;ll be caught up to God into his throne. &nbsp;I said that 2 a.m. in the other day and he said do you know what that means you know what that means to be caught to God and he said walk and I went walking and he ran up beside me see a conduct a and I said to that is foolish your blinds as foolish before never got a ketchup to God and that measure but if Congress glorified MSU brings to a place where return be with him where he is set up an effort of our old but our effort must then responds in obedience to his replica was to Peter Peter come to me. &nbsp;Peter said Lord if you bid me to come in on the words that Jesus spoke in this life and his power is victory over the storm over the circumstances over the trial of the chest you can walk on her words because he spoke it. &nbsp;And that word produces an experience in your soul and the tribulation comes it can&#39;t hurt the experience and only purifies it. &nbsp;And the Scripture says in some IT to Word of God is purified seven times. &nbsp;We got something that you can trust us to the test to test the weight it is already pure it&#39;s always been here you will always be peer you can&#39;t take away from the Word of God. &nbsp;You can&#39;t destroy you can put it down. &nbsp;All power and all authority is with God he is in control at the world say what they want our hope is in the Lord tonight. &nbsp;We believe this word he&#39;s going to accomplish his purpose in the lives of those that will believe him. &nbsp;But not everybody has to still. &nbsp;And we all are without hope there&#39;s an experience that is producing something that wasn&#39;t there probably last year. &nbsp;Or a few days ago there is an experience that God is working with analysts that is producing something that hasn&#39;t been there. &nbsp;I want God and all the songs that we same doesn&#39;t do it for us but when God to an experience begins to put something in us that can make a strong and inspires their faith and strengthens our faith now before we couldn&#39;t help herself a man would begin to see hey you can do it you can trust the Lord you can hope in him you come rejoice in the situation. &nbsp;The lies were before you can even rejoice it can&#39;t have any hope you can&#39;t make it but the truth is in this new experience that you can make. &nbsp;And Ruth Ann chapter 1 of verse 12 she says to not only says to Ruth on the go home go back and go to your relatives go back to them I can&#39;t help you. &nbsp;I can&#39;t give you any hope and she says if I could have hope of husband if I could have hope would you wait? &nbsp;Would you wait? &nbsp;She could not even have the whole to have a husband and all have hope in a husband who have children that have them wait for children again. &nbsp;You see the Lord provided in this grace and in his mercy before. &nbsp;And I can do it again. &nbsp;God can do it again but we don&#39;t always know what he wants. &nbsp;We don&#39;t always understand his promise. &nbsp;It was not the will of God at this time for no me to remarry in to produce children for Ruth in or for those that God&#39;s will does not hold their pair but there was no hope there does not even a desire for God to do something there was no seeking for direction there was nothing there to store their faith and encourage their faith and strengthen their faith to at least come to light. &nbsp;We don&#39;t know what God wants we don&#39;t understand what God wants but let&#39;s just get to the land let&#39;s get back to the blessing of God what he is put us. &nbsp;Naomi lost that direction to point souls to where they need to be. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t fully understand the provisions that Christ is made for us at the cross just because the Word of God says so at least that much say the word repeat the word you may not understand that you may not feel it you may not altogether believe it but just say it because it&#39;s the Word of God you&#39;ll find that if you go in the direction toward the cross if you win a direction for Christ he is faithful he is merciful is on his outstretched he stretched forth his arm long stretches on all four for Israel where did he reach out for them he reached out for them while he was in Egypt. &nbsp;He reached out for them while they&#39;re in the land of bondage. &nbsp;And again he reached out to them as handle on in Babylon. &nbsp;Our God is a merciful God. &nbsp;Our job is a long-suffering and gracious God. &nbsp;It may not understand how the grace of God works. &nbsp;They don&#39;t understand how merciful he is a just repeat the word of God point souls to the cross. &nbsp;He never know. &nbsp;You may not understand it but it works. &nbsp;It&#39;s real if Ruth could just get back to Bethlehem children and she can get into that place where she can recognize the heavenly alas. &nbsp;And recognize Jesus Christ as a savior as the liver as the bridegroom. &nbsp;There should not be want have a hard time saying we should be right there believe in God a we have not reached a place but we should have a whole to reach their Holt should be inspiring our faith and should be at work at this time card wants to purify people he wants to unite with the people he wants to do a great work in our hearts but the church has lost its desire to even gay or route out of no left get them out of the life of sin. &nbsp;It is like a feel-good leaving them there because it puts a leeway in places for them to do. &nbsp;My mind tells me some things where people are just living the loose life because they afraid of commitment. &nbsp;But I pray that they&#39;ll will put a hold on our heart based on a real experience that changed our minds changed our thinking take away the vain thoughts that leave us and take time and time again. &nbsp;Where he can&#39;t even get ourselves a time place where we really truly worship God with all our heart dollars soul though strength Ross ice we are lost to get to that place we do not fully understand what we have a whole the couple tries into the experience into
