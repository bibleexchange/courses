How can we tell whether or not a person is a true believer? This is the discussion of this passage. Remember: Jude was the brother of our Lord. At first, he did not believe in Jesus Christ. But some time after the resurrection of Christ, he gave his heart to the Lord and surrendered his life to preach the gospel. Here we see him sitting down and writing to the believers of the first century. And in writing, he wastes no time: right from the start he describes himself as a true minister of Jesus Christ and his readers as true believers of Christ. Consequently, in his opening remark we have a picture by which we can measure ourselves, the picture of a true minister and of a true believer.</span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="about:blank#link485"><span class="cs92015F65">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the picture of the true minister (v.1).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="about:blank#link486"><span class="cs92015F65">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the picture of the true believer (v.1-2).</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="link485"><span class="cs3D5B4455">1. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(v. 1) </span><span class="csA657E9A2">Minister&mdash; Servant&mdash; Humility</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: there is the picture of the true minister. Who is he? Jude says two simple things about himself.</span></a></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that he is &quot;the servant of Jesus Christ.&quot; This is amazing, for as stated above, Jude was the brother of Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+13%3A55"><span class="cs92015F65">Matthew 13:55</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mk+6%3A3"><span class="cs92015F65">Mark 6:3</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; cp. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+7%3A1-5"><span class="cs92015F65">John 7:1-5</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, esp. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+7%3A5"><span class="cs92015F65">John 7:5</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). At first he did not believe that Jesus was the Christ, the Anointed One of God, the Son of God who was to come to earth as the Savior of the world. But note what Jude says here: he says that he is &quot;the servant of </span><span class="csBAF33195">Jesus Christ</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; He now believes that his brother Jesus is the Messiah, the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Anointed One</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of God. He believes that his brother Jesus is the Son of God who came into the world to save man. He believes that his brother Jesus can save him from sin, death, and judgment; he believes that his brother Jesus can make him acceptable to God. What an enormous turnaround! What a testimony for our Lord Jesus Christ!</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Note what else Jude says: he says he is the servant of Jesus Christ (see note, </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Servant</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>&bull;</sup></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup></sup></span><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=609&amp;sec=00004652#sp10073"><span class="cs92015F65">2 Peter 1:1</span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"> for discussion).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+12%3A26"><span class="cs835A930E">John 12:26</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">; cp. <a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+12%3A1"><span class="cs835A930E">Romans 12:1</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">; <a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+15%3A58"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Cor. 15:58</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;[Laboring] not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eph+6%3A6-7"><span class="cs835A930E">Ephes. 6:6-7</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Col+3%3A23-24"><span class="cs835A930E">Col. 3:23-24</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may </span><span class="csA657E9A2">serve</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> God acceptably with reverence and godly fear&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+12%3A28"><span class="cs835A930E">Hebrews 12:28</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And ye shall serve the Lord your God&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ex+23%3A25"><span class="cs835A930E">Exodus 23:25</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+10%3A12"><span class="cs835A930E">Deut. 10:12</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+2%3A11"><span class="cs835A930E">Psalm 2:11</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+100%3A2"><span class="cs835A930E">Psalm 100:2</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jude says that he is the brother of James. Who is James? What James would be so famous and well known that all the believers of the first century would know him by his first name? There was only one such James, the James who was the Lord&#39;s brother, the James who was the pastor of the great Jerusalem church, the mother church of Christianity.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Note this fact: Jude identifies himself by referring to James. Believers all over the world knew James, but few knew Jude. Therefore, he must identify himself so that his audience will receive his exhortation. He is simply Jude &quot;the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James.&quot; Note the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">humility</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of this man! The only claim he has is that he is a slave to Jesus Christ and the brother of a famous man. He could have easily been jealous of his famous brother, resentful of the fact that he had to live under the shadow of his brother, resentful that he had to use his brother&#39;s name to get a hearing from believers. But Jude was not jealous or resentful. He was a true minister of God: he walked humbly among the believers of the world, humbly before God, ever so thankful that God had called him to serve His Son the Lord Jesus Christ, thankful for whatever call God gave him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="csA657E9A2">Thought 1</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The true minister of God has two very basic traits.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The trait of being the servant and slave of Jesus Christ. And remember: Christ means Messiah, the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Anointed One</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of God, the Son of God whom God sent into the world to save men. This is the most basic belief of a true follower of Jesus Christ. Therefore, every true minister of the gospel makes this belief the basis of his life and ministry. He is a true minister because he is the servant and slave of </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Jesus Christ</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The trait of humility. The true minister walks humbly among believers and before God. No matter how low God&#39;s call is to him, he is thankful for the very fact that God called him. He is, after all, the servant and slave who is available to do the bidding of his Master.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="csA657E9A2">Thought 2</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The fact that Jude was a brother of our Lord is glorious evidence that Jesus Christ is exactly who He claimed to be. It is touching when we realize that Jude had lived as the half-brother to Jesus for years. Day in and day out, hour by hour, month by month, and year by year Jude had played, eaten, worked, slept, and gone to school with Jesus. He had roamed the surrounding hills with Jesus as a boy and seen Him play with other children and relate to the neighbors and adults of their neighborhood. Jude had seen how his brother received and responded to adult instruction, teaching, and supervision. He had also probably seen Jesus take over the head of the household when their father, Joseph, had died.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mk+16%3A19"><span class="cs835A930E">Mark 16:19</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lk+22%3A69"><span class="cs835A930E">Luke 22:69</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+3%3A31"><span class="cs835A930E">John 3:31</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ac+2%3A36"><span class="cs835A930E">Acts 2:36</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ac+5%3A31"><span class="cs835A930E">Acts 5:31</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+10%3A9"><span class="cs835A930E">Romans 10:9</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+14%3A9"><span class="cs835A930E">Romans 14:9</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+8%3A6"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Cor. 8:6</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eph+1%3A19-20"><span class="cs835A930E">Ephes. 1:19-20</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

Who were these believers? If Jude was writing to a particular church or group of churches, he does not name the church or churches. This points toward him writing to all the believers of the first century. Apparently the fact that Jude and James were brothers of the Lord Jesus Christ carried a lot of weight with the believers of their day. When they spoke, it made the believers stand up and take notice, for they had lived with Jesus day by day before His ministry and had experienced dramatic conversions from unbelief to staunch belief. This fact probably points to Jude writing to a wider audience. What he was writing was to be circulated among all the churches among all believers. In these opening words, Jude pictures just who a believer is. We can actually measure ourselves against his description and tell whether or not we are a believer.</span></a></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Believers are the &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">sanctified</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">hagios</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The sanctified person is a person who has turned away from sin and set his life apart to follow God. He is a person who is set apart unto God, a person separated from the world and its possessions and pleasures, a person who is dedicated to following God, a person who has given </span><span class="csC382D2BB">all he is and has</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to God.

That is, believers are </span><span class="csC382D2BB">beloved</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in God the Father. God holds them ever so close to His heart. They have accepted His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; honored Him by believing in Him. Therefore, God loves the believer with a very special love, the love that accepts the believer and gives him the right to live in God&#39;s presence forever and ever.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Believers are &quot;preserved in Jesus Christ.&quot; The word &quot;preserved&quot; (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">tetērēmenois</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup></sup></span><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=P\#3032: Preserved"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;3032</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71">) means to be kept; to be guarded and watched after.

God calls man to accept the gospel. He tugs and pulls at the heart strings, convicts and convinces man to accept Jesus Christ as His Son, but man has to respond to the call of God. God cannot make the decision for man. The believer is a person who has genuinely accepted the call of God. God summoned him, called him, and the believer responded. He became a believer, a person who truly believed in Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+20%3A16"><span class="cs835A930E">Matthew 20:16</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">; cp. <a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+22%3A14"><span class="cs835A930E">Matthew 22:14</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Among whom [all believers] are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: to all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+1%3A6-7"><span class="cs835A930E">Romans 1:6-7</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+1%3A2"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Cor. 1:2</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+1%3A23-24"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Cor. 1:23-24</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;[God] who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Ti+1%3A9"><span class="cs835A930E">2 Tim. 1:9</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;It means that a believer has been called to be a </span><span class="csC382D2BB">saint</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, that is, to live a life of holiness.
