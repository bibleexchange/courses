			<li class="cs6E7362EA"><span class="csA7555675">THE PASSOVER</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The first Feast is the Passover, which had its origin in Egypt, and was the memorial of redemption and deliverance of the Israelites from the bondage of Egypt, Ex. 12:14. It took place on the14th day of the first month, Nisan-Abib, corresponding to our April. This was originally the seventh month, but was changed by order of God to the first month, &ldquo;The beginning of Months&rdquo;. It marked the Jewish Birthday as a nation, (Ex. 12:2), and was the beginning of the Jewish sacred year. Time was to date from redemption, we begin to live spiritually when we are redeemed, only then new life begins. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Life begins in knowing Jesus Christ through the cross.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">1 Cor. 5:7, 1 Peter 1:18,19</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The Feast consisted of a male lamb without a blemish of the first year, a lamb for a family. The lamb was to be taken in the 10</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> day and kept until the 14</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> day, when it was killed in the evening. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">This sacrifice was to be personal, to be kept four days in the home with all the children and family would make this sacrifice reach to the heart of each one in the family and show to all what it was like for the Father to give His only Son to save the world from sin. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">This sacrifice was to be kept four days in the home to prove that the lamb was without a blemish. So our Lord&rsquo;s public life proved His perfection. All the combined tests of God, man and Satan proved that He was without a blemish: only thus could He become the Lamb slain to redeem us. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">With a bunch of hyssop the blood was applied on the two side posts and upper lintel of the door of each Israel&rsquo;s home. When the death angel passed by and saw the blood the first born was spared. (Ex. 12:13) Wherever the blood was not found judgment fell. This sets forth in type the personal appropriation of the blood. </span></p><p class="cs46853151"><span class="csA7555675">John 3:36&mdash;</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</span></p><p class="cs46853151"><span class="csE5F3F462">Eph 1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">True the lamb was slain. The blood is sufficient but it is positional only where it was in regard to Israel, (before it was applied) in a basin. It is laid up for &ldquo;whosoever will&rdquo; appropriate it. Faith sprinkles it upon the lintels; and door posts of the heart. Only then are we individually protected, covered and safe. .</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The flesh of the lamb was roasted and eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, and none of it left until the morning. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">THE LAMB ROASTED-speaks to us in type of the fire Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous wrath that our paschal lamb was to endure on the cross.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">THE UNLEAVENED BREAD- is a type of that practical separation from evil which follows our being washed in the blood of the Lamb.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">BITTER HERBS-sets forth that which is bitter to nature, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death of the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6 Gal. 2:20, 6:14: Col. 2:11) Those who have entered into true fellowship with Christ &ldquo;esteem it as a feast &rdquo; to keep self nature in the place of death. God give us a good appetite for bitter herbs.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Those who feasted were to do so with their LOINS GIRDED, their SHOES on their feet and their STAFF in their hands, ready to leave Egypt. They were to eat it as a people prepared to leave behind them the Bondage, sin and judgment and to move on to the land of the Promise. The GIRDED LOINS speak of readiness to serve; The SHOD FEET OF PREPARATION to leave the scene, while the STAFF was the expressive emblem of a pilgrim people. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Beautiful characteristics are now by the Blessed Spirit working them in us. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The first time the Israelites observed the Passover Feast, it was in the midst of God&rsquo;s judgments in the land of Egypt, a type of the world. It was at this time that they were delivered from their cruel oppressor, Pharaoh, a type of Satan. Afterwards the yearly observance of the feast was as a joyful memorial of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. While the Jews still observe the Passover Feast no &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; slain and no blood used. The Christian church does not observe the Passover, but they do observe as a memorial, the ordinance of the Lord&rdquo;s Supper that Christ instituted in its place.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">This feast is typical of communion with Christ, feeding upon Him, The unleavened bread, and also of a Holy Walk. (I Cor. 4: 6-7; II Cor. 7:1)</span></p><p class="cs47051ADA"><span class="csA7555675">The Feast began on the day the Passover lamb was killed and continued for seven days. The lamb was slain on the 14</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> &ldquo;in the evening&rdquo; that is between the sun&rsquo;s decline and its setting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feast of Unleavened began immediately after the sunset which was the between beginning of the 15</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> day. There was no interval between the two Feasts. The divine order is rich in meaning here; first redemption then a Holy Walk. God looks for holiness to </span><span class="csDA02FF29">immediately follow</span><span class="csA7555675"> salvation. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Lev. 23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Throughout the seven days of the Feast they were not only to eat unleavened bread but there was to be no leaven in the camp. Seven sets forth the whole course of the believer&rsquo;s walk which must be HOLY.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Lev. 23:7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The first and seventh day were kept as &ldquo;Holy Convocations&rdquo;, &ldquo;no servile work, was to be done, but the sweet savor offering was to ascend each day of the seven days. The work of man&rsquo;s hands, </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csDA02FF29">Typifying that which comes forth merely from the human, was to cease</span><span class="csA7555675">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a contract this is, with the sweet savor of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice! The work of flesh was to cease, but Christ was to be seen. What a lesson we find here for our own hearts. It is not our dead works but His works that must be manifested in our lives. The most elaborate works of merely the human is &ldquo;servile&rdquo; Gal. 5:22, But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23: Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. That which has upon it the stamp of the Divine, will alone satisfy the heart of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gal. 2:20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csA7555675">Rom. 8:4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">This feast was celebrated after the Sabbath. So Christ was raised on the first day of the week. The feast was not observed until after the Israelites had entered Canaan. The offering was a sheaf reaped from the fields of the harvest and carried to the priest to be waved before the Lord. This was followed by a Burnt offering, Meal and Drink offerings, typical to Christ in His perfections. No Sin Offering was included. As Christ was raised &ldquo;from the dead&rdquo; even so will the true believers.. </span></p><p class="cs46853151"><span class="csA7555675">Php 3:10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Lev. 23:14 &ldquo;And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">They could not eat until a sheaf was waved before the Lord. The harvest could not be touched until the sheaf of first fruits had been presented and with the sheaf the Burnt, Meal, and Drink Offerings. Even so Christ must have the preeminence. He must precede &ldquo;then afterward &ldquo;They that are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming&rdquo;. Christ&rsquo;s glorious resurrection is a guarantee of the resurrection for all those who have died in Him. Hallelujah!</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Fifty days after the feast of the First Fruits the Feast of Pentecost was observed. This is the exact period between the resurrection of Christ and the formation of the Church on the day of Pentecost. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">It was not until the day of Pentecost had fully come that we have the fulfillment of the type. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Acts 2:1&mdash;</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&nbsp;2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&nbsp;3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&nbsp;4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">At the feast of Pentecost a new Meat offering was to be offered. It was made from the New Harvest and speaks of the New born Church, fresh from the hand of God. The grain was prepared and ground &nbsp;into fine flour for two wave loaves (representing the Jew and Gentile) that were baked with leaven. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Lev. 23:17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Christ is typified by the separate sheaf, but the Church is set forth by many grains ground and blended together as one.

The Harvest was marked with the same characteristics that were in the sheaf. The true Church not only has the nature of Christ but was brought into being through His death and resurrection and the first fruits company is to be fully revealed at Christ&rsquo;s coming.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">1Co 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ&#39;s at his coming.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Divine Provision has been made for the Church. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The loaves were baked with leaven but with the wave-sheaf no leaven was offered for there was no evil in Christ. &nbsp;&ldquo;sin shall not have dominion over us&rdquo; but in the wave-loaves, typifying the church, there is evil </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Evil was divinely recognized &nbsp;also divinely met. The Sin Offering but also with the bread, the Burnt, Meal, Peace and the Drink offering were all offered. Christ our Sin Offering in His perfections are provided also for the church that through them, God might see us &ldquo;accepted in the Beloved&rdquo; and perfected in Him.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The Drink Offering first mentioned in connection with the Sheaf (Christ) Lev. 23:11,-13 is also here in connection with the Bread (The Church) Lev. 23:13. How fitting that the Drink-Offering typical of the joy of the spirit should be associated with Christ in resurrection. </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">What joys pulsated through the being of our Mighty Conqueror.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">What complete provision, that the Church might be presented &ldquo;perfect and entire wanting nothing&rdquo;. All was freely offered on the Day of Pentecost.</span></p><p class="cs8F28D9F3"><span class="csA7555675">THE INTERVAL</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Between the Feast of Pentecost and the Trumpets there was an interval of about four months, during which the Harvest and Vintage were gathered in. There was no convocation of the Israelites during those busy months. This long interval typifies the present dispensation in which the Holy spirit is gathering out the Church. When &ldquo;The fulness of the Gentiles&rdquo; (Romans 11:35) </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">together with the remnant have come in (Rom. 11:5) Then the Dispensation of Grace will end and the Elect of Israel will be gathered back from the four corners of the earth to keep the Feast of Trumpets. (Matt. 24:31).</span></p><p class="cs8F28D9F3"><span class="csA7555675">V THE FEAST OF TRUMPETS, Lev. 23:23-25</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">On the first day of the seventh month, Tisre (Corresponding, in our time, to something around the 15</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> of September to the 1</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>st</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> of October) The Jews held the Feast of Trumpets. The Feast was ushered in with the Blowing of the Trumpets and special sacrifices were offered.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">During the wilderness wandering two silver trumpets were blown for the calling of the assembly and for the journey of the camps, (Numbers 10:1-10)</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">NOTE IN THIS FEAST WE HAVE A TWO FOLD ANTITYPE:</span></p><p class="csD0E0FDC2"><span class="csA7555675">1.

At the Revelation, Israel will be gathered together with the sound of the trumpet.

		<p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The Day of Atonement was Israel&rsquo;s annual cleansing from sin. Study carefully Lev. 16:1-34. Its typical meaning was fulfilled in Christ, our great High Priest. (Hebrew 9:1-16)</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The fact &ldquo;The Day of Atonement&rdquo; is placed between the &ldquo;Feast of Trumpets which has its fulfillment in the Feast of Tabernacles which is a type of Israel&rsquo;s Millennial Rest and gathering, implies that it has some typical significance between those two events. It must, therefore, refer to the time of Israel&rsquo;s cleansing as a nation. See the connection between the &ldquo;Trumpets&rdquo; in Joel 2:1 and the sorrow and repentance that follows in verses 11-17. See also Zech. 12:10-14 with 13:1. Historically the &ldquo;fountain&rdquo; of Zech. 13:1 was opened at the crucifixion- then rejected by the Jews. After the regathering of Israel the fountain will be efficaciously &ldquo;opened&rdquo; to Israel as a nation.</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

( Deut. 16:13) The people during the feast were to dwell in booths made of branches(Lev: 23:40: And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook. Ye will rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">The Feast of Tabernacles like the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, is both Memorial and Prophetic.</span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Memorial as to the redemption out of Egypt, (Lev.23: 42-43) </span></p><p class="cs64D08382"><span class="csA7555675">Prophetic as to the Kingdom rest of Israel after her regathering and restoration when the feast again becomes memorial, not for Israel alone but for all nations.
