<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: A Gospel for the Whole World<br>
TEXT: Romans 1:8-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God give us a burning heart to win the lost to be personally
involved reaching to the lost and the needy. You will not win the lost like we
should until we love each other like we should.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Romans 1:8-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&lt;Tammy would you pray&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Gospel for the Whole World. Where is my vision? Is it one
that seees it is MY responsibility to reach the whole world with the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…to the end ye may be established…night and day was his
longing to be with them to help them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.8,9 Your faith is spoken of….not just speaking about
sinners … Our faith at the DC has been spoken of in parts of the world, but
there are yet parts to cover. Those unreached places ought to be a call to our
hearts to be reached by the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the burden we have is there it is there by the Spirit of
God. It goes beyond us. V. 13 He was hindered, though he longed to be there.
There will be a lot of things too hinder, but they cannot stop us, we cannot
allow them to stop us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11 years ago, we had a lot pressure financially. And then
opportunities to do mission work came and the more we gave to the work of the
Lord the more things improve. Paul had to make tents at times to meet the
needs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is going to be a body ministry and not a one man show or
effort. ‘may be comforted together with you’ There were things he wanted to
share with them, but also receive of them. ‘mutual faith both of you and me’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the things we need today is a love for each other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I Cor. 13 Have all faith to move mountains and have not
love, you have nothing. We need to have a love that will reach to our wife,
cousin, sister, family, church members and visitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Romans 5:5 This is not something that yhou can just learn on
your own, but must learn by the spirit. Love comes by truth being revealed and
you follow in obedience to the truth and the Spirit of God works In your heart.
Through your obedience to the truth, love will grow in our hearts as a fruit.
The holy ghsot is here to pouur into our hearts and spirit that ability to
love. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We get a taste of the love of God and then too often don’t
learn through obedience how to love God. Learn him and not just experience a
good feeling for a while. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are spiritual truths to learn whereby we may love the
unloveable. Loving people beyond ourselves. The closer you get to God the more
angry you may becomoe against people if our heart is not set right. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tehre has to be some learning if we are going to overcome. </p>
