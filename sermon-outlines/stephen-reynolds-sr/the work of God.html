Jesus lived a perfect sinless life and then paid the ultimate price which was His precious blood shed for our sins.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(John 1:29) The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Col 1:14) In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God takes his record of a perfect sinless life and recons it to be our record. In other words God imputes his record on us. &nbsp;He then takes our life and places it on the cross with Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Rom 4:1-8 ) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God is able then to declare the believing sinner righteous by the act at calvary. He paid the price. His record is imputed to the beliving sinner. Nothing else will do. As mentioned in the above verses man can not be justified by his works. &nbsp;He must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Rom 10:13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA657E9A2">Sanctification</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> deals with the saved person and his spiritual condition. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sanctify is defined as </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is self evident to anyone who has been saved for awhile that every Christian is at some stage of spiritual growth. Being justified and declared righteous is one thing. To be able to live a holy life is another. Spiritually defined sanctification is the process by which one becomes more Christ like in his Christian walk. Note it is a process not a sudden change. When one first becomes a Christian he has little knowledge of what a spiritual walk is. He must grow. The Christian grows spiritually by the word of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(John 17:17) Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Psa 119:9) BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Eph 5:26) That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The word of God is able to make one grow spiritually for it is spiritual food.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1 Pet 2:2) As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1 Cor 3:2) I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Heb 5:12) For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Heb 5:13) For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Heb 5:14) But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&nbsp;<br/>The Christian then grows spiritually by the word of God. Sanctification is the process of the Christian becoming more Christ like. It is the Christian growing and preparing himself for whatever ministry God may have for him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(2 Tim 2:21) If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master&#39;s use, and prepared unto every good work.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The term sanctified Christian would be one who has grown in the Lord and is profitable for the ministry. We should all strive to be wholly sanctified unto the Lord. The word of God is to be studied. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(2 Tim 2:15-17) Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA657E9A2">Redemption</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is defined as making payment for something. It is to buy back, regain or recover by payment of the amount due. It also means to pay a ransom, to liberate or free. In the spiritual sense it is God making the payment for our sins. The payment price was God&rsquo;s own blood. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Eph 1:7) In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Col 1:14) In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Heb 9:12) Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Rev 5:9) And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God paid for our sins by his own blood. When one looks at this payment in the scriptures it points to a time as being redeemed (past tense), as in being redeemed (presence tense) and then looking forward to the day of redemption. (future tense) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Gal 3:13) Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Eph 1:7) In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Rom 8:23) And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Eph 4:30) And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The point of hath redeemed, have redemption, redemption of our body, is this: we have a body, soul, and spirit. Our spirit is redeemed when we are saved. Our spirit is quickened at the moment of salvation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Wrong &nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is redeemed at death, and the body is redeemed at the rapture.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Eph 2:1-5) And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins: 2&nbsp; Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 3&nbsp; Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 5&nbsp; Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)&nbsp; 6&nbsp; And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Rom 8:10,11) And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 11&nbsp; But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(2 Cor 5:6-8) Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)<br/>8&nbsp; We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/><br/>(1 Th 5:23) And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1 Cor 15:51-57) Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54&nbsp; So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? 56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.<br/>57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1 Th 4:13-18) But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18&nbsp; Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1 Th 5:1,2) But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. 2&nbsp; For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In conclusion redemption deals with God redeeming our body, soul, and spirit. The payment was his own blood shed at calvary. It occurs in stages yet each occurrence in itself is at an appointed time. Our spirit at the moment of salvation. Our soul at the moment of death. Our body at the rapture. For those living when the rapture occurs both the soul and body are redeemed at the same time.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Glorification is the final step in our salvation. We are saved when we accept the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus then adopts us into his family. We are born again. Yet, we are still in our bodies. Any Christian knows he is not perfect. He desires to be, and the soul is willing but the flesh is weak. Glorification is when all three parts of our being have been redeemed and changed. Glorification occurs for the Christian when he ends up with God in Heaven with resurrected incorruptible bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be like Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1 John 3:2) Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Glorification deals 99 percent of the time in scripture with the Lord Jesus Christ or God the Father being glorified. In Romans 8 we see the Christian being mentioned as being glorified. This is the reason that very few Christians hear about glorification as pertaining to the Christian themselves. It is, however, a scriptural truth we shall be glorified in heaven to spend eternity with God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Rom 8:14-30) For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 15&nbsp; For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: 17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19&nbsp; For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 20&nbsp; For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, 21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 23&nbsp; And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. 24&nbsp; For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?<br/>25&nbsp; But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. 26&nbsp; Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. 28&nbsp; And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. 29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.<br/><br/>(Eph 1:5) Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All those who trust in Jesus Christ for salvation are predestinated to be adopted and become like him. (Eph 1:5 and Rom 8:30) When we become like him we are glorified. Our being glorified is because we will be like Jesus Christ. (1 John 3:2) above.&nbsp; This is not the Calvinistic view of predestination where the Calvinist believes only those God predestined to be saved will be saved.&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have here is the biblical teaching that those who are saved are justified, redeemed, sanctified and will be glorified.&nbsp; This is what predestination is biblically.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, those who accept Jesus Christ to be their Saviour will end up with a glorified body because it is predestined that those who accept him will end up being glorified and living with the Lord Jesus Christ forever. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
