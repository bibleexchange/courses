And it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the lord....The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch....And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons&#39; wives with thee. And of every living thinking of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female....Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he&quot; (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+6%3A5-8"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Genesis 6:5-8</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">, <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+6%3A11-14"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">11-14</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">, <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+6%3A17-19"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">17-19</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">, <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+6%3A22"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">22</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Noah&#39;s faith.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth had become so wicked that it was filled with corruption and violence. It was so corrupt that every imagination of man&#39;s heart was corrupt and evil. Man had reached the point of no return; he would never repent and return to God.

Noah lived far, far inland from the ocean; he was nowhere close to the sea or to the shipbuilding yards of the world. Yet, there he was building a ship as large as an ocean liner.

But Noah was faithful:</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csD3860DFD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;He preached the righteousness and coming judgment of God.

Noah continued on and on, walking in godly fear, believing the sheer Word of God about coming judgment.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;A world that lives by science and technology is tempted to trust in nothing beyond itself. Science and technology tend to draw and focus all attention upon the world of sense and feelings, of comfort, and pleasure, of possessions and self. Therefore, the idea of God and of coming judgment is ignored. And if anyone preaches it, he is ridiculed, mocked, scorned, and often abused. We must be faithful to God, for God </span><span class="csD3860DFD">is</span><span class="csA521DC07">. God does exist, and God is going to judge the world.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
