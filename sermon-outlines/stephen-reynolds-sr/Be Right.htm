<p class=MsoNormal>“setting him free”    Always remember this initial
experience is always to be followed up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you allow people to believe that they can be saved and
still keep on sinning is <b>wrong.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on
him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make
you free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin,
that grace may abound?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live
any longer therein?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him,
that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in
that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed
unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body,
that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are
alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are
not under the law, but under grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under
the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto
death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of
sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
delivered you.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the
servants of righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:22 But now being made free from sin, and become
servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 8:10  And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because
of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Co 8:12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound
their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Co 15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have
not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2Co 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ga 2:17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we
ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God
forbid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Ti 5:20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also
may fear.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Ge 20:9  … a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that
     ought not to be done.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal> Heb 3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called
To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received
the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 11:25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the
people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with
so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which
doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
before us,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving
against sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jas 1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth
sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jas 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth
it not, to him it is sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 14:23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because
he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Jo 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light,
we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Jo 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 1Jo 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you,
that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Jo 3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the
devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 1Jo 3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for
his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of
your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and <b>abode not
in the truth</b>, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he
speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 1Jo 5:16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not
unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto
death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b> 1Jo 5:17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin
not unto death.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When a sinner trusts Christ he is immediately born into the
family of God and receives the gift of the Holy Spirit.” A good illustration of
this is the household of Cornelius when they heard Peter preach. (Acts
10:34-48)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is still a real.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every believer should receive the infilling of the Holy
Ghost, but not all are at new birth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lu 24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon
you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from
on high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ac 1:4 And, being assembled together with them, commanded
them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of
the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ac 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost
is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in
all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt 3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway
out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ac 19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding <b>certain
disciples</b>,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost <b><u>since
ye believed</u></b>? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard
whether there be any Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 7:39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that
believe on him <b><u>should</u></b><u> receive:</u> for the Holy Ghost was not
yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ac 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and <b><u>ye
shall</u></b><u> receive</u> the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eph 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the
word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also <u>after that ye
believed</u>, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the
redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2Co 5:5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing
is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ac 8:15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that
they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they
were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Acts 8:12------------ they became believers-----------8:17
they received the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Page 91</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be very careful of making statements like (the Spirit of
death)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when the scripture says the Spirit of Life.  Rom.
8:2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Page 91and93 both speak of adoption at new birth and
conversion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are born into the family of God not adopted, God has no
adopted children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Spirit of Adoption is for the fully Matured not for
babes in Christ,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These statements of being born again, full grown leaves the
spiritual growth period right out of the experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ga 4:1  Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child,
differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ga 3:26 For ye are all the children &lt;huios&gt; of God by
faith in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>uiov  huios,  hwee-os'        (a Son)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 5:13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the
word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Co 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto
spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto
ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 3 For ye are yet <b>carnal</b>: for whereas there is among
you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not <b>carnal</b>, and walk as
men? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eph 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into
him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 1Pe 2:2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the
word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 2Pe 3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2Pe 1:4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature,
having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith
virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2Pe 1:9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and
cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make
your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of
Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of
repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2Co 3:18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass
the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,
even as by the Spirit of the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Co 15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we
shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2Co 7:1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let
us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1Pe 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, {abundant: Gr.
much}</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, {for you: or, for us}</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto
salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if
need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious
than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spiritual Adoption is a placing of fully matured children of
God into Sonship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 2:10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by
whom are all things, in <b>bringing many sons</b> <u>unto glory</u>, to make
the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 8:29 ¶ For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate
to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among
many brethren.</p>
