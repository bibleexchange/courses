<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Submission in the Family<br>
TEXT: James 4:7-10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does His righteousness come into our heart? We believe
him. This is not a mere mental assent, but we must BELIEVE Him in order to
receive it. If God gives me something by faith, can I now act anyway that I
want? What do we have to do with this flesh. We must crucify this flesh. Humble
ourselves. V. 9 Be afflicted. How many know how to afflict your soul properly?
Crucifying the flesh properly without becoming a nervous wreck. We cannot meet
the requirements on our own strength. I must lose my mind at the cross!  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are praying and asking God for direction. I have been
praying and God has shown me some things about submission in the family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hosea (here is a request of the Lord) When God requests
something is that a requirement or just “do the best you can, at least you
tried” is it just a suggestion? His requests are requirements. If you try to do
what Hosea did you will end up in big trouble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How difficult is it for a husband to submit to his wife?
Always doing what she wants? That is frustrating. We need to learn <u>submission
to God</u>. In submitting to God, we find our place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b>HUSBANDS</b>: Remember, whether it is true or not
or makes sense or not, the fact is what your wives are FEELING is VERY REAL to
them. You can talk and talk and what she feels will not change until certain
things are done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hosea 1:2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD
said to Hosea, <b>Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of
whoredoms</b>: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the
LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing
from the LORD</i>.—worse than the physical acts of adultery going on on the
streets of Portland is the people of God turning from Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Could I looking at this Scripture love a woman like Gomer?
God is not just saying go get you a girlfriend, but he is saying a wife, this
is the one you are going to be with for the rest of your life! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is something in our heart and spirit that must be
there to help the destitute and see to it that they are saved and stay saved. (<u>not
meaning marry them</u>.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t get attached to people. We need to have a great faith
in God. Thank God for men of faith wisdom and example, but let’s be attached to
the Lord. This same rule applies to Husband and wife. Paul said, “Live as
though you were not.” There is a place where we can be strength to her. When
was the last time you held your wife’s hand? Kissed her? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bro. Carle, I’ll kiss my momma if you kiss your wife?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes you don’t FEEL like doing certain things, but
being in submission involves doing those things that I don’t feel like doing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a spirit of fear, There is a spirit of Bitterness
&amp; Pride. The Lord help us get beyond our weaknesses. Admit our weaknesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Genesis 1:27,28 God created and founded the family. Making
man in His own image and woman he formed out of man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>So God created man in
his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>            And God blessed them, and
God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and <b><u>subdue</u></b>
it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eph 6:4 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, ye fathers, <b>provoke not your children to wrath</b>:
but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pr 22:15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
correction shall drive it far from him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God not only founded the family but institued marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exodus 20:14 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ex 20:12 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eph 6:1-3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first
commandment with promise;)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When your children see you submitting to God and honoring
God, they will learn to honor and submit to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God has led the family to worship. It is the father the head
of the household that is responsible to lead the family to worship. </p>
