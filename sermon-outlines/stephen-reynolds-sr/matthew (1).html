Steve,</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">Greetings from Africa. Things are going well here. I had a few small difficulties last week, but God is helping me to work through them.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">I am writing because I found out from my father that you are planning on getting married and I want to make sure </span><span class="cs4DDE7994">I first</span><span class="csC84C4A98"> let you know</span><span class="csCECB8010"> </span><span class="cs936D7A43">my feelings</span><span class="csCECB8010">.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="cs4DDE7994">I first</span><span class="csCECB8010"> want you to know that I am not against a person getting remarried after their spouse has passed away. Your father did it, and there were many people that were greatly blessed because Sis. Reynolds became a part of his family as well as his ministry. My father has also done it, and Donna has been a blessing for the family. She has been able to give womanly advice to three boys that were in the age to start moving from boyhood to adulthood. Now that Josh is so distant because of sin, he does not communicate much with Donna, but when he was in church he did. Rick, who at first did not receive her well at all, now is very affectionate to her and looks to her for much help. As for myself,&nbsp; am very grateful and blessed to have her as a part of our family. She has not only helped us boys, but she also has been a great help to Dad and has stood with him as he does the work of God.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">While we all may agree that it was the right thing for Dad and her to get married, there is something else we all now agree on--it would have been better for them to have waited longer. There were many problems we faced as a family in the first few years that we realized could have been better if we had all gotten to know each other better.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">I also know from personal experience, that there will be many people that will be quick to sentence judgment on a person because </span><span class="cs4DDE7994">he is quick to get remarried</span><span class="csCECB8010">.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">&ldquo;quick&rdquo; </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">Ge 35:20 And </span><span class="csC84C4A98">Jacob set a pillar upon her grave</span><span class="csCECB8010">: that is the pillar of Rachel&#39;s grave unto this day.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">&nbsp;21 And </span><span class="cs4DDE7994">Israel journeyed</span><span class="csCECB8010">, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">The changes that needed to take place in April and I, around April and I, in her family and in my family have happened and we consider your feelings and opinions today and trust when you get home you will see for yourself that April is the right choice for me and the ministry. 100%</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1AE57FF8"><span class="csCECB8010">Not enough time for people to handle what is to take place?</span><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="cs8BE947CA"><span class="csCECB8010">Your questions were mine; that&rsquo;s why I called every available person &nbsp;&nbsp;for hours in days for their answers, everyone I talked to, gave me the same answer.</span><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
					<li class="cs66D531FA"><span class="csCECB8010">Keep in mind I prayed, been praying, still praying; talked to the whole family including Lisa and made a special visit for her advice and opinion and she said she trusts my judgment and was very happy for me and told me to go for it, Preachers &nbsp;and their wives were all very supportive, 100%</span></li><li class="cs66D531FA"><span class="csCECB8010">You are the only one to question me </span><span class="cs4DDE7994">and </span><span class="cs6044CF16"> I thank you for it.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">Not all change is bad, but all change is one thing--</span><span class="csC84C4A98">difficult to get adjusted to</span><span class="csCECB8010">. Many people&rsquo;s feelings about his change may come forward as different emotions--anger, sadness, bitterness, and confusion. My family faced many different responses from many different people in the first year of so after Dad and Donna met.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">I say this to let you know how hard it is to face the opposition of getting remarried, and while I do not want to be the sword of an enemy, I do want to share some of my thoughts and concerns. I know you are much older than me and have much more respect and authority than me in many ways, and so </span><span class="cs4DDE7994">my words may not matter too much</span><span class="csCECB8010">. Yet I would not feel right inside if I did not let them be known to you.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">Amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">My first concern is to your family. While there was a part of me that always liked Donna and I was glad to receive her as a part of the family, it was also a hard transition at many times. I am worried that if there is not complete healing in the lives of your children, then, even though they may receive your new bride with apparent joy (I do not know how they feel, for I have not talked to any of them concerning this), there may be feelings which will unwittingly develop inside their hearts.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">I am also concerned about Lisa. Sis. Tammy was her main connection to your family and the Center, and if she feels that thought and memory of her sister is so soon removed from your family and the church (I am not saying that it has, but I know how feelings work), It might be devastating for her.</span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">THIS IS WHY I DEALT WITH HER RIGHT AS SOON AS TAMMY PASSED SO SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE RESPECT THAT I ALWAYS GAVE HER WAS STILL THERE.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">I Visited Lisa&rsquo;s house twice and talked to her on the phone to make sure that she had no problem with me whatsoever.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">I am limited about what I can say about your choice for the lady that you are marrying, </span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">You are limiting yourself because you have something you&rsquo;re thinking about April. </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">for I do not know much about her</span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">You&rsquo;re saying you don&rsquo;t know but you&rsquo;re thinking something and it is okay to ask point blank.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">I do not know if she has a relationship with God.</span><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csAC8B2127"><span class="csCECB8010">I witnessed what I was looking for in her spiritually, shook her hand , walked away talked with the family and many ministers</span></li></ul>
			</li></ul>
		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">&nbsp;I would not marry someone that did not have a relationship with God?</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">I do not know if she has a standard for right living. </span><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csAC8B2127"><span class="csCECB8010">April has a standard for right living, plus she is asking me who you know, love and trust to help her for more than just a standard but to be in submission to me in all things </span></li></ul>
			</li><li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">I do not know if she has a pleasant and friendly personality.</span><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csAC8B2127"><span class="csCECB8010">So pleasant that everyone so far has thanked me for bringing her to them.</span></li></ul>
			</li></ul>
		<p class="cs76C76E01"><span class="csCECB8010">&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">I do not know if she will embrace the many aspects of the ministry of the Deliverance Center. </span><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csAC8B2127"><span class="csCECB8010">She made the decision to embrace every aspect of my ministry including and foremost the ministry of the Deliverance Center.</span></li></ul>
			</li><li class="csD44A58F6"><span class="csCECB8010">I do not know if she will submerge herself into the fellowship of the congregation of the church.</span><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csAC8B2127"><span class="csCECB8010">She is so well that her and the people feel at home.</span></li></ul>
			</li></ul>
		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">That is my main concern--I don&rsquo;t know her, and neither do many of the members of the congregation of the Deliverance Center. While she may be becoming the wife of Stephen G. Reynolds, Sr., she is also becoming the wife of the senior pastor of the Deliverance Center. While a change like this will be difficult under any circumstances, it will be much harder if the people feel left out of getting to know this lady before she actual become&rsquo;s our First Lady.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">I can speak personally that at the news of your remarriage I was quite shocked and caught off guard. I found out yesterday morning and was troubled throughout the day. Last night I had several dreams about you getting remarried and about your new wife-to-be. I awoke very troubled. I am not saying these are supernatural warnings, but they are that the sub-conscience is very thoughtful and concerned with changes like this. While part of my feelings are because I am simply surprised that you are getting remarried at all (again, not a bad thing, but still difficult to get used to), the more of my feelings are because she is a mystery woman to me.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">Thank you for sharing these thoughts with me so that I would have a chance to respond to you before you get frustrated</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">I do not claim to have much wisdom of my own, but I have learned to reap from the wisdom of many great men. When my father expressed to Bro. Reynolds about his desire to marry Donna, Bro. Reynolds suggested a trial period to ensure we all knew what we were getting into. He suggested that Donna come to Lancaster with us and fill the position of taking the responsibility of taking care of three teenage boys and a man. She came to Lancaster for a week and spent the days cleaning the house, cooking, ironing, and just being a member of the family and then at nights she would go to Janice&rsquo;s house.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">Perhaps some similar trial would be good for both the congregation of the church and for her. It would help us to know who she is, and it would help her know what the church is like (I know that she used come to the Center many years ago, but many things have changed since then).</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csCECB8010">Again, my words my not count as much, but I do feel better telling them to you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
