		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Prayer is universal . Ps 65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. Unsaved men pray. All nations pray. It is the sense of need, of weakness, that leads men to cry out for help to a Higher Power; and it is wrong to say, as some have said, that the prayers of unconverted people are never heard. The man whom our Lord healed of his blindness said, John 9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. This is true, in the sense that they ask amiss, God won&rsquo;t answer every prayer He is all wise. </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

To many it is only a theory, or a mere doctrinal statement. &ldquo;I believe in the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; thoughtless formalists repeat time after time, and many real Christians utter the words without the least understanding of their wonderful meaning. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&ldquo;Upon your believing ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.&rdquo; He, a divine person, dwells in you if a believer. Your body is His temple. He has come to reside, to make His permanent residence in you. Have you recognized Him? Have you welcomed Him? Do you seek to make Him at home there? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Observe: He is the </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Holy </span><span class="csA7555675">Spirit. He detests sin in all its forms&mdash;pride, lust, selfishness, worldliness, in every shape and of every degree. He is most sensitive to neglect, and is easily grieved. Yet how many of us have never seriously sought to &ldquo;clean house&rdquo; that we might be suited temples for His indwelling! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">I was once received into a home the very memory of which still fills me with horror and disgust. I spent a week, with my family, in circumstances so filthy and unsanitary that I wonder now how we ever stood them. We remained for fear that, if we left, we might stumble two poor ignorant souls, groping after God. Coarseness, vulgarity and dirt grieved us constantly. We could not </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">enjoy </span><span class="csA7555675">our visit, but we tried, by example and hard work, to clean up the place and to show the people living there a little of what refinement meant. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The Holy Spirit is more sensitive to moral filth, to spiritual defilement, than the most delicate and fastidious lady could be to vulgar and degrading living conditions; and the Word says, &ldquo;Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption!&rdquo; (Ephesians 4:30). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The 31</span><span class="cs80275571">st </span><span class="csA7555675">verse suggests the kind of house-cleaning that is required if He would be made at home in our lives. &ldquo;All bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil-speaking&mdash;with all malice,&rdquo; must </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">be banished if He would be ungrieved. And, mark, only as He abides in us ungrieved can we really pray in the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">This is the secret of so many unanswered prayers. This also explains why, so often, we try to pray and there is neither joy nor liberty. It is a wearisome form. The grieved Spirit of God is silent. He does not indite out petitions. Communion is broken. Our prayers are vain. The heavens seem as brass above, and the ground below is stayed from dew. Refreshing of soul there is none. For by our careless ways and lack of self-judgment we have so wounded our Holy Guest that He is, if I may so speak, in grieved retirement. He has not left us: He never leaves; He abides forever; but He cannot be at home in a heart where so much is tolerated that is disgusting and a grief to Him. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">If any resent the term &ldquo;disgusting,&rdquo; and shrink from applying so strong a word to any habits or ways tolerated by them, let me remind you that to God pride is of all things most vile. By this sin Lucifer was transformed into Diabolus. And this is a sin most of us are slowest to detect in ourselves, while keen enough to observe it in others. From this mother-sin spring all kinds of other evils. &ldquo;Only by pride cometh contention. &ldquo;A proud look and a lying tongue&rdquo; are each abominable in the sight of God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">How great the need then for a spiritual house-cleaning if we would pray aright; for only as the Divine Person living in the believer is ungrieved can we pray in the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">In the second place, prayer in the Spirit must be in accordance with the word of God. &ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and His word was in my tongue.&rdquo; &ldquo;Which things we speak, not in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth.&rdquo; These are only a few quotations that distinctly affirm the Spirit&rsquo;s authorship of the Holy Scriptures. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Manifestly then, the better I know my Bible, both theoretically and practically, the more intelligently I can pray. Mark, I have said, &ldquo;practically,&rdquo; not merely &ldquo;theoretical.&rdquo; I certainly need to learn all I can of the Book by careful, assiduous study. But I must not stop there. I must know my Bible </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">practically</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">. I am to &ldquo;</span><span class="cs4EEB067A">know </span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">the truth&rdquo; but I must also &ldquo;</span><span class="cs4EEB067A">walk </span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">in the truth.&rdquo; In fact, I do not really </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">know </span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">any truth unless I walk in it. If ignorant of the word of God I am likely to pray for many things that are not in harmony with the Lord&rsquo;s mind&mdash;things that are not suited to the dispensation in which we live, or that would not be helpful to my spiritual progress or honoring to God. The better I know my Bible, and the more careful I am to obey its precepts, the better I shall be able to pray. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">I have already said, but I stress it here, that he who prays much but does not read his Bible is liable to fanaticism. This is an important consideration.
