But it was overcome by a courageous mother who believed God. Pharaoh was furious. He had launched every evil he could conceive. But no matter what he plotted, Pharaoh&#39;s evil plans were overcome. He was left with only one other option: the law of the land. Thus he passed a murderous law: all baby boys born to Israel were to be drowned. Who were the executioners to be? All the Egyptians.

Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to contract heart disease. Lung, larynx, esophageal, bladder, pancreatic, and kidney cancers also strike smokers at increased rates. Some 30 percent of cancer deaths (130,000 per year) are linked to smoking. Chronic obstructive lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are 10 times more likely to occur among smokers than among nonsmokers.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Smoking during pregnancy also poses serious risks.

It is a whole new language that is devised to distort facts, confuse issues and persuade people to believe lies.

The class-action suit was filed under the name Jane Roe to protect her identity.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because of the slow legal process, Ms. McCorvey never had the abortion, and she gave up her baby for adoption. She has since worked in construction and waitressing jobs and remained anonymous until 1988, when she went public and started the Jane Roe Foundation.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Her house has been shotgunned, a movie has been made of her life, and she is trying to locate the child whose conception triggered the landmark case.</span></p><p class="cs1BD8A2E4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Atlanta Journal</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Number Of Babies Per Year</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The annual number of births in the world is roughly estimated at 95 million, or 3 babies every second.

The second poster offers $500 for the same information regarding the Oklahoma state bird. Other organizations offer even greater monetary motivation to turn in known bird molesters and killers.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Federal protection of eagles is not limited to the live birds. It extends to their eggs, nests and dead carcasses as well.

He was an illegitimate child who never saw his mother. His father later married a sixteen-year-old girl. For twelve years, he was brought up first by his grandmother, then by two aunts. After that, he went to live with his father and stepmother. Because of his father&#39;s legal profession, Leonardo was considered better than the village children, so he was never allowed to play with them. His early life, therefore, was very unsettled, and he never knew what it was to enjoy the fun associated with childhood.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">With that bad start, we would expect that Leonardo would have become a dull, sullen boy with strong anti-social attitudes. But Leonardo had one trait of character that saved him from this fate. He had an active curiosity. As soon as he was old enough to walk, he would hike all over the countryside, with his eyes, ears, and mind wide open. The open fields, the woods, the birds and animals surrounding the Florentine village of Vinci fascinated him.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There was no limit to his interests. Plants, fossils, stars, and all other aspects of nature interested him. In fact, he observed everything so carefully that he became an authority on dozens of scientific and artistic subjects. Today, it amazes us how one man could have possessed so many remarkable talents.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Leonardo could have gained fame in several different professions. He was a &quot;Wright brother&quot; in the field of aeronautics. He was also the Thomas Edison of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. He was a leading astronomer, geologist, engineer, botanist, and anatomist, as well as a famous author, illustrator, and psychologist. Perhaps some reader is saying, &quot;But I know Leonardo de Vinci only as the renowned painter of the well-known and intriguing &#39;Mona Lisa&#39;&mdash;that Florentine mystery lady with the most discussed smile in history.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is the story of the boy with the bad start! He became one of the most remarkable and famous men of all time!</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;George H. Clement</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Baby Hater Of Germany</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A young bearded man went into the Evangelical Hospital, Hamm, Germany, and entered the Nursery. Before anyone saw him, he had used his fist to beat up the babies and broke their arms. The babies, all younger than two weeks, suffered a variety of injuries ranging from broken arms to fractured skulls. The man escaped. An armed guard was henceforth stationed about the Nursery.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Infant Life Expectancy</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Under present conditions, almost three-fourths of newborn babies should live to their 65th birthday.

Nor will it likely be rated R although it literally focuses on sex and violence.

Her motions become desperately agitated and her heart rate increases dramatically, as Dr. Nathason explains in his compelling narration.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Once the director of the largest abortion clinic in the world and a founder of what is now named the National Abortion Rights Action League, Nathason has become one of the foremost champions of the pro-life movement. He is an atheist.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Nathason was on their side, he was an &quot;authority.&quot; Now, according to them, he is a &quot;fraud&quot;. Because the film shows abortion from the victim&#39;s perspective, it is destined to change the course of public debate.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Abortion has become big business. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Fortune Magazine</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> estimates that $500 million is grossed each year from the abortions themselves. Another source reports that aborted fetuses are being sold at $25 a batch up to $5,500 a pound.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The sale of late-term aborted fetuses between within 10 years at one of our nation&#39;s hospitals brought in $468,000. This money was used to buy a TV set, and cookies and soft drinks for visiting professors.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Equally disgusting is the purchase of fetal collagen by the cosmetic industry for its various beauty products. Collagen is the gelatinous substance found in connective tissue, bone and cartilage. It can be found in twelve leading shampoos and five hand creams in stores throughout the United States. And unless the product&#39;s label stipulated animal collagen, it probably contains human collagen. Though the thought is horrendous, it is possible for a once expectant mother to beautify her skin and hair with matter from her own dead child.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Lucrative also is the sale of fetal tissue, which brings investors about one million dollars annually. According to the &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Village Voice</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">,&quot; estimates made several years ago indicate that between 20,000 and 100,000 fetuses are being sold to drug companies annually in the United States alone.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is ironic that a total of forty-seven senators voted to protect dogs from being experimented on with poisonous gas, but then voted down Senator Jesse Helm&#39;s amendment to stop federal funds from being used for abortion.</span></p><p class="cs1BD8A2E4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Chattanooga News-Free Press</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Most Children Born To One Mother</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In a total of 27 confinements, the wife of Feodor Vassilyev, a peasant from Shuya (near Moscow), Russia, gave birth to a total of 69 children, comprising 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.

But while the brain contains virtually all the nerve cells it will ever have, the pattern of wiring between them has yet to stabilize.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Up to this point,&quot; says Shatz, &quot;what the brain has done is lay out circuits that are its best guess about what&#39;s required for vision, for language, for whatever.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Following that, it is up to neural activity&mdash;no longer spontaneous, but driven by a flood of sensory experiences&mdash;to take this rough blueprint and progressively refine it.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">During the first years of life, the brain undergoes a series of extraordinary changes. Starting shortly after birth, a baby&#39;s brain, in a display of biological exuberance, produces trillions more connections between neurons than it can possibly use.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Then, the brain eliminates connections, or synapses, that are seldom or never used, starting around the age of 10 or earlier, leaving behind a mind whose patterns of emotion and thought are, for better or worse, unique.</span></p><p class="cs1BD8A2E4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BD8A2E4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
