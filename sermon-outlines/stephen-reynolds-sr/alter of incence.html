This error is taught by good and honest&nbsp; theologians and seminary teachers, to those who will be pastors, who think that their teachers cannot be wrong.&nbsp; This is the way in which errors spread within Christianity;

In this very same passage it says that incense was going to be burnt in it twice a day and blood was going to be put in its horns once a year.&nbsp; Therefore, it is clear that they entered into the Most Holy every day. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As we can see there are at least three passages that tell us that they entered the Most Holy much more frequently than once a year.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is true that </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">with the blood of the atonement for the whole nation, as Paul specified,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; once a year could the High Priest enter the Most Holy.&nbsp; This ceremony symbolized Christ&#39;s sacrifice.&nbsp; That is why it had to be done only once a year, symbolizing that Jesus was going to be sacrificed only once. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If now we go to the New Testament we see that Zachary ( Luke&nbsp; 1: 8-9 ), </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">who was not the High Priest,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> was the one who burned the incense that day.&nbsp; This means that not only the High Priest, but any priest could enter the Most Holy Place if he was elected to do so by the casting of lots.&nbsp; What only the High Priest could perform was to bring blood to be put in the altar of incense as an atonement for the whole people of Israel. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Not very long ago I heard a Sunday School teacher that was teaching an error</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&nbsp; He learned this error from a pastor, who in turn learned it from a seminary teacher, who learned it from another teacher, who read it in a book, whose author learned it from a teacher, who&hellip;.etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, none of them learned it from the Bible, which should be the only source of religious knowledge for them. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What this teacher taught to his brethren was that the Bible says that only the High Priest could enter the Most Holy, and even so, he had to enter with a rope tied to his leg in case that if he were to die, they could remove his body, because no one else could go into the Most Holy.&nbsp; This is false.&nbsp; The Bible says nothing like that. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, by reading the Bible we&nbsp; see that during the exodus, </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">the tabernacle with the Most Holy included, had to be disassembled each time that&nbsp; people moved.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; Therefore, young men had to come to disassemble it and carry it on their shoulders.&nbsp; It is not logical to think that Aaron, who at that time was over 83 years old, was going to do the whole job alone. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">This next argument is not a biblical one, but it makes sense.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; Another reason for not believing that the Most Holy could be entered only once a year, is that a place where nobody enters for a year, will become full of mildew and other fungus like plants; and besides, all kinds of bugs, snakes, rats, etc., will come to live in there.&nbsp; Especially when the tabernacle was in the wilderness. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you see, </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">it is good to read the whole Bible from cover to cover continuously.&nbsp; We must never expend our time reading &quot;books that talk about the Bible&quot;&nbsp; if we have not red yet the Bible that day.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; It is good to read these books, but only if you have time to first read the Bible, because this way it will be more difficult to get confused by the error of a brother.&nbsp; Most probably our brother&#39;s purpose was&nbsp; not to make us err, but he makes us err anyway. Therefore, it is our responsibility to avoid any error, no matter if it was done purposely or not. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Ex 30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Le 4:3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock&#39;s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock&#39;s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. {without...: Heb. to without the camp} {where...: Heb. at the pouring out of the ashes}</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock&#39;s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
