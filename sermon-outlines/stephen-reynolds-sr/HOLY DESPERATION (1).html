Churches are failing, leaders are fumbling, and truth is fallen in the streets. The prophet Isaiah continues with this divine reprimand: &ldquo;they declare their sin as Sodom, they hid it not.&rdquo; And what shall the end of a people be that &ldquo;hid not their sins&rdquo;? I have seen a strange thing under the sun: professors preaching &ldquo;continue in sin&rdquo; from the pulpit. The Apostle Paul in contrast preached &ldquo;God forbid&rdquo; which is one of the strongest emphatic statements in Scripture used to convey the ceasing of sin in the life of the believer. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">John Wesley said: &ldquo;What one generation tolerates, the next generation will embrace.&rdquo; Sadly we have tolerated a hell-less, eternity-less, sin-less gospel and this next generation is aimed at accepting this as the genuine apostolic original. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">The true Christian witness seems to be almost overshadowed by false doctrines, false cults, and false prophets. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">It is time for a holy desperation for revival to arise in God&rsquo;s people! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We need a fury of passionate pleading, desperate crying, fervent praying for a heaven-sent revival in our day. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We are living in desperate times but the Church is not desperate before God in prayer.&rdquo; <br/>Revival only comes by birth&mdash;with birth comes&mdash;travailing birth-pains, and agony, growing pains, &nbsp;shall the birthing of of revival be any different? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Revival prayer is born out of a holy Faith and healthy desperation for the presence and power of Christ in His church. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We need not shrink back from emotions and displays of desperation for revival, read this old report from one hundred years ago with the Irish Presbyterian Church: &ldquo;Perhaps you say it&rsquo;s a sort of religious hysteria. So did some of us when we first heard of the Revival. But here we are, about sixty Scottish and Irish Presbyterians who have seen it-all shades of temperament-and, much as many of us shrank from it at first, everyone who has seen and heard what we have, every day last week, it is certain there is only one explanation-that it is God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit manifesting Himself in a way we never dreamed of. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We have no right to criticize; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&lsquo;I believe in the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;&rdquo; God is desiring to manifest Himself in ways that we &ldquo;never dreamed of&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what saith the Scripture? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Psalms 126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Oh Lord! turn back our captivity and grant us revival.<br/>ONLY REVIVAL <br/>pray for the completing of it.<br/>&ldquo;For decades sincere believers have asked, &quot;Why don&#39;t we have revival?&quot; And for decades the answer has always been the same: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We don&#39;t have revival because we&#39;re willing to live without it! It really is that simple. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Do we really want to hear the truth? God responds to hunger and thirst. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">He fills those who recognize their need, who are empty and broken, who are at the point of desperation, who are panting for Him the way a deer pants for water in the desert. He answers dependent prayers. Sure, we want revival. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Ps 42:1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">But we don&#39;t need revival. That&#39;s the difference. God will meet us at our point of need, not our point of preference. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Revival is God&#39;s measure </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Revival comes when we realize that it&#39;s either revival or death, revival or continued backsliding, revival or the world around us goes to burning hell.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">There are no shortcuts with God, we will never see a revival until this is realized and acted upon. In light of eternity let us have tears for our lack of desire and desperation for God. John Knox was a Great Man of God and this was his prayer, &quot; God give me Scotland or I die!&quot; Again, John Hyde who was a missionary, prayed, &quot; God give me souls or I die&quot; Again, Whitefield prayed, &quot; God give me souls or take my soul!&quot; May we take it further can you pray: &ldquo;Give me revival or I die?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD"><br/>Have a </span><span class="csD04A7434">burdened heart</span><span class="csC05134DD"> like Evan Roberts, he prayed for revival night and day for twelve years. At the end of these twelve years he prayed with such intensity, agony and urgency that his landlord asked him to vacate his living quarters. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Have &nbsp;a </span><span class="csD04A7434">burning in your soul</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;Have a </span><span class="csD04A7434">building desire</span><span class="csC05134DD"> in your heart </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Let us not fool ourselves the prayer meeting is &ldquo;dead&rdquo; and so are multitudes in their trespasses and sins. We need a holy desperation to fill our prayer meetings, a holy zeal that will not relent until revival comes. The &ldquo;Lord comes suddenly&rdquo; to his temple, let us not be found sleeping or great will be our shame. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">It is revival or death!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD04A7434">William Seymour</span><span class="csC05134DD"> the father of the modern day pentecostal movement prayed for five to seven hours a day for over a year for revival. And what resulted? a glorious powerful sweeping pentecost swept the world. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Winkie Pratney told why there was no revival in the church over twenty years ago: &ldquo;We do not have men and women who are prepared to pay the same price to preach the same message and have the same power as those revivalists of the past. Without these firm believers, the community can never be changed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
