Two tenons </span><span class="cs366CB853">shall be </span><span class="cs338C08B3">in each board for binding one to another. Thus you shall make for all the boards of the tabernacle. And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side. You shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards: two sockets under each of the boards for its two tenons. And for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, </span><span class="cs366CB853">there shall be </span><span class="cs338C08B3">twenty boards and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under each of the boards. For the far side of the tabernacle, westward, you shall make six boards. And you shall also make two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle. They shall be coupled together at the bottom and they shall be coupled together at the top by one ring. Thus it shall be for both of them. They shall be for the two corners. So there shall be eight boards with their sockets of silver; sixteen sockets; two sockets under each board.</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">a. </span><span class="cs31007154">For the tabernacle you shall make the boards of acacia wood</span><span class="csA7555675">: Each board was made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold.

The back (</span><span class="cs31007154">westward</span><span class="csA7555675">) side was six boards wide with two corner boards, for a total of eight boards across the back.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">c. </span><span class="cs31007154">Coupled together at the top by one ring</span><span class="csA7555675">: Each board was joined together by a system of </span><span class="cs31007154">tenons</span><span class="csA7555675"> (tabs) with </span><span class="cs31007154">rings</span><span class="csA7555675">, through which ran bars.

Silver is the metal associated with redemption and payment for sin (Exodus 21:32, Leviticus 5:15, 27:3, 27:6, Numbers 18:16, and Deuteronomy 22:19). Jesus was betrayed for silver (Matthew 26:15). The tabernacle&#39;s foundation was silver - pointing to the redeeming work of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">ii. Perhaps the dual nature of the foundation had to do with the two sources of revelation - the Old and New Testaments.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iii. The silver of redemption also separated the tabernacle from the dirt of the desert floor.

The middle bar shall pass through the midst of the boards from end to end. You shall overlay the boards with gold, make their rings of gold </span><span class="cs366CB853">as </span><span class="cs338C08B3">holders for the bars, and overlay the bars with gold. And you shall raise up the tabernacle according to its pattern which you were shown on the mountain.</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">a. </span><span class="cs31007154">And you shall make bars of acacia wood</span><span class="csA7555675">: Each bar was made of acacia wood and overlaid in gold. Seemingly, the bars ran the entire length of each side, linking together each board into one system.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">b. </span><span class="cs31007154">The middle bar shall pass through the midst of the boards from end to end</span><span class="csA7555675">: Four bars ran horizontally on each side, linking each board. One bar - </span><span class="cs31007154">the middle bar</span><span class="csA7555675"> - was invisible, running in the middle of each board.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. This speaks to both the visible and the invisible unity among God&#39;s people. The system of linking bars was both visible and invisible.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">c. </span><span class="cs31007154">According to its pattern which you were shown on the mountain</span><span class="csA7555675">: The repetition of this phrase (Exodus 25:9, 25:40 and here in 26:30) suggests that Moses received a vision of exactly how the tabernacle should look. He had to communicate this vision to the craftsmen who did the actual building.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. God works the same way in leaders today. He gives them a vision of what His work should be, and the leader passes it on to others who will do much of the actual work. Moses couldn&#39;t have remained silent about what God had shown him, or the work would never have gotten done.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9A9996D5"><span class="csA7555675">C.

Their hooks </span><span class="cs366CB853">shall be </span><span class="cs338C08B3">gold, upon four sockets of silver. And you shall hang the veil from the clasps. Then you shall bring the ark of the Testimony in there, behind the veil.

The ancient Jews said the later veil of the temple was as wide as four fingers, so that no one could possible see into the Most Holy place.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">b. </span><span class="cs31007154">With an artistic design of cherubim</span><span class="csA7555675">: From this, we know that the interior of the tabernacle was filled with gold and the pattern of cherubim.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">c. </span><span class="cs31007154">The veil shall</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span><span class="cs31007154">be a divider for you between the holy place and the Most Holy</span><span class="csA7555675">: The veil separated the tent into two compartments. The first compartment was </span><span class="cs31007154">the holy place</span><span class="csA7555675">, which was the larger room, first entered, with the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altar of incense. The second compartment was </span><span class="cs31007154">the Most Holy</span><span class="csA7555675"> place, a smaller room with the Ark of the Covenant.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. This veil was a barrier, and no priest could go beyond the veil into the Most Holy place except the high priest. He could only enter once a year, and that on the Day of Atonement.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">ii. Spiritually speaking, in dying for our sins Jesus </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption</span><span class="csA7555675"> (Hebrews 9:12).</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iii. In the temple, this veil was torn from top to bottom at the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51), showing that through His death, there is no longer a barrier to the Most Holy place.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iv. Now the Most Holy Place is open to us: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil, that is His flesh</span><span class="csA7555675"> (Hebrews 10:19-20). The torn veil of Matthew 27:51 also symbolizes the broken body of Jesus, through which we have access to the Most Holy Place.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">v. Centuries later, the ancient general Pompey pushed aside the priests and walked right into the Most Holy place of the temple - and was astounded to see there was no idol or statue.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="csA7555675">2.
