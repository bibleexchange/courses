He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The principles of the marriage relationship.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">In Christian marriage, the model never to be forgotten is the Lord Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">A believer is a member of His body. No more intimate relationship could be imagined than the relationship that exists between one member of a physical body and another member. Each member of a body shares the same life, is controlled by the same spirit, is washed by the same blood, and is ruled by the same brain. The idea of a leg, an arm, or an eye existing independently is ludicrous.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Because we are members of Christ&#39;s body, the high and holy standard of Christian marriage is reachable; the standard is not just a lofty ideal. The link between each believer and Christ may be mystical, but it is certainly not mythical. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07"><a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eph+5%3A30"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Ephesians 5:30</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07"> says, &quot;We are members of his body.&quot; Christ&#39;s life is our life. His love is our love. His Spirit energizes our spirits. His blood cleanses all.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">When Paul wrote that husbands are to love their wives &quot;as the Lord the church,&quot; he was not being idealistic. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">He is being intensely practical. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Because we are members of His body, our lack of love is replaced by His boundless love. Our little tributaries of love soon dry up, but the ocean tides of His immeasurable love come in and overflow the banks of the narrow channels of our love.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The husband is not to resolve: &quot;I will love my wife as Christ loved the church. I will do my best to imitate Christ.&quot; The result would only be an imitation. The Holy Spirit tells every Christian husband to draw on the fact that he is a member of Christ&#39;s own body&mdash;&quot;of his flesh, and of his bones,&quot;. A relationship exists between the believer and Christ, making it possible for a man to love his wife as Christ loved the church.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">If this relationship between Christ and us did not exist, then Paul&#39;s whole idea of marriage was just a noble dream. But this relationship is not merely a glorious concept. It is a down-to-earth, hard-fact reality. It is the principle on which all else rests. Our organic oneness with Christ certainly exists. We have God&#39;s Word for that. Any breakdowns are on our side, not His.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The key to making the principles of the marriage relationship work is faith. Our problem is that we only half believe them. The principles, however, remain the same. We </span><span class="csD3860DFD">are</span><span class="csA521DC07"> members of His body. And, of course, this principle applies to the wife in her role, in the same way it applies to the husband in his role.</span></p><p class="csD9BBA7D9"><span class="cs75A07D5F">A Man and his bride (Christ&#39;s Bride will be chosen) (</span><span class="csA521DC07"><a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eph+5%3A31-32"><span class="csF42C4B08">5:31-32</span></a></span><span class="cs75A07D5F">)</span></p><p class="cs4F0F9526"><span class="csD3860DFD">Eph 5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">A Christian is mystically linked with the body of Christ. On the other side, he is maritally linked with his wife. Now Christ&#39;s life and love flow through him to her, completing the circuit. Of course the Christian wife is also directly linked with Christ and His love flows through her too. Faith throws the switch that allows the power to flow and the results to show.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Paul&#39;s teaching on marriage, like the Lord&#39;s teaching in <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mk+10%3A2-12"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Mark 10:2-12</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">, is based on <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+2%3A23-24"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Genesis 2:23-24</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">. Marriage was God&#39;s purpose </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">In instituting marriage, God had eternity&#39;s values in view and the ultimate reality of Christ and His church in mind. Sin, however, has dimmed the bright ideal. Even when we know the truth that is found in Christ, our chronic unbelief often hinders us from seeing the truth work in our lives. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">God intends the Christian home to be an outpost of Heaven in a sin-cursed world. The home is to be a place where family, friends, visitors, and neighbors can come, see, and sense the wonders of God&#39;s mysterious purposes at work.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">It is no accident that the first and second times that love is mentioned in the Bible occur when and where they do. The first mention of love is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">the love of the father for the son</span><span class="csA521DC07"> in <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+22"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Genesis 22</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">. Abraham loved Isaac, yet God demanded that he take his only begotten son to mount Moriah and enact Calvary there. &quot;Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+22%3A2"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">22:2</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). The spiritual significance of this illumines all of a past eternity.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The second mention of love is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">the love of the son for his bride</span><span class="csA521DC07"> in <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+24"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Genesis 24</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">. &quot;Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&#39;s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her&quot; (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+24%3A67"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">24:67</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). The spiritual significance of the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah illumines all of the endless ages yet unborn. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">There are hidden depths in Christian marriage that are linked with God&#39;s eternal purposes. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Paul gave us glimpses, and a comprehensive study of Old Testament brides will reveal more. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Some of those brides teach us truth regarding Christ and His church; others (such as Abraham and Sarah, Abraham and Katurah, and Hosea and Gomer) teach us truth regarding Jehovah and Israel.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Mt 14:22 &para; And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Mr 6:45 &para; And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. {unto...: or, over against Bethsaida} </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Lu 8:22 &para; Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Peter was doing just what Jesus was doing; he was doing the impossible. Peter&#39;s faith in Christ enabled the power and authority of Christ over every circumstance to operate in his life; in terms of what he was able to do at that moment and in that situation, there was absolutely no difference between Peter and Christ. Peter had not mastered the theory of whatever dynamic was involved in walking on water, but his trust in Christ at that moment so linked him with Christ that Christ&#39;s mastery was transmitted to him. Peter&#39;s faith turned on the power in his life.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The </span><span class="csD3860DFD">boldness of Peter&#39;s trust</span><span class="csA521DC07"> during those few glorious moments when the treacherous waves were as solid as dry land beneath his feet. But there was a sudden </span><span class="csD3860DFD">breakdown of Peter&#39;s trust</span><span class="csA521DC07"> as he became aware of the angry wind and sea. He took his eye off the Lord and fastened it on his circumstances. Faith died and fear rose. The vital link to the source of power was severed and Peter began to sink.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">But all was not lost. The Lord had not challenged Peter to try this new kind of life only to let him perish when he failed. Jesus came alongside him. Peter fixed his eye once more on the Master and cried out, &quot;Lord, save me&quot; (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">14:30</span><span class="csA521DC07">). Faith took hold once more and the Lord took hold. That mighty arm was outstretched to save. That hand, able to contain in its hollow the waters of the seven seas, caught the sinking disciple. &quot;O thou of little faith,&quot; He said, &quot;wherefore didst thou doubt?&quot; (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">14:31</span><span class="csA521DC07">)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Peter&#39;s faith was little, but it was better than no faith. Peter had been given an experience of victorious living that no one else in the boat had been given, an experience he would remember to his dying day.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Mt 14:32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Mt 14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
