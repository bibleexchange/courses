<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>1<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
children in the orphanage are wearing clothes that are threadbare and shoes
that are falling apart. Containers holding clothes and other supplies for the
orphanage are not delivered frequent enough to meet the needs of the orphans.
It is promised that a shipment will go out immediately, but it is several
months to a year before the is a shipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>2<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
are no screens or glass in the windows of the dorms of the orphans and neither
are they supplied with mosquito nets for their beds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>3<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jonas
Kadaghe has affirmed that many of the good and new thing on the orphanage
grounds have been installed or repaired right before a group has come from
America. It is good to clean up before visitors come, but we also must remember
that these children are there all year and deserve repairs meant for them and
not the people coming to view the grounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>4<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
orphans have confirmed that special food is purchased and served at times when
a group from America is on the grounds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>5<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regular
meals at the orphanage consist of either rice and beans, stiff porridge, white
corn and beans,  or breakfast porridge with hardly any allowance given to
provide the children with fruits, vegetables, or meat to give the children
proper nourishment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>6<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L.
K. Powers was told repeatedly that we needed earth-rods to provide proper
grounding to electricity on the orphanage grounds, but he has neglected to
issue their installment. This is a liability for physical danger due to
electrical shock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>7<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matthew
Derocher has personally witnessed Samson's church in Mwica and bears witness
that the building is quite incomplete. In America he was lead to believe by L.
K.  Powers that the building was completely finished. Jonas Kadaghe affirms
that the $15,000 that was raised was not all invested in the project. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>8<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L.
K. Powers decided to remove insurance from the Toyota truck, which was
purchased for $24,000 that was raised by people in America. He deemed that it
was too expensive though it was only approximately $600 per year. The vehicle
was in an accident and we would have received approximately $15,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>9<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead
of using a convenient and reliable method of transferring money (such as PayPal
or a linked bank account) to Africa L. K. Powers chooses to send money through
Western Union. This service imposes a hefty 10% fee and it is also to be noted
that these transactions are very hard to trace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>10<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The church built in
Gonga is financially supported in large part by Elijah. As the founding
organization of the church, Landmark World Missions could help with the
churches it creates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>11<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The orphanage not
finished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>12<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Money is owed to a
local merchant named V.J. The money is for chairs purchased for the church in
Gonga. As a good steward, this debt should be paid off before new endeavors are
pursued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>13<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The board of directors
for Landmark World Missions does not meet very often and is not privy to major
financial decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>14<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Money is often
displaced and is not used for the purpose for which it was raised. Finances
were raised during Landmark Youth Camp 2011 for the purpose of buying many
Bibles and money has been raised for a radio tower in the Rift Valley, but the
money raised for these items was not used for the promised reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>15<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No lesson has been
apparently learned from the vehicle that was totaled without insurance. The new
vehicle has no insurance either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>16<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where is the money
that was raised in convention? Close to $20,000 in cash was raised at
Landmark’s convention in April of 2012. Jonas says aprox. $3,000 USD has been
put into the building project on the grounds of Safe Haven Orphanage since
then.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>17<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Electricity bill went
unpaid for four months. It was shut off because of being unpaid. It was turned
on the day before Matthew Derocher arrived (Sept. 1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>18<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A container from
America has not been shipped in over two years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can help on a lot of these things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.         We must produce clothes for all ages to be
shipped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.         Is it more reasonable to first try to keep
screens on the windows, rather than try to keep up with nets on the beds?
Matthew Derocher has already talked with Jonas about this. Bed nets would have
to be replaced too often and it would be best to screen in the windows. He
rough estimate is that it would cost approximately $600.00 to screen in the
windows for both the boys and girls dorms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.         It looks like someone could help as a maintenance
man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can find out who is actually making these improvements
just before visits from America and at least learn from them, encourage them or
hire them to do more of these improvements also use them for maintenance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can pray to send men to help you, while you are there and
become responsible for some of these things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We CAN PRAY like Jesus did for who  would be willing to work
with you, in all these areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What can be done to make Landmark World Missions a valid
and trustworthy institution?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Changes in
Africa will not be as lasting if there are not first changes in America in the
way things are run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Transparency--everything
needs to be done above board. Instead of waiting for people to ask questions,
we should give them answers before they think to ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Internal
financial reports need to be made at least quarterly and reviewed by the board
members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A public
financial report should be made at least annually, but better bi-annually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The board
should meet quarterly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The board
should vote on any major financial decisions before L. K. Powers makes any
promises in Africa or stirs any hope of physical materials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Separate
accounts should be opened for large projects such as the building of churches
that have received designated donations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Local
African workers should be evaluated for performance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
to the old adage, pictures do lie. We need to make the newsletter more of a
solid presentation of facts instead of stories and empty promises. It would be
good if several people contributed to the newsletter instead of just one, as it
has been. If Jonas or someone else from Africa could give a report in them,
then the people would have a clearer picture of what is going on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Orphan program</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why cannot
we run the orphanage by monthly sponsors of each orphan? At one time this
method was attempted, but was not structured in a way so that it would
continue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Included
in the cost should be their personal needs, food, &amp; a percentage of the
overhead (i.e. salaries of the workers &amp; electricity).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
sponsors of the children must have a way to communicate with the children and
vice versa. They should have a way to send emails and receive several pictures
of the child each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Payment
could be set up in an automatic way using merchant services on the internet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When a
child is discharged from the orphanage, the sponsor should be informed. They
could be given an option to sponsor a new orphan if one is available, or
receive an email notice when one is available if on is currently not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If they
ever want to stop sponsoring a child, there should be a clear and painless way
to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
should receive newsletters and financial reports so they can see where their
money has gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-17.95pt'>&#9679;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it
would be needed to hire someone to take care of correspondence between the
sponsors and the children.</p>
