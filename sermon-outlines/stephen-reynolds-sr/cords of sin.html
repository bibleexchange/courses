		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">Note how false the charms are. The adulteress flatters and speaks fair, her words are honey and oil, but she will deceive those that hearken to her: Her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them; she often changes her disguise, and puts on a great variety of false colours, because, if she be rightly known, she is certainly hated. Proteus-like, she puts on many shapes, that she may keep in with those whom she has a design upon. And what does she aim at with all this art and management? &nbsp;Nothing but to keep them from pondering the path of life, for she knows that, if they once come to do that, she shall certainly lose them. Those are ignorant of Satan&#39;s devices who do not understand that the great thing he drives at in all his temptations is, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">[1.] To keep them from choosing the path of life, to prevent them from being religious and from going to heaven, that, being himself shut out from happiness, he may keep them out from it. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">[2.] In order hereunto, to keep them from pondering the path of life, from considering how reasonable it is that they should walk in that path, and how much it will be for their advantage. Be it observed, to the honour of religion, that it certainly gains its point with all those that will but allow themselves the liberty of a serious thought and will weigh things impartially in an even balance, and that the devil has no way of securing men in his interests but by diverting them with continual amusements of one kind or another from the calm and sober consideration of the things that belong to their peace. &nbsp;And uncleanness is a sin that does as much as any thing blind the understanding, sear the conscience, and keep people from pondering the path of life.

Solomon here brings in the convinced sinner reproaching himself, and aggravating his own folly. He will then most bitterly lament it. First, That because he hated to be reformed he therefore hated to be informed, and could not endure either to be taught his duty (How have I hated not only the discipline of being instructed, but the instruction itself, though all true and good!) or to be told of his faults--My heart despised reproof, Pr 5:12. He cannot but own that those who had the charge of him, parents, ministers, had done their part; they had been his teachers; they had instructed him, had given him good counsel and fair warning (Pr 5:13); but to his own shame and confusion does he speak it, and therein justifies God in all the miseries that were brought upon him, he had not taken their council, had not obeyed their voice, for indeed he never inclined his ear to those that instructed him, never </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">minded what they said nor admitted the impressions of it. &nbsp;Note, Those who have had a good education and do not live up to it will have a great deal to answer for another day; and those who will not now remember what they were taught, to conform themselves to it, will be made to remember it as an aggravation of their sin, and consequently of their ruin. Secondly, That by the frequent acts of sin the habits of it were so rooted and confirmed that his heart was fully set in him to commit it (Pr 5:14): I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. When he came into the synagogue, or into the courts of the temple, to worship God with other Israelites, his unclean heart was full of wanton thoughts and desires and his eyes of adultery. Reverence of the place and company, and of the work that bccwas doing, could not restrain him, but he was almost as wicked and vile there as any where. No sin will appear more frightful to an awakened conscience than the profanation of holy things; nor will any aggravation of sin render it more exceedingly sinful than the place we are honoured with in the congregation and assembly, and the advantages we enjoy thereby. Zimri and Cozbi avowed their villany in the sight of Moses and all the congregation (Nu 25:6), and heart-adultery is as open to God, and must needs be most offensive to him, when we draw nigh to him in religious exercises. I was in all evil in defiance of the magistrates and judges, and their assemblies; so some understand it. Others refer it to the evil of punishment, not to the evil of sin: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">&quot;I was made an example, a spectacle to the world. I was under almost all God&#39;s sore judgments in the midst of the congregation of Israel, set up for a mark. I stood up and cried in the congregation,&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">&nbsp; Job 30:28.
