Peter is saying &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T LOOK AT THE PROCESS&rdquo; Keep your eyes on the goal! Peter went through a fiery trial and His faith was tested that night he fled and followed Jesus afar off and denied that he even knew Him. Remember what Jesus said to Peter before he denied the Lord? Peter Satan has desired to have you and to sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that &ldquo;YOUR FAITH FAIL NOT&rdquo; Before the cock crows you will deny three times that you even knew me. This helps us to see what Peter was saying when he penned in His 1</span><span class="csE3E21311"><sup>st</sup></span><span class="csE3E21311"> Epistle &ldquo;Receiving the end of your faith&rdquo;. Peter is telling us by experience not to get caught up in the process of the fiery trials. He is saying if you fail the Lord don&rsquo;t give up, but to keep our eyes on the goal! </span></p><p class="cs95A3899A"><span class="cs723021EB">Mt 26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span></p><p class="cs95A3899A"><span class="cs723021EB">&nbsp;Lu 22:61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span></p><p class="cs95A3899A"><span class="cs723021EB">&nbsp;Joh 2:22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span></p><p class="cs95A3899A"><span class="cs723021EB">&nbsp;Ac 11:16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</span></p><p class="cs95A3899A"><span class="csE3E21311">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95A3899A"><span class="csE3E21311">Paul the Apostle said the same words &ldquo;This one thing I do forgetting those things behind, I press toward the mark or goal for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; You see it&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs723021EB">through obedience</span><span class="csE3E21311"> in the fiery trial that </span><span class="cs723021EB">self is denied and the Lord </span><span class="csE3E21311">removes all self-confidence that would causes us to say I DID IT! When he is finished with us we can only say like Peter HE DID IT! It was Him and His power that brought me through! It was His faith that he gave me; even the faith of the Son of God. As Paul said &ldquo; Its no longer I that lives but Christ that liveth in me and life I now live in the flesh I live by the FAITH of the Son of God! The only thing that pleases the Father is Faith. Many times Jesus rebuked his disciples saying &ldquo;Oh ye of little faith&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where is your faith?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you doubt?&rdquo; The Scriptures say &ldquo; Without faith it is impossible to please Him&rdquo; Did you hear that? It&rsquo;s impossible to please Him without faith. </span></p><p class="cs95A3899A"><span class="csE3E21311">That means it&rsquo;s never going to happen until we believe Him. We must believe to receive. Which brings us back to what Peter was saying, &ldquo;Receiving the end of your faith&rdquo; We must keep our eyes on the goal set before us. We are going to go through many things such as fiery trials, storms, tests but they are all there to make us FAITHFULL! Only faith with no room for unbelief or doubt. After we go through the fire all that will be left is our dependence on Him and we will have no confidence in the flesh. Glory!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE3E21311">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs697E7615">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs697E7615">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
