There was the march around Moab. A picture of progress, marching forth from place to place in a spirit of strong assurance. Now the people were ready for their final march right up to the border of the promised land. At last, they were on the verge of reaching their destination. As they marched along, the excitement of their hearts could be seen in a faster pace: the tempo of their steps increased as they marched day by day. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped at Oboth (Numbers 21:10).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped at Iye Abarim (Numbers 21:11).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped at the Zered Valley (Numbers 21:12).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped alongside the Arnon River (Numbers 21:13-15). &nbsp;A famous river that flowed into Amorite territory. The river was actually the border between Moab and the Amorite territory. A large number of significant battles had been fought in the area around the river (Numbers 21:14-15). </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped at the well Beer (Numbers 21:16-17). The people again were without water, but the Lord told them where they could dig a well for water. The gift of water led God&#39;s people to compose a song of joy, the Song of the Well.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped at Mattanah (Numbers 21:18).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped at Nahaliel (Numbers 21:19).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped at Bamoth (Numbers 21:19).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israelites camped in Moab in the valley below Pisgah peak, an excellent location to spy out the land of Canaan (Numbers 21:20).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Israel had been an unbelieving people, grumbling, a people who lacked assurance and confidence in the Lord. They just did not believe He had the power to carry them into the promised land. But this scene of Scripture is entirely different: it is a picture of a quick pace, an excitement to reach their destination. It is that of breaking camp, marching, stopping, and setting up camp; then again breaking camp, marching, stopping, and setting up camp; then again breaking camp, marching, stopping, and setting up camp; and on and on. The idea is that of a fast pace, of purpose and motivation, of enthusiasm and excitement. This has not been seen before, but now the people are rapidly approaching the promised land. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They seem to be trusting God more than ever before.

There was victory over Sihon, the king of the Amorites. This is a picture of God&#39;s protection when attacked by enemies (Genesis 15:16; Psalm 136:19). As the Israelites marched to the promised land, they came to the border of the Amorites. The land of the Amorites stood between them and the promised land. God&#39;s people had no choice: if they were going to continue their journey to the promised land, they had to pass through the land of the Amorites. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The request of Israel for safe passage Num 21:22 Moses promised that the Israelites would not do any damage to the fields or crops or water as they marched through Amorite territory. He promised to stay strictly on the king&#39;s highway until they had passed completely through the territory.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprise, hostile attack against Israel Num 21:23 King Sihon rejected the request of Israel for safe passage. Instead, the king and his officials mobilized their entire army and marched out against Israel. When the Amorites reached Jahaz, they attacked.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the surprise attack, Israel was victorious Num 21:24-25 They routed the Amorite army and pursued them all over Amorite territory, conquering the entire nation. But they stopped at the Amorite border because of the fortifications. However, they did capture and occupy all the cities of the Amorites including the capital of Heshbon and its surrounding villages Num 21:25</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Victory over a celebrated king and army had been achieved Num 21:26-31</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great victory is seen in the conquest of the city of Heshbon: it was the capital of the Amorites&#39; king, Sihon &nbsp;Num 21:26</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The great victory is also seen in the defeat of the great king Sihon: he had conquered Moab, a conquest so great that it had been celebrated by ancient poets &nbsp;&nbsp;Num 21:27-31 &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">king Sihon had been so powerful that he was able to conquer Moab. Therefore, the people of God must be even more powerful, for they had conquered the great king Sihon. The message was clear: Israel was the super-power of the area, stronger than either the Amorites or the Moabites.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory was even extended to the major city of Jazer &nbsp;Num 21:32 &nbsp;Moses sent spies to Jazer and captured the towns surrounding it. He also drove out all the Amorite citizens of that area.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="link325"><span class="csCF6BBF71">III.	A clear picture of victory through the power of God. (</span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71">21:33-35) </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Og, King of Bashan</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: there was the military victory over Og, the king of Bashan. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;king of Og marched his whole army out to attack Israel at Edrei (Num 21:33</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp; God gave His people strong assurance of victory (Numbers 21:34). Moses and the people were not to fear their enemy. Total and complete victory was assured. God&#39;s people were to use the same pattern as before: pursue and total conquest, just as they had done with Sihon, king of the Amorites. The whole nation of Bashan was to be conquered and the cities destroyed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Nu 21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
