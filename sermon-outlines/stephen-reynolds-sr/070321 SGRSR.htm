<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: True Intercessors</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Luke 22:31-62</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>TRUE INTERCESSORY PRAYER</u>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Knowing God’s plan and praying through until God’s will is
fulfilled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Work that WORD
inn my prayer settling for nothing less.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Believe God’s Word
above our feelings, above our thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Weep NOW with an obedience in our spirit. Obedience
NOW. Prayer NOW. Instead of Prayer with Bitterness later.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Proverbs 28:5 “…they that seek the Lord understand
all things.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Isaiah 59:16</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Jeremiah “none saith restore”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Job “I cannot believe a word you say because you
tell me the opposite that I know. You say the wicked prosper and that I am
wicked because I as a righteous man suffer adversity. I cannot listen to that
kind of counsel.” Job said that if there’s a spot in my hands let my wife be a
slave and his offspring turned over to others, he was completely free of guilt
and shame. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“SIMON, SIMON” v.31</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A true intercessor doesn’t call one time and then
say that’s enough, but continues to Call.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“That your faith fail not” v.32</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We must believe God.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is a process to learning. Here the Lord is
saying “Simon, Simon” wanting to get his attention to teach him something. What
is ahead, what is going to happen beforehand. Not going into trial ignorantly.
Ignorance causes wickedness. You will never do well by accident. You must TRUST
the Lord in order to do well. In the process of learning how to believe God it
is impossible, difficult without God’s help. I cannot do it on my own. What He
puts inside of me, I must work out with fear and trembling. He works by faith
and His Word.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“When thou art converted, strengthen the brethren”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The process the Lord is bringing us through is
through learning. We get our understanding by seeking the Lord. The key of
learning is seeking the Lord. The effects of ignorance always causes
wickedness. 2 Chr. 7:14 The wicked love their sin therefore they do not deal
with it. It is not just ignorance, but WILLINGLY IGNORANT. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>WE CAN KNOW ALL THINGS IF WE SEEK HIM BECAUSE HE
REVEALS.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Lord reveals the enemies desire—Luke 22:31</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>How can
we know what the devil desires and designs? By the Word of God. He desires to
have that he might sift as weak. His plan is to get you to deny that you the
Lord. The devil’s desire is against God, against me loving God and serving God.
If I feel any desire not to worship God that is God allowing us to sense the
devil’s desire. That is for the intercessor to catch a hold of and fight
against. God is going to have some warriors that will fight the fight of faith.
The true intercessor knows what it is to hold the garment and pray.—Joel 2:13 </p>

</span>He Revealed that the hour was THEIR hour.v.53</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>God’s eternal plan and
purpose must be more important to us than anything else. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Let the full weight of what they are going through
be upon us.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Isaiah 53:6 –HE bore our sin and our sin was laid
upon Him. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>Speak the
Word and do what is needed. Speak it AGAIN. “Simon, Simon”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>
