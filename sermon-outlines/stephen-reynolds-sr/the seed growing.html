Yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; do not forsake us!<br/><br/>14:10 Thus says the LORD concerning this people: Truly they have loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not accept them, now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.<br/><br/>14:19 Have you completely rejected Judah? Does your heart loathe Zion? Why have you struck us down so that there is no healing for us? We look for peace, but find no good; for a time of healing, but there is terror instead.<br/><br/>14:20 We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, the iniquity of our ancestors, for we have sinned against you.<br/><br/>14:21 Do not spurn us, for your name&#39;s sake; do not dishonor your glorious throne; remember and do not break your covenant with us.<br/><br/>14:22 Can any idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Is it not you, O LORD our God? We set our hope on you, for it is you who do all this.</span><a name="_GoBack"></a></p></body>
