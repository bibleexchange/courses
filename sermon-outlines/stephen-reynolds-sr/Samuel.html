In a monotonous cycle: Israel rebelled; God allowed them to be conquered by an enemy king; they were vassals to a foreign nation for a period of years; Israel cried to God; and God raised up a judge to deliver them. The cycle may be described as </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">sin, servitude, supplication </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">salvation. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Notice that God always gave more years of peace than years of captivity-often at a five-to-one ratio. The major spiritual principle to be learned is the principle of restoration upon </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">repentance and change. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">God would not accept His called out physical people in a sinful and rebellious condition, and He certainly will hold to the same conditions for his spiritual people,</span><span class="cs16E84F30"> </span><span class="cs31B015EA">&quot;For God does not show favoritism&quot; (Romans 2:11)</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Judges also shows the necessity of right leadership. Each time God delivered Israel, He called a specific individual to lead them into battle, and to be judge over them when they were freed. And when that leader died, the nation returned to its apostasy.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">De 18:15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;17 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">1Samuel 3:20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Ps 99:6 &para; Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Jer 15:1 &para; Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Ac 3:20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Ac 7:37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Ac 13:20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Heb 11:32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
