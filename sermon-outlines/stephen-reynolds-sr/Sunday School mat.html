An aid may help impart knowledge, attitudes, skills, or understanding; arouse emotions; or develop appreciation. </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs34AE182B"><span class="cs8926E06">An instructional aid is a tool for </span><span class="csDB729555">improving instruction</span><span class="cs8926E06"> not take the place of instruction, or to take up too much time for the prepared lesson and the part for the preaching with anointing.	</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs6D5EDE14"><span class="cs8926E06">Instructional aids are valuable for several reasons but not as valuable as the anointing that breaks and destroys the yoke of the bondage of sin that is heavy in these children&rsquo;s lives. </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs34AE182B"><span class="cs8926E06">An instructional aid as a tool does help overcome the language or attention barrier but nowhere as effective as the anointed preaching by God&rsquo;s design.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs89759355"><span class="cs8926E06">Most teaching is verbal, either written or oral; yet increasingly </span><span class="csB0EFEC6E">our culture emphasizes</span><span class="cs8926E06"> visual learning. Aids help capture and hold students attention and make learning more rapid, thus making more efficient use of class time to preach the gospel to them under the anointing. Students remember longer what they have learned when the aural sense is reinforced by the visual. Aids can make the Bible come alive in ways that words alone cannot.</span></p><p class="csE9DD335D"><span class="cs8926E06">Traditionally, instructional aids have been classified either as impressional or expressional.</span></p><p class="cs89759355"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">IMPRESSIONAL AIDS</span></p><p class="cs1EB6FE52"><span class="cs8926E06">Impressional aids are used to create impressions on the students through activities that are done to or for them. Among the impressional aids that you will find effective are audio devices, visuals, and audiovisuals.</span></p><p class="cs416EB364"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">AUDIO AIDS</span></p><p class="cs8FD707C7"><span class="cs8926E06">Sound is vital to communication and equipment such as CD players, and tape recorders can be used profitably in church education.</span></p><p class="cs8FD707C7"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">VISUAL AIDS</span></p><p class="cs8FD707C7"><span class="cs8926E06">Visuals reach the student through the eyes as well as the ears. One value of visuals is that students who fail to grasp a truth orally may be able to comprehend it through visual means.</span></p><p class="csA6C5F681"><span class="cs8926E06">Included in this are objects and models, maps and globes, pictures, bulletin boards, chalkboards, projectors and flipcharts, flannelgraph.</span></p><p class="cs416EB364"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">Objects and Models</span></p><p class="csDDB1B7BF" style="tab-stops:left 14.85pt;"><span class="cs8926E06">	Objects and models are tangible items used to help illustrate or define spiritual truth.</span></p><p class="csA6C5F681"><span class="cs8926E06">Objects appeal to everyone. A small object such as a coin, stone, or paper is easily used. Jesus frequently used objects in his teaching. When he wanted to teach his followers about the qualities they&#39; should possess, he set a child in their midst as an object lesson. On another occasion, when his enemies tried to trap him on the issue of paying tribute to Caesar, he called for a coin, which he then used as an object to make his point. When used effectively, objects</span></p><p class="cs89759355"><span class="cs8926E06">are valuable instructional aids. They give students firsthand experience with the subject being discussed.</span></p><p class="cs1EB6FE52"><span class="cs8926E06">A well-equipped church should also have among its materials a collection of models such as the tabernacle, temple, home in Bible times, as well as missionary artifacts. Bible models add background and substance to the biblical records and descriptions of life in ancient times and missionary artifacts provide realism to missions stories.</span></p><h2 class="csB7C0EF58">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Maps and Globes</span></h2>
		<p class="cs4B3EEAA8"><span class="cs8926E06">Maps and globes help students become familiar with mission fields and Bible geography and history. </span></p><p class="cs4B3EEAA8"><span class="cs8926E06">The journeys of the patriarchs, the wanderings of Israel, or the campaigns of Joshua and David cannot be followed without the use of maps. Every class, therefore, should have a good set of Bible maps available. Small maps in Bibles, classroom wall maps, and maps on overhead</span></p><p class="cs8E63AB38"><span class="cs8926E06">transparencies are all helpful aids for effective teaching.</span></p><h2 class="cs95B26442">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Pictures</span></h2>
		<p class="csE9DD335D"><span class="cs8926E06">The skillful use of pictures results in successful instruction. Some of the great works of art depict Bible scenes. Copies of these masterpieces can be used in class sessions. Often a series of pictures can be arranged to present a running narrative of the life of Christ or other Bible characters. Pictures may be purchased from publishers of curriculum materials or collected from magazines, posters, calendars, and other sources.</span></p><p class="cs1EB6FE52"><span class="cs8926E06">Students may need help in interpreting a picture&#39;s message and its relationship to the lesson emphasis. Too much attention to details of a picture will cause the students to remember the picture more than the lesson. Often pictures are left up for several weeks after the lesson has been taught. In this way they silently help the students review previous lessons.</span></p><h2 class="csB7C0EF58">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Bulletin Boards</span></h2>
		<p class="cs4B3EEAA8"><span class="cs8926E06">Often known as the classroom &quot;silent teacher,&quot; bulletin boards use good visual form, attractive colors, and effective pictures to communicate information. A bulletin board can emphasize, remind, review, introduce, or announce a variety of subjects. Bulletin boards should be kept current and fresh for maximum impact on the viewers. To add to their learning value, students can be involved in creating and constructing them.</span></p><p class="cs98F865E4"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">Chalkboard and Flip Chart</span></p><p class="csD2C81FAD"><span class="cs8926E06">Every classroom should have a chalkboard. Flip charts and chalkboards may be used by teachers to draw diagrams, outlines, and sketches step by step. Even the teacher&#39;s action while using the chalkboard helps sustain attention.</span></p><p class="csD2C81FAD"><span class="cs8926E06">It is not necessary to be a professional artist to make good use of a chalkboard or flip chart. A short line, a few stick figures, a circle, or a square can represent people, cities, or events. New and difficult words, names of characters, important dates, an outline or summary can be written for class members to see. </span></p><p class="csD2C81FAD"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD2C81FAD"><span class="cs8926E06">Five things to remember when using a chalkboard or flip chart are:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2BCE10EA"><span class="cs8926E06">Avoid too much detail.</span></li><li class="cs2BCE10EA"><span class="cs8926E06">Don&#39;t block the view.</span></li><li class="cs2BCE10EA"><span class="cs8926E06">Write legibly, but quickly.</span></li><li class="cs2BCE10EA"><span class="cs8926E06">Stand at the side of your work as much as possible.</span></li><li class="cs2BCE10EA"><span class="cs8926E06">Talk while writing, but do not talk to the board.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs233396BD"><span class="cs8926E06">Teachers will also at times have the students use the flip chart or chalkboard. Student participation will help them remember the lesson longer.</span></p><p class="csF1FF786E"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">Flannelgraph</span></p><p class="cs5FFEAA8"><span class="cs8926E06">Flannelgraph is a very versatile instructional aid. It therefore is one of the most widely used aids in church educational programs. While it is most frequently used in young children&#39;s classes, it can also be effective with youth and adults.</span></p><p class="csD2C81FAD"><span class="cs8926E06">This medium secures attention at the very outset and, as new factors appear, interest is sustained. At the end of the lesson, the class may repeat the story, placing the figures on the board. This activiity combines the faculties of hearing, seeing, and doing.</span></p><p class="cs98F865E4"><span class="cs8926E06">Three basics must be mastered if the flannelgraph is to be used successfully-dexterity, suspense, and movement.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csE7AD7F32"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs2F00A314">dexterity,</span><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csC3945048"><span class="cs2F00A314">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs8926E06">You need to study the story in advance so that it flows swiftly and smoothly. </span><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
					<li class="cs76252020"><span class="cs8926E06">The figures should be arranged in advance in the order in which they will be used.</span></li><li class="cs76252020"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;If backgrounds are to be changed during the story, these should be laid out or arranged so that the change can be made without interrupting the story. </span></li></ol>
				</li><li class="csC3945048"><span class="cs8926E06">Talk as you work, but be sure to maintain eye contact with your students.</span></li><li class="csC3945048"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;Produced by persons </span><span class="cs2F00A314">from </span><span class="cs8926E06">diverse backgrounds, you should carefully preview them before showing them to your class. Imaginative teachers who have access to an 8mm home movie camera and projector have found creative ways to produce and use these in their teaching.</span></li></ol>
			</li></ol>
		<p class="csE8F90B11"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">Filmstrips and Slides</span></p><p class="csF0D95A86"><span class="cs8926E06">Many 35mm projectors can use either filmstrips or slides. Slide programs are available commercially, but they can also be prepared by teachers who have access to 35mm equipment. With a little practice you can photograph landscapes, buildings, other color photographs, classroom scenes, or individual students. By preparing an audio tape to accompany them, effective audiovisual programs can be produced.</span></p><p class="csFAFB7F1B"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">Transparencies </span><span class="cs8926E06">are profitable</span></p><p class="csFAFB7F1B"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFAFB7F1B"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFAFB7F1B"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFAFB7F1B"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE8F90B11"><span class="cs5BEC2C28">EXPRESSIONAL AIDS</span></p><p class="cs89759417" style="tab-stops:right 309.6pt;"><span class="cs8926E06">	Impressional aids include all things teachers do to make an impression on students in order to stimulate them to mental activity. Expression, however, involves students in various activities that allow them to express some aspect of the lesson they are learning to encourage them to think through the lesson until they can express it in their own words and behavior. Expressional activities allow teachers to evaluate what students have really learned.</span></p><p class="csDDB1B7C8" style="tab-stops:left 21.6pt;"><span class="cs8926E06">	To be effective, you must provide expressional activities that involve careful thinking, reasoning, analyzing, evaluating, and summarizing. This active involvement of the mind and will urges students to become &quot;doers of the word&quot; (James 1:22).</span></p><p class="cs8AF8DDFC"><span class="cs8926E06">Expressional activities are part of good teaching. They are effective because they supplement the personality and skill of the instructor, and assist students in learning.</span></p><p class="cs21C1FC36"><span class="cs8926E06">Impressional aids help to reach and stimulate-the student&#39;s mind but they do not necessarily secure a response. Expressional activities are effective because they deepen impression, capitalize on energy, and reach the personality in such a way as to bring lasting change in the students&#39; lives.</span></p><p class="cs21C1FC36"><span class="cs8926E06">Children will often forget what they hear and they may forget what they have seen, but they will not soon forget what they have done. Learning is a process of listening, looking, and doing. As students express themselves they empress their own minds and learn the truth through a different sense channel-not only through sight and sound, but also through activity. Learning begins and continues in what the learner does. Students taking piano lessons receive certain impressions when the teacher demonstrates a musical selection, but they don&#39;t begin to learn until they practice it for themselves.</span></p><p class="cs21C1FC36"><span class="cs8926E06">Effective expressional activities will have a positive effect on the shaping of the lesson and the lives of the students. The objective of Christian teaching is the development of Christian character and living. This requires the appropriation and application of knowledge which is encouraged by the use of expressional activities.</span></p><p class="csBA83BF21"><span class="cs8926E06">Two very important expressional aids are student activity books and handwork projects.</span></p></body>
