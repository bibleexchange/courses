Yet, God is reaching out to a remnant. V.3</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He is dealing with a people with quick ears and quick hearts to respond to the Word of God.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">v. 7,8 There are some that will know the power and grace of God who will be strong and mighty. &lsquo;they that know their God shall be mighty and do exploits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If anything else substitutes the life of Christ then you will be miserable. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As the ship&rsquo;s sail is set in the midst of contrary winds and directs the ship to the desired destination.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Micah 4:1-2 Before the tribulation hour there is going to be a people that will know God and see His mercy in His fullness. God&rsquo;s grace is sufficient in all things. He is going to make us a blessing when we realize that our sufficiency is in God. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God wants to do something in our spirit to change us completely.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I appreciate the message of the Overcoming Life and along with that message over and over again has come the charge of the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is going to be a remnant of people that have heard truth and will not come to full experience until after 3.5 years of the tribulation. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God&rsquo;s power, its undefeated, unchanging, unrelenting. I am challenged tonight to see beyond what we feel. There are things that go through our emotions to stab us like a sword and it comes like a fiery dart. The Holy Ghost warns us to be on guard to ward off all the fiery darts of the enemy. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People are always trying to shoot down and explain away the Christian life because they don&rsquo;t understand it. The thoughts that are coming from my mind are not to be trusted, are not to go by. In the midst of true repentance is a peace and safety.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are times when a certain thought would come to my mind, but the Holy Ghost checked me on it and I am glad I didn&rsquo;t say it.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We don&rsquo;t receive council from the world or those that speak from the top of their head. We seek counsel from those that seek God.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The dew from heaven is given to water the heart. If the seed is the Word of God, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the circumstances are, the word of God always brings life. When we stop going by our own thinking, that is true repentance. I need dew to fall from Heaven, I need the grace of God. True repentance will cause me to acknowledge my need of the grace of God. You will not gain anything from God until you believe Him.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;how can that many people be wrong&rdquo; people say looking at the numbers who side against the truth and the strait and narrow. Look at the cross. How many were wrong in that scene?</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Micah 4:7 I will make her that halteth a remnant. Have you ever felt like you couldn&rsquo;t make it one more step? Micah 5:3,7,8 God is looking for a remnant that he can feed and replenish and restore and make them strong that they can destroy the works of the devil out of their life and out of the lives of others.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It was because of Israel&rsquo;s unbelief and their refusing to receive and therefore they were cast far off. Even though the heart of man rejected the things of God, God reaches deep and far off to that which is desperate, destroyed, halt, and He draws them and says I WILL MAKE THEM. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how far off a person gets, the grace of god is able to reach out and bring them back. You can&rsquo;t be cast off too far that He won&rsquo;t have mercy. You can be brought back, you can be delivered. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God is able to make us strong that we don&rsquo;t have to be cast off&mdash;He can keep us. I Peter 1:5</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Micah 4:2 LET US GO UP&hellip;Let us not wait (Rev. 12:4) until tribulation comes upon us. Our God is able to keep us, let us depend on Him. Stop doing it my way. Stop thinking my thoughts, and say LET US GO UP&hellip;AND HE WILL TEACH US HIS WAYS. I love truth. I need truth. I remember years ago, reaching out to a certain individual concerning the Bride of Christ, 15 years. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I don&rsquo;t want to learn by a rod, but by a yielded heart. True repentance is only the first step. It takes that step of faith that reaches out and receives from God. Take us by the hand and teach us. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teach= bring us into training; chastening; correction. His commandments and chastening are not grievous to us. Once you see the principle of life working in our hearts&mdash;God is Holy I will be Holy. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus cares about you. David was in a wilderness period and cried out, &ldquo;No one cares fro my soul.&rdquo; God cares and God delivers.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Let Him teach you His ways.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And we will walk in His paths. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Micah 7:20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob. God gives us insight. True repentance is when we obey the Word. Repentance will cause us to feel our need for mercy, grace, the showers of Heaven. It isn&rsquo;t just going to come upon us, we must prepare for it. The dew tomorrow morning will fall everywhere, but rust will follow if things are not taken care of. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is what receives strength in the TIME OF THE BATTLE. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Abraham believed God, and God didn&rsquo;t just reward Abraham&rsquo;s faith. God rewarded Abraham&rsquo;s faith IN GOD. The key was the connection between Abraham&rsquo;s faith and God&mdash;a lifeline. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Others have a loud voice saying the giants are too big. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God will show us His ways, but we have got to want it. </span></p></body>
