This sense helps us govern the thoughts and actions.

This is something that God has built into man FOR MAN&#39;S GOOD, just like the nerves in our body or like a set of scales to weigh things out, or even signal lights. (Gen. 6:5; Rev. 3:17)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God wants man to know when things are not right in his life and that they need to have God fix whatever is wrong. When man sins or does wrong, God wants him to feel bad about it and guilty about it. If man felt good about sin, then man would never feel it necessary to fix the problem!The conscience is something that all men possess. In every dispensation all are responsible to follow that which is good and avoid that which is evil. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Job 1:1&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">&hellip; perfect and upright, and one that </span><span class="cs31B015EA">feared God</span><span class="csC382D2BB">, and </span><span class="cs31B015EA">eschewed</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> evil.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Romans 12:9&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">&hellip;. </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Abhor</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> that which is evil; cleave to that which is good</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1Peter 3:11&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Let him </span><span class="cs31B015EA">eschew</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is never safe to do something that your conscience will condemn. Only do it if your conscience gives a green light. If your conscience gives a red light, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">DO NOT DO IT</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. If it gives a yellow light, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">TAKE CAUTION</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. It is very dangerous for a person to do what is wrong and to ignore the signals that come from your conscience. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Always be careful to follow this rule: </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Adam&rsquo;s conversations and relationship with God were just as vivid and real if not more so than his conversations and relationship with Eve (Gen. 3:8). Man lost this &ldquo;God-Consciousness&rdquo; in the Fall and afterward was governed by the experience of his own &ldquo;self consciousness.&rdquo; This does not mean that Adam lost the knowledge that God exists or what God had said, but relationally Adam had become separated from God in the Fall and the extent to which Adam was &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; of God in Eden was lost.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the first dispensation, Adam knew nothing of sin, he was innocent. Adam relied entirely on the knowledge and instruction that came directly from God. In the second dispensation, Adam now had the knowledge of his own experience concerning the effects of sin: paradise lost, physical and spiritual death, and separation from God. Adam&rsquo;s eyes were &ldquo;opened&rdquo; in partaking of the fruit for sure, but Adam lost the great privilege of an intimate, unlimited walk with God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

You may discover that what you thought was wrong was not wrong at all and what you thought was right was not right at all. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Word of God and the Spirit of God (Bible Truth and the Spirit of Truth) </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">are our guides. &nbsp;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is the Bible that tells us what is good and what is evil. It is the Bible that we should follow. Jesus said, &quot;Thy Word &nbsp;is Truth&rdquo;, but what man&rsquo;s conscience may tell him is not ALWAYS truth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John 17:17&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sanctify them through thy truth: </span><span class="cs54A12280">thy word is truth</span><span class="csC382D2BB">.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John 7:17&mdash;</span><span class="cs54A12280">If any man will do his will, he shall know</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="cs4F7DE8F5">John 13:15; 14:15-17; 15:26; 16:13</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2 Peter 1:3,4&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the </span><span class="cs31B015EA">knowledge</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="cs31B015EA">of him</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> that hath called us to glory and virtue: 4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious </span><span class="cs31B015EA">promises</span><span class="csC382D2BB">: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, </span><span class="cs31B015EA">having escaped the corruption</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> that is in the world through lust.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That which is true and right needs to be added to our faith, heart and mind so that we can more and more weigh accurately right and wrong. If a person&#39;s conscience has been enlightened by God&#39;s Word, then it will approve what God&#39;s Word approves and condemn what God&#39;s Word condemns. In other words, it will send out the right signals. The scale of our conscience will be very accurate. </span></p><p class="cs19A9F50E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Romans 14:22-23&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How accurate is your conscience? How keen is your sense of right and wrong? When you need to weigh right and wrong, how accurate is your scale? Are you reading your bible daily to find out what is really right and what is really wrong? Are you giving your scale the kind of information it needs to weigh things accurately? May our scale be an accurate scale, and may we be careful to do what we know is good and avoid what we know is evil. </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Acts 24:16&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Hebrews 13:18&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Peter 3:21&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">&hellip; the answer of a good conscience toward God&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1 Tim. 1:5; 2 Tim. 1:3; Romans 9:1; Hebrews 9:9; 1 Peter 2:19</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4F7DE8F5">2Corinthians 4:2&mdash;</span><span class="cs76B4DD1B">But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man&#39;s conscience in the sight of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC6AC147E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4F7DE8F5">This is an exceedingly important principle in regard to preaching, </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4F7DE8F5">The gospel of Jesus Christ may be seen to be true by every man to whom He is preached. It should be the aim of every preacher so to preach the truth, to convict the consciences of his hearers.

Conscience imparts no power. Man&rsquo;s conscience, just as a condition of innocence, is not enough to properly govern the heart and life of man. God in his wisdom and righteousness does not merely pass this judgment, but tests man&rsquo;s conscience in this second dispensation.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
