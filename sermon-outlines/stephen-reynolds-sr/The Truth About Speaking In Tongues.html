			<span class="csDB202E0B">The Truth About Speaking In Tongues - Zac Poonen</span></h4>
		<p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBD405142">&quot;Every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation (change)&quot; (James. 1:17).</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">God never makes a mistake, He never changes and He gives only perfect gifts. Therefore when He gave the gift of </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;speaking in unknown languages&quot; (&quot;tongues&quot;)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> to the church on the day of Pentecost, He knew exactly what He was doing. The gift of </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> was a perfect gift. God has not changed His mind about the gift, for He never changes.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">God knew the controversies that would surround this gift in the 20th century. Yet He felt the church needed this gift to fulfill its ministry.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Even major truths such as the Trinity, the Deity of Christ, the Humanity of Christ and the Person of the Holy Spirit have been opposed and have faced controversy in the history of Christendom. So it should not surprise us if the gift of </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> has been controversial too. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">It is always best to stick exactly to what Scripture says on all doctrinal matters. Let us look then, with an unprejudiced mind, at every single verse in the Bible on the subject of </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;speaking in tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">:</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 1<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">Mark 16:17: [Jesus said,] &quot;These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues... they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.&quot;</span><span class="cs50909F0"> </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Jesus said that some of the signs accompanying the company of </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;those who have believed&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> would be speaking in tongues, casting out demons and healing the sick. He did not say that ALL these signs would accompany EVERY believer. But He said that these signs would be found among the company of </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;those who have believed&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">So every believer need not have all these gifts. Neither need every church have all these gifts. But they will be found in the whole church worldwide. The Holy Spirit sovereignly decides whom to give the gifts to.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 2</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"><br/></span><span class="csBD405142">Acts 2:4,7,11: &quot;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance....... And the Jews from every nation marvelled saying....`We hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The first time that believers were filled with the Holy Spirit, they ALL spoke in tongues. The </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> were languages that others understood immediately. So there was no need for the gift of interpretation.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Notice also in verse 4 that it was the persons themselves who began to speak in tongues and not the Holy Spirit. The Spirit did not move their tongues. The Spirit only gave them utterance. They spoke themselves.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">In no gift, does the Holy Spirit take away freedom of choice from us. In fact, the fruit of the Spirit is </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;self-control&quot; (Gal.5:23)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. Only demon-possessed people lose control of themselves. One who is filled with the Spirit will have more control over himself than anyone else. </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;The spirit of the prophets is subject to the control of the prophets&quot; <br/>(1 Cor.14:32)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 3</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"><br/></span><span class="csBD405142">Acts 10:46: &quot;They were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Here, in the house of Cornelius, all who were in his house were baptized in the Holy Spirit, at the same moment as they were converted to Christ. They spoke in </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> exalting God (praising Him) - not speaking to people, as was the case on the day of Pentecost.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 4<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">Acts 19:6: &quot;When Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The Holy Spirit came upon the believers in Ephesus, when Paul laid hands on them. The &quot;tongues&quot; here seems to have been prophesying.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csD7019BF9">Note the following facts from the above instances in </span><span class="cs404404AD">&quot;Acts&quot;</span><span class="csD7019BF9">:</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"><br/><br/>(a) In Acts 2 they received the Spirit, </span><span class="cs404404AD">after</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> water baptism. In Acts 10, they received the Spirit BEFORE water baptism. <br/>(b) In Acts 2 and 10, they received the Spirit </span><span class="csD7019BF9">without</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> anyone laying hands on them. In Acts 19, they received the Spirit </span><span class="csD7019BF9">after</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> Paul laid hands on them. <br/>(This proves that there is no standard pattern for receiving the Spirit. It could be either before or after water-baptism, and also with or without the laying on of hands). <br/>(c) In Acts 8:14-18, when the disciples in Samaria received the Holy Spirit, there is </span><span class="csD7019BF9">no mention that they spoke in tongues.</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> But Simon the magician did see some evidence (we are not told what it was) which made him want the same ability that Peter had.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 5</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"><br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 12:7,8,10: &quot;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit... to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The gift of tongues is for </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;the common good&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> - the good of the church. This was written 25 years after the day of Pentecost. And the gift of tongues was still being given then by the Spirit &quot;for the common good&quot;.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 6<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor.12:11: &quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills&quot;.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">This is perhaps the clearest Scripture that teaches that the Holy Spirit sovereignly decides to whom to give each gift (including the gift of tongues). We cannot dictate to Him whom He should give any gift to. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 7<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 12:28: &quot;God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then... various kinds of tongues.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">It is God Who appointed the gift of tongues in the church - for some purpose. So we should never oppose this gift, lest we be found opposing God. Remember that He has more wisdom than we have.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 8<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 12:30: &quot;All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">All believers </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">do not</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> speak in tongues, just like all believers do not have the gifts of healing. So obviously, God does </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">not</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> feel that </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> is an essential gift for all believers - either for being holy or for being effective in His service. If it were, He would have given this gift to everyone.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 9<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 13:1: &quot;If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Speaking in tongues without love is useless. All pride in those who speak in tongues, and all </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;looking down&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> on others who don&#39;t speak in tongues is because of a lack of love. Such unloving believers who speak in tongues are as repulsive to God as a noisy gong is to us.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 10<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 13:8: &quot;Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">When perfection comes at Christ&#39;s return, there will be no more need for speaking in tongues. <br/>In heaven, there will be no need for </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> - just like there will be no more need for Bible-knowledge or prophecy. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">So </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> is a temporary gift needed only under the imperfect conditions prevalent on earth. <br/>This explains why Jesus never needed the gift of tongues. It was because His mind was perfectly pure and because He lived in perfect communion with His Father at all times,</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 11<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:2: &quot;One who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The gift of tongues mentioned here is obviously different from the one manifested on the day of Pentecost - for this gift is </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">not</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> to </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;speak to men but to God&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> and no-one can understand what the speaker is saying.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 12<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:4: &quot;One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"><br/>The gift of tongues enables a believer to build himself up spiritually.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 13<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:5: &quot;I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edifying. But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching?&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Paul wished that ALL spoke in tongues. This is yet another verse that clearly indicates that all believers do NOT speak in tongues.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Paul&#39;s wish here is similar to his wish that ALL should be single like he himself was (as he states earlier in the same letter - 1 Cor.7:7). Paul saw some benefits in being single. He also saw some benefits in speaking in tongues. But Paul recognised that just as God was sovereign in giving the </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;gift of being single&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> only to some believers, He was equally sovereign in giving the </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;gift of tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> also only to some believers.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Therefore it is as foolish to expect all believers to speak in tongues as it is to expect all believers to be single!!</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">In the church-meeting, it is far better to prophesy (that is, </span><span class="csBD405142">to speak God&#39;s Word &quot;to encourage, edify and console&quot; others - 1 Cor. 14:3)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. If however a </span><span class="csBD405142">&#39;tongue&#39;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> is interpreted, then it is equal to prophecy.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 14<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:9,13: &quot;Unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear (understandable), how will it be known what is spoken?...Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> <br/></span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;Tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> must be interpreted when used in a church meeting.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 15<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:14: &quot;If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. What is the outcome then? I shall pray with the spirit and I shall pray with the mind. I shall sing with the spirit and I shall sing with the mind.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">When praying in tongues, a person cannot understand what he is praying. But Paul still felt that he should pray and sing </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;with the spirit&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> (in tongues), as much as he did with his mind (in a known language).</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 16<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:18: &quot;I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all.&quot; </span><span class="csCC8F3D24">Paul was thankful to God for this gift. So it must have helped him.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 17<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:19: &quot;However, in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind, that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.&quot;<br/></span><span class="csCC8F3D24">In the church, speaking in a known language is always the best. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 18<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:22: &quot;Tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers&quot;<br/></span><span class="csCC8F3D24">Tongues are for a sign to unbelievers - as on the day of Pentecost.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 19<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:23: &quot;If therefore the whole church should assemble together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">It is madness for all to speak in tongues in a church-meeting - for no one will understand what anyone is saying. (This must obviously be referring to people speaking in tongues individually and not when all are praying together - for in the latter case, we do not listen to the prayers of even those who pray in a known tongue.)</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 20<br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:26, 27: &quot;What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and let one interpret;&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Not more than two or three should speak in tongues in a meeting of the church, but each &quot;tongue&quot; must be interpreted. </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;Interpretation&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> is </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">not</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> the same as </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;translation&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. Translation is </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;word for word&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. Interpretation is </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;expressing the thought in one&#39;s own words&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Truth No. 21</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"><br/></span><span class="csBD405142">1 Cor. 14:39: &quot;Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">This then is the conclusion. Don&#39;t forbid the exercise of the gift of tongues. But if you are desiring a gift, seek for the gift of prophecy more than for the gift of tongues.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">The True And The Counterfeit</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">There is a certain amount of mystery about the gift of tongues, as all those who have received the gift will acknowledge - if they are honest. We do not know everything about it. We know only in part </span><span class="csBD405142">(1 Cor.13:12)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">As one who has spoken in tongues for the past 26 years, let me add a few words concerning what I presently understand about the gift, from my own experience.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">When a person speaks in tongues, his spirit (heart) speaks forth syllables (directly from his heart to his mouth, bypassing his mind) and thus he pours out whatever is in his heart to God - whether that be an overflow of joy or a burden caused by sorrow or discouragement. Thus the pressure on his heart is relieved. That is how he is </span><span class="csBD405142">&#39;edified&#39;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">As we saw earlier in </span><span class="csBD405142">Acts 2:4</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">, when anyone speaks in tongues, it is the person himself who speaks, and not the Holy Spirit. The believer forms the syllables himself, just as he does when speaking in a known language. The only difference is that now, he does NOT use a known language to pray, but concentrating on the Lord, speaks forth syllables with his mouth, straight from his heart, bypassing his mind - knowing that God understands the longings and pressures in his heart, even if he cannot understand himself what he is saying.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Unburdening himself like that in moments of pressure helps a believer, especially if his mind is too tired to pray in a known language. We may not be able to explain how this works, but it does.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Let us now look at the gift of interpretation: As we have already seen, interpretation of a tongue is equivalent to prophesying. So this gift will usually be given by the Spirit to one who has the gift of prophecy as well.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">In a church-meeting, if someone speaks in a tongue, one of those having the gift of prophecy (usually one of the elders), if he is walking in the light of God, will find a thought being impressed on his mind, if the </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongue&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> is genuinely from God. He speaks forth that thought in his own words - for it is </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">not</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> a translation, but an interpretation.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">If another elder (who also has the gift of interpretation) had interpreted the </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongue&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">, the interpretation would have been the same (although couched in that elder&#39;s own words). This would be the case if both elders were in perfect touch with the Lord.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Since no revelation from God can contradict what is written in the Bible, the interpretation will be in accordance with Scripture - just like all true prophecy will also be in line with the Scriptures.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Some who are sceptical of spiritual gifts have asked this question: If a </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongue&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> that was interpreted in a meeting, is copied on to a tape and someone else (with the gift of interpretation) in another p lace is asked to interpret it, will the interpretation be the same as the first one? The answer is: It should be, if both interpreters had a perfect understanding of the mind of the Lord. If the interpretation is different in content, (and not just in words), that would only indicate that one or both interpreters are not in such perfect touch with the Lord as to understand His mind perfectly. That is not abnormal, because no believer in the world is in such perfect touch with the Lord as to know His mind perfectly.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The following example will prove this fact beyond any doubt: Suppose you have to speak in a meeting and you have a particular message on your heart which you feel is the burden of the Lord for that meeting. Then, if you are unable to be at that meeting and someone else speaks in your stead, strictly speaking, he should give the same message as you had on your heart (even if it be in his own words). If that brother doesn&#39;t give the same message as you had on your heart, it would indicate that one of you did not have a perfect understanding of the Lord&#39;s mind for that meeting. So we see that believers could fail such a test even when giving a message in a known language.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">That&#39;s why the Bible tells us to judge even a prophet&#39;s message </span><span class="csBD405142">(1 Cor.14:29)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. Similarly, we should judge, all messages in </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> and their </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;interpretations&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. What should we judge in such cases? Just this: Whether our spirit witnesses that the utterance (prophecy, tongues or interpretation) was Scriptural (and from the Lord) or not.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">We are warned </span><span class="csBD405142">(in 1 John 4:1)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> not to believe every spirit but to </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;test the spirits whether they are of God&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. So every time, we hear </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> or interpretation in public, we must test it in our spirits. Many of the </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;supernatural utterances&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> we hear may not be from God. We must always reject a prophecy (or any part of it), a </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;tongue&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">, or an interpretation, if we feel uneasy about it in our spirits, for any reason.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">It is the unquestioning acceptance of everything supernatural and abnormal that has brought tremendous confusion into Christendom in this century - and tremendous dishonor to the Lord&#39;s Name as well.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">Notice these facts in all instances of speaking in tongues in </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">&quot;Acts&quot;</span><span class="csBA7B3A7C"> :</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">(a) In </span><span class="csBD405142">every</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> case, the speaking in tongues was spontaneous;<br/>(b) In </span><span class="csBD405142">every</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> case, </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">all</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> spoke in tongues - there were no exceptions;<br/>(c) In </span><span class="csBD405142">every</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> case, there was no coaching or urging or instruction given on how to speak in tongues;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Today however, in most places, </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">none</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> of the above characteristics are found. Only where the gift of tongues is spontaneously received without any coaching, can we conclude that it </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">could be</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> genuine.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Of all the </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;speaking in tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> that I have heard, my spirit has borne witness to only a small percentage of it as genuine. Most of the rest I have felt was an attempt to imitate the gift - either to be accepted by others in a group or to impress them. A small percentage could even be of demonic origin. My observations are based on the fruit and the results that I have seen in the lives of many people in many lands. Speaking and singing in tongues often appears to be a form of </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;exhibitionism&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> in many churches - and exhibitionism is characteristic of little children.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">It is also a well-established fact that, at this present time, the maximum exploitation of believers for financial gain is practised by those preachers and pastors who claim to </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;speak in tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. Most of the cults in the 20th century have also developed from tongue-speaking groups.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">My advice to all believers therefore is: </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;Avoid churches that </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">major</span><span class="csBD405142"> on the gifts of tongues and healing - because many of them go to dangerous extremes and usually don&#39;t have spiritually-minded leaders. Seek instead for fellowship with a church that </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">emphasises holiness and disciple-making</span><span class="csBD405142"> primarily, that </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">accepts the genuine gift of tongues</span><span class="csBD405142"> and that </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">does not covet your money or seek to control your life</span><span class="csBD405142">.&quot; </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">Let me also emphasise that we need to use our mind (renewed by the Holy Spirit) if we are to understand God&#39;s will and His Word aright </span><span class="csBD405142">(Rom.12:2)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. Many believers tend to despise their minds. Our mind is to be like a wife. She should not be the head of the home. But she should not be killed either!! Jesus is our husband and head. Our mind should be submissive to Him through our heart.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">In a nutshell then, here is a bit of sane advice on </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">&quot;tongues&quot;</span><span class="csBA7B3A7C">:</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBD405142">&quot;If God gives you the gift of tongues, receive it and exercise it. Speak forth the syllables from your heart to God when you are alone with Him - anywhere - and especially when your heart is under pressure (through discouragement) or overflowing with joy. If you don&#39;t have the gift, don&#39;t worry about it. But be open to the Lord to receive it, at all times. Don&#39;t be against it and don&#39;t get into a frenzy to receive it. God will give it to you, if He wants you to have it, without any frenzy on your part. At the same time, don&#39;t believe that everything you see and hear in Christendom is inspired by the Holy Spirit. Test everything. Use your God-given faculties of discernment. If you don&#39;t have the gift of tongues, don&#39;t consider yourself inferior to those who have it. And if you do have the gift, don&#39;t imagine that it makes you spiritual or superior to those who don&#39;t have it. (Paul and the Corinthian Christians both spoke in tongues. But Paul was a spiritual giant, while the Corinthians were carnal!!).&quot;</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csBA7B3A7C">What Is Absolutely Essential</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">What is absolutely essential for all of us is to be </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">endued with the Holy Spirit&#39;s power</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. It is </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">power</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">, and not speaking in tongues that is the evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8).</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The Holy Spirit is to be received </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">by faith</span><span class="csBD405142"> (Jn.7:37-39)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">, just as we received the forgiveness of our sins - on the basis of Christ&#39;s merit alone, and not on our own merit. We do not receive the </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">Gift</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> of the Spirit by fasting or praying or by any other work. He is a </span><span class="csBD405142">Gift (Acts 2:38)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">We ask and receive - immediately by faith - and go forth believing in God&#39;s promise that He gives the Holy Spirit more readily to those who ask Him, than any earthly father would give food to a hungry son </span><span class="csBD405142">(Lk.11:13)</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">. If we are unsure about having received the Spirit, we can ask God to give us an assurance. He will not deny us such an assurance.</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">But we need to be filled with the Spirit continually (because we are leaky vessels - </span><span class="csBD405142">Eph.5:18</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">), just like we need to be forgiven continually (because we sin - often without knowing it - </span><span class="csBD405142">Matt.6:12</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">).</span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The devotion of our heart to Christ is </span><span class="cs29A1C7DE">far more</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> important than our speaking in tongues. </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;Do you love Me more than everything else?&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24">, was our Lord&#39;s question to Peter, before commissioning him for His service. Arguments about </span><span class="csBD405142">&quot;speaking in tongues&quot;</span><span class="csCC8F3D24"> are therefore a diversion arranged by Satan to sidetrack believers from total devotion to Christ. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="csCC8F3D24">The greatest Christians in the world have been those who loved the Lord Jesus supremely - whether they spoke in tongues or not. Some like Peter, James, John and Paul spoke in tongues.

		<p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">I saw a cartoon once of the disciples waiting in the upper room to be filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:12-14). (We know now that they waited for ten days, but at that time, none of them knew how long they would have to wait.) One of them walks out of the door on the ninth day, saying that he is tired of waiting and is going home. He tells the others that they can wait if they want. Imagine his disappointment, when he heard the next day that all the others in the upper room were baptized in the Holy Spirit and fire and endowed with power from on high. How close he had been to the answer. If only he had waited one more day..... </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">Jesus invited only those who THIRST to come to Him (John 7:37-39). Only those who seek God WITH ALL THEIR HEART find Him (Jeremiah 29:13). God rewards only those who DILIGENTLY seek Him (Heb.11:6 - KJV). Why is this so? Because it is only when we seek God WHOLEHEARTEDLY that we prove that our relationship with Him is the MOST IMPORTANT thing to us in the world. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AS WE SHOULD, WITHOUT BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SERVE THE LORD AS WE SHOULD, WITHOUT BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">Even Jesus Himself needed to be anointed with the Holy Spirit, before He went out into His ministry (Luke 3:21-23). </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">The Lord told His disciples to WAIT until they &quot;were clothed with power from on high&quot; (Luke 24:49). While the world lay dying in need of hearing the gospel, those apostles needed to wait until they were baptized in the Holy Spirit before they could go out and serve the Lord (Acts 1:8). </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">What about us?? </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">How foolish we are to think that we don&#39;t need this too!! </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the people that God was offering TWO gifts to all who would repent, believe and be baptized - FORGIVENESS OF SINS and THE HOLY SPIRIT (Read Acts 2:38). </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">Forgiveness of sins qualifies us for heaven. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">The baptism in the Spirit fits us for life on earth. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">If you are only interested in going to heaven when you die, you don&#39;t need to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. You only need to have your sins forgiven. But if you want to spend your earthly days usefully, showing your gratitude to the Lord for dying for you, by serving Him, then you MUST be filled with the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">There are FIVE main reasons why many believers are NOT baptized in the Holy Spirit: </span></p><p class="csEB314BCF"><span class="cs50909F0"> &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(1) They have been INTELLECTUALLY CONVINCED by some theological argument that they were baptized in the Spirit when they were born again. And even though they are defeated, powerless, empty and fruitless, they continue to believe this theological deception. </span></p><p class="csEB314BCF"><span class="cs50909F0"> &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(2) They feel that they are NOT WORTHY ENOUGH to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The fact of the matter is that the more unworthy you feel and the greater the sinner you consider yourself to be, the more fit you are to receive the Holy Spirit - because God&#39;s gifts are given only to those who feel themselves most unworthy to receive them. If you have repented of your sins, it doesn&#39;t matter how unworthy or unfit or useless you are. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="csEB314BCF"><span class="cs50909F0"> &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(3) They DON&#39;T BELIEVE that God is a good God - who gives His gifts freely to all who ask Him. They feel that they have to pay a price - do some good deeds, like fasting and praying, before they can receive. But God&#39;s gifts are all freely given - whether it be the forgiveness of sins or the baptism in the Spirit. None of God&#39;s gifts can be purchased. Many believers feel that to have faith itself, is a difficult thing. But Jesus likened faith to drinking (See John 7:37,38, &quot;...DRINK.... BELIEVE&quot;). To receive the Holy Spirit is as easy as drinking. Even babies know how to drink - and those who are newly born again can be baptized with the Holy Spirit. That is how it was in the early days - as we read in the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;. </span></p><p class="csEB314BCF"><span class="cs50909F0"> &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(4) They DON&#39;T THIRST. They are not desperate enough. Jesus spoke a parable of a man who kept on knocking at his neighbour&#39;s door, UNTIL HE RECEIVED what he wanted. Then Jesus went on to say that our Heavenly Father would also give the Holy Spirit to those who asked, sought and knocked like that man (Read Luke 11:13 in the context of the previous verses, beginning at v.5). </span></p><p class="csDB3D0BDA"><span class="cs50909F0"> &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(5) They WAIT FOR SOME EXPERIENCE (tongues or thrills etc., ) similar to the one they heard someone else testify to. They are not willing to leave it to God to decide what gift or manifestation is best for them to have. The Holy Spirit is received by simple faith. Ask and ye shall receive (Gal.3:2; Luke 11:9-13). Don&#39;t wait for feelings. But ask God to give you an assurance. Leave it to Him as to how He gives you that assurance. Didn&#39;t He give you an assurance that your sins are forgiven and that you are His child? In the same way, He can also assure you that He has filled you with the Holy Spirit. What you need is not an experience, but POWER (Acts 1:8). </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">SO: THIRST - BELIEVE - AND RECEIVE. Now is the accepted time. Today is the day of salvation. </span></p><p class="csEB380D0F"><span class="cs15323895">&quot;The Spirit of the Lord WILL come upon you and you shall be CHANGED INTO ANOTHER MAN&quot; (1 Sam.10:6).</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><a name="Chapter_7"></a><span class="cs2F348265">CHAPTER 7</span></p><p class="cs2E44D3A6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Baptism In The Holy Spirit</span></p><p class="cs2E44D3A6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In early 1963 I was posted in the Naval Base at Cochin. I had been studying the Word seriously for more than two years and had developed a fairly good knowledge of it &ndash; good enough to be able to preach at meetings in the church. But I found a great lack of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">power</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in my ministry. In the church I attended, we studied the Bible, but it was like studying a history book &ndash; all intellectual! The messages I heard in the church-meetings too were heavy and boring, lacking the freshness and fire of the Holy Spirit.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus told the Sadducees once that they did not know the Scriptures or the power of God </span><span class="csC382D2BB">(Mt.22:29).</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In my case, I knew the Scriptures - to some extent - but I certainly did not know the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">power</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of God. Jesus told His disciples that they would receive power only when they were baptized in the Holy Spirit (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Acts 1:5, 8)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But I discovered that different Christian churches taught differently on this subject. Some taught that every born-again Christian was automatically baptized in the Spirit at new birth whether he realized it or not. Others taught that one had to seek the Lord specifically for the baptism in the Spirit </span><span class="csC382D2BB">after</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> being born again. I was confused. But I saw that Jesus Himself was anointed with the Spirit before He began His ministry </span><span class="csC382D2BB">(Acts 10:38).</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Then how much more I needed this! Jesus also said that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">everyone</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> who believed in Him could have rivers of living water flowing out from him. But I found only a trickle flowing out from me. I realized that I was missing something. And so I decided to seek God for His power, without getting bogged down in a theological argument about the Holy Spirit. I wanted the rivers.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I visited a group of assemblies that emphasized the ministry of the Holy Spirit, to see if they could help me. They were very zealous, but I was disappointed with much that I saw in their midst. There was a lot of noise and emotionalism, but hardly any emphasis on victory over sin or Christlikeness of character (which is what the Holy Spirit came to give us primarily). Many of their pastors also seemed to be great lovers of money! One pastor asked me to keep on repeating the word &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; if I wanted to be baptized in the Spirit! I refused to do that, since I knew that that was not the way the apostles received the baptism in the Spirit. All this was certainly not the fulness of the Spirit that I was looking for. But the counterfeit only proved to me that the genuine article must be valuable - for people make counterfeits only of valuable articles! I told God that I did NOT want what I saw in those groups, but I did want the genuine baptism in the Holy Spirit that the apostles received on the day of Pentecost. And I cried out to God every day for that.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I saw from the Scriptures that Jesus was anointed with the Spirit when He chose to be baptized in water - which symbolized His choosing the way of death to the Self-life. The Lord showed me then that the Spirit-filled life was closely connected with the way of the cross. He told me that if I chose the way of the cross at all times, I would have His power upon me always too.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God filled me with His Spirit at that time. There was no physical manifestation. But I found a freshness, a liberty and a boldness in my ministry thereafter. I began to experience the gift of prophesying - to edify and encourage and challenge others </span><span class="csC382D2BB">(1 Cor.14:3).</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> I loved Jesus more fervently and I longed to serve Him wholeheartedly. The way of the cross became precious to me. And I had a burning passion to bring others to Christ. I did not speak in tongues at that time. That came 11 years later.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What I experienced then was only a beginning. Since then I have had to be filled with the Spirit again and again and again. (We read in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Acts</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of three times when Peter was filled with the Spirit.) A cup, a well and a river can all be full.
