		<p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">20140224 Sunday am--</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lt;&lt;theme--the will of God, &nbsp;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MONDAY</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: </span><span class="cs76EFAA84">You cannot know God and live under sin at the same time</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Example: Adam and eve were cast out of the garden because of their sin! If you are still practicing sin your are under the law.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TUESDAY</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: The Importance of Our Attitude Toward God and Concerning Ourself (Honesty &amp; Humility). Acts 5: Ananias and Sapphira thought they could get away with lying to Peter. But to lie to Peter was to lie to the holy ghost. The holy ghost is God.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">God has given us things in his word and we must have an attitude that is ready always for God to deal with us. God requires a right attitude. Attitude is so important.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">We need an attitude of honesty. Honest with ourselves and honest with God.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">If your are not honest with God&#39;s word, will, and call there will be a break down. There won&#39;t be &#39;one accord&#39; but there will be discord.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">The fear of God was in all the church and they were in one accord. This can be among us. If we are reduced down to just two left in unity God help us to still have a good attitude concerning his will.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs31D24DEE">WEDNESDAY</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">Acts 5:12 &lt;__ a new section begins here.&nbsp;&nbsp; And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">Signs and wonders are needed for the sinner to wake up! many were healed in acts 5 and we have a great responsibility in our day to see the same take place. We don&#39;t seek the signs but in our seeking of God we believe for signs to follow. we should be in one accord to recognize what God is doing. Not to exalt man or the apostles at that time but those people needed to recognize that these apostles were men of God and that God was with them.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">THURSDAY: Vs. 13 they were not quick to try to replace or usurp the place of an apostle but recognized the ministry of the apostles. Do we want to see god raise up some in our hour that could be recognized as an apostle of God? Acts 8: simon wanted the power to baptize in the holy ghost. but he had no idea what he was asking. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">We can get too busy and not recognize what God is doing. We must be more aware of God and what he wants to do through us and through others. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is going to take 1)</span><span class="cs76EFAA84">men that know God</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and 2)men </span><span class="cs76EFAA84">to recognize those men</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> that know God for this city to be turned around. Revival is not just going to happen spontaneously. We may even see signs and wonders but it is going to take knowing and staying and doing of the will of God even when it is hard to bring about revival. It is going to take Not departing from God&#39;s will in hard places.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">FRIDAY: There are often times we desire to </span><span class="csE52E8F9B">feel</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> a certain way in a service but lack enough desire to pray through and to </span><span class="csE52E8F9B">change</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csE52E8F9B">CAUTION</span><span class="csD5D7D290">:Too many will chase after signs but even the devil can produce that which seems miraculous. The devil cannot heal but he can produce lying signs and wonders. I let a man pray for me once and my knee quit hurting and my back started hurting instead. note I rather have knee problems than back problems.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">They recognized that they were God prepared men. We have a great need in our church for God prepared men. Who knows what God would do in your life if you sought him in the same manner as the early apostles.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">We not only need to speak the truth concerning God&#39;s will and staying at it even in difficulty but we as a people need to be </span><span class="csE52E8F9B">united in God&#39;s will.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Whether people are being healed or there is trouble, we must be united in the will of God. We much prefer the miracle over the trial but in either case we must be found doing the will of God. Stop doing my thing and do the will of God.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">The early church became weak the more they became divided.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some live so far removed from any sincere concern for the will of God that even the slightest word of correction and reproof is fought against. they become hostile against reproof. We don&#39;t need hostility toward truth and God given direction, but we need instead </span><span class="csE52E8F9B">honesty</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and </span><span class="csE52E8F9B">humility</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> toward the will of God.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">We cannot be truly humble without honesty.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">22:40 left off.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
