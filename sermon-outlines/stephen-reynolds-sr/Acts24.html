They traveled 60 miles to Caesarea, the Roman center of government, to bring their false accusations against Paul. Their murder plot had failed (Acts 23:12-15), but they persisted in trying to kill him. This attempt at murder was both premeditated and persistent.</span></p><p class="cs16695DE5"><span class="cs5E98E930">TERTULLUS</span><span class="csA16174BA"> &nbsp;(Ter tuhl&rsquo; luhs) Diminutive of the personal name </span><span class="csD007A21A">Tertius </span><span class="csA16174BA">meaning, &ldquo;third&rdquo; (Acts 24:1-8). Tertullus was the prosecutor opposing Paul before Felix, the Roman governor of Judea. Tertullus accused Paul of being a political agitator and of attempting to defile the Temple. According to the longer Western text (Acts 24:7), Tertullus was a Jew. The shorter text allows for his being a Roman. Whatever his ethnic origin, he was skilled in judicial oratory and was familiar with Roman legal conventions. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF80B0AD6"><span class="cs5E98E930">Richest Man Asks Wisest Man</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">The richest man in the world, Croesus, once asked the wisest man in the world, Thales, &quot;What is God?&quot; The philosopher asked for a day in which to deliberate, and then for another, and then for another, and another, and another&mdash;and at length confessed that he was not able to answer, that the longer he deliberated, the more difficult it was for him to frame an answer.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">The fiery Tertullian, the early Church Father, eagerly seized upon this incident and said it was an example of the world&#39;s ignorance of God outside of Christ. &quot;There,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;is the wisest man in the world, and he cannot tell you who God is.

Antonius Felix became procurator of Judea in A.D. 52, succeeding Cumanus. He remained in office until A.D. 60, when the emperor Nero recalled him. He is depicted in Acts as a man who listened with interest to Paul&rsquo;s defense but failed to make any decision with regard to the case or with regard to the personal implications of Paul&rsquo;s message. Rather he hoped Paul would pay him a bribe (Acts 24:26). Contemporary historians Tacitus and Josephus paint Felix as a brutal, incompetent politician who was finally replaced. Compare Acts 24:27. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF80B0AD6"><span class="cs5E98E930">Think And Thank</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">It has often been pointed out that thinking precedes thanking. When we are presented with a gift, it is because we think of its significance and meaning that we are led to express our appreciation.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">What, then, are the thoughts that, entertained by the Christian, lead to thanksgiving?</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Somewhere in our thinking there should be thoughts of God. Perhaps we should start there. God&mdash;what a train of thoughts should be started when we think of Him! Power, wisdom, goodness, grace, love, care: these are just some of the thoughts that cluster around the word God.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">When Paul traces the downward path of mankind, he begins by saying that men, &quot;when they knew God,... glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful&quot; (<a class="csAC6AF41D" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+1%3A21"><span>Romans 1:21</span></a></span><span class="csA16174BA">). Men were not thankful that they had a revelation of God; indeed, they sought to suppress that knowledge and to evade its power.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">In addition to thoughts of God, there should be thoughts of ourselves. We should see our own insignificance in the light of the facts we know about God. We should see and confess our own frailty and failures. We should admit our commitment to earthly things. But we should not stop there. We should think thoughts about our privileges in Christ. God has loved us and made us significant, through sending His Son to die for us. The Father has accepted us in the Beloved Son.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">In the light of these thoughts, we should be led to think of our responsibilities. We are now responsible to live for God&#39;s glory. Redeemed, we should seek to serve Him faithfully. We should recognize our responsibility to be thankful, and from our lips there should come a daily song of praise.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Why is it, then, that we are not more thankful? The truth probably is that we don&#39;t stop to think. The cares and riches and pleasures of this life choke the plant of gratitude, and our lives become unfruitful.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Thanksgiving is thus really the product of careful cultivation. It is the fruit of a deliberate resolve to think about God, ourselves, and our privileges and responsibilities. By giving thanks we make manifest the fact that our lives are not controlled by the imperious cares and concerns of this life. We give testimony to the fact that material things do not dictate the horizons of our soul.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="cs5E98E930">24:4</span><span class="csA16174BA">	But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly. </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5E98E930">&quot;But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing. </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csD007A21A">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF80B0AD6"><span class="cs5E98E930">Only Peace Between Equals Lasts</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Only a peace between equals can last; only a peace, the very principle of which is equality, and a common participation in a common benefit can endure.</span></p><p class="cs5BE2EDC4" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 360pt;"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs5BE2EDC4" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 360pt;"><span class="cs5E98E930">Fact:</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE" style="tab-stops:left 36pt left 360pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">Many hear but do not understand. &nbsp;</span><span class="csA16174BA"><sup>	</sup></span><span class="csA16174BA">Acts 28:26</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE" style="tab-stops:left 36pt left 360pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">Many have turned their ears away from the truth and followed fables. &nbsp;</span><span class="csA16174BA"><sup>	</sup></span><span class="csA16174BA">2 Tim. 4:4</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE" style="tab-stops:left 36pt left 360pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">People cannot hear without a preacher. &nbsp;</span><span class="csA16174BA"><sup>	</sup></span><span class="csA16174BA">Romans 10:13</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Justice Instructing Judges</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">There is a huge painting hanging in the Supreme Court Building in the little country of Switzerland.

The Nazarene sect referred to the Christians&mdash;named here after Jesus&rsquo; hometown of Nazareth.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">R. C. Sproul</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">In a matter of days, representatives of the Jews arrive from Jerusalem (it is possible that &ldquo;after five days&rdquo; refers to the time since Paul&rsquo;s arrest, which may place the Jews&rsquo; arrival in Caesarea only a day or two after Paul&rsquo;s). The delegation is led by the high priest himself, an indication of the importance the Jews attach to this matter. With him are the elders and an &ldquo;orator&rdquo; named Tertullus. Though he seems to be a Jew (he refers to &ldquo;our law&rdquo; in 24:6), he apparently has expertise in Roman law and the Latin language. He, not the high priest, makes the accusations when Paul&rsquo;s trial convenes before governor Felix.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">First, however, he has flattering words for the governor. The five years Felix has led Judea, Tertullus says, have resulted in lasting peace and prosperity, for which all the Jews are thankful. This is ludicrous. The truth is that Felix&rsquo;s repressive policies have led to unrest among those who wish to throw off Roman domination. As Dr. Simon Kistemaker notes, &ldquo;The administration of Felix had not at all been characterized by lasting peace. His administration was so oppressive that Nero recalled him two years after Paul&rsquo;s trial.&rdquo; In fact, he adds, the unrest that has begun under Felix will culminate in a decade or so in the Jewish revolt against Rome, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. Tertullus employs flattery that has no congruity with reality,&rdquo; Kistemaker writes in his commentary on Acts.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">In his courtly oratory, Tertullus then adds a most ironic line: &ldquo;Not to tedious to you any further, I beg you to hear, by your courtesy, a few words from us.&rdquo; He is now ready to present the Jews&rsquo; accusations against Paul, and the words of the accusation are few indeed. He claims Paul has caused riots among Jews all over the world, that he is a leader of the &ldquo;sect of Nazarenes,&rdquo; and that he tried to profane the temple. He then segues into a complaint against the commander of the Jerusalem garrison, who prevented the Jews from punishing Paul and ordered them to present their case to the governor. He even urges the governor to verify his claims with the commander, not knowing that Claudius already has advised Felix to set Paul free.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">That is the extent of the Jews&rsquo; case against Paul. Luke notes that Ananias and the other Jews who are present concur with the accusations, but they offer no proof of Paul&rsquo;s guilt.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">First Protestant Church In Israel</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">The first Protestant church built in Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948 was dedicated in 1962 in Nazareth.

The answer is not crucial, for Paul is merely trying to show that he was not in Jerusalem long enough to sow widespread dissention. Paul asserts that he went to Jerusalem for the most peaceful of purposes, to worship and that he was not discovered &ldquo;disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd,&rdquo; whether in the temple, the synagogues, or the city.

However, as Dr. Simon Kistemaker notes in his Acts commentary, &ldquo;Paul blunts the significance of the Jews&rsquo; accusation by putting his admission within the context of serving Israel&rsquo;s God.&rdquo; He tells Felix that he worships the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; that he believes the Jewish Scriptures; and that he shares the Jews&rsquo; hope that there will be a resurrection from the dead for the purpose of establishing justice. The Jews themselves had called Christianity a sect of Judaism. Paul is, in essence, agreeing with them, and thereby asserting that he is a part of a religion (Judaism) that is protected by Roman law. Paul is saying that he is a good Jew, but that he must follow and proclaim the teaching of the Rabbi Jesus or violate his conscience. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Paul says, &ldquo;I am of the Way, as all Jews (and Gentiles) should be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csF4C17DD1"><span class="cs5E98E930">WAY</span></p><p class="csF8110AD8" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">Of holiness. &nbsp;		</span></p><p class="csF8110AD8" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">Of righteousness, narrow. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8110AD8" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">Of sin, broad. &nbsp;		</span></p><p class="csF8110AD8" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">Jesus the. &nbsp;		</span></p><p class="csF8110AD8" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="cs6E9CEE3C">	</span><span class="csA16174BA">Doctrines taught by Christ. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Lean His Whole Weight On</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">When the great missionary, John C.

As he lived before God and his peers, he listened to this inner voice because he knew that a clear conscience is essential to a happy Christian life. Many people, however, wrongly think of conscience as a fun-killer, a nuisance. That&rsquo;s how Willie in the Moon Mullins comic strip thought of it. In the first picture he is slumped in a chair in front of the TV set, his coffee cup resting on his pot belly, as he says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awful quiet this morning, Mamie,&rdquo; She replies, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to let your conscience be your guide on your day off, Willis.&rdquo; The next picture shows Willie outside washing a window, the lawnmower and rake in the back ground.

Consequently, to our human nature in which God&#39;s Son has been formed (see ), His commands are difficult. But they become divinely easy once we obey.</span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="csA16174BA">Conscience is that ability within me that attaches itself to the highest standard I know, and then continually reminds me of what that standard demands that I do. It is the eye of the soul which looks out either toward God or toward what we regard as the highest standard. This explains why conscience is different in different people. If I am in the habit of continually holding God&#39;s standard in front of me, my conscience will always direct me to God&#39;s perfect law and indicate what I should do. The question is, will I obey? I have to make an effort to keep my conscience so sensitive that I can live without any offense toward anyone. I should be living in such perfect harmony with God&#39;s Son that the spirit of my mind is being renewed through every circumstance of life, and that I may be able to quickly &quot;prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God&quot; (Romans 12:2; also see ).</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">God always instructs us down to the last detail. Is my ear sensitive enough to hear even the softest whisper of the Spirit, so that I know what I should do? &quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God . . .&quot; (Ephesians 4:30). He does not speak with a voice like thunder -- His voice is so gentle that it is easy for us to ignore. And the only thing that keeps our conscience sensitive to Him is the habit of being open to God on the inside. When you begin to debate, stop immediately. Don&#39;t ask, &quot;Why can&#39;t I do this?&quot; You are on the wrong track. There is no debating possible once your conscience speaks. Whatever it is -- drop it, and see that you keep your inner vision clear.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Devotional Learning to follow the voice of conscience is the proper way for a believer to learn to hear the Lord&#39;s life-voice within. This is because our conscience is interrelated with our regenerated spirit (cf. Rom. 9:1 with 8:16). So, if our conscience is not clear, our spirit cannot properly function and be released. This is a crucial principle in our Christian life.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Our conscience may be regarded as the leading function of our spirit. In his own life, Paul maintained the principle of keeping a clear conscience. He testifies in Acts 24:15-16: &quot;I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust. This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men.&quot; Paul exercised himself to keep his conscience clear so that his relationship with the Lord would be up to date, and also so that he would be ready for the judgment seat of Christ at the resurrection of the righteous. Thus, it is important to have a relationship with the Lord that is governed by the voice of conscience. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">The voice of conscience is God&#39;s appointed means for man to learn to be inwardly regulated (Rom. 2:14-15). The conscience approves or disapproves our actions and words (Rom. 13:4-7). The basic lesson of learning to live by the Lord&#39;s voice in us is to learn to listen to the voice of our own conscience (cf. 2 Tim. 1:3 with Rom. 1:9). If we do not practice this, how could we discern the requirement of the Lord&#39;s life in us? Therefore, in our daily life when the Lord is teaching us to hear His voice, the first lessons we learn are to pay attention to the voice of our own conscience. When we follow the requirement of our conscience by obeying it over matters pertaining to right and wrong, we will be inwardly genuine and exercised to learn the requirement of the Lord&#39;s life in other areas related to the intuition of our spirit (2 Cor. 2:12-13). </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Lincoln&#39;s Life And Conscience</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">I desire so to conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth.

David&rsquo;s heart smote him&rdquo; (1 Samuel 24:5). Compare 2 Samuel 24:10; Job 27:6. The New Testament also uses this Hebraic reference to conscience: &ldquo;if our heart condemn us&rdquo; (1 John 3:20-21.) The word for &ldquo;reins&rdquo; or &ldquo;kidneys&rdquo; sometimes refers to conscience. In Psalm 16:7 the psalmist thanked God for giving him counsel and because his reins or kidneys admonished him, meaning his conscience reproved him. (See Psalm 73:21 for &ldquo;heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;reins&rdquo; in the same verse.) </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Epigram On Conscience</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Conscience warns us as a friend before it punishes us as a judge.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Adjust Your Conscience</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men. &mdash;Acts 24:16</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Built into our nature is an internal judicial system, the conscience, that commends us when we do right and condemns us when we do wrong.

In others, a person is still considered good even when he betrays a friend.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">A story from The Philadelphia Inquirer illustrates this problem. A 12-year-old boy was caught stealing a watch. He told police that previously he had shoplifted a gift for his mother, and he felt he had to do the same for his dad. Although troubled about slighting his father, he had no qualms about stealing.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Because of sin, conscience is unreliable and needs a continual adjustment.

On the purely physical side a person is considered clean when obvious indications of dirt or similar defilement have been removed. A clean person is also one who habitually maintains a pattern of personal cleanliness and hygiene, while at the same time taking care to ensure that his or her environment is in a clean condition so as to forestall possible accidents, infection, and disease. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Because the mind is an integral aspect of the human personality, cleanness must also be applied to attitudes and motives that govern particular forms of behavior. Impure thoughts as the expression of the mind can result in shameful activities (Mark 7:15) unless they are checked firmly, and bring disgrace to the individual concerned as well as harm to others. A &ldquo;clean-living&rdquo; person is generally understood to be one who does not give evidence of being a criminal, a victim of such vices as alcoholism and drug addiction, or an individual who habitually flaunts God&rsquo;s moral code. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF80B0AD6"><span class="cs5E98E930">Nesting In Lion&#39;s Mouth</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Upon the plains of Waterloo there stands a great bronze lion, forged from the captured guns of Britain&#39;s foes in 1815.

Its first capital was Pergamum, but the capital was later changed to Ephesus. Asia residents were in Jerusalem at Pentecost (Acts 2:9). Paul the apostle traveled and preached extensively in Asia (Acts 19:10; Acts 19:22) especially in the neighborhood of Ephesus; but God forbad him to preach there prior to his Macedonian call (Acts 16:6). Men of Asia led to Paul&rsquo;s arrest in Jerusalem (Acts 21:27). 1 Peter was addressed to Christians in Asia. Asia was the location of the seven churches to whom the Book of Revelation was addressed. Asia was known for its worship of Artemis (Acts 19:27). </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">R. C. Sproul</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Paul has answered two of the Jews&rsquo; accusations. He now turns to the third: &ldquo;He even tried to profane the temple.&rdquo; Paul begins by telling Felix that he was away from Judea for many years; indeed, except for his brief visit at the conclusion of his second missionary journey, he was absent from the province for nearly a decade. But when he did return from his journeys in Gentile lands, it was not to stir dissension or to intentionally profane the temple. Rather, he came bearing gifts to the Jewish believers from their Gentile brothers. Ironically, it was Jews from those Gentile lands in Asia who found him in the temple, but he was &ldquo;neither with a mob nor with tumult,&rdquo; and he was undergoing and had nearly completed the rituals of purification. In short, Paul asserts that he had done nothing that warrants a trial before the Jews, much less the Roman governor.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Paul brings out the fact that his case started with an accusation by the Asian Jews, not the Jews of Jerusalem. That being the case, the Asians should be present before Felix to make their charges. On the other hand, those who are present, the high priest and the elders, did not witness the scene in the temple. They are qualified to testify only concerning those things Paul said in his appearance before the Sanhedrin, and the only possible statement with which they can take issue had to do with his hope of a resurrection of the dead. &ldquo;Paul states that when he was before the Sanhedrin he uttered only one critical sentence, and it pertained not to the political concerns of the Romans but to the theological concerns of Jews and Christians.&rdquo; Dr. Simon Kistemaker writes. &ldquo;This means that the point of conflict between Ananias and Paul is a theological issue that ought to be discussed in a Jewish ecclesiastical court.&rdquo; With just a few words, Paul has skillfully undermined the credibility of his accusers and shown that his case does not concern the Roman Empire.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">It is worth noting that even as Paul defends himself, he functions as a witness for Christ by mentioning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life that is precious to all believers. He speaks of it before the Sanhedrin and the Governor Felix. &ldquo;This doctrine is fundamental to the Christian faith and fearlessly proclaims it everywhere,&rdquo; Kistemaker writes.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="cs5E98E930">24:20</span><span class="csA16174BA">	Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin-- </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5E98E930">&quot;Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council, </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csD007A21A">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Origin Of Draconian Code</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Draco was appointed magistrate of Athens in 621 B.C., and the code of Draco made death the penalty for crimes both great and small. Even idleness or laziness was a capital crime, and those who stole fruit from the market were punished in the same way as those who murdered or committed sacrilege.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">According to legend, Draco wrote his laws in blood, not ink, and when asked why he made death the penalty for nearly all crimes he said, &quot;The lesser ones deserve it, and for the greater no heavier penalty could be found.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">But even though the Draconian code was an improvement, the harsh penalties did little to comfort the restless citizens of Athens. Reforms were demanded and the next generation brought one of the wisest statesmen and lawgivers of all times to the magistrate&#39;s post. Solon was Draco&#39;s replacement and Draco&#39;s code was destroyed. Only his laws on manslaughter remained for history to examine.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS</span><span class="csA16174BA"> &nbsp;Israel, like most peoples in the Ancient Near East, considered their law to be the direct revelation from God. Since the law came from God, any transgression of the law was a transgression of God&rsquo;s revealed will. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">The responsibility for the fulfillment and enforcement of the law lay with the entire community. The transgression of the law by one person or group within Israel involved the whole community in the guilt of the act. This is especially true in cases of homicide, idolatry, and sexual offenses (see, for example, Deut. 19:10; Deut. 21:1-9; 2 King 24:1-7). When Israel failed to purge the offender and rebellion against God&rsquo;s Law from their midst, God punished Israel (Leviticus 18:26-28; Leviticus 26:3-45; Deut. 28). </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Israelite Law with respect to crime and punishment was distinct from the laws of other cultures in several ways. First, Israel, in contrast to many of its neighbors, did not consider crimes against property to be capital crimes. Israel observed a system of corporal punishment and/or fines for lesser crimes. Second, Israel restricted the law of retaliation (eye for an eye; </span><span class="csD007A21A">lex talionis</span><span class="csA16174BA">) to the person of the offender. Other cultures permitted the family to be punished to the crimes of the offender. Third, Israel did not observe class differences in the enforcement of the Law to the extent that their neighbors did. Nobility and commoner, priest and lay people were treated equally in theory. However, slaves and sojourners (foreigners) did not have an equal standing with free Israelites&mdash;though their treatment in Israel was often better than in surrounding nations; and women did not have equal standing with the men in Israelite culture&mdash;especially in regard to marriage and divorce laws and laws pertaining to sexual offenses. Finally, Israelites (in contrast to the people of surrounding nations) could not substitute sacrifices for intentional breaches of the law; sin and guilt offerings were allowed only in the cases of unwitting sins (Leviticus 4-5). </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Right Of Accused To Face Accuser</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&quot;Let Justice be done, though the heavens fall.&quot; This was a maxim made famous by Lord Mansfield, in his decision in the Wilkes case, in which Wilkes had been sentenced to the outlawry without having been present in court.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Mansfield asserted the constitutional right of an Englishman to a public trial in the presence of the accused.

Felix, like Herod Antipas (Mark 6:17-18), had taken another man&rsquo;s wife. Paul&rsquo;s words were interesting until they focused on &ldquo;righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come.&rdquo; Many people will be glad to discuss the gospel with you as long as it doesn&rsquo;t touch their lives too personally. When it does, some will resist or run. But this is what the gospel is all about&mdash;God&rsquo;s power to change lives. The gospel is not effective until it moves from principles and doctrine into a life-changing dynamic. When someone resists or runs from your witness, you have undoubtedly succeeded in making the gospel personal.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">R. C. Sproul</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">When Paul concludes his defense, Felix abruptly adjourns the hearing. Every indication is that the governor recognizes the frivolous nature of the charges against Paul and accepts his innocence. For instance, Luke notes that Felix has &ldquo;more accurate knowledge of the Way&rdquo; than others, knowledge that permits him to see that Paul is no threat to the Roman state. Furthermore, Felix commits Paul to the care of a centurion, but he tells the official to let Paul have some liberties and to permit his friends to visit him and bring him things he needs. With these actions and his promise to decide Paul&rsquo;s case when the Jerusalem commander comes, Felix gives Paul reason to hope.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">But all is not as it seems here. First, the commander, Claudius Lysias, already has given Felix his opinion about Paul&rsquo;s guilt: there really is no need for Felix to await Claudius&rsquo; arrival. And the possibility that Felix is using Claudius&rsquo; absence on the day of the trial as a delaying tactic seems to be confirmed when Paul languishes in jail for two years. Luke never tells us whether Claudius comes to Caesarea, but it is unimaginable that the commander of the Jerusalem garrison does not visit the provincial capital on official business regularly. And Felix has more sinister motives for holding Paul. He hopes Paul will offer him a bribe for his freedom. And the governor is weighing political considerations. Luke notes in verse 27 that when Felix is recalled to Rome, he leaves Paul imprisoned as a favor to the Jews.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">Nevertheless, Felix does seem interested in Paul and his message. Not long after the trial, he comes to hear Paul speak &ldquo;concerning the faith in Christ,&rdquo; or the Gospel. With the governor is Drusilla, his third wife, a Jewess who had left her previous husband to marry Felix, a Gentile. To this licentious couple Paul speaks on &ldquo;righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come.&rdquo; The reaction is remarkable: Felix, Luke tells us, becomes afraid and sends Paul away, promising to hear him again at his convenience. The governor does indeed converse with Paul at other times during Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment, but Felix&rsquo;s evident conviction of sinfulness apparently never leads to conversion. &ldquo;The governor is afraid of the coming judgment, but he refuses both to repent of his evil ways and to turn in faith to Jesus,&rdquo; Dr. Simon Kistemaker writes in his commentary on Acts.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Satan&#39;s Strategy</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">In a remarkable book published some years ago, Canon Roger Lloyd an arch-demon instructs subordinates on an ancient and effective piece of satanic strategy. &quot;Insert yourself into the simple situations which call for plain and obvious duties,&quot; urges this devil, &quot;and complicate them, and complicate them again, until at last no one involved in them can make sense of the confusion.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">C.

Freedom in Christ does not give believers liberty to cast off all moral restraint as some members in Galatia and other churches apparently believed. Nor does it call for a withdrawal from life and its temptations. It calls for a self-disciplined life following Christ&rsquo;s example of being in the world but not of the world. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5E98E930">Anger Symptoms</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csA16174BA">The obvious symptoms of sudden anger are often red face, swollen neck veins, clenched fists, and a stumbling for words.
