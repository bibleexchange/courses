<br/>Health Evidence Touts Benefits of Dark Beer vs. Light Beer </span><span class="cs7294CA65"><br/><br/></span><span class="cs5719E085">1.</span><span class="cs7294CA65">&nbsp; From 2002-2003, medical researcher John D. Folts, PhD and his research team fed dark and light beer to dogs that had narrowed cardiac arteries, similar to the narrowed arteries observed in people with heart disease. When compared to the results of dogs who consumed light beer, there was substantial evidence to prove that the darker brew prevented blood clots in dogs with compromised or narrowed arteries.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs5719E085">2.</span><span class="cs7294CA65">&nbsp; The most important dark beer -- like Guinness, Huber Boch, Stroh&#39;s Boch, Bass and many others - facts gleaned from this research are based on the fairly obvious presupposition that dark beer is much richer in flavanoids than light beer, and flavanoids possess powerful antioxidant properties.&nbsp; <br/><br/></span><span class="cs5719E085">3.</span><span class="cs7294CA65">&nbsp; One of the post powerful antioxidants found in dark beer is Vitamin B6. Folts&#39; research confirmed that the Vitamin B6 levels in dark beer prevented the build up of an amino acid called homocystenine, which has been linked to heart and vascular diseases in humans. As a result, Folt&#39;s research confirmed that dark beer did indeed play a role in reducing the overall levels of heart disease in the dog he studied.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs5719E085">4.</span><span class="cs7294CA65">&nbsp; Since Folts&#39; 2003 research, case studies carried out by the American Heart Association have demonstrated that 30-35% of men who drink beer in moderation are less likely to experience heart attacks or coronary artery disease.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs5719E085">5.</span><span class="cs7294CA65">&nbsp;&nbsp; Research has also shown that the heavy concentrations of hops, naturally occurring in dark beer contain a powerful antioxidant called xanthohumol. Xanthohumol has been proven to assist the human body in halting the excessive action of testosterone and estrogen. The compound helps protect against certain cancers.</span></p></body>
