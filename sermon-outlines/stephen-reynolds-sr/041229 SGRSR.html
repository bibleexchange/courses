I want you to pray for him. &nbsp;If the devil is deceiving.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Second Thessalonians 2: 10 &quot;love of the truth&quot;. &nbsp;Their demons to strike people&#39;s lives where they can live in sin and live for the world and live for the devil and still profess to be saved. &nbsp;It is lives you must come out of the world you must leave sin behind. &nbsp;We need to be separated from the world. &nbsp;Separated from unrighteousness and send. &nbsp;We must be separated from them. &nbsp;This deception is destroying people. &nbsp;We must take a stand against sin and deception. &nbsp;You cannot accept the person that is deceiving with open arms and have that not affect you.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You never know what the devil is going to come up with next. &nbsp;The world around us is in deception. &nbsp;It is involved with unrighteousness. &nbsp;It is not just a choice of man they are driven, there are in darkness. &nbsp;Their will is being controlled by Demon power. &nbsp;They are driven.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I would like to speak to you as a family. &nbsp;We must cry out in our prayer time for the needs of each other&#39;s soul. &nbsp;The condition of a person&#39;s soul is what really counts. &nbsp;If we do not reach them their soul spend eternity in hell. &nbsp;We must be warned of where we are at. &nbsp;We must follow the Lord wants. &nbsp;His plan and desire is that way all the effect and be strong and that we all care for the souls of others. &nbsp;If we continue to do our own thing and go our own way there is no help.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yet no intention to study his Bible but he said he was driven every night to open his Bible. &nbsp;He said things were leaping out of his Bible page after page after page issues driven and he didn&#39;t know what was going on. &nbsp;He couldn&#39;t actually turned to the Scripture and show me where he was talking about. &nbsp;It was nothing more than just twisted thoughts. &nbsp;It is sad. &nbsp;That demons would take the Bible and place people&#39;s minds. &nbsp;Pray. &nbsp;Pray that you don&#39;t enter into temptation. &nbsp;You should never allow fear in any measure your heart. &nbsp;You must recognize the devil as an enemy. &nbsp;He cannot just sit back and relax and say I&#39;m not afraid of the devil. &nbsp;Wake up! &nbsp;To the point the devil is your enemy. &nbsp;I plugged the blood over my mind to protect my mind from the filth and deception. &nbsp;The twisted thoughts. &nbsp;I prayed to the Lord to protect my mind from that. &nbsp;Many are distorting this Bible in this hour. &nbsp;Some hear from God. &nbsp;Let us be a part of that some.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When a person leaves off loving true they are in danger. &nbsp;Love truth. &nbsp;If it is in the word, it is truth! &nbsp;Love truth. &nbsp;Amen? &nbsp;Not in just one air of your life but every era of your life.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="csC67CFA75"><span class="cs220AA535">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs9A793522">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mark 6: 45 -- 46</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Lord sent the multitude away and he entered into a secluded place to pray. &nbsp;He sent the multitude away! &nbsp;There is a great need for us in this hour to not be is deceased. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Masters prying. &nbsp;That gives us a sense of hope. &nbsp;That gives us hope will we know the master is praying. &nbsp;There is no storm the rage too hard. &nbsp;There is no storm they&#39;ll be too long or too difficult when you understand the master is parying. &nbsp;Verse 46 he is going into a mountain to pray. &nbsp;He&#39;s going into a place to be all alone with a father. &nbsp;This is something he did regularly. &nbsp;He&#39;s giving us some keys to success. &nbsp;A part of the process that develops us and to make a strong. &nbsp;That will lead us in directions that always involves prayer. &nbsp;Jesus went there to pray. &nbsp;What are you doing? &nbsp;Where are you going. &nbsp;What is the purpose of what you&#39;re doing. &nbsp;What is the purpose of where you&#39;re going? &nbsp;His purpose was to pray. &nbsp;He wasn&#39;t long in the mountain for something outs and nobody was there he prayed. &nbsp;He went to the mountain for the purpose of praying. &nbsp;And to be away from the crowd. &nbsp;He was not afraid of them. &nbsp;There was a purpose. &nbsp;Many times the people that follow that the Jesus fault him for all the wrong reasons. &nbsp;In one place and John chapter 6 after the feeding of the 5000 they said let&#39;s make him king. &nbsp;Let us set them up as king. &nbsp;They were always looking for the Messiah to come in if he was the Messiah that and he&#39;s the one that&#39;s work in all these miracles make in these five rules of bread into fissures and feet in these 5000 landless women and children he must be the Messiah he must be the son of God he must be he says he is. &nbsp;He came to be a suffering saver</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Luke 12: it isn&#39;t just praying words. &nbsp;Edison just mouthing a few words and expecting God to hear an answer those words. &nbsp;We must hear from God will be pray. &nbsp;When Jesus went to the mountain to pry he&#39;s communicating with a father. &nbsp;He&#39;s hearing from the father. &nbsp;He&#39;s hearing! &nbsp;He&#39;s receiving. &nbsp;Lord help us to learn that. &nbsp;We don&#39;t just go embed our need for a few minutes and then leave the way we came. &nbsp;We go for the purpose of hearing from God. &nbsp;If there is no hearing from God there is no deliverance, there&#39;s no hearing from God. &nbsp;It is a waste of your time. &nbsp;Jesus went to the mountain to pray. &nbsp;The multitudes can&#39;t you hear this message most of cant understand it. &nbsp;Do you pray if for the purpose of hearing from God? &nbsp;Do we pray to your from God? &nbsp;He is the savior, to liver, Potter. &nbsp;He is the one that will make a change. &nbsp;There must be changes showing up in our life over and over again. &nbsp;Luke chapter 12 and verse 34, where your treasure is there we harpy also. &nbsp;Let your voice be queried about it you like burning. &nbsp;-- -- -- -- wedding.&quot; &nbsp;There are some he&#39;s going to be wedded to. &nbsp;Is it just a matter of just catching up to where he is that? &nbsp;You&#39;ll never catch up to God and you&#39;ll never catch up to him. &nbsp;You can run your fastest and you&#39;ll never catch up to him. &nbsp;There is no catching up to God. &nbsp;Ephesians 4:13 there is a measuring out onto the full stature of Christ but that is done by the Spirit of God taken this word lien upon my precept upon precept and putting into practice in your life daily. &nbsp;Every altar call should be a time when God ministers faith administers life into your soul so that you go away different. &nbsp;You don&#39;t know all together knoll what the Lord has done to you but you know that there has been a change. &nbsp;We must walk expecting a change a leaving got change her heart. &nbsp;Luke 12: 35 your loins be girded about we are too loose with our attitude, thinking, and actions. &nbsp;We are too loose! &nbsp;We must tie and a. &nbsp;Allow the fear of God back into our mind. &nbsp;Where we would be afraid to say anything contrary to the Word of God. &nbsp;Paul said I spoke the whole counsel of God as the Word of God. &nbsp;As an ambassador in God&#39;s stead. &nbsp;God spoke to Samuel and Sam did and said then that rejecting you they are rejecting me. &nbsp;Jesus came unto his own and they receive them not.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They say they&#39;re coming for a good time they try to build chill out. &nbsp;But they&#39;re there for your life. &nbsp;The heart of the wicked one is to destroy your life. &nbsp;Jesus gave warning and he said make sure your girded with juice and you get it on tight. &nbsp;That is the only guarantee that you can be safe in this hour. &nbsp;There is no other guarantee. &nbsp;Just to know truth is not not to hear truth is not enough to believe truth is not enough. &nbsp;You must love truth. &nbsp;You must have truth on tight. &nbsp;It must not be any looseness in your heart, attitude, or spirit. &nbsp;And must be tight! &nbsp;Let your loins be girded but truth in your lights burning. &nbsp;You need to Holy Ghost in your life. &nbsp;Do not pray Lord can I be good enough to feel your spirit. &nbsp;Jesus sent the multitude away when he went to pray. &nbsp;He do now desire any fanfare. &nbsp;Sometimes we pray Lord take these anxieties away these feelings away take these emotions away. &nbsp;And the expect God just to be our feelings and circumstances by making us feel better. &nbsp;God gives us circumstances in our life to turn us back to the place where we look to the word and trust to the Lord trust the word in every situation. &nbsp;And the fire of the Holy Ghost working in our heart. &nbsp;Until we have a desire to hear them receive from God we will not have the power of God and we&#39;ll not only sends the presence of God. &nbsp;There is a cold dark night coming. &nbsp;That has to do with a condition where you do not know God can you do not feel God. &nbsp;A cold dark night! &nbsp;We do not feel him and you do not know him. &nbsp;For some it is so dark and so, cold soul that they can say to your face I know God. &nbsp;They love not truth. &nbsp;Their desire was not of God and not by the Spirit of God but it was fleshly selfish self motivated. &nbsp;We need to love God and that the grace of God minister to our hearts so that we will love only hated where abused when we are falsely accused, in every situation</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must pray to hear from God. &nbsp;When they were in the ship in the storm was raging about and they cried out he came to them walking on the water. &nbsp;Peter knew him. &nbsp;Lord give us a desire revelation to know you. &nbsp;Mark 6: 50. &nbsp;They all saw him but they didn&#39;t know him. &nbsp;When they saw him they were troubled. &nbsp;They did not know him. &nbsp;If you&#39;re troubled tonight. &nbsp;Admit it! &nbsp;If you&#39;re troubled you don&#39;t know him. &nbsp;You must see who he is. &nbsp;You might shun that selfishness that keeps a blind trouble keeps us complaining and downcast. &nbsp;Trouble is of the devil it is dark. &nbsp;And immediately he talked to them and say content and it is I be not afraid. &nbsp;I thank God for his immediate response. &nbsp;It is to help us and not stick a finger in our face and say you don&#39;t know me you don&#39;t even want to know me. &nbsp;Immediately he said be of good cheer. &nbsp;In the store in the night where their troubled. &nbsp;Immediately before any more happens before anything in his presidency brings cheer and he says be of good cheer it is I be not afraid. &nbsp;Verse 54, straightway they knew him. &nbsp;I want to know you Jesus. &nbsp;When I bow my knees in prayer tonight I want to know him a little bit better. &nbsp;Is that your desire?</span></p></body>
