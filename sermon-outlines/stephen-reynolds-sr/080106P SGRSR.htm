<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Isaiah 57:18-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isa 57:18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will
lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 19 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that
is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot
rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 21 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will heal you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>FIRST OF ALL, We see that the Lord sees our ways. He knows
what we are thinking. He knows the condition of our heart and our actions. He
has promised deliverance and salvation in abundance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is no hope of accomplishment of the task outside of
trusting God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Come to a broken state and say I surrender all, I NEED YOU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Word of God brings out over and over again, verse 15,
God dwells in the heart of the humble. Their only hope is in God. We cannot
make it without Him. I put my trust in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v. 13 When though cries let thy company…but he that putteth
his trust in me shall inherit the land…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We cannot help ourself. There is no hope in doing thing sour
way. We can’t do things our way. Anymore. We must obey him. In verse fourteen
there is something happening. There are words coming from within. No longer
just the mind workinb, but something working in the heart wherr ethere can be
development, glorious change where God shows himself. Cast ye up, prepare ye
the way, take up te stumbling block. Not everyon will believe in godo and
remove the stumbling Block. There is a llife of holiness a high way apart from
sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cast things away and cast things aside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That wich the lord is doing and promising build arise let
there be something that is built up to exalt the Lord the way of holiness the
way of life the way of truth but there has to be some things that we recognize
that we must speak it and act upon it. It must be done. And it has to be
continuous cast you up cast ye up He will continue to put that into yoru heart
until he is pleas and satisfy us and our flesh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have got to have the victory in your life. I create the
fruit of the lips. That word create is found in genesis one onece and my heart
and my lifes I trust him there is no question of his power you can believe Him
He who created all things there is nothing left undone it al works in perfect
order. If it all was not perfect then this world would be in trouble. His
promise is I will created the fruit of they lips can God make a differenc ecin
my testimony my witeness my experience I created the fruite of thy lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is God that is doing the creating. If it isnt’ God then
you are in a lot of trouble. You can be doing great and all successful and all
of sudden someone says something negative and brings division if your hope is
in God and He is doing the created that which isn’t will be and that God will
create in us a clean heart He will create in us all things new. I will created.
In verse 21 it says that he craeated man He created man in the likensess of God
in romans 3:12 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God God in
his great understanding and power made man ,b ut man didn’ understand the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have sin a lot of times people so lonely so lonely you are
not going to escape loneliness by getting married all the trouble that someone
else will be added to you more than double for the trouble and gets worse and
worse and when it is a spritual problem adding to that casting up muck and mire
to where ther eis no peace we need trust God n ot just for our personal life we
need to trust God for our nation country world. We need to thing about this
world that God has created</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To beht point he is reading his bible about the created that
he didn’t know anything about what an opportunity to witness the Gospel finding
someone reading Isaiah 53. that is the soulwinner’s dream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One time I had to bring in a block leather blocked looking
like a bible. And I brought it to work to a man. Ken this is the only bible you
need to read until you get saved because all you want to do is argue. I saw him
20 years later. I still believe what I always believed. He knew there was
something real that is why he tried to fight us hard. Why he does I do not
know. The wicked are like the troubled waves of the sea. They didn’t have the
ability to be barren. They went out and they adopted trouble. She was a women
so nice and even so nice she couldn’t even put up with him. NO rest no peacec
just turning up division and strife. AS you grow and develop. The righteous
perish and no man layeth it to heart. And the merciful man is taking away. It
seems like they don’t even care to see goood men God. As a matter fact they are
glad. Showing that the rightoues face eternity with peace in verse two he shall
enter into peace. In the last part of verse two walking in his uprightness
walking obedient to the Lord the righteous that walk with God in truth. In
verse 3 but draw near hiher ye sonos of sorceress there is a different seed.
There lip service may be but there heart is wicked. The seed of the audulterer.
Do ye spor tyourselves. Are not the childer of transgression a seed of
falsehood. Prepare yourself to be a clear witness a righteous man. It is going
to take the word of God to walk uprightly and mercifully. Men are going to open
their mouth wide with demonic activity and powe rin their lips devising evil
converstation against you to destroy you. There is an adversary against those
that walk uprightly. There is an adversary against you. In recognizing that we don’t
have to be so quick to defend ourselves and fall into a snare to say things out
of place. They made scorn of Christ, derieded him, but he opened not his mouth.
WHY? Because we were guilty and he was taking our place. He is what he said He
is. He is the saviour. You do’t heal by fighting and defending yourself. He
puts it into our heart to change us. That word creates and transforms it is a
glorifying process so because of his great power we can declare his goodness.
Peace peacec peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace
peace peace say what his words says. You cannot be inspired of God with peace
and continue the way of the world. It is better for a man to know the ways of
righteousness than to know it and turn from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though they come with all there ideas. I see it with my own
eyes. They are looking ot find fault and trouble. They are going to reap the
harvest of shame. If you sow to the flesh you will of the flesh reap
corruption. If you tallk of trouble then you wil end up in roulbe. I want to
have the waters of life and bring joy and peace and life everlasting that is
what Jesus brings that is what </p>

kind of lifestyle bring people get so lonely that they will do anything to get
