Piercing Their Conscience</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Text:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>To
be an Overcomer you must be one that has come through some hard places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Your
carnal mind will never encourage you to pray or to keep the fire burning in
your soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Follow
after what the Holy Ghost is doing. Is my life a visual expression of Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Our
lives need to show a clear unwavering stance, by manifestation of the truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>There
are many that use the Word of God deceitfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>We have the promises and an open door, but there is a
process and stages of growth that we must pass through. The power of the Holy
Ghost can take me there. (OVERCOMING) Don’t misapply the truth. Stay in line
with the truth. <i>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
mercy, we faint not;</i> Yes He requires some things of me, but unless He works
something in me then I will never change. All we’ll have is a good though, good
person, good opinion that in time when the pressure gets high will crumble and
faint. We should not be excusing our sin as we do in this hour. Sin is wicked
and evil in the sight of God. Don’t’ excuse your sin. We give too much great to
our carnal mind. Give God the praise that is due His name, If you are hurting
then give God the praise and not your hurt. “My soul will wait upon the Lord.”
Without His power and grace working in my heart I can do nothing. With Him
working He will bestow in abundance His power and the promises will be made
complete in my heart. I need His mercy. I need God to be merciful to me. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The things that I have allowed myself to be involved
with is WORLDLINESS. Not questionable, you know it wrong, and in the face of
truth you must make a decision. In the face of people’s rejections we can show
them Jesus and be REAL. V. 1 God has been good to us. We have received His
mercy. He sends His messenger that we might know that His mercy will work for
us again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>To us that want to be that piercing messenger to the
conscience of others, FAINT NOT. You will be tested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>WE are out to see conviction in their hearts and show
them Jesus. Not to condemn them only of their sin, but show t hem Jesus and let
His words life in us to convict Him. It is worth it when God sets three men
down and tells us to testify. Jobs comforters gave some good advice in some
areas, but God did not send them to Job. Some things that God has sent to us is
not for everyone else. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Faint not has to do with NO DOUBTING. It is those
little thing sthat creep into the corners of our  minds that cause us to doubt.
How can a man read in the bible thirty sixty hundred and not see there is a
difference. That was your deal that was what you believed me for. He si greater
than for just one penny all day long. There is an experience to know God far
great than we have known God to this point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Let us be near Him as His messenger and laborer. Let
us not allow this to become a business or a job. He will reveal Himself and He
will do what is right with us if we can understand His promises. IF there isa
question then get hos questions answered. God will sometimes puts us through
some extreme tests to see how weak we really are. If we rely on His mercy we
don’t have to faint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>v.  2 NO DISHONESTY—beings shamed; having shame; being
disgraced ROMANS 1:16 Going to Hell with doubt is one thing, but it is another
thing to go there with blood on your hands. You don’t have to go that way.
Tjhere is more for you. Some of us has taken this Bride message out of its base
without setting down and asking God to help us attain to a life that is
sinless. We are not event rying to  get rid of sin and worldy activities. The
Bride should not be something you have knowledge of alone, but you must receive
it as a reality in your spirit where God is the closest one to you. The
messenger shaming the message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Not walking in craftiness. Luke 20:23. We don’t love
as we should, because we do not understand truth as we should.  Lu 20:<i>23 But
he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</i> God is
dealing. We are not after one individual tonight, but the Holy Ghost can walk
through this congregation tongith and touch things in your spirit. YOU KNOW
BETTER.  And Jesus says, WHY TEMPT YE ME? Trying to act one way while they do
another. Job 5:13; I Cor. 3:19 <i>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Hold up the standards and Godly living higher than
ever. Through the Sprit you are sanctified and the things that you once do you
are justified. We need to harden our hearts to sin and not toward people. God
is not an austere that is stern and hateful. There is no darkness in Him His
nature is light. There is no compromise in Him. Hate sin and don’t get tempted
by it. Ephesians 4:14-<i>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and
fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and
cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</i> Don’t walk in
darkness. NO craftiness, no subtility. People are compromising with the things
of this world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>2 Cor. 4:2 No handling the word of God deceitfully. It
is one thing to never hear the truth and is another thing to hear it and it
doesn’t touch you.</span></p>
