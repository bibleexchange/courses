This is an effort to make us believe that if we use this product we too will be just like this famous person, play sports better, or be more beautiful. Eating a cereal may give us more energy, but it will not make us play sports any better, make us more beautiful, or even make us rub shoulders with somebody famous.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">According to the Bible, the sin of legalism is just as damning as license!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Those that key in on the word &quot;eternal&quot; fail to see that the quality of &quot;everlasting&quot; is connected to &quot;life&quot; and not to our &quot;having&quot; it or &quot;possessing&quot; it! The &quot;life&quot; is &quot;eternal,&quot; and not the believer!</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Having Eternal Life does not mean that we have an irrevocable possession of it! Whether we accept Christ and the gift of eternal life has no bearing on the quality of this &quot;eternal life.&quot; It stays eternal whether we possess it or not! The quality of the &quot;life&quot; is &quot;eternal&quot; whether whether anyone ever believed on Christ or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The logic of an Eternal Gift is interesting, but does not establish a fact of a Eternal possession or an Eternal Security!</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The conclusion is that since there are no unambiguous statements in the Scripture that say explicitly that through the death of Jesus that our sins were &quot;paid for&quot;, we are justified in avoiding such deceitful terminology in favor of the idea that the atonement is a &quot;provision&quot; which makes the Gospel the good news, truly good news for </span><span class="cs987D718D">all</span><span class="csA521DC07">. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">A provision is not a payment and thereby is not for the limited few, but is for the whole world. As a provision it can and does demand conditions in order to receive its benefits. A provision is conditional, a payment is not. A provision is made for ALL, and a payment is made for FEW. If we admit that some will not be saved, and we believe that Jesus died for &quot;every man&quot; and the &quot;whole world,&quot; we should be able to see that it must be a provisional atonement and not a payment in times past, for a payment is denied by the fact that some are lost. A provision commands us to repent and believe the gospel as a condition (not a merit) of receiving the application of its benefits. This is not a &quot;works&quot; salvation, it is genuine saving faith!</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Why would God tell us to flee from the wrath to come if we cannot choose whether we can escape or not?</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">We are saved by grace through faith. We are required to have faith in order to have salvation. If we cease to have faith, the only conclusion is that the condition of salvation is no longer present, salvation is abandoned by us. This should cause us to believe the Scriptural demand that is all throughout the New Testament that exhorts us, and warns us, that we must remain, abide, and continue in the faith to be saved. Logic tells us that if we are warned to remain, abide, and continue, there is the possibility of not remaining, not abiding, and not continuing.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">the Scriptures are our source and rule of faith</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1866F3C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&ldquo;the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&ldquo;when a man hath found, he hideth&rdquo;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
