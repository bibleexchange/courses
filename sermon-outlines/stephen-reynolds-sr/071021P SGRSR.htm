<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Luke 13:17,23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>And when he had said these things, all his adversaries
were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were
done by him.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Then said one unto him, Lord, <u>are there few that be
saved</u>?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The world lives depressed and abiding in the negative. But
Christ always causes us to triumph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am thankful for the church services. But I can say from
the grace of God and knowing from the past and the Word established in our
heart no matter how dark the day or difficult the task one day we are going to
be with Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The worst and hardest times are probably ahead of us. If we
trust him when it is done we will be able to look back on the day and rejoice
in the glorious things He has done. I see a shallowness in their voice in verse
17. There was not the heart reflection of the greatness of God that could have
been done in their lives. There is no indication tha the people really received
what He was doing. People here grasping and holding onto things that they love
more than God. Don’t just let the rejoicing be a feeling of the moment. Be
ready. Do everything you can to say that Jesus Christ is Lord, Saviour, Healer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must not be caught up with the negative. V. 3 REPENT v. 5
REPENT Without true repentance God is not going to hear your cry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.11 <i>And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of
infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up
herself</i>. –The call was not reaching her heart, whether She had heard Jesus
before or someone telling her, the call was not reaching her heart for 18
years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jesus saw her, HE CALLED HER TO HIM. <i>And when Jesus
saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from
thine infirmity.</i>, vs.12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is looking for us to answer His call. God can free us
from the desire of sinful things. There are things that we hold onto that wee
don’t always call sin, but the fact that we desire that rather than the things
of God make it a sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>vs.13 <i>And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she
was made straight, and glorified God</i>.—immediately…that is what God can do!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><b>&lt;&lt;&lt;PRAYER&gt;&gt;&gt;</b></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prepare us for the things that you are going to do in these
last days for you are gracious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah 59:1,2 The hand of the Lord is not shortened and his
ear is not heavy. He will save and he will hear but then as you look there you
will see in this case things have gone to a different Level—God has not
changed---people have changed! They have gone to a different level and lost
faith in the things of God. It is our responsibility, that understand the
things of God to know when the Lord touches a soul, immediately it is
strengthened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText> 1Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot
save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i> 2 But your iniquities have separated between you and
your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sin has caused the problem in people’s lives. The problem is
not God ear being deaf for He can hear and will hear. Psalm 34 –this poor man
cried…! God will hear, can hear. The problem is men hold onto their sin and
while they desire sin it keeps them blinded, deaf, bound in a condition that
they don’t believe that God hears them. God WILL hear the cry from the
repentant heart. DAVID KNEW GOD HEARD HIM. All the struggle was in his own
heart---God won’t hear me, save me, deliver me. GOD”S HAND IS NOT SHORT…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>None of us are beyond change if we just neglect the power that
God has given us. One touch of the Master’s hand will make the weak strong. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I prayed that prayer at 3 years of age. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember a hard difficult time in 1977 during the time dad
had the heart attack and trouble. God can do it. As long as we please, obey,
praise Him He is going to work and make our adversary to be ashamed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you surrender to the Lord, You must reach out to the
souls of men that don’t understand true salvation. There is a promise to be
free from the power of sin and not just the penalty of sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People Love their sin more than God that is why the church
houses are empty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John 3:19 <i>And this is the condemnation, that light is
come into the world, and <u>men loved darkness</u> rather than light, because
their deeds were evil.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God wants us to take care of the things that He has called
us to do and not get caught up in all ‘these other things’. And He will shame
the adversary. </p>
