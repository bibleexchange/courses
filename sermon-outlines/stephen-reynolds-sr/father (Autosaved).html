		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">There is a sin common among us, which we may be unwilling to recognize, the sin of irreverence; a want of respect for the presence, power, and majesty of God, arising from thoughtlessness or practical unbelief. We need not attempt to prove that God has a right to expect from us the fullest tribute of veneration which we can offer, for this truth is a self-evident one. He is the Creator; we are the creatures. He is the Redeemer; we are they whom He has purchased to Himself. He is the Sanctifier; we are they who need sanctification. He is Eternal, Almighty, Infinite; we are mortal, weak, finite. His mercy claims our love &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His power and goodness claim our reverence. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Serve God acceptably, we must serve Him &quot;with reverence and godly fear.&quot; On this point we are lamentably defective, the reproof to Israel is appropriate but even greater applied now. Malachi&#39;s censure was, in the first instance, applied to the priests. But as it was with the priests, so is it now with all. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">We do not deny that God is our Father and Master.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">With our lips we acknowledge Him, but are our hearts are far from Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Do we consider the force of our words when we confess Him, or what they involve. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">We speak of Him as our Father and Master but look at the offerings made to God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Irreverence in Malachi&#39;s days was shown by the character of the offerings made to God. Instead of bringing the best and perfect, men thought it sufficient to sacrifice what was torn and crippled, what was cheap and what was of no value in the market. They offered to God of that which cost them nothing. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Have we no temptation to commit the same kind of sin? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Look at the state of our churches; and negligence in church-repairs. It may be said, &quot;so as our hearts be right, it matters little under what external circumstances we worship.&quot; The Israelites might have offered a similar plea. But let us examine whether our hearts are right, and whether we have as much reverence for God&#39;s presence in His house as we ought to have. It is not in God&#39;s own house only that we show our indifference to Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The manner in which we treat His name, His day, His Word, His ministers, His sacraments, all is so much evidence against us that we have not that abiding awe of Him which is due to Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">From what causes such a spirit of irreverence has grown, and spread till it has taken possession of us; in what was its origin, and how it has been fostered, I cannot now stop to express an opinion. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The fact is before us, and the bitter fruits of our profaneness and irreverence are ripening day by day. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Our national and individual irreverence could end in open apostasy</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">What then must be done?

			<span class="cs75A07D5F">Of God&#39;s being the Father and Master of mankind</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Consider&mdash;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> How truly God is the Father, and the Master of mankind.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="csDC0FC69">1.</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2"> The Father. God gave being to the world and all things in it. St. Paul styles Him &quot;the Father, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,&quot; the Head of the rational system, the Father both of angels and men, who all derive their being from Him, and in the constitution of their nature bear some features and resemblances of the great original from whence they sprung. God created man in His own image. It is evident from our consciousness and experience, that we have such powers of perception and understanding, such a sense of good and evil, right and wrong, and such principles of honesty and goodness in our nature as ally and unite us to the Father of spirits, and give us a striking resemblance of Him, in some of His most glorious attributes and qualities. God is also to be considered the Father of mankind, as He has made an ample provision for the improvement and happiness of the excellent nature which He has given them.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="csDC0FC69">2.</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2"> The Master. As God hath all power in Himself, and as by this alone the universe subsists, all creatures whatsoever are necessarily in a state of subjection to Him. There is something implied in the notion of God&#39;s being the Master of men, more than His merely exercising an uncontrollable dominion over them. But God is a perfectly holy, righteous, and good Potentate, governing rational agents according to the dictates of the highest sanctity and justice, and consulting their happiness in all His administrations towards them. That He is the righteous Governor of men is evident from His having laid us under the law of righteousness in the constitution of our being. The foundation of God&#39;s moral government over men is firmly laid in His own nature and in ours. A just order is plainly prevalent in the conduct of human affairs, notwithstanding the irregularities and confusions which are to be observed in them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">II.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> What is that duty which we owe to God as Father and Master? Expressed in the terms </span><span class="csC382D2BB">honour</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">fear.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="csDC0FC69">1.</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2"> Honour. No sentiments are made universal and better known to the mind than those of respect, duty, and submission, which children entertain for their parents in this world. If this be the temper which becomes us with respect to the fathers of our flesh, how much more must we cultivate the same temper towards the Father of our spirits. Surely the devotion of our minds towards Him must rise into a perfect adoration of His goodness, accompanied with the sincerest gratitude and love, the firmest affiance in Him, the most absolute resignation to His will, and the most earnest endeavours to obey His laws and to imitate His purity and benignity in our whole conversation.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="csDC0FC69">2.</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2"> Fear. As the masters of this world are of different tempers and characters, so the fear of their subjects or servants in regard to them is of very different kinds. God has nothing in His nature resembling the qualities of the arbitrary or oppressive masters and rulers of this world. His government is founded on the maxims of perfect wisdom, goodness, and righteousness, therefore a slavish fear of Him can be no part of thee homage which His worshippers and servants are to pay to Him. The only fear of God which it becomes us to entertain, is a mixed affection of mind, made up of a high reverence of His perfections, particularly His wisdom, justice, purity, goodness, and power; an affectionate esteem of His laws, an earnest solicitude to obey those laws, and a great dread of transgressing them, from a sense of the baseness and odiousness of trampling upon the authority of our rightful and most gracious Lord and Saviour. The cultivation of these principles, the honour and fear of God, should be earnestly commended. Let us not, upon any pretences, excuse ourselves from the cultivation of a becoming temper towards the Deity, but cheerfully pay Him all that honour and love, that obedience and submission which, as our most compassionate and indulgent Father, and our most gracious and righteous King and Lawgiver, He claims and demands from us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">the highest happiness we shall seek to know. But can this be said to be the experience or the taste of many who call God their Father and Master? In the second place, obedience to the Divine commandments is another indication of that honour and fear which God, as a Father and Master, demands of those who profess to be His sons and His servants. An implicit confidence in the wisdom of his parents is one of the earliest instincts which nature has implanted in the bosom of a child; and to merit parental approbation and love is one of the most amiable and powerful desires that influence his conduct. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">We say, He is our Father&mdash;let Him have our filial love and obedience. We profess to bow to Him as our Master and Lord&mdash;let us devote ourselves unreservedly to His service and honour. In the third place, the relation should prompt a desire after resemblance of God in His moral excellence. The principle of imitation is one of the earliest and most active tendencies of our nature. As reason advances, the principle of imitation retains its power, and exerts its influence. Its power and influence are chiefly discernible in the resemblance which it generates in the temper and affections of the child to those of the parent. It is true that the tendency may be very strikingly modified by counteracting circumstances. But the truth holds good, that there is a strong and ever-operating tendency in a son to imitate his father; and where this imitating tendency is exercised by virtue in the parent, it is the source of the highest reciprocal satisfaction and delight, what the Father of our spirits requires of us is to elevate and ennoble this tendency to imitation by directing it to Himself. In the New Testament this imitation or resemblance of God is repeatedly pointed out as the prominent and characteristic distinction of His children. The moral excellences of the Divine character are presented as at once the sources of our comfort and the objects of our imitation. Only at an infinite distance from the moral glory of the Divine character the sons of mortality must for ever remain. In every renewed heart there is the ardent and ceaseless, and ever active desire to grow in resemblance to the moral grandeur which it adores and loves. In the fourth place, acquiescence in the appointments of His providence, and submission to His chastisement, distinguish those who are the sons and servants of God. In the exercise of his authority, and to promote the happiness and preserve the virtue of his children, the father must sometimes insist on privation and restraint, and give inflictions which he administers with reluctance and pain. Our Heavenly Father, who knows our waywardness and frailty, puts forth His hand in chastisement upon us. He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. Then what is the state of mind in which they should be met and endured? Have the visitations of Providence always been met in a right spirit? Have we not often, by the fretfulness of our temper in the hour of visitation, evinced the absence of the childlike spirit that becomes those who profess themselves the sons of God?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Present your bodies a living sacrifice.&quot; We are to serve in &quot;newness of the spirit,&quot; and not in the &quot;oldness of the letter.&quot; The living sacrifice of our body is not only keeping its members in all purity, as we would be members of Christ&#39;s body, but also giving to the Lord that &quot;from which all purity must come, a heart devoted to His service, and well instructed for that purpose in all heavenly knowledge and spiritual wisdom. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The true and living sacrifice of the body in this particular is the growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
