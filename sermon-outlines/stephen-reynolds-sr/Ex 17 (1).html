Sometimes difficult circumstances seem overwhelming and impossible to handle, as though they will swamp us and drown us under the weight of pressure and tension, distress and discouragement. The question is: What can be done? The answers seem beyond our reach. There seem to be no solutions to the hardship or misfortune, the trial or temptation.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">But there is a solution. And that solution is the Lord Himself. If we will </span><span class="csD04A7434">genuinely seek the Lord, trust and call upon Him</span><span class="csC05134DD">, He promises to give us the courage to face the difficult circumstances and to conquer them. A bold, fearless courage is the promise of the Lord to any of us who will trust and call upon Him. This is His wonderful promise, and it is the great lesson that is dramatically pictured for us in this chapter of His Holy Word. Throughout his entire adult life, David had been a military commander. Ever since he had defeated the giant Goliath as a young adolescent, David had been a warrior in Israel&#39;s armed forces. For over forty years David had been a courageous soldier, first serving as a commander within the armed forces and then as commander-in-chief when he became king of Israel. During the years of his service and reign, Israel reached a height of glory the nation had never before achieved. Also under David&#39;s leadership, the territory of Israel would include more land than ever before or any time since including up to present </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">history.
