Mysteries are being revealed in this hour. A mystery coming alive. This word is penetrating his heart and causing his heart to act in mercy, love, and kindness. People have turned hateful and unkind, but God is revealing to him that it is not over yet. God showed some things to him. Before He shows things to him regarding Israel he says, don&rsquo;t go on thinking YOU ALREADY NOW. If you already know and have &nbsp;preconceived idea you have no room for the revelation, new understanding. NO room for revival. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 184.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 184.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Cor. 2:14-16 Though there be few in number that receive the truth, God is faithful to cause his Word to abound. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 184.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 184.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What does it take to bring Israel to holiness?
