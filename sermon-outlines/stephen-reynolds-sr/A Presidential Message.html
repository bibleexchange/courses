This is a Hebraism that pictures God as an Investigator &ldquo;visiting&rdquo; a person, city, or nation to expose the hearts, gather evidence, and &ldquo;see&rdquo; firsthand, as it were, the truth of a matter. It is much like a divine court case where the evidence is uncovered and presented to the judge for judgment. </span></p><p class="csC5CA72D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Lu 19:43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">The time of visitation was the three-year period of Jesus&rsquo; ministry from 30-33 A.D., where God manifested in human flesh to &ldquo;visit&rdquo; Judea and Jerusalem and to test the hearts of the people. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">(Jesus is called a Bishop or Overseer in 1 Peter 2:25.) </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">In another sense, Jesus was the Heavenly Fruit Inspector. Jesus found a few whose hearts were right, and these formed the branches of the good fig tree that brought forth good fruit (Jer. 24:5-7). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">The majority, along with the religious leaders, were of the evil fig tree (Jer. 24:8-10). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">The good figs were Jesus&rsquo; disciples and the converts of the early Church, who were expelled from the land (by persecution), in order that God might spare them from the coming judgment forty years later. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The idea of &ldquo;visitation&rdquo; is shown in the Old Testament. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">For believers, it has a positive connotation, as in Gen. 50:24, 25, Psalm 106:4, and Jer. 27:24. Their visitation results salvation or deliverance. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">For unbelievers, it carries a negative result, as we see in Ex. 32:34, Lev. 18:25, Isaiah 10:3, and Jer. 10:15. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The Hebrew word for &ldquo;visitation&rdquo; in the Old Testament is </span><span class="csC8468922">peqadah</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">, and the Septuagint Greek equivalent is </span><span class="csC8468922">episcope</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">As the Heavenly Fruit Inspector, Jesus was sent to taste of the fruit being given to God at the temple in Jerusalem to see (and judge) if it was good. He was gathering evidence to be presented to the divine court that would determine the fate of Jerusalem. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">At the same time, He was also training and testing the hearts of twelve disciples. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Divine visitation is God&rsquo;s judgment in the life of the believer by which the Holy Spirit trains them in obedience. By His guiding voice, He shows them the will of God and writes His law upon their hearts. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">So we see that divine visitation, or judgment, has a positive outcome for the believer and a negative outcome for the unbeliever. And yet, even the negative outcome is not permanent, for the purpose of judgment is ultimately to correct men and bring them into alignment with the will and mind of God. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The Greek word for Comforter is </span><span class="csC8468922">parakletos</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">, which means an intercessor, an advocate, or helper in a court of law&mdash;that is, a defense attorney, one who knows the law and can show sinners the lawful way to avoid God&rsquo;s judgment. The lawful way, Jesus said, is to through the Door, rather than over the wall (John 10:1-10). Going over the wall (avoiding Jesus Christ and His Sacrifice for sin) is how many religions advocate salvation, but they will lose their case when they stand before the Great White Throne. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">It is the job of the Comforter (Holy Spirit) to discern, judge and convict men of sin according to the evidence. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The Comforter is a defense attorney to a believer, but a witness against the unbeliever. </span></p><p class="csC5CA72D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">John 16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: </span></p><p class="cs70055351"><span class="cs1DA2E76">[Gr., </span><span class="csC8468922">parakletos</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">] </span><span class="csA77D58D6">shall not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. </span><span class="csA77D58D6"><sup>8 </sup></span><span class="csA77D58D6">And He, when He comes, will </span><span class="cs71CD9AA">convict </span><span class="cs1DA2E76">[</span><span class="csC8468922">elengkos</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">] </span><span class="csA77D58D6">the world concerning sin, and </span><span class="cs71CD9AA">righteousness</span><span class="csA77D58D6">, and </span><span class="cs71CD9AA">judgment </span><span class="cs1DA2E76">[Gr., </span><span class="csC8468922">krisis</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">, &ldquo;decision for or against; justice&rdquo;]</span><span class="csA77D58D6">. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The Greek verb translated &ldquo;convict&rdquo; above is </span><span class="csC8468922">elengkos</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">. Its noun form is </span><span class="csC8468922">elegmos</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">, which means &ldquo;proof or evidence.&rdquo; So the verb means to convict or judge according to the evidence that has been gathered during the time of visitation, or investigation. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">For the world in general (unbelievers), this evidence will convict them of sin. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">But for the believers, the evidence will show proof of righteousness. </span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="cs1DA2E76">During Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry, the time of His visitation was to decide the fate of Judah and to divide the good figs from the bad (Jer. 24). The majority were bad figs by God&rsquo;s definition in Jeremiah 24, because they refused to submit to Rome according to God&rsquo;s judgment and desired a military messiah who would throw off the Roman yoke. Jesus found only a minority who could accept the Prince of Peace as their Messiah. These were the good figs of Judah. These were promised &ldquo;another Comforter,&rdquo; the Holy Spirit, who would come on Pentecost to begin the next &ldquo;time of visitation&rdquo; in the Pentecostal Age leading to Christ&rsquo;s second coming. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">It is the job of the Holy Spirit to help advise sinners who stand convicted by the law (Rom. 3:19) to find justification&mdash;that is, be pronounced not legally guilty. Jesus trained His disciples during His time of visitation. And then toward the end of His ministry, He spoke of &ldquo;another Comforter&rdquo; (John 14:16) that was yet to be given. The use of the term &ldquo;another&rdquo; indicates that Jesus Himself was a Comforter prior to the time when the Holy Spirit was given in Acts 2. In fact, at the beginning of His life, Simeon called Him &ldquo;the consolation of Israel&rdquo; (Luke 2:25). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">The word is </span><span class="cs54AE92B1">paraklesis</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">, the same word as the Comforter. </span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Once a sinner goes through that Door, the Holy Spirit continues to take an active role in our lives to teach us the difference between sin and righteousness. </span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">This is not for the purpose of justification in the divine court, but rather for the purpose of sanctification in our personal lives.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;Justification is when a sinner is pronounced </span><span class="cs54AE92B1">not guilty before the law, through faith in Christ.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Sanctification is the next step&mdash;the work of the Spirit to teach us to conform our lives to the image of Christ&mdash;that is, being made not guilty </span><span class="cs54AE92B1">by nature</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">. Sanctification is pictured by the feast of Pentecost.
