They are--in increasing order of rank--private, private first class (lance corporal in the Marines), corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant, sergeant first class (gunnery sergeant in the Marines), master sergeant and sergeant major. The army has the added rank of specialist, which is the same pay grade as a corporal but lower in rank, located between private first class and corporal.</span></li></ul>

The nine ranks are seaman recruit; seaman apprentice; seaman; petty officers 3rd, 2nd, and 1st class; chief petty officer; senior chief petty officer; and master chief petty officer.

They can best be corrected by restoring to the Church its true position and its rightful authority in all matters concerning faith. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The word [</span><span class="csD3860DFD">ecclesia</span><span class="csA521DC07"> or church] means,</span><span class="csD3860DFD"> </span><span class="csA521DC07">a body, &nbsp;called out of the world, a selected assembly or people called out of heathenism, from worldly things engrossments, from the slavery of sin, and who are born into the Christ-Kingdom, Christ as Lord and Head, receiving Him personally as Redeemer and Saviour, giving Him full allegiance, obeying His teaching, relying on His promises. They are born and called into this, prevenient grace. Preparing you to be baptized into the body of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;In Covenant with God through Christ the Mediator, on the ground of His Redemptive work, through the human instrumentality of His Ministry.

It may be considered as local&mdash;a single congregation. It is a Church as having the Ministry, the preaching of the pure word of God. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">This is the Kingdom which John Baptist announced as immediately at hand, which Jesus Himself began to preach in Galilee Mark i, 14, and which He, its founder, compared to a grain of mustard seed, in His parables. it is set forth and illustrated in varied language. It is the Body of Christ. It is a living Temple built up on the foundation of His doctrine. It is a vine with fruit-bearing branches. It is an army fighting and conquering under Jesus our King and the Captain of our Salvation. It is the institution built by Christ against which the gates of hell cannot prevail Matt. xvi, 18. It is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the Truth.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">All the references to it in Holy Scripture prove that it is Divine and intended to be permanent. I am not speaking now of the Jewish Church of which the Christian is the antitype, the continuation, the development, and which every one who receives the OldTestament believes to have been Divine in its origin and divinely guided in its history. I am speaking of the Church of the New Covenant. It is founded by Christ. It is purchased by His Blood. It is vitalised and energised by His Spirit. He ordained and appointed and qualifies its Ministry, and provides for their succession and perpetuation. He instituted its Sacraments, and gave for its guidance the Word of Truth. He intended it as the Spiritual House, the School for training, the Church as His Body should represent Him in the world, should be and show through the Word His life, should continue the work which He began to do and to teach (Acts i, 1), and of which He laid the foundation in His Death, Resurrection, Ascension and Pentecostal gifts; the regeneration of the world.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">First, it is </span><span class="cs75A07D5F">one</span><span class="csA521DC07">. Christ, the Head, has not many Bodies, but one Body. It has many members, and all have not the same office, but they all contribute to the increase and usefulness of the Body. So the Vine is one. The Temple is one. Indeed, all the Scripture representations of the Church involve its Unity. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Since the Church has been broken into many schisms and as we see it to-day to be sadly divided, a distinction has been drawn between the Church, visible and invisible; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Triumphant in Glory.

The Holiness of the Church needs but a word of explanation. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The Church is Holy in purpose and end. It is Holy because its Head is Holy. Its life is from the only Source of Holiness. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The </span><span class="csF42C4B08">Holy</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Spirit is its vital breath and inspiration. It is One in Christ in Whom it lives and Who is in it the hope of glory. The Scripture passages which directly and indirectly assert the Holiness of the visible Church are numerous and must be familiar to students of the Bible.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">1Ti 1:5 &para; Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Mt 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The crime </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">breaking the Unity of the Church</span><span class="csA521DC07"> lies chiefly at the door of lukewarmness.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">4.
