		<li class="cs6DB7E83D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Redemption means &#39;&#39;buying back&#39;&#39;; we had sold ourselves for naught, and Christ redeemed us and bought us back. </span></li><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;A friend in Ireland once met a little Irish boy who had caught a sparrow. The poor little bird was trembling in his hand, and seemed very anxious to escape. The gentleman begged the boy to let it go, as the bird could not do him any good; but the boy said he would not, for he had chased it three hours before he could catch it. He tried to reason it out with the boy, but in vain. At last he offered to buy the bird. The boy agreed to the price, and it was paid. Then the gentleman took the poor little thing, and held it out in his hand. The boy had been holding it very fast, for the boy was stronger than the bird, just as Satan is stronger than we; and there it sat for a time scarcely able to realize the fact that it had got liberty; but in a little while it flew away chirping.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is what redemption is &mdash; buying back and setting free. Christ came to break the fetters of sin, to open the prison doors and set the sinner free. </span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

It cannot be found. The blood of Jesus Christ blots out sin. There was a woman in Ireland had a little class in school; and she asked if there was anything that God couldn&#39;t do. And one little child said, &#39;&#39;Yes, He can&#39;t see my sins through the blood of Jesus Christ.&#39;&#39; That is what He cannot do. The blood blots it out</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;When we get to heaven we will find men whom we have known to be thieves and drunkards and murderers, men as vile as could be, as vile as any that ever trod this earth, then as pure as the Son of God, because the blood of Jesus Christ has made them clean.

You can have them if you will. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;They say now-a-days that they can&#39;t make a will that is so sure that some keen lawyer can&#39;t smash it all to pieces; but I challenge any man to break Christ&#39;s will. He rose to execute His own will. Neither man or devil can break it. He made peace by His blood on the cross. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peace of conscience, Peace of mind, Peace of soul </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peace can only be found under the shadow of the cross.

Is your soul tossed on the waves of trouble and sorrow and persecution?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;During the last days of the civil war, when many men were deserting from the South, Secretary Stanton sent out a notice from the War Department that no more refugees be taken into the Union army. A Southern soldier hadn&#39;t seen that, and he came into the Union lines and they read the order to him. He didn&#39;t know what to do. If he went back into the Southern army he would be shot as a deserter, and the Northern army wouldn&#39;t have him. So he went into the woods between the armies and stayed until he got starved out. He saw an officer going by, and he rushed out of the woods and told this officer that if he didn&#39;t help him he would have to take his life. The officer asked what was the trouble. He told him. The officer said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;&#39;&#39;Haven&#39;t you heard the news?&#39;&#39; &nbsp;&#39;&#39;No,what news?&#39;&#39; the war is over. Lee has surrendered. Peace is declared. Go to the first town, and get all the food you want.&#39;&#39; The man waved his hat and went to the town as quick as he could. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peace is declared, the war is over. Be ye reconciled to God, and the whole thing is settled. The trouble is on your side. The blood is on the mercy seat, and as long as it is there the vilest sinner can enter and be saved for time and eternity. </span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Do you know what it means? It is better than pardon. Justification means that there isn&#39;t a charge against you. Your sins are completely washed away; they are not to be remembered; they are not to be mentioned. Think of it! God says He puts them out of His memory. In other words, I have been running up an account down at the grocery store for some years, and I haven&#39;t any money to pay. I go down there and the storekeeper says: </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paid in full by the Precious Blood of the Lamb, the whole bill; it is all settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is justification.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ro 8:33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God&#39;s elect?

It went against him, and when the judge pronounced the sentence upon him, he took pains to say that he and the whole court were shocked to think that a man could be on trial for his life and be so unconcerned. When the judge got through, the man stepped up and laid the king&#39;s pardon on the judge&#39;s desk, and walked out bold as a lion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a charge against me.
