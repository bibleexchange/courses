Therefore, a person with a dove personality is typically easy-going and friendly. A dove is a God-pleaser and a team-player. A dove is loyal and hard-working, but tends to avoid conflict and confrontation. A dove likes to play it safe and doesn&#39;t like taking risks. Often, a dove would rather go with the flow than to be assertive in his or her needs. Typically, a dove has a submissive personality. A dove is a tenderheart and tends to think with emotions.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Personality Test: The Eagle Personality Traits</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/>The eagle is majestic and a noble hunter. An aggressive bird, the eagle knows what it wants and takes it. A person with the personality traits of an eagle is bold and dominant. An eagle is highly analytical and decisive. He or she can be discriminating to others&#39; needs. An eagle is focused and single-minded, keeping track of the &#39;bigger picture&#39;. Where a dove rules with emotions, an eagle can sometimes come across as being devoid of emotion.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Personality Test: The Peacock Personality Traits</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/>The peacock is a showy bird, with its bright colors and beautiful tail feathers. It struts around, flashing those feathers to attract attention. Thus, it&#39;s not hard to imagine that a person with the personality traits of a peacock is someone who adores attention. A peacock loves to be noticed. He or she is gregarious and talkative. A peacock sparkles and is the life of the party. However, the peacock can come across as cocky and irresponsible. A peacock is generally not great with time management or dealing with details. &nbsp;&ldquo;you talk so much I bet you talk in your sleep!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Personality Test: The Owl Personality Traits</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The owl is considered to be of the night, late and see from either side at the same time, wise old owl.

Without space to run, as is its habit, it will not even attempt to fly, but will remain a prisoner for life in a small jail with no top.</span></li><li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="cs5B41FA1C">The buzzard allows the pen to be his master and over looks a wide open escape. You who have been, or are a slave to alcohol or tobacco drugs will be master over that when you have faith in God. You have an escape and it is wide open to you. He is the one to deliver you.</span></li><li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="csA16174BA">Has a screeching cry, gives a hoot but feeds on the smaller birds.</span></li></ol>
