While hiding out there, a band of Philistines camped out in the Valley of Rephaim right below the cave stronghold, trapping and blocking any hope of escape for David and his soldiers. Sitting there in the cave with no fresh water supply, the men apparently began to discuss how refreshing a drink would be from the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">good well water </span><span class="csC05134DD">of Bethlehem. At some point during the discussion, David wishfully stated how much he would love to have a drink of that refreshing water from Bethlehem.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Being so deeply devoted to David, three of his warriors set out to fulfill the desire of their commander (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+23%3A16"><span class="cs6C232F6B">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:16</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Somehow they fearlessly broke through the enemy line and secretly made their way to Bethlehem where the Philistines had set up a garrison to keep the Israelites of the area under their control. Without being spotted, the three devoted soldiers walked up to the well and drew water, then brought it back to David. David was so overwhelmed by the sacrificial devotion of the men that he refused to drink the water (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+23%3A16-17"><span class="cs6C232F6B">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:16-17</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Instead, he poured it out as a drink offering to the Lord. He valued the water so much that he used it as a symbol of blood, for it had been brought to him at the risk of the three warriors&#39; lives (blood). Being symbolized as blood, the water could be used only as a drink offering presented to the Lord. A drink offering symbolized that the person was pouring out his life as an offering to God, submitting himself to the Lord&mdash;all he was and had. </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
