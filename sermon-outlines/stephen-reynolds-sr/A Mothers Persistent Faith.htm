gift suggestion from him (<u>2&nbsp;Kings 4:14</u>). The servant replied that
the woman was childless and her husband was very elderly, so she probably would
never have children. Immediately Elisha summoned the childless woman and
promised that God would give her a child within one year (<u>2&nbsp;Kings
4:15-17</u>). Standing in the doorway, the woman was utterly shocked, but no
doubt flooded with a sense of excitement. Nevertheless, she objected to
Elisha's promise because she feared disappointment, a broken heart. She
objected, asking for Elisha not to mislead her, not to break her heart with
such a promise. But she soon was with child and bore a son just as Elisha had
promised.</span></p>

Taking him upstairs to Elisha's room, she laid the child on the prophet's bed.
As quickly as she could, she asked her husband for a servant and donkey so she
could make a quick visit to Elisha. Somewhat perplexed, the husband asked why
she needed to make the visit since it was not a religious holiday. Wellhe gave
her permission to make the quick trip. As rapidly as she could, she rushed to
Elisha, the prophet of God, from whom she would <b><u>seek help</u></b> in her
desperate and helpless hour of need.</span></p>

mother rushed to Mt. Carmel where Elisha lived. Spotting her off in the
distance rushing toward him, Elisha sent his servant to meet and greet her. But
she refused to be delayed by conversation with the servant (<u>2&nbsp;Kings
4:25-26</u>). As soon as she reached Elisha, she quickly slipped off her donkey
and rushed up to him, kneeling to the ground and grabbing his feet (<u>2&nbsp;Kings
4:27</u>). Gehazi rushed over to push her away, but Elisha stopped him. For he
sensed the mother's bitter grief and sorrow. Pouring out her soul to Elisha,
she expressed that her pain was worse than having no child at all. In fact,
when Elisha had promised the child, she had asked him not to raise her hopes (<u>2&nbsp;Kings
4:28</u>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;

at the home, Elisha found the boy lying on the bed in the room that had been

to the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Lord</span>. At some point he
stretched his body out upon the boy face-to-face, and the dead child's body
began to grow warm (<u>2&nbsp;Kings 4:33-34</u>). Getting up off the child,
Elisha began to pace the floor, continuing to pray (<u>2&nbsp;Kings 4:35</u>).
Then once again he stretched out his body upon the boy. Immediately the boy
sneezed seven times, and God revived the dead child. At that point, Elisha instructed
his servant to call the woman (<u>2&nbsp;Kings 4:36-37</u>). As she entered the
room, her first sight was of Elisha holding the child in his arms; then she
heard the prophet instruct her to take the child. But this she did not do.
Rushing toward the prophet and her son, she fell at Elisha's feet and bowed to
the ground showing gratitude and worship to the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Lord</span>.
Before long she arose and tenderly took her son into her arms. She then went
out to spend some precious moments with the son who had been raised from the
dead and given life by the power of God (<u>2&nbsp;Kings 4:36-37</u>).</span></p>

eternally and all unbelievers to be separated from Him eternally. The wonderful
hope of believers is the glorious resurrection when the Lord Jesus Christ
returns to this earth. When we are raised from the dead we will receive our <i>permanent
bodies</i>, bodies that will be perfected, free of all disease and aging, pain
and suffering, deformity and defect. Just as this small child was raised from
