		<p class="cs232A56CC"><span class="cs87110596">Introduction</span><span class="csC05134DD">: the judgment of God is a forgotten subject. There is little fear of God in the world today.

Remember what had just happened. The glory of God&#39;s holy presence had just been revealed to the people. The glorious day of dedication&mdash;the dedication of the people and the Tabernacle&mdash;had just occurred. But then all of a sudden, two of Aaron&#39;s sons who had just been ordained as priests rejected God&#39;s clear commandment. They disobeyed God. They approached God in their own way, as they wished instead of as God said. They rejected the way of approach appointed by God and determined their own way. Consequently, the judgment of God struck out against them. This is the subject of this passage: </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">The Judgment of God upon The False Worship of Two Priests, Nadab and Abihu: The Fate of All Who Approach God in a Wrong Way</span><span class="csC05134DD">, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="sp10451"></a><a name="sp10179"></a><a name="sp10102"></a><a name="sp10366"></a><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="link319"><span class="cs821257DA">1. </span></a><span class="cs821257DA">JUDGMENT </span><span class="csC05134DD">False Fire </span><span class="cs87110596">False Worship,&mdash; False Ministry,</span><span class="csC05134DD">: the sin and judgment of false worshippers.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Note what Aaron&#39;s two sons did.

He willingly approaches God through the atoning sacrifice. He confesses that he is a sinner, that he has no access into God&#39;s presence&mdash;no right whatsoever to approach God&mdash;except as God dictates.

Note that Aaron was not allowed to take care of his two dead sons. Priests were forbidden to touch or go near a corpse. Why? Because death symbolized defilement and uncleanness, corruption and decay. Defilement and corruption disqualified a priest from performing his service for God. For this reason, Aaron was forbidden to touch the two dead bodies despite the fact that they were his sons. Note that Moses had the two nephews of Aaron remove the dead bodies (the defilement) outside the camp (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+10%3A5"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Leviticus 10:5</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to prevent the judgment of God is to show total devotion to God (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+10%3A6-7"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Leviticus 10:6-7</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Note that Aaron and his two surviving sons were not even allowed to share in the rites of mourning. They had to leave the mourning and the taking care of the bodies in the hands of their relatives (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+10%3A6"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Leviticus 10:6</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Why? Because the priests had to show that they fully agreed with God&#39;s judgment against sin: they did not condone sin. The priests had to show that they were totally devoted to God, and the people had to understand their total devotion. Note that Aaron and his sons were to remain in the Tabernacle and complete their service for the Lord (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+10%3A7"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Leviticus 10:7</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). They were to be steadfast, unmovable in their service for God. Note that this is exactly what Aaron and his two surviving sons did. They obeyed God: they showed that they were totally devoted to God. Think of the devotion of Aaron. His two sons had just been struck dead by the holiness of God because of a terrible sin they had committed. Yet Aaron, though gripped with a deep sense of grief and sorrow, continued on, completing his service for God. What devotion!</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to prevent the judgment of God is no drinking wine or strong drink (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+10%3A8-9"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Leviticus 10:8-9</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Note this is a very special commandment from God to the priest, Aaron. In fact, this is the only time in Leviticus that God speaks directly to Aaron. Up to this time, God had instructed Aaron through his mediator, Moses. The fact that God Himself gave this commandment to Aaron shows the importance of the commandment. But note this fact as well: the commandment is to be a permanent commandment for all generations. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to prevent the judgment of God is to live totally for God (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+10%3A10"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Leviticus 10:10</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).
