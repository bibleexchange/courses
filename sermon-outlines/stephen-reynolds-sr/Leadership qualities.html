				</li><li class="cs794F77C2"><span class="cs6785BAD0">But it&#39;s not enough to have a vision; leaders must also share it and act upon it. </span></li></ol>

		<p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">A leader must be able to communicate the vision in terms that cause followers to act willingly. We must communicate clearly and passionately.</span></p><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="cs35059B9E"><span class="cs6785BAD0">A good leader must have the discipline to work toward the vision single-mindedly, as well challenge each follower toward the goal.</span></li></ol>
		</ol>
		<p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">Progress in Action is the mark of a leader.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">&nbsp;A leader does not suffer &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; but is always doing something in pursuit of the vision, inspiring others to do the same.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csFD416B16">Anyone desiring to be a leader must bring to the table the three foundational attributes &ndash; Hungry, Honeable, and Honorable </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="csB2FC2855">Integrity</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> is the combination of outward actions and inner values.</span></p><p class="csC65104C8"><span class="cs6785BAD0">&nbsp;A person of integrity is the same on the outside as on the inside. Such an individual can be trusted because they never veer from inner values, </span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">A leader must have the trust of followers by always displaying integrity.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">Honest dealings, predictable reactions, well-controlled emotions, and an absence of tantrums and harsh outbursts are all signs of integrity. A leader who is centered in integrity will be more approachable by followers.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="csB2FC2855">Dedication</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> means spending whatever time or energy is necessary to accomplish the task at hand. A leader inspires dedication by example, doing whatever it takes to complete the next step toward the vision. By setting an excellent example, leaders can show followers that there are no nine-to-five jobs on the team, only opportunities to achieve something great.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="csB2FC2855">Magnanimity</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> means giving credit where it is due. A magnanimous leader ensures that credit for successes is spread as widely as possible throughout the company. Conversely, a good leader takes personal responsibility for failures. This sort of reverse magnanimity helps other people feel good about themselves and draws the team closer together. To spread the fame and take the blame is a hallmark of effective leadership.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">Leaders with </span><span class="csB2FC2855">humility</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> recognize that they are no better or worse than other members of the team. A humble leader is not self-effacing but rather tries to elevate everyone. Leaders with humility also understand that their status does not make them a god. Mahatma Gandhi is a role model for Indian leaders, and he pursued a &quot;follower-centric&quot; leadership role.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="csB2FC2855">Openness </span><span class="cs6785BAD0">means being able to listen to new ideas, even if they do not conform to the usual way of thinking. Good leaders are able to suspend judgment while listening to others&#39; ideas, as well as accept new ways of doing things that someone else thought of. Openness builds mutual respect and trust between leaders and followers, and it also keeps the team well supplied with new ideas that can further its vision.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="csB2FC2855">Creativity</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> is the ability to think differently, to get outside of the box that constrains solutions. Creativity gives leaders the ability to see things that others have not seen and thus lead followers in new directions. The most important question that a leader can ask is, &quot;What if &hellip; ?&quot; Possibly the worst thing a leader can say is, &quot;I know this is a dumb question ... &quot;</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="csB2FC2855">Fairness</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> means dealing with others consistently and justly. A leader must check all the facts and hear everyone out before passing judgment. </span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">Avoid leaping to conclusions based on incomplete evidence. When people feel they that are being treated fairly, they reward a leader with loyalty and dedication.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="csB2FC2855">Assertiveness</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> is not the same as aggressiveness. Rather, it is the ability to clearly state what one expects so that there will be no misunderstandings. A leader must be assertive to get the desired results. Along with assertiveness comes the responsibility to clearly understand what followers expect from their leader.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">Many leaders have difficulty striking the right amount of assertiveness, according to a study in the February 2007 issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, published by the APA (American Psychological Association). It seems that being underassertive or overassertive may be the most common weakness among aspiring leaders.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">A </span><span class="csB2FC2855">sense of humor</span><span class="cs6785BAD0"> is vital to relieve tension and boredom, as well as to defuse hostility. Effective leaders know how to use humor to energize followers. Humor is a form of power that provides some control over the work environment. And simply put, humor fosters good camaraderie.</span></p><p class="cs98755B4A"><span class="cs6785BAD0">Intrinsic traits such as intelligence, good looks, height and so on are not necessary to become a leader. Anyone can cultivate the proper leadership traits.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csA7555675">Timothy</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2Ti 3:10 &para; But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Ac 19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Ro 16:21 &para; Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Col 1:1 &para; Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Php 2:19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Php 2:22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1Ti 1:2 Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1Co 16:10 &para; Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1Co 4:17 &para; For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">1Co 7:17 &para; But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk.
