We have helped broken family members until they get back together with their families.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Sunday School program that has reached as many as 80 children at a time, Friday and Saturday night young people meetings, many special field trips, youth camp a week at a time.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">The Deliverance Bible Institute : &nbsp;Three year Bible school since 1969</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Christian Academy of Portland: Primary to 12th grade </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Vanda Siciliano has never lived at the Deliverance Center but she has attended some classes in the bible School as well as her daughter Hope had attended a few classes at times and Vanda still attends &nbsp;the Church services. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">It really is a long story of how many times we have spoken to her and warned of just potential problems between her and other children or just both of them feeling comfortable around the men in general that we have tried to help at the Deliverance Center or people that have attended church services, Bible school and the Academy.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">We can only help certain types of people at a time now because of the way the system is working with the insurance companies and the courts, you can be in trouble just by someone making an accusation. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Hope Siciliano right up to becoming married has never got along with any child but is always the other child or person&rsquo;s fault by her and her mother.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Hope Siciliano&rsquo;s birth in 1989 &nbsp;happened by Frank Siciliano (Vanda&rsquo;s husband at the time) &nbsp;took a young struggling teenager (Shawn Mcfarland) a 18 year old we were trying to help, into his own home, &nbsp;Frank took Shawn and about six other men we didn&rsquo;t even know or ever have anything to do with into his home to live with him and his wife at the time (Vanda). </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Vanda and Shawn Mcfarland slept together in Frank Siciliano&rsquo;s home (Hope was born from that disaster) Shawn Mcfarland ran away and had nothing to do with them for years. Frank Siciliano divorced Vanda. My dad Rev. James R. Reynolds convinced Vanda Siciliano not to abort Hope, When Hope Siciliano was older she got a hold of Shawn Mcfarland to come back to Maine, he got into trouble here in Maine Vanda and Hope asked us at the Deliverance Center if we could help Shawn, we tried for a couple of weeks twice and there was no change in his constant lying. Both times Vanda and Hope brought Shawn to the Deliverance Center for help.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">If they had any bad memories of any men here, why would they send Shawn back to us for help and their own relative&rsquo;s </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Gregory Scott Luce, Terry Luce</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">, </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Jonathan K Luce. Why would Mrs. Gloria Luce attend services for 25-30 years, Vanda and her sister&rsquo;s attend the services.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">From 1989-1994 Hope (from birth to 5 years old) lived at home with her mother as they attended church at the Deliverance Center. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">From 1994-2000 was home schooled because she just couldn&rsquo;t get along with the other students at Christian Academy of Portland. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">From 1994-2003 Hope (14 years old) there were many times speaking with her and her mother over problems they would have here at the Church no mention of molestation.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Now Hope says she has kept a calendar of events that she is claiming took place here at The Deliverance Center.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">From 2003-2006 I Myself Stephen G. Reynolds Sr. Spent a lot of time trying to warn Raymond Champagne (a man living at the Deliverance Center) not to involve himself in any way with Hope, at this time she is Hope Siciliano.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">I warned Hope (14-16) she is too young to be married and Raymond Champagne 35+ was not at all ready for marriage for many reasons, just the fact that he was talking about a 14 year old.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">They insisted to get married, I made him leave the Deliverance Center, Raymond went and married Hope and shortly returned for a visit and apologized for not listening to me.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Many things took place they didn&rsquo;t get along at all. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Hope Champagne while she is married to Raymond paid for hotels and slept with Charles Knox many times which is a man that my Dad has tried to help a few times in the past and now Hope is trying to say she kept records that Charles Knox has done things to her at the Deliverance Center, no mention of these things before and we had many conferences.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">We have watched out for Hope since she was a little girl; she has never been a bit afraid of any adults. Hope would speak up to her mother and us at the Deliverance Center always lying and blaming someone else for the most simple things, (pushing, stealing a sandwich or something from someone&rsquo;s lunch bag, taking or moving someone&rsquo;s stuff, claiming that all the other children was being mean to her over and over) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">I have never heard or seen so much drama to disaster involving two people in 52 years, </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">This is a very brief summary, I am willing to discuss more.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">We want to give the $50,000 dollars back to Vanda Siciliano but with 100% caution.</span></p></body>
