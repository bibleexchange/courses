				<li class="csB2924952"><span class="csA521DC07">Repentance is more than a sorrow for sin; it is a determination to abandon it and live a new life.

John the Baptist was its herald. Christ, after his resurrection and just before his ascension, declared his induction into it. Mt 28:18. The millennium and the judgment are stages in its continuous progress; and the consummation of the mediatorial kingdom is described. 1Co 15:24,28. Some texts in which the phrase is used refer mainly to one stage, and others to another, of its onward course. Men must hate and forsake their sins in order to be prepared for the kingdom of God. Pr 28:13.</span></li></ol>
