<p class=MsoNormal>Title: Our Responsibility to Guard the Field</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Text: Matthew 13:24-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a responsibility. Where god holds us responsible he
has provided much. He has guaranteed to reward us if we remain faithful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.25 While men slept the enemy sold tares</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God has given us a responsibility to guard the field and pay
it careful attention. God has planted some good seed into our heart and into
our life. We must guard against the enemies sowing of tares. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.5in'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></b><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We Must Realize We Have a
Responsibility to Keep the Enemy Away and Keep Bad Seed Out of Our Lives</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a responsibility. If we don’t realize our
responsibility we’ll miss church, give excuse for un-involvement in things you
once loved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People let the devil come by and put wedges of doubt and
questions in their mind. “Oh, I don’t have time to spend with you today.” Love
brought into question because of tares and wedges. As important as our family
and friends are and we have a responsibility in protecting those relationships.
We must make sure our hearts and lives are guarded because there is an enemy
that comes by and loves to sow tares. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People wanted to go in and gather up the tares quickly, but
you cannot change people. You cannot fix their problems for them. (Mote beam
and splinter in your eye lesson from Jesus applies here as well.) UNLESS THEY
wake up and realize something is wrong with them (Matthew 11:28) they can’t be
changed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.5in'>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When We Realize His Gifts are Good, We have a Responsibility to Guard
Those Things</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He has promised to keep us and his keeping power is real. We
would have no problem with the enemy or the flesh if we kept our faith in
working order through a dedicated and consistent prayer life. If you are going
to have His gifts you must come to Him. Come and keep coming. In a place of
worship, prayer, and praise to the Lord we have FELLOWSHIP with God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must share what God has given us to others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If it is not the seed God has planted it is a tare. </p>
