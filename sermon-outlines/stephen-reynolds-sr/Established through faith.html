		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB9F74D32">Ophir, from the <a class="cs41BD8870" href="http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/hebrewal.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Hebrew</span></a></span><span class="csB9F74D32"> word (pronounced) </span><span class="cs55EC5E2E">oh-feer</span><span class="csB9F74D32">, was the name of a son of Joktan, a descendant of Noah through the line of Noah&#39;s son Shem (Genesis 10:21-25). Ophir was also the name given to a place (see also <a class="cs41BD8870" href="http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/places.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Bible Places</span></a></span><span class="csB9F74D32">) that became famous in early <a class="cs41BD8870" href="http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/biblhist.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Bible History</span></a></span><span class="csB9F74D32"> for the gold found there. The Bible does not state that Ophir, the place, was named after Ophir, the man (or vice-versa), however the possibility does exist because others born at that time shared names of places that soon thereafter entered the Biblical record. Two of Ophir&#39;s brothers, Havilah and Sheba, also had names that became identified with places i.e. Sheba was where the famous Queen of Sheba came from (see <a class="cs41BD8870" href="http://www.keyway.ca/htm2004/20040311.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">The Queen of the South</span></a></span><span class="csB9F74D32">), and Havilah, although known as a place before <a class="cs41BD8870" href="http://www.keyway.ca/htm2002/flood.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">The Flood</span></a></span><span class="csB9F74D32">, was also an existing place after the Flood, and like Ophir, Havilah was known for its gold. The Bible does state that Ophir and his brothers lived to &quot;the east&quot; (Genesis 10:30 KJV), which, considering that Sheba is known to have been located in southern Arabia, was the most likely area of their habitiation. There is no mention of them farther north, among the Canaanites.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCC95C18">&quot;And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csB9F74D32">Ophir is always mentioned regarding the gold found there; another clue as to the location of Ophir is that Solomon&#39;s ships departed from the Red Sea ports to obtain gold from Ophir, thereby indicating a southern destination (rather from the Mediterranean Sea ports which traded to the north).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><div style="float:right;margin:5.25pt 6pt 5.25pt 6pt;width:322.5pt;height:385.5pt;">
