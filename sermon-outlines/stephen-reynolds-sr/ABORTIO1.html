Family member can also be affected. Symptoms are similar to those in any post traumatic stress disorder. Basically it is the personal struggle to work through thoughts, feelings about the abortion and previous pregnancy, and the goal to come to peace with those involved in the decision making process and ultimate loss of life. Granted some men/women are better equipped to deal with the aftermath of an abortion, but EVERYONE is changed by it!

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">RU486, Mifepristone: (Abortion Pill) </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">- Within </span><span class="csC5F53424">4 to 7 weeks</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> after last menstrual period (LMP)<br/><br/>This drug is only approved for use in women up to the 49th day after their last menstrual period. The procedure usually requires three office visits. On the first visit, the woman is given pills to cause the death of the embryo. Two days later, if the abortion has not occurred, she is given a second drug which causes cramps to expel the embryo. The last visit is a follow up ultrasound to determine if the procedure has been completed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">RU486 will not work in the case of an ectopic pregnancy. This is a potentially life-threatening condition in which the embryo lodges outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. If not diagnosed early, the tube may burst, causing internal bleeding and in some cases, the death of the woman.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Manual Vacuum Aspiration</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: up to </span><span class="csC5F53424">7 weeks</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> after LMP<br/><br/>This surgical abortion is done early in the pregnancy up until 7 weeks after the woman&#39;s last menstrual period. A long, thin tube is inserted into the uterus. A large syringe is attached to the tube and the embryo is suctioned out.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Suction Curettage:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> between </span><span class="csC5F53424">6 to 14 weeks</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> after LMP<br/><br/>This is the most common surgical abortion procedure. Because the baby is larger, the doctor must first stretch open the cervix using metal rods. Opening the cervix may be painful, so local or general anesthesia is typically needed. After the cervix is stretched open, the doctor inserts a hard plastic tube into the uterus, and then connects this tube to a suction machine. The suction pulls the fetus&#39; body apart and out of the uterus. The doctor may also use a loop-shaped knife called a curette to scrape the fetus and fetal parts out of the uterus. (The doctor may refer to the fetus and fetal parts as the &ldquo;products of conception.&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Abortion is not just a simple procedure; it may have many side effects.

That&#39;s over 4000 per day, and nearly three per minute!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ninety-three percent of the abortions in America are for convenience. The mother&#39;s health is an issue only three percent of the time, and the baby&#39;s health is an issue only three percent of the time. Rape or incest are issues only one percent of the time. Ninety-three percent of all abortions in America are performed just because someone doesn&#39;t want a child!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are four basic types of abortion being performed in America today, while two more types may be added in the near future.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First, there&#39;s the </span><span class="cs31B015EA">suction type </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">abortion. This is where the unborn child is literally vacuumed from the mother&#39;s womb during the early stages of pregnancy.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The </span><span class="cs31B015EA">currette-type</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> abortion is where the child is cut from the mother&#39;s womb with a spoon-like object.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A third type is similar to a </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Caesarean operation.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The baby is surgically removed from the mother and allowed to suffocate, because the child&#39;s lungs aren&#39;t developed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The fourth type of abortion is the </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Salt Brine</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> technique. With this method, the unborn child is literally &quot;pickled&quot; to death by the injection of a strong salt solution. A few days after the injection the child is still born.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is currently much debate about </span><span class="csC382D2BB">partial-birth</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> abortions. This is where a child is partially delivered, then stabbed in the skull to have his or her brains sucked out. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is also much talk about the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">RU-486</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> abortion pill from France, also called &quot;mifepristione&quot; in America. This pill works by inhibiting pregnancy hormones, and is normally used within seven weeks from conception. At the present time, mifepristone is illegal in the U.S., but there is much political pressure to make it legal.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs2C025596">Abortion Is An Act of Murder</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In reference to pregnant women, the term &quot;with child&quot; occurs twenty-six times in the Bible. The term &quot;with fetus&quot; never occurs once. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In Luke chapter one, verses 36 and 41, we are told that Elisabeth conceived a &quot;son&quot; and that the &quot;babe&quot; leaped in her womb. God does not say that a &quot;fetus&quot; leaped in her womb! He says THE BABE leaped. This is the exact same word that God uses to describe Christ in the manger AFTER He is born (Luke 2:12, 16). In God eyes, an unborn babe and a newborn babe are the same. They are both living human beings!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Dear reader, please answer a question: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">What is an &quot;infant?&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Get the answer in your mind and keep it there for a moment. Do you have it? Okay, please consider Job 3:16: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.&quot; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Did you see that? Job referred to unborn children as INFANTS. Not fetuses! Not masses of tissue! INFANTS! In God&#39;s eyes, an unborn child is a living human baby. God never says once that an unborn child is anything less than a human being.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">David said in Psalm 51:5, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> He did not say that a fetus was shapen in iniquity and conceived in iniquity. David, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, said that HE was conceived. David, not a blob of tissue, was conceived.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The same is the case in Psalm 139:13-16:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother&#39;s womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Who was in the womb? David! A literal and living person. The Bible never uses anything less than human terms to describe the unborn.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Notice that in Jeremiah 1:5 we are told that God KNEW Jeremiah:</span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To further confirm the fact that God views the unborn child as a person, please consider Exodus 21:22-23:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman&#39;s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If the woman has a premature birth and the child lives (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;no mischief follows&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), then there&#39;s no death penalty. However, if the child dies (or the woman dies) God says the death penalty applies: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;thou shalt give life for life.&quot; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Why would God require the death penalty if He didn&#39;t consider the unborn child to be a human being?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Friend, like it or not, God says that life begins at conception, and the unborn child is a human being.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But the Bible isn&#39;t alone in declaring this truth. Science also declares that an unborn child is just as much an independent human being as you. The original human cell consists of 46 chromosomes, 23 from each parent. At no point during pregnancy does the mother contribute any new cells to the child. The original cell divides itself and multiplies to provide development and growth for the child. Scientifically speaking, the child is just as independent at six months before birth as he will be six months after birth.</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yes, the mother does provide nourishment to the unborn child, but she also provides nourishment to the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">newborn</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> child!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At two weeks pregnancy, the &quot;fetus&quot; can move alone. By four weeks the child has limbs, muscle tissue, a heart and heartbeat. Ears, eyes, and small hands are visible by the fifth week. The child responds to touch sensations by the sixth or seventh week. At eight weeks, the baby sometimes tries to take a breath when removed from the mother. At twelve weeks, the child will often struggle for life two or three hours when removed from the mother. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Friend, abortion is wrong because abortion is MURDER!</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Involves the Shedding of Innocent Blood</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Proverbs 6:16-17 says that God HATES those who shed innocent blood! Deuteronomy 27:25 says, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Who could possibly be more innocent than an unborn baby?! Yet, our society has become so wicked that it condones the slaying of 1.5 million innocent children every year. The Bible says that God HATES people who do this.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Is A Violation of the Golden Rule</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In Matthew 7:12, the Lord Jesus Christ said, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Would it be your desire to suffer and die while someone traps you in a cage and literally tears your arms and legs from your body? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Abortion is a violation of the golden rule.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Attempts To Destroy A Work of God</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.&quot; (Ecc. 3:14)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God is eternal, so His work is also eternal. Abortion is an attempt to do away with unwanted people--an attempt to make a liar out of God by bringing an end to His work. However, Jesus said you can destroy a person&#39;s BODY, but not their SOUL (Mat. 10:28). Parent, if you&#39;ve had an abortion, your aborted child is in Heaven right now, because you only destroyed the body!</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Often Brings Shame, Heartache, and Deep Regret</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">After his sin with Bathsheba, King David confessed these words to God: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.&quot; (Psa. 51:3)</span><span class="csA7555675"> David was living under constant conviction and regret for what he had done. He couldn&#39;t get away from it! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Most women who decide to have an abortion spend the rest of their lives regretting it. Are you thinking about an abortion? I challenge you to visit with some woman who have had abortions. Ask them if they would do it again. Ask them if they have any regrets.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the book,</span><span class="csD5FB87F7"> The Christian and Social Issues</span><span class="csA7555675">, by Tom Wallace, a reference is made to a full page Washington Post ad, dated June 13, 1983. A lady who had undergone a saline abortion six months earlier describes the mental torments that she now suffers every day. She speaks of her </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;...everyday hell of never hearing a baby cry without crying within myself; counting days to see how old the baby would have been; wondering what contributions my baby would have made to our desperate society; and wondering if there will ever be another chance for motherhood.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Of the abortion itself, the lady recalls, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;...sitting in a crowded waiting room studying each others fearful, anxious faces...signing death certificates for what is very much alive within you...seeing crying women given tranquilizers and sent home to recuperate and try to forget.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Abortion is wrong because it brings shame, heartache, and deep regret.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Disannuls A Plan of God</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If God allows a child to be conceived, then God obviously has a plan for that child. Mary&#39;s parents didn&#39;t know that she&#39;d give birth to the Savior of the world, but she did. God has a plan for unborn children (Jer. 1:5; Lk. 1:13-17; Gen. 4:25; Jud. 13:3-5), so to abort an unborn child is to stop a plan of God.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion De-values Human Life</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God created man to be the highest form of life on earth (Gen. 1:26-28). Human life is very precious to God. In fact, it is so precious that God Himself instituted the Death Penalty for anyone who takes the life of another (Exo. 21:12; Num. 35). God places great value on human life!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">However, abortion promotes the message that life is NOT so valuable, and that man can do as he pleases with it. How long will it be before our nation decides that the killing of elderly people and sick people is justifiable? Why stop there? How long will it be before it becomes lawful to kill Bible believers who refuse to conform to the world system? It won&#39;t be as long as you may think (Rev. 13:16-18; Rev. 20:4). Abortion devalues human life, and it pushes our nation a step closer to that wicked day when it becomes lawful to murder innocent people. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Shows A Lack of Natural Affection</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Paul tells us in 2 Timothy 3:3 that the last days will be characterized by people who lack &quot;natural affection.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe the pro-abortion movement is a perfect example of this. It is NATURAL to conceive a child, grow to love that child, take care of the child during pregnancy, give birth to the child, and then raise the child with the best care possible. That&#39;s the natural process that God has ordained. It is NOT natural to kill the child! To commit such an act is to show a lack of natural affection, which is sin.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Encourages Sin</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.&quot; (Ecc. 8:11)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ec 8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;(KJV)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Why will 1,500,000 women have abortions this year? Largely because it has become popular. It is no longer illegal, and it is no longer considered a shameful sin by our society. Every time a woman has an abortion she helps society to become more comfortable with it. She&#39;s advertising it! By her example, she&#39;s encouraging others to commit the same sin, and other sins as well. The convenience of abortion will only lead to an increase of other sins such as adultery and fornication. Friend, abortion is wrong because abortion encourages sin!</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csEF6939E5">Abortion Shows A Lack of Faith</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 14:23 says, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;...for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&quot; </span><span class="csA7555675">Hebrews 11:6 tells us that without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">To have an abortion is to take matters into your own hands, rather than to trust God to work things out. This shows a lack of faith in God, which the Bible labels as SIN.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A desperate woman says, &quot;I can&#39;t afford to have a child. I&#39;m not ready for this.&quot; Lady, you need to start trusting God and claiming His promises. You need to STOP trying to run your own life for a change and START trusting God. You don&#39;t need an abortion, for such will only INCREASE your troubles. The devil has you thinking that abortion is the answer, that it will take care of everything, and you&#39;re very close to giving in to his subtle temptation. If you do, you&#39;ll regret it forever, and God will hold you accountable! Why not turn your life over to the Lord Jesus Christ right now?

By receiving Him as your Savior, you can be WASHED from all your sins in His precious Blood (Rev. 1:5; Col. 1:14; Acts 20:28; I Pet. 1:18-19).
