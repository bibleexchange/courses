From here there is a lot you can and must do to break porn addiction for good and these 5 steps will be a good place to start.</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="csF1DADE03">1. Out of Sight, Out of Mind</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="cs8148B463">The most obvious <a class="csF8BC42EA" href="http://helpforbreakingpornaddiction.com/overcoming-addiction-to-porn-by-understanding-triggers/"><span class="cs34CEA3D8">trigger</span></a></span><span class="cs8148B463"> of porn addiction craving is of course seeing pornography. By making sure that you have absolutely no porn on your computer or in your house you will be able to avoid accidentally stumbling upon any porn. This is quite important also psychologically; the very act of <a class="csF8BC42EA" href="http://www.cyberscrub.com/"><span class="cs9FF1B611">deleting all of this porn</span></a></span><span class="cs8148B463"> and throwing it out is a way to cement in your mind a form of first step commitment. If you do not do this you are not ready to stop your porn addiction &ndash; simple as that, just like a smoker refusing to throw away his last packet of cigarettes. They are lying to themselves too.</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="csF1DADE03">2. Reduce Temptation</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="cs8148B463">Even with all of your porn gone, you can always find more online right. Sometimes it is hard NOT to find porn online and a stray click can bring you undone. This is why I recommend a porn blocker on your computer. If you can get someone else to set the password for it &ndash; even better. But if not, that fine, just having it there will reduce the temptation.</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="csF1DADE03">3. Create New Healthier Habits</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="cs8148B463">The time you used to spend on porn MUST be replaced with something positive and healthy. If you leave this time empty you will default back to your original behaviour. Instead you need to have a plan on how to deal with this time. A hobby, exercise, whatever it takes &ndash; you have to fill this time with distraction and fulfilment. The more of a natural healthy buzz you get from this activity the faster it will become a default behaviour that will break your addiction to pornography.</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="csF1DADE03">4. Reward Yourself</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="cs8148B463">One more way you can get </span><span class="csB6E43327">self help for porn addiction</span><span class="cs8148B463"> is to give yourself some positive reinforcement along the way. Make sure to reward yourself for some milestones you set yourself for not using porn. This should never BE porn of course, but something as simple as a nice meal, a trip somewhere, or buying yourself sometime nice and linking that to your success is a good idea.</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="csF1DADE03">5. Enlist Help for Porn Addiction</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="cs8148B463">Getting help for an addiction to pornography is not as easy as it sounds as you are probably aware. This is a very secret addiction for many, and that makes it a lot harder to break than something like smoking where giving up comes with many well wishers and others trying to do the same often. Porn is a secret addiction and shame to many, but some help for breaking pornography addiction is needed to really get you over the line.</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="cs8148B463">One way is to enlist the help of another. Your wife or girlfriend even though that might be an incredibly difficult conversation. If you are a part of a church, your local minister or religious leader is a good person to talk to &ndash; they know more of this than you might think and are usually very helpful and empathic to your plight. If you have a close friend you are comfortable with talking about this with then this is another place. However, most people addicted to porn simply cannot get this sort of help.</span></p><p class="csCC42752"><span class="cs8148B463">In this case there is a lot of help you can find online. There are a number of downloadable e-books you can get which can help with this task. Some I read were not great, but some others were incredibly helpful such as <a class="csF8BC42EA" href="http://7b72b77u85b2isb3s3t6z7vywc.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=HELPFORB"><span class="cs7CA37CB9">Stop Porn Addiction Now</span></a></span><span class="cs8148B463"> which I found to be very insightful.

Pornography has been described as anti-love. It contributes to the view that other person as are sex objects for our exploitation. Sex with a partner, ideally, is two-sided, both partners receiving satisfaction in not just a physical act, but an emotional exchange and bond. The permanent bond of marriage provides a healthy emotional commitment that better facilitates emotionally satisfying sexual relations. </span></p><p class="cs1A892C10"><span class="cs4A756D3B">This is not to say that all married persons have satisfying sexual relations, but that the more stable relationship of marriage can provide an arrangement whereby the emotional element of sex, which is very significant, finds greater fulfillment for both partners. </span></p><p class="cs4A4B591"><span class="cs4A756D3B">Because pornography is one-sided, only one person receiving satisfaction, the emotional exchange is lacking and that can lead to a void, afterwards, as pornography viewing is usually accompanied by <a class="cs790D7D8D" href="http://winmentalhealth.com/depression_and_sexuality.php"><span class="cs21F1A020">masturbation</span></a></span><span class="cs4A756D3B">, when viewed alone.
