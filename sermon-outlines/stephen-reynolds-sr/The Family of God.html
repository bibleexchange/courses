This life is not permanent; the life to come is. Church is not just something we do on Sunday. It is who we are. Church is the permanent family; it is the eternal family; it is taking shape right in front of us. Our family relations are temporary, and they are all for this world. At one level, they serve for the good ordering of society. In God&rsquo;s wisdom, the family unit is the foundation of civilization. More than that, our families are analogous of the gospel. The problem comes when the type supplants the reality. <br/><br/>I have two fears. One fear is that someone will hear me say that families don&rsquo;t matter. We should neglect them. Not so. The temporary nature of these relationships is a powerful reminder that if we are to enjoy the fulfillment of them in eternity, we must view them rightly here and now. <br/><br/>A second fear is that when I say family people who are single won&rsquo;t hear or they will think their lives lack a powerful analogy of the gospel. Not so. Your lives even more clearly, more directly picture union with Christ.</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">Mr 10:29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel&#39;s,</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">Lu 9:57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</span></p><p class="cs58C3AB3E"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;59 And he said unto another, Follow me.

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E"><br/>Your marriage is an analogy of the gospel. It points to something beyond itself. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">Think often of the temporary nature of marriage and fatherhood. Such thoughts do not lead to neglect wife, children, or grandchildren. They do, aid in being rightly related to wife, children, and grandchildren. We must think of the ultimate meaning of our lives and work from the type toward the reality. <br/><br/>We cannot make our children the center of the world and lead them to Christ. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">We cannot lead them to One whom they feel is not as important as they. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">If you save your family, you will lose it. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">If you lose your family for Jesus&rsquo;s sake and the gospel, you will find it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">Mt 10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">Mt 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. <br/><br/>When we try to exalt marriage and family as ultimate, we bring all kinds of dis-function into it. Our children need to see the all-surpassing greatness of Christ in our lives and be gripped by an overwhelming vision of His majesty. <br/><br/>When our lives are ordered for God&rsquo;s glory and the good of the church and our children ask, Why?, we can tell them of the greatness of Jesus and the freeness of the gospel and how we love Christ more than anything and we will do whatever he directs us to do.<br/><br/>There is good news. It could be that you have been abandoned by your husband or your wife or your father or your children. These relationships are not ultimate. Christ is a loving husband, God is a faithful Father, the church is a permanent family. Give yourselves to these things.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4090733E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
