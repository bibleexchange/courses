<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TITLE: God Making Us a Blessing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TEXT: Micah 5:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Academy Engraved LET"'>INTRODUCTION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Micah means ‘who
is a God like our God?’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>God wants to make
us a blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>This book was written during a time of Israel’s
captivity because of their sin. Yet, God is reaching out to a remnant. V.3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>He is dealing
with a people with quick ears and quick hearts to respond to the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>v. 7,8 There are
some that will know the power and grace of God who will be strong and mighty.
‘they that know their God shall be mighty and do exploits.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>If anything else
substitutes the life of Christ then you will be miserable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>As the ship’s
sail is set in the midst of contrary winds and directs the ship to the desired
destination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Micah 4:1-2
Before the tribulation hour there is going to be a people that will know God
and see His mercy in His fullness. God’s grace is sufficient in all things. He
is going to make us a blessing when we realize that our sufficiency is in God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>God wants to do
something in our spirit to change us completely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>I appreciate the
message of the Overcoming Life and along with that message over and over again
has come the charge of the Holy Ghost. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>There is going to
be a remnant of people that have heard truth and will not come to full
experience until after 3.5 years of the tribulation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>God’s power, its
undefeated, unchanging, unrelenting. I am challenged tonight to see beyond what
we feel. There are things that go through our emotions to stab us like a sword
and it comes like a fiery dart. The Holy Ghost warns us to be on guard to ward
off all the fiery darts of the enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>People are always
trying to shoot down and explain away the Christian life because they don’t
understand it. The thoughts that are coming from my mind are not to be trusted,
are not to go by. In the midst of true repentance is a peace and safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>There are times
when a certain thought would come to my mind, but the Holy Ghost checked me on
it and I am glad I didn’t say it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>We don’t receive
council from the world or those that speak from the top of their head. We seek
counsel from those that seek God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>The dew from
heaven is given to water the heart. If the seed is the Word of God, it doesn’t
matter what the circumstances are, the word of God always brings life. When we
stop going by our own thinking, that is true repentance. I need dew to fall
from Heaven, I need the grace of God. True repentance will cause me to
acknowledge my need of the grace of God. You will not gain anything from God
until you believe Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>“how can that
many people be wrong” people say looking at the numbers who side against the
truth and the strait and narrow. Look at the cross. How many were wrong in that
scene?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Micah 4:7 I will
make her that halteth a remnant. Have you ever felt like you couldn’t make it
one more step? Micah 5:3,7,8 God is looking for a remnant that he can feed and
replenish and restore and make them strong that they can destroy the works of
the devil out of their life and out of the lives of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>It was because of
Israel’s unbelief and their refusing to receive and therefore they were cast
far off. Even though the heart of man rejected the things of God, God reaches
deep and far off to that which is desperate, destroyed, halt, and He draws them
and says I WILL MAKE THEM. It doesn’t matter how far off a person gets, the
grace of god is able to reach out and bring them back. You can’t be cast off
too far that He won’t have mercy. You can be brought back, you can be
delivered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>God is able to make
us strong that we don’t have to be cast off—He can keep us. I Peter 1:5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Micah 4:2 LET US
GO UP…Let us not wait (Rev. 12:4) until tribulation comes upon us. Our God is
able to keep us, let us depend on Him. Stop doing it my way. Stop thinking my
thoughts, and say LET US GO UP…AND HE WILL TEACH US HIS WAYS. I love truth. I
need truth. I remember years ago, reaching out to a certain individual
concerning the Bride of Christ, 15 years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>I don’t want to
learn by a rod, but by a yielded heart. True repentance is only the first step.
It takes that step of faith that reaches out and receives from God. Take us by
the hand and teach us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Teach= bring us
into training; chastening; correction. His commandments and chastening are not
grievous to us. Once you see the principle of life working in our hearts—God is
Holy I will be Holy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Jesus cares about
you. David was in a wilderness period and cried out, “No one cares fro my
soul.” God cares and God delivers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Let Him teach you
His ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>And we will walk
in His paths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Micah 7:20 Thou
wilt perform the truth to Jacob. God gives us insight. True repentance is when
we obey the Word. Repentance will cause us to feel our need for mercy, grace,
the showers of Heaven. It isn’t just going to come upon us, we must prepare for
it. The dew tomorrow morning will fall everywhere, but rust will follow if
things are not taken care of. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Faith is what
receives strength in the TIME OF THE BATTLE. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Abraham believed
God, and God didn’t just reward Abraham’s faith. God rewarded Abraham’s faith
IN GOD. The key was the connection between Abraham’s faith and God—a lifeline. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Others have a
loud voice saying the giants are too big. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>God will show us
His ways, but we have got to want it. </p>
