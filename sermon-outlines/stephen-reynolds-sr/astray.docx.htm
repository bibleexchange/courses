<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sheep is not attached enough to the shepherd or to the other sheep. There is
not the bond or union there should be. Therefore, he stays off by himself,
eating and resting and working alone until eventually he wanders off without
anyone knowing it, including himself (</span><a

wilderness. The wilderness had an excitement about it. The unknown and the risk
aroused the emotions, but once the sheep ventured out into the wilderness, he
found its terrain rugged, full of narrow ridges and deep ravines and crevices.
It was rough going, heavy with thick underbrush, pricking thorns, dangerous
footing; and, if the way out was never found, it would sap the sheep's strength
and age him ever so rapidly. Eventually the wilderness would take its life.</span></p>

was the one that needed to be sought. It was this sheep that needed the
attention of the shepherd and was to occupy the time, energy, and effort of the
shepherd. As long as the sheep was lost, seeking it was the primary purpose and
reason for the shepherd. (What a lesson for the church and ministers!)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

commitment to seeking the lost.</span></p>

hours and the tediousness of running into dead end after dead end. He sought
