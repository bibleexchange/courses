This assurance, this reliance on God&#39;s Word, this confidence is Faith</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csA521DC07">Faith is strengthened through trial</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Faith has to do with the Word of God. It is not impressions, strong or weak, We have to do with the written Word and not ourselves or our impressions.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD3860DFD">Probabilities Are Not To Be Taken Into Account.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Many people are willing to believe regarding those things that seem probable to them. Faith has nothing to do with probabilities. The province of FAITH begins where probabilities cease and sight and sense fail. A great many of God&#39;s children are cast down and lament their want of Faith. They say that they have no impressions, no feeling, they see no probability that the thing they wish will come to pass. Appearances Are Not To Be Taken Into Account. The question is, whether God has spoken it in His Word</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Look at the promise and do not look at the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the Promiser not at the troubler.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Trials before victory, Exercise of faith in hard times for patience, to be willing to take trials from God&#39;s hand as a means. Trials, obstacles, difficulties, and personal defeats, are the very provisions for great Faith.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Is the thing you want in accordance with His Word?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Is the Word alive in you by believing or are you empty by doubting.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">As we ask to have our Faith strengthened, we must be willing to take from God&#39;s hand the means for strengthening it. We must allow Him to educate us through trials and bereavements and troubles. It is through trials that Faith is exercised and developed more and more. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">God affectionately permits difficulties, that He may develop unceasingly that which He is willing to do for us, and to this end we should not shrink, but if He gives us sorrow and hindrances and losses and afflictions, we should take them out of His hands as evidences of His love and care for us in developing more and more that Faith which He is seeking to strengthen in us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Matthew 6:25-34</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Take God at His Word</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Through the fire in our weakness the holy Ghost will strengthen us &nbsp;inside and make us strong in his might.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Eph 3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
