<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: The Totally Yielded Life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Philippians 2:1-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foundational work is done under the ground. A lot of work in
preparation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>vv.1-4 We are at a decision point. A decision time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This context deals with a total yielded life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can’t take these promises and make them work. You must
come to the end of yourself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The yielded life is useful. As we surrender, God can
operate, and we can act in response to what God has done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of myself other become more important to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>vv.5-11 The supreme example of yielding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            v.6 thought it not <i>robbery</i>—something to
grasp for. Not taking something that didn’t belong to him, but it was HIS. In
eternity past, Jesus had the fullness of power, but laid it aside. As Jesus the
man he was a fully surrendered yielding himself ot the father. You cannot reach
the things in God by ‘reaching after’ but by God’s doing. Striving has its
place, but not until you have yielded yourself to the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can’t do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These promises come as we yield to Him and do what He says. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He did not grasp at something to make it his, but was
honored and ordained by the Father. He gave up everything and yielded it all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>vv.12-16a A challenge bringing us to a decision point. A
message to learn of the completely surrendered life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.14 this verse is not randomly placed here, but is part of
the test. “Do all things without murmurings and disputings:” This is the very
thing that you will fight with in your flesh until you are totally yielded. NO
SELFISHNESS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If God has said something that is what is going to help us
and not paying attention to the voices of opposition.</p>
