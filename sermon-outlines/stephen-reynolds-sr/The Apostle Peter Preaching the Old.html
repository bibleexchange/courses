but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ac 3:12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ac 4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem;
