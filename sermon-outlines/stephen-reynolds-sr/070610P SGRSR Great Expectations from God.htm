<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Great Expectations from God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Proverbs 3:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dropping of the dew</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No move of God will come without prayer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Acts 3:5</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something
of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were head to pray and the Lord set up so a man in need
could get some help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>ACTS 3:6-8</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with
them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at
that which had happened unto him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No physical problem is too hard for God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Exodus 6:6 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD,
and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will
rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm,
and with great judgments:</p>
