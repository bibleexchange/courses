Reynolds, Sr.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">							 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 3, 2005 </span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sunday School</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Title: The Shepherd&#39;s Voice</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Text: John 10:14-16</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">INTRODUCTION</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a Good Shepherd and a Path of Life. We are never alone. There is a purpose for every test. We must understand from the Word what we are doing so that we are never in the dark. If you don&#39;t have Jesus in you you are no light to the World. He is the Shepherd of life. He leads us into pastures of life. If we are simply &quot;just making it&quot; there is something wrong. God has somethings in store for His people and He is no respecter of persons. Let us desire to know the Life of Christ and follow Him every step of the way.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Romans 2:11--God has given us insight, but just because we have recieved a revelation of truth does not mean we have a &quot;special&quot; position with God. We must KNOW God and OBEY Him. The Jews boasted in that to them was committed the law by God, but Paul exhorted that all men were given the law in their conscience. There is no many ways to eternal life, but ONE way.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is something lacking in each of us, but we have a Good Shepherd in Whom is no lack. &quot;You will fail yourself and those around you.&quot; Jesus will NEVER fail you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John 10:1-6 &nbsp;v.1 Judas had been called out by Jesus to be His disciple, and yet he became a thief. <br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God has given to us and we too often don&#39;t share as we should and if that is so we will lose it. People have lost things by the thief and they become hard and hold grudges.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Barabbas was a robber. Took advantage of people. Low, mean, would take a person&#39;s life in his stealing.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">v.6--they did not understand nor recieve the first 5 verses.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The pope died with a false hope. (1/6 of the world follow him and the path he took.) We must make sure the life of Jesus is working in our heart for that life is the light of the world. His Word in us in life and a light to the world.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a thief around! He doesn&#39;t just steal but robs, kills, and destroys. He is trying to destroy our faith. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People must see Jesus. Your words are not enought, &quot;I am a Christian.&quot; They MUST SEE JESUS IN YOU. Not just willing to give but GIVING.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Divide. Destroy. Is the goal of the theif. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Know, believe, obey, and give yourself to truth. and the thief won&#39;t be able to hinder us.<br/></span></p></body>
