The first is His office of omnipresence and the following six are now listed in what I perceive as their order. The Spirit of Restraint is that great limitation on evil, which keeps Satan and all darkness on a leash. He is both the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Revelation. He is the Spirit of Conviction of all sin, righteousness, and judgment to come. He is the Spirit of Grace that converts and frees man of sin and evil control. He is the Spirit of Preservation that seals the soul that He has converted to righteousness and sustains them until the glorious hour of perfection. To search those offices of the Holy Spirit and to recognize the divine intent of each is to walk in the meadows of majesty. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The early church was deeply rooted in the meat of the Word. Because of such depth, they turned their world upside down. The awakening that followed on the heels of Pentecost has never been matched. The Holy Ghost created a church world that touched millions without one modern means of communication. They were possessed of the Spirit and needed nothing else. The office of Christ&quot;s Spirit, which came to be called the Holy Ghost, was the vicar of Jesus Christ in His every expression. When Jesus Christ is glorified as the Spirit glorified Him in the early church, nothing can stop the saints, not even the gates of hell. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">May every Saint of God begin a fresh &quot;coveting&quot; of the sweet Holy Spirit. His power in us is supernatural and will begin to affect both ourselves and all under our influence. &quot;And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Isaiah%2010.27" target="_blank"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Isaiah 10:27</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Our world lieth in the wicked one and his powers are only broken by the power of the Holy Spirit in us.

The powers of evil must be broken and then we can destroy the effects that Satan is manifesting in the multitudes. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
