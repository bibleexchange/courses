God gave the law to Moses and Moses in turn instructed Joshua (Paul to Timothy). Joshua didn&#39;t look for a new message for his generation but dedicated himself to the cause of an eternal one. Gods commands just as his promises transcend time. The intent with which Christ gave his Word to the apostles is the identical intent with which He anoints his Word today. The Gospel message has not evolved or changed since His Word was settled in Heaven.</span></p><p class="cs28DC752B"><span class="csA7555675">Joshuas record in chapter 12 of 31 wins 0 losses was the results of his courage to keep and&nbsp;obey&nbsp;a commission given to Moses. To Joshua Moses&#39; call was in a way his call and Moses commands his commands and also Moses&#39; blessing was also available to him but only if he walked the path that Moses did. In Joshua&#39;s career he did things unique to his own individual calling that Moses never did, but </span><span class="cs79659084">he&nbsp;did not leave off a single command that was given to Moses</span><span class="csA7555675">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Obedience is the key to victory for God&#39;s people. Again, obedience is stressed: the Lord had commanded Moses, and Moses had commanded Joshua. What God commanded through His servant Moses, Joshua did. The emphasis is clear: he left nothing undone. He did exactly what God commanded.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">Complete</span><span class="csA7555675"> victory is the result of implicit obedience.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Joshua 11:9 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span><span class="csA7555675">It did not mean that God kept the Canaanites from being saved, but He kept Israel from making peace with the Cananites who had evil, unrepentant hearts that would in time corrupt God&#39;s people. Rahab and the Gibeonites show that the Canaanites could have been saved if they had been willing to repent. For centuries the Canaanites had given themselves over to evil, to total rejection of God. Their hearts as a people became hard, grew more and more stubborn. Their hearts grew beyond repentance, beyond any desire or will to ever be saved. So the judgment of God was to be executed upon them as a sign of what will take place in the last days.</span></p><p class="cs28DC752B"><span class="csA7555675">Ex. 17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</span></p><p class="cs28DC752B"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;2John 1:9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.

They want to be &nbsp;recognized and approved so they try to impress people and go beyond Christ and what He has taught. They twist or break off from or remove from the teachings of Christ. John warns against a person that does not stay in the teachings of Christ, he does not have God. He is not saved; he is not truly born of God. The only person who is born of God is the person who stays in the teachings of Christ. This does not mean that believers are not to be creative and thoughtful. It means: we must not move away from or beyond what Christ taught.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
