		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew16_21"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">21. From that time forth began.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Jesus began to give obscure intimations concerning his death at a very early period of his ministry. Two of these are quoted by John as having been uttered during his first visit to Jerusalem (John 2:19-22; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+3%3A14"><span class="csE2DF19C1">3:14</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">); one is quoted by Matthew in his reply to the demand for a sign (12:38-40); but none of these was understood at the time by either friend or foe. He had wisely postponed a plain declaration on the subject until the faith of the disciples had taken the definite shape just indicated by Peter&#39;s confession (verse 16), and had acquired sufficient strength to endure the shock which this announcement gave.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew16_22"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">22. Peter took him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The conduct of Peter in taking Jesus aside and rebuking him, shows how severe was the shock which the disciples received from this announcement. Peter seems to have dreaded its effect on the other disciples, as well as on the world; for he thought that such a termination of the -career of Jesus would prove that he was not the Christ. In this Peter exemplified the common weakness of human judgment in spiritual matters, and the proneness of men, through a misguided judgment, to fight against their own best interests.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew16_23"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">23. behind me, Satan.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Peter received a severer rebuke than he administered. It was impossible to serve Satan more effectually than by dissuading Jesus from the death of which he had spoken; hence the metaphorical application of Satan&#39;s name to Peter. The vehemence with which Jesus spoke is also accounted for by the fact that he instinctively shrank from the dreaded sacrifice, and needed encouragement in regard to it instead of dissuasion.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">savorest not.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Obsolete for &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">thinkest</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> not.&quot; Mr. Green happily renders the clause, &quot;Thy mind is not on the things of God, but those of men.&quot; His mind was on the worldly conception of the Messiah&#39;s kingdom which had been adopted by men, and not on that conception of it which was in the mind and word of God.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">

The latter expression came into use from the fact that criminals who were to be crucified carried their own crosses to the place of execution. Peter had objected, as recorded in the preceding paragraph, to the contemplated death of Jesus, and now he and his fellows are taught that not only must this be endured, but they must themselves take up the cross and follow his example; and so must all who would be his followers.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew16_25"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">25. save his life shall lose it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;In this verse there is a play on the two meanings of the word life, temporal and eternal.

There the sense requires it to be rendered </span><span class="csC382D2BB">life,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and as its meaning in this verse is the same, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">life</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> should be the rendering here. The sense, however, is the same as when rendered </span><span class="csC382D2BB">soul</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; for it is the future and eternal life that is referred to, and to lose this is what our translators meant by losing the soul. The solemn truth here declared was most appropriate in this connection, because Peter&#39;s opposition to his Lord&#39;s death was inspired chiefly by his expectation that the latter would establish an earthly kingdom and conquer the whole world. He is taught that something far more valuable than the whole world is to be gained by following Christ, even though it should involve the loss of life.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew16_27"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">27. For the Son of man shall come.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The fact here declared furnishes proof of the preceding remarks concerning the loss and gain of life. If men are to be finally rewarded according to their works, all the preceding remarks must be true. That the final coming of Christ is the coming here mentioned is evident from the three facts, that it is a coming &quot;in the glory of his Father;&quot; it is to be &quot;with his holy angels; &quot;and he is then to &quot;reward every man according to his works.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew16_28"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">28. coming in his kingdom.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The coming to judge the world naturally suggested the mention of another coming which was nearer at hand, and which also had an important connection with the preceding conversation. If he were destined to die at the hands of his enemies, as stated in the preceding paragraph, it would appear to his disciples that he must fail to establish the expected kingdom; but he assures them that notwithstanding his contemplated death, some of the present company would not taste of death till they would see him coming in his kingdom. The expression &quot;coming in his kingdom&quot; means entering formally upon his reign as a king, which occurred when his exaltation to the right hand of God was first proclaimed on the day of Pentecost, and which they then saw by the eye of faith. (See Acts 2:33-36; also my Commentary on Acts, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ac+1%3A6"><span class="csE2DF19C1">1:6</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.) None but himself and Judas were to die previous to that time; but he intended to be indefinite about the time, and hence the very vague expression, &quot;There be some standing here who shall not taste of death till they see,&quot; etc.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some expositors understand that the coming here mentioned took place at the transfiguration. But that event took place only </span><span class="csC382D2BB">six days</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> afterward (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+17%3A1"><span class="csE2DF19C1">17:1</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">); none of the company tasted death before its occurrence; and Jesus was then no more in his kingdom than at the time of our paragraph. Others, again, refer it to the destruction of Jerusalem; but he came in his kingdom long before this event, and had already been seen in his kingdom as clearly as when that event occurred. (For a statement of these and other opinions, see Lange on this verse.)</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">
			<span class="csC57700C4">The Transfiguration, 17:1-13. (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_1"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. after six days.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Six days after the time of the conversation last mentioned.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Peter, James, and John.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;There were two objects to be considered in selecting witnesses of the transfiguration; first, to insure the desired secrecy (verse 9); and second, to insure from the event itself the best final results. On account of the preeminence which these three apostles now had and were yet to acquire, they were the most likely to turn to good account the impression which the scene would make on themselves, and they were probably the most likely to keep the event a secret until the time should come for making it known. The present increase of their faith would also bring an indirect advantage to the entire company, even though the others knew not what had caused it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">into a high mountain.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The scene of the transfiguration was formerly supposed to be Mt. Tabor, a very beautiful conical mountain west of the lake of Galilee; but as Jesus was on his tour to C&aelig;sarea Philippi, which town was situated at the base of Mt. Hermon, it is now generally believed that the latter is the mountain mentioned in the text. Moreover, Mt. Hermon better corresponds to the designation &quot;a high mountain;&quot; for it is the highest mountain in Palestine, being about 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. Its top is covered with almost perpetual snow, and is visible from high points in all parts of Galilee and Judea. Some lofty terrace on its side would have been in every way a suitable spot for the transfiguration.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_2"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. transfigured before him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Transfigured</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> means </span><span class="csC382D2BB">changed in form</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, yet the description indicates only a change in the appearance of his person. Though &quot;his face did shine as the sun,&quot; we suppose that the features maintained their natural form; and though &quot;his raiment was white as light&quot;&mdash;that is, light reflected from some polished surface&mdash;we suppose it was unchanged in other particulars. It is impossible for us to realize his appearance until we shall be like him and see him as he is. (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Jn+3%3A2"><span class="csE2DF19C1">1 John 3:2</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_3"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. Moses and Elias talking.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;It must have been from the course of the conversation that the disciples learned that the visitors were Moses and Elias; for they could not have known them by sight. They talked, as we learn from Luke, about his decease, which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_4"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. Then answered Peter.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;There was a divine attraction in the scene, a foretaste of heaven&#39;s own glory, and no wonder that Peter exclaimed. &quot;It is good for us to be here.&quot; But his proposition to build tabernacles (</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&sigma;&kappa;ή&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, booths made out of branches from the trees) for the three glorified persons to dwell in, was hasty and inconsiderate. The best excuse for it is the one given by Mark: &quot;He knew not what he should say: for they were frightened.&quot; It shows that men in the flesh are not pro pared to judge of the fitness of things in the spiritual world. In all probability many of our most cherished conceptions of that world are as incongruous as that of the frightened Peter.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_15"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">5, 6. While he yet spake.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The scene had been witnessed long enough by the disciples, and it was abruptly terminated by the introduction of another. The entire transaction, as we may safely infer from Luke&#39;s narrative, occurred in the night. (Notice, that Jesus had been praying until the disciples were &quot;heavy with sleep;&quot; and that they came down from the mountain &quot;on the next day.&quot; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lk+9%3A28"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Luke 9:28</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lk+9%3A32"><span class="csE2DF19C1">32</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lk+9%3A37"><span class="csE2DF19C1">37</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.) Out of the womb of darkness had suddenly appeared the three glowing forms of Jesus, Moses, and Elijah, and now, while the disciples were trembling at that sight, there floats near to them out of the same darkness a cloud all radiant with light like that which shone from the face of Jesus, and as it begins to overhang them, they hear that voice which has never yet been heard by mortals except with fear and trembling. It came just as Peter&#39;s incongruous proposal had escaped his lips, and it is no wonder that the three fishermen &quot;fell on their faces and were sure afraid.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This is my beloved Son.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The words uttered are a repetition of the oracle which was heard at the Jordan (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+3%3A17"><span class="csE2DF19C1">3:17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), with the addition of the significant words, &quot;Hear him.&quot; This command contains the chief significance of the entire scene. Uttered in the presence of Moses the lawgiver, and of Elijah the prophet, it meant that Jesus should be heard in preference to the law and the prophets. In the exalted preeminence thus bestowed on Jesus, accompanied by a change of his appearance harmonious with the glory of his position, his divine majesty was displayed in a manner never witnessed on earth before or since. Peter afterward presented this view of the transaction, when he wrote, &quot;We followed not cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his </span><span class="csC382D2BB">majesty.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> For he received from God the Father </span><span class="csC382D2BB">honor</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">glory</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount.&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Pe+1%3A16-18"><span class="csE2DF19C1">2 Pet. 1:16-18</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_7"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">7, 8. they saw no man.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Their prostration when they heard the voice of God prevented them from seeing the departure of Moses and Elias, and the disappearance of the glory. When Jesus touched them and told them to arise, he alone was before them, and he was there in his natural appearance.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_9"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">9. Tell the vision to no man.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;To have published abroad the vision could at that time have done no good; for the people would have discredited the story and would have reflected adversely on the veracity of the three disciples. But to lock up the secret in the breasts of these three was to cause them to reflect on it much and to converse with one another about it often. Furthermore, the more intensely and the longer it burned within them as a secret, the more joyously would they speak of it when the proper time arrived, and their own miraculous powers rendered credible all that they said of it. That they told it then is evident not only from Peter&#39;s words above quoted, but from its being recorded by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, none of whom were witnesses of the event, and all of whom wrote before the publication of Peter&#39;s epistle.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Matthew17_10"></a><span class="cs91EF8B52">10-13. the disciples asked him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Expecting a literal fulfillment of Malachi&#39;s well known prediction concerning the coming of Elijah (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mal+4%3A5-6"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Mal. 4:5, 6</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), the disciples were surprised that when he appeared on the mountain he did not remain to do the work predicted of him; hence their question. Jesus teaches them a second time that Malachi used the name Elijah figuratively to represent John the Baptist.
