<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lu 12:49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will
I, if it be already kindled?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lu 12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how
am I straitened till it be accomplished!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A place of preparation for war</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the
Jews; but went thence unto a country <u>near to the wilderness</u><b>,</b> into
<u>a city called Ephraim</u>, and there continued with his disciples.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><u>Near</u> to the wilderness- <u>Place of  Preparation</u>
     for Temptation, Trial and War.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><u>Ephraim</u>- Double fruitful</li>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt 20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye
ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr 10:38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask:
can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that
I am baptized with?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt 26:39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face,
and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt 26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed,
saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it,
thy will be done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt 26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed
the third time, saying the same words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Php 3:10 That I may know him, and the power of his
resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto
his death;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Know only Him- Manifestation of Christ’s
life                           Dan 3:25-26</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Christ death has condemned Sin-we must make the same
     judgments against sin</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Christ death has condemned Satan          “the prince of
     this world is judged”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Christ death has condemned Man as a sinner (an unbeliever)
     to death but alive unto God as a true Believer</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ro 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient
for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto
you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin,
and of righteousness, and of judgment: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see
me no more;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>
