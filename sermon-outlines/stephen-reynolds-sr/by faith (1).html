Campbell Morgan, the well-known Bible expositor and preacher, had four sons and they all became preachers of the Word. </span><span class="csC05134DD">They all became great ministers.

It seems that God uses our sorrows and heartaches to call our attention to His; to His concerns and purposes and ways He wants to use us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual time of sacrifices and feasts had become a source of pain rather than a time of great joy for Hannah. Peninnah would receive large portions to distribute to her children, and even though Elkanah sought to relieve Hannah&#39;s pain with a double portion, it was still a constant reminder of her barrenness. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA0DEE522">Why does God begin 1 Samuel (which contains the story of the development of God&#39;s kingdom) with this story of the pain and barrenness of a Hannah? Why should such a seemingly trivial matter be recorded in light of the great events of history that would follow? </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2526AE45"><span class="csA0DEE522">Hannah&#39;s barrenness was no trivial matter to her and this demonstrates God&#39;s concern for each of us in our problems of life </span></li></ol>

It reminds us that </span><span class="cs8F9B443C">the foundation of society and its leaders is the home.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA0DEE522">(4) It reminds us of the importance of prayer, It is a response to God&#39;s initiative. God used Hannah&#39;s pain to draw her to Himself, to develop her consciousness of not only her need, but of the needs of her people. And through that process, He drew out of her both </span><span class="cs8F9B443C">her prayer (the request</span><span class="csA0DEE522">) and </span><span class="cs8F9B443C">the offer (the dedication of her child to God&#39;s purposes).</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA0DEE522">(5) We can see that His great purposes for Israel were linked with and resulted in Hannah&#39;s own blessing and capacity for joy. &quot;He led her gently through suffering that He might enlarge her capacity for joy&quot; </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA0DEE522">Have we ever stopped to consider that our pain may extend far beyond our own life and times? May we each remember that the pain which led to a Samuel (who transformed Israel and who anointed and ministered to kings) first led to a transformed mother named Hannah.</span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA0DEE522">The book opens with the cry of a godly woman. Out of a woman&#39;s suffering which caused her to cry out to the Lord, God blesses the nation by raising up Samuel the prophet. I suppose one of the key lessons we can learn from Hannah is, &quot;Let&#39;s not waste our sorrows!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD3860DFD">And &ldquo;a man came from God&rdquo; whose name was George Campbell Morgan; and he came at the critical moment, at the very right time when all those spiritual emotions and experiences needed to be harnessed and deepened and fostered.

The loss of his daughter remained with Morgan throughout his ministry; yet it gave great power to his preaching, as seen in his commentaries where this event is referenced. His ministry was difficult, yet an important part of God&rsquo;s wonderful appointment for Morgan.
