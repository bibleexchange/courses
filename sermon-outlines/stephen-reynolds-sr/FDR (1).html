			<li class="cs4FC7BF42"><span class="csA7555675">Roosevelt&rsquo;s campaign speeches were deliberately vague. </span></li><li class="cs4FC7BF42"><span class="csA7555675">He called for change of direction but proposed no concrete programs. </span></li><li class="cs4FC7BF42"><span class="csA7555675">The campaign was aimed at getting votes, not at defining a new philosophy of government. But there could be no mistaking the candidate&rsquo;s concern for &ldquo;the forgotten man&rdquo;- the farmers and workers who had been hardest hit by the Depression. </span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">With the depression the only issue of consequence in the presidential campaign of 1932, the American people had a choice between the apparently unsuccessful policies of the incumbent Hoover and the </span><span class="csC57700C4">vaguely defined New Deal program</span><span class="csA7555675"> presented by Roosevelt. While Roosevelt </span><span class="csDA02FF29">avoided specifics</span><span class="csA7555675">, he made clear that his program for economic recovery would </span><span class="csDA02FF29">make extensive use of the power of the federal government.</span><span class="csA7555675"> In a series of addresses carefully prepared by a team of advisers popularly known as the Brain Trust, he promised aid to farmers, public development of electric power, a balanced budget, and government policing of irresponsible private economic power. Besides having policy differences, the two candidates presented a stark contrast in personal demeanour as well. Roosevelt was genial and exuded confidence, while Hoover remained unremittingly grim and dour. On election day, Roosevelt received nearly 23 million popular votes to Hoover&#39;s nearly 16 million; the electoral vote was 472 to 59. In a repudiation not just of Hoover but also of the Republican Party, Americans elected substantial Democratic majorities to both houses of Congress.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">In the four months between the election and Roosevelt&#39;s inauguration, President Hoover sought Roosevelt&#39;s cooperation in stemming the deepening economic crisis. But Roosevelt refused to subscribe to Hoover&#39;s proposals, which Hoover himself admitted would mean &ldquo;the abandonment of 90 percent of the so-called new deal.&rdquo; As a result, the economy continued to decline. By inauguration day&mdash;March 4, 1933&mdash;most banks had shut down, industrial production had fallen to just 56 percent of its 1929 level, at least 13 million wage earners were unemployed, and farmers were in desperate straits.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The first term</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">In his inaugural address Roosevelt promised prompt, decisive action, and he conveyed some of his own unshakable self-confidence to millions of Americans listening on radios throughout the land. &ldquo;This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and prosper,&rdquo; he asserted, adding, &ldquo;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&ldquo;The Hundred Days&rdquo;&mdash;the first phase of the New Deal, in which his administration presented Congress with a broad array of measures, intended to achieve economic recovery, to provide relief to the millions of poor and unemployed, and to reform aspects of the economy that Roosevelt believed had caused the collapse.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Roosevelt was candid in admitting that the initial thrust of </span><span class="csC57700C4">the New Deal was experimental</span><span class="csA7555675">. He would see what worked and what did not, abandoning the latter and persisting with the former until the crisis was overcome. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Assessment</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">During his lifetime Franklin D. Roosevelt was simultaneously one of the most loved and most hated men in American history. His supporters hailed him as the saviour of his nation during the Great Depression and the defender of democracy during World War II. Opponents criticized him for undermining American free-market capitalism, for unconstitutionally expanding the powers of the federal government, and for transforming the nation into a welfare state.</span></p></body>
