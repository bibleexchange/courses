<p class=MsoNormal>Waiting on the Lord has to do with faith in action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doing obediently and consistently what you already know to
do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have to be patiently waiting on the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah 64:4</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he
hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God has always used them that obey and wait on Him. Others
may have gifts of His grace and be used at times, but it is of the other kind
which consistently follow the Lord, that see God work a habit of work in their
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ready for another command. Waiting. Obeying. Ready.
Prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II Thessalonians 3:5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and
into the patient waiting for Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jude 21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keep ourselves in the Love of God. he will direct you there.
You are only going to keep yourself there by obeying Him. </p>
