It is better to</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">dwell in a desert or a rooftop corner than with her who shames you by her ungodliness within. Indeed, it is</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">rottenness to the bones [Prov.12:4; 21:9,19; 25:24].</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">Brethren, a prudent wife is from the Lord [Prov.19:14].
