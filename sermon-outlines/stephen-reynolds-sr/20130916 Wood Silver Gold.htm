<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Rebekah came

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Rebekah met the requirements of
the servant for the Bride.  The servant’s request was that the Bride give him
drink and give the camels drink.  These ten camels had traveled a long way
through a desert land, and would have been very thirsty{<span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Those who will
make up the Bride will always be thirsting for more.  Like Paul, after years of
ministry and being part of great miracles said, “<i>That I may know Him…</i>”
