It is a form of theft from taxpayers, encourages the neglect of children and jobs, draws unscupulous people, cultivates laziness and entices one to other sins such as alcohol and drug use and prostitution. In any form, it is wrong. Gambling is not authorized by God. It stands condemned by God. As Christians, we believe we must stand against society&rsquo;s attempts to legalize and promote ANY forms of gambling.</span></p><p class="cs7C5B1331"><span class="cs1970BCFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
