Using this method, you may often ask the question, &ldquo;How is the Scripture to be APPLIED spiritually and practically?</span></p><p class="csCE07DCE8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3. Prophetically (or Ultimate) &ndash;The prophetic method of interpreting Scripture is </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">observing what key to the plan and purpose of God is revealed by the text. The method of interpretation requires an ample amount of proof texts for each point or doctrine to be emphasized: this will help prevent misuse of any text for &ldquo;no Scripture is of private interpretation.&rdquo; (2 Peter 1:20)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God would not permit me to believe error, and God would permit me to believe error.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He would </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">not </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">if my heart was filled with a sincere love for the truth and </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">willingness to be taught.

This is not saying I cannot go wrong or miss God, but I believe that if I do miss the truth or misunderstand through ignorance and not rebellion that God will correct me as a father would his son. I am not left to myself and required to make perfect judgment time after time, but the Holy Spirit comes as a teacher to the YEILDED. John 16:8 speaks of the Holy Spirit saying He will &ldquo;reprove.&rdquo; According to the Strongs the Greek word in that text incorporates the meaning of &ldquo;to tell a fault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He would if I did not receive the love for the truth.
