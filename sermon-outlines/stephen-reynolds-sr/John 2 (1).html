In those first days there was something for every day, and they were a example of the whole life of the Savior. He could never say, like Titus, &quot;I have lost a day.&quot; Every day had its deed, glorifying to God, and blessed to men. Let us also try to labor for Christ every day; let there be no day without its mark. May God grant that there may be something to make every day memorable! &quot;And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee.&quot; The first miracle of our Lord was not wrought at Jerusalem; but away there in the back settlements, in &quot;Galilee of the Gentiles.&quot; It was necessary for him to be seen, and to work miracles which might be seen; but he began in an obscure region, among a despised and poor people.<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image11.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />1. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">And the mother of Jesus was there:</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image12.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />This expression leads to the belief that there was some kind of kinship between the bridegroom or the bride and the mother of Jesus, for it is not said that she was invited to be there, but that she &quot;was there.&quot;<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image13.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />2. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image14.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />Happy marriage, where Christ is invited to be present! Where Christ goes, his disciples go. If they suffer with him, they also rejoice with him. If he goes to a feast, they must go, too: &quot;Both Jesus was called, and his disciples.&quot; They were only six; but six is a large number to add to a poor family&#39;s wedding party. It shows the generosity of their heart that they invited Jesus to come and bring his disciples; and he went to put honor upon marriage, <img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image15.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">3. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image16.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />John calls Mary &quot;the mother of Jesus.&quot; the dying word of Christ, &quot;Behold thy mother!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7C96B97">&quot;The mother of Jesus.&quot; Because she has been so exalted in Catholicism, do we think too little of this woman to whom the angel Gabriel said, &quot;Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.&quot;<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image17.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />&quot;They wanted wine.&quot; They had not been long married before there was want in the house. Even in the brightest days of life, they wanted something more; and the mother of Jesus saw that they were in want, and that the marriage festival would be dishonored; so she went to her son and she said, &quot;They have no wine</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7C96B97">&nbsp;He would not use his miraculous powers merely for their advantage; but for the glory of God and the instruction of men.<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image18.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />4. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/>The Savior had an hour for everything; an hour for suffering, and an hour for working; and he did everything punctually, promptly to the minute. That was one of the beauties of his life: We must keep our place, He is the Master, we are the servants; <br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image19.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />5. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image20.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />Mary took the rebuke in silence. She said nothing; she felt the force of Christ&#39;s words, she proved that she did by now fully believing that he would do something. &quot;Mine hour is not yet come&quot;? His hour will come,. Let him alone; he knows best how and when to show his grace towards you. Keep silence before him, and in patience commit your way unto him.<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image21.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />6. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image22.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />The accuracy of the Holy Spirit. John does not know exactly how much these vessels held; they were not made to measure things in, so he writes, &quot;containing two or three firkins apiece.&quot; These were 6 &quot;waterpots of stone.&quot; Stone will not, as a rule, hold the flavour of anything that has been in it, like an earthen vessel would do; so these pots, which had contained nothing else but water, could not be suspected of having any lees of wine concealed therein, or any flavouring material that would make the water taste like wine. No, they were genuine stone waterpots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6-120 gallons)<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image23.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />7. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.

If Christ says to you, &quot;Fill the waterpots with water, fill them up to the brim. Never cut down his commandments; carry them out as far as the largest interpretation can go. When you are bidden to believe in him, believe in him up to the brim. When you are told to love him, love him up to the brim. When you are commanded to serve him, serve him to the brim<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image25.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />8. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">And be saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image26.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />&quot;Draw out now&quot; &quot;</span><span class="csBA19D4A8">Now</span><span class="csA7C96B97">.&quot; He turned the water into wine as they went. He simply willed it, and it was done. He said, &quot;Draw out now.&quot; He was sure it was; so he said to the servants, when they had filled the waterpots with water, &quot;Draw out now. Do not bring it to me for me to taste it; I know what it is. Take it to the </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">governor of the feast</span><span class="csA7C96B97">, to him who sits at the head of the table, and is the judge of the wine:&quot; &quot;and they bare it.&quot; The holy confidence of Christ is admirable. May we be able, by faith, so to work, with a calm consciousness of divine help! But notice this. Whenever the Lord fills any of you with a blessing, listen to hear him say, &quot;Draw out now.&quot; He does not fill these pots that they may keep full. &quot;Draw out now.&quot; Did you have a good time last Monday night at prayer? Some did. &quot;Draw out now.&quot; Have you lived near to God and are you very happy? &quot;Draw out now.&quot; If he has filled you up to the brim, draw out now; for, if you try to store it up, it will become useless. Selfishness will poison it all. (Procrastination, disobedience, lingering)<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image27.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />9. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image28.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />There was no collusion, for the governor, who tasted it, did not know where it came from; and the servants, who knew where it came from, did not taste it, so that they did not know what it was like. <br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image29.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />10. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image30.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />The governor of the feast did not understand, but he admired it and here is a picture of what our Lord always does. He gives his people the best last. At first, the wine of the kingdom is mingled with much bitterness, salt tears of sorrow flow into it, but it improves as we go on; and when we shall drink it with him, in the kingdom of God, what will it be like? The joy of Christ&#39;s love on earth is heaven, You who live for the world have had your best already; but, as for our feast with Christ, we go from good to better, and from better to the best.<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image31.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />11. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory;</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image32.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />Moses turned water into blood; Christ turned water into wine. One brought a curse upon the common things of daily life; the other put an added sweetness and blessing into them.<br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image33.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />11. </span><span class="cs6CDCD209">And his disciples believed on him.</span><span class="csA7C96B97"><br/><img src="John%202%20(1)_files/image34.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />They did believe on him before; but now they had visual demonstration of his divine power and Godhead; and they believed as they had not believed before.
