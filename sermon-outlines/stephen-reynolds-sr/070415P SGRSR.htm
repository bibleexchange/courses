<p class=MsoNormal>TITE: Wisdom and Prudence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Ephesians 1:8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I don’t know another chapter you
can look at to study about the blessing of God.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The blessing of God that makes rich and adds no
sorrow with it has to do witht that which is spiritual. Our blessing is in
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Wherein he hath abounded toward us
in all wisdom and prudence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>God abounding towoard us. What is
it that God wants to do for me? How much does that interest me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This is not just something at times
God wants to do for us. But God wants to always do this for us. Who is
abounding to us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Isaiah 52:13 Behold, my servant
shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>God is dealing with us prudently.
Ther eis a difference between wisdom and prudence. One will not be without the
other. Wisdom and prudence are mentioned many times throughout the Scripture.
(There are times when men APPEARED to be wise in their OWN eyes or prudent.
Obadiah 1:8)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>God is not interested in just
giving us something we can take in our hands and say God has blessed me. It is
not just good moral deeds that I have learned to make me wise. We have more
than just a moral code to follow, but we hav ethe LIFE OF JESUS IN US. He that
is born of God doth not omit sin. We hav e new nature, we have been made a new creature,
a new man in Christ. We have God putting into us His Divine nature. Wisdom is
not just from knowledge learned and we just follow it. But Wisdom is that we
have from the imparted life of God in us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>WISDOM: Knowing HOW and DOING it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>PRUDENT: Knowing and Doing without
stopping. (100 out of 100)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Our righteousness is as filthy
rags. The best we can produce in our own striving is SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS. But if
we draw night to God He will draw nigh to us. It is the Word that the Spirit
uses to draw us. If you pay attention to the Word as it is spoken you will
sense the Holy Spirit dealing with your heart. Sometimes people are looking for
a certain feeling rather than knowing that God uses His Word to draw. If you
respond to the Word properly there is a lot of good feeling that goes along
with exercising your faith diligently. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I Corinthians 1:18  For the
preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which
are saved it is the power of God. <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>ßß</span>Respond
to the Word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>17:30 – 22:30 , 5 minutes, 379
words, = 75.8 words per minute</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>God is going to put your wisdom and
your prudence to the test, but be the simpleset one amongst us and say that
Jjesus is the Lord of my life and believe that God’s Christ’s shed blod brought
healing tomy sould and He will honor His word and bring you life for it is
written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the
understanding fo the prudent. I don’t want me I want God’s help he si the
servant that has come to serve, not to minister unto be but to minster unto.
God Christ gave himself a sacrifice to all, but man will go the borad road that
leads to destruction. There wisdom is come to nought to nothing, but there is a
staraight and narrow way tthat come sby faith it is a simple way. I thaink God
for the real way. That does not mean you will be simple and underlearned
forever, but he teaches us ikn the fashion that we receive his nature in us. We
find ourself working out what he has worked in and wee find ourselves
victorious like when he spoke the word and said et there be light. He made it
to have f ewllowship like on the same level on the same leve on the same level
He can do that He is the only one that can do that. There are things that I
must pay attention to and examine the word of God with my whole heart. If we do
not pay attention God will judge. He says we will destroy the wisdom of the
wise. The wise agree there is not a second chance to go to heaven. You preach
the tribulatio nyou are a liar. You are you don’t need to know who said it but
it wasn’t true. Our first as a wisee prudent man of God to cover the shame.
Bring to light the things that are right and the things that are wrong you have
to mark if they go wrong. You cover shame. You deal with it between yuou them
and the Lord. Keep it co vered. The less people know about me the better off I
am Somotimes they think you have never been tested</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>God is prudent. <span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span> God never changes he is always doing the
same thing over and over again. He never changes His mind. He is doingn it the
same way over and over again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>26:30-36:30, 10 minutes, 730 words,
73 words per minute</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>If seems It seems the more that you
try to help them the worse they get because they do the wrong over and over and
over again without any change. I want God to impart life, but it has to be the
Word imparted by the spirit. That is not prudent. If it is all word you will
dry up, the letter does kill in my mind. You give me the owrd and let me have
my way and I will have everyone all chopped up, but God speaks life out of the
darkness there is a transforming power of God to give us the help that we need
To preach in the fashion that we need to honor him not just someday Godo will
do soething . Just like fun it will comme and it willl go if yo ubelieve God
for it when it happens you will know what it is. I see tonight something in
theis word God is challenging us. God has sent his servant yOu can know what
God wants to do you can know how God works by His word and keep doing it stop
chaign gyour mind and changing what you are doing Obey the Word keep it simple
obey the Word. Understand the right knowledge eof the Word of God and apply it
daily every day all day lonng God does not change His way or his practices you
dot’ know what you are doing yo uare going to leave a mark that can’t be fixed.
A lot of people have destroyed by making their mark and it has to be destroyed
and has to be taken away. We have done foolishly in our own mind we are wise
and we have done it time and time again, but the spriti of God is speaking ot oour
hearts there are things that must change When paul sent titus intot he church
there He sent Himm tinoto a place that the people were doing things contrary to
the will of God while there were saying this is God’s will. They were saying
that Paul didn’t know what he was talking about, Paul had missed it. Don’t let
here be any lacking Put there faith back intot he simple thing sof the word of
God God will destroy it and cause it to come to nought hunger fo rth eWord and
hunge rfor God to speak to me I the times when the spirit of God is moving
worship even walking by the building you can sense God’s presence more than
just sense God’s presence we need to know His will and to do it, but it must be
done according to His word and by his spirit. God is abounding by all wisdom
and prudence. That is why Jesus was able to lay aside His glory and for thirty
years lived in flesh but at thirty he receive the fullness of the spirit. The
initial filling that we receive is just the earnest there are things that we
must learn to receive to prepare for that the fullness fo the spirit of God is
for everyone that would believe and obey him. You can have that. In order to
overcome you MUST have that ninety-nine and nine tenths you must have the
spirit fully. This is a time to know that God is still working. What He has
done He is still doing and what will do he will always do. As God’s servant we
must deal prudently. God’s wants to show us who He is and that we are a servant
to Him. We serve His servant. We serve as a son an not just as a hireling. God
help us Jesus was the only begotten son of God and he was proclaimed as a
servant that total surrendered heart wanting to do the will of God, I must be
about my father’s business. We need to have things done in order. Set these things
in order. It is not just a matter of doing the best that I can, but there is a
divine order and everything else must be destroyed. Strengthen their faith
perfect that which was lacking in their faith that was the pattern the word is
till simple today prevent perfect that which is lacking in their faith. There
are leaks some have leaked out. Some have never had the experience yet. </p>
