<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Title: <b>A Good Conscience</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'><u>THE PEACE OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>A good conscience is a clear conscience--no guilt, no bitterness, or
grudges. The peace of a good clear conscience is of great value. Matthew 11:28
There is a peace in obedience to God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>There is a law to love one another. Their will be a lot of tests of your
conscience. If you go to war with an unclear conscience it is going to show up.
In the midst of the battle when you find yourself wounded, do not give up or
let down. The grace of God works in the heart of a man whereas the peace of God
prevails. If wounded in battle do not blame God, but remember that you missed
something in the Word. Be honest. Forgive yourself and others, be forbearing,
loving, kind, gentle. A good conscience is necessary weapon of our daily
battles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'><u>WHAT IS A GOOD CONSCIENCE? </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>A good conscience is a mighty weapon just as faith is. &quot;Holding
faith and a good conscience.&quot; Holding that experience/ground that God has
given to you. The devil can get at you through your feelings, but not through
your faith. A good conscience is a might weapon of defense when the great
accuser comes by because we know by God's grace we have been CHANGED. I Cor.
5:17 The devil as a liar tries to bring us back down after God has placed us on
our feet. By the righteousness of Christ we have been made righteous. His righteousness
is imparted to our heart when His life is flowing freely making us STRONG.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>It takes believing God's Word to have the peace of a clear conscience.
You can't meditate on unbelief and evil thoughts and yet have faith. Faith is a
shield that cuts off those evil thoughts to where they cannot penetrate and
wound. If we allow those evil thoughts to get in it wounds so that our
conscience cannot work properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>God's Word is holy. God is holy. Leviticus 20:7 We must know Who He
is--GOD IS HOLY! The devil cannot defeat the life of Christ in you. It is His
nature in you and his nature is Holy. Every part of your life must be holy. I
Peter 1:15,16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>A good clear conscience is a weapon you need that brings a peace the
devil cannot bring down. God's Word is what we need in our hearts to keep us
from offending Him. People find no steadiness or consistency in merely
memorizing truth and Scripture and trying to live a better Christian life. We
must have the life of Christ in us working, flowing, a fresh and intimate
relationship with God. You can know God and have Him working in your heart.
John 4:14 It won't flow until the conscience is clear and faith is exercised.
His life working in our heart will produce victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>Exodus 15:2 We need to get beyond simply not offending God and just
admitting failure. We must seek after Him and worship and praise him asking Him
to work in our heart what we could not do ourself. Speak against the voice of
the flesh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'><u>PREPARATION IS SO NEEDED TO HAVE AND HOLD A GOOD CONSCIENCE. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>Ephesians 6:15 There is a process producing a good conscience to bring us
into a place to where we may exalt Christ and walk in newness of life. In
Christ we are restored and our conscience becomes clear. THE LORD IS MY
STRENGTH. Prepare God a habitation and do not allow the devil to have place in
our mind. Speak life, speak God's holiness, power, grace, and what He is
saying. Do not rest in past promises or future promises (remember it), but rest
in a promise that is ALIVE now. John 14:1,2 There is preparation that God has
made for us and preparation for us to make in following after what He has done.
God has something for us. The devil brings negative, but the Word of God holds
us steady. Rev. 19:7,8 You can only make yourself ready by what the Holy Ghost
brings to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>To hold a good conscience is to live a transparent life, an experience
that reaches deep inside, GENUINE. &quot;Rivers of water feeding the
hungry.&quot; Psalm 119:11 God is going to help us. Psalm 10:17 Make
preparation for the Holy God. 1 Cor. 14:8 We NEED God's Word. Labor in study to
know truth so that the Holy Spirit may reveal it to your heart. A clear
conscience is a mighty weapon that stands together <u>with</u> faith. Your
conscience can't stand clear and pure by itself. &quot;Some having put away
concerning faith have made shipwreck.&quot; Hold faith, hold a clear conscience
that we may hold to the Truth and not let up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'><u>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE? </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>I Peter 3:16 God has  a purpose greater for His people than just fighting
the devil. We can know a Christian experience above just fighting the
adversary. We must conquer the enemy, but more so--&quot;more than
conquerors.&quot; PURPOSE: so that when we are falsely accused, ridiculed,
there will be a shining forth of the life of Christ from us. That light is a
light to the world. Memory verses are not a light to the world, but when the
life of Christ shines from you that is the light of the world. Divine life is
Divine light. Study the Word to know that this is for you. More than
conquerors, but also a light to the world. &quot;IF WE CAN HEAR THAT CERTAIN
SOUND...&quot; We must understand how the promise works. We must hear that
sound that only the Spirit of God can speak to you. If we know what we are
doing, we can conquer and be in victory. Do not fault others, hold no bitterness,
and speak the love of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'><u>HOW POWERFUL IS A GOOD CONSCIENCE? </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>It doesn't work by itself or just happen, but it must be exercised by
faith. Hebrews 5:13,14 Acts 24:16 It takes strength to exercise a good
conscience. It didn't come easy, but he did those things he knew to do
according to the Word of God. The power of a good conscience is to void out
every onslaught of the enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>Faith with a good conscience is powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'><u>HOW CAN A MAN REINFORCE A GOOD CONSCIENCE?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>A cry of faith unto Jesus will be heard. Reach out to Him knowing He is
watching. When we call on His name He will answer. John 1:9 Men have been
dashed against the rocks, but He is that great Lighthouse warning of us of the
way of sin and its inevitable destruction. A Clear conscience makes it possible
for the Light to shine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;text-autospace:
none'>We must have a good conscience. We cannot have it without conviction or
repentance.</p>
