The occasion was the visit of Pope John Paul II to Ontario, Canada, in the 1980&rsquo;s. As is seen, JP2&#39;s attention along with the rest of his entourage was drawn and riveted for a few seconds on the preacher whose words are recorded at the top of the photograph. Directly afterward, the mobile&#39;s surrounding, bulletproof glass enclosure was pulled closed, and the very slow moving motorcade throttled up and sped away. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus Christ told us, &quot;...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.&quot; (Mark 16:15) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus had a prayer request: He requested&nbsp;us to...&quot;Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.&quot; (Matthew 9:38)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which </span><span class="cs1D3FF4A2">stood above the people</span><span class="cs4777DE10">, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.&quot; (2Chron. 24:20) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Cry aloud, spare not, </span><span class="cs1D3FF4A2">lift up thy voice like a trumpet</span><span class="cs4777DE10">, and shew my people their transgression, and the&nbsp;house of Jacob their sins.&quot; (Isa. 58:1) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;</span><span class="cs1D3FF4A2">Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain</span><span class="cs4777DE10">, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.&quot; (Isa. 13:2) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCACBBA9A">_________________</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-known forty-year veteran of field preaching said, &quot;Street preaching will give you the correct opinion of yourself.&quot; (Concerning this, see Acts 20:20 below.)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, (Acts 20:20 &mdash; practicing this verse gives you 20/20 vision) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Wesley said: &quot;To this day field preaching is a cross to me, but I know my commission and see NO OTHER WAY of preaching the gospel to EVERY creature.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4777DE10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A qualification for effective soul winning: Shake off the vipers that are in the Church&mdash;formalism, pride, and self-importance, etc. (D.L.
