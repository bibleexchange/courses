		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="51_esther3f_3"><span class="csC05134DD">The Jews had to defend themselves to gain the upper hand over all who attacked them. Three reasons are given for their successful defense: </span></a></p><p class="csCDDC8C82"><span class="csC05134DD">a. Because of King Xerxes&rsquo;s second decree, the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Decree of Defense</span><span class="csC05134DD">, the Jews had time to prepare and mobilize themselves against all adversaries. In city after city throughout the empire, the Jews banded together to defend themselves against all who sought their death. If each family had stood alone, they would have been easy prey. But by banding together in cities, they were able to successfully defend themselves when attacked.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">b. Because of God&rsquo;s love for the Israelites. He aroused fear within the hearts of the anti-Semites (</span><span class="csD04A7434">v.2</span><span class="csC05134DD">; </span><span class="csD04A7434">8:17</span><span class="csC05134DD">). None of them were successful in attacking the Jews because they were too apprehensive, too afraid. Once again the Lord, through His sovereignty, had protected the Jews. He had long ago appointed them to be the people through whom He would give the Word of God (the Holy Bible) to the world and through whom He would send the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, to save the world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">c. Because the Persian nobles and political leaders threw their weight behind the Jews, the Jews were able to successfully defend themselves (</span><span class="csD04A7434">v.3</span><span class="csC05134DD">). Within the cities throughout the empire, the political officials took their stand with the Jews. This was to be expected, for King Xerxes had thrown his weight behind the Jews. Furthermore, he had appointed the Jew Mordecai to be the prime minister of the nation. In fact, Scripture says that the governors and political officials actually </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">feared </span><span class="csC05134DD">Mordecai. Thus they were bound to support the Jews against their attackers. If they had actually supported the aggressors, they themselves would have been executed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="51_esther3f_4"><span class="csC05134DD">3. For the above three reasons, the Jews gained a great victory against the citizens who attacked them. They survived the attempted holocaust launched by those who so despised the Jews. Instead of being slaughtered, they were actually able to defend themselves and to kill the aggressors. Moreover, they were apparently strong and confident in their defense. For the most part they were able to do as they pleased, gaining an easy and complete victory over those who assaulted them (</span></a><span class="csD04A7434">v.5</span><span class="csC05134DD">). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="51_esther3f_5"><span class="csC05134DD">4. In the fortress of Susa the Jews killed 500 men. In addition, they killed the ten sons of Haman, the former prime minister who had so bitterly despised the Jews and who had deceived King Xerxes into signing the decree of extermination</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">. </span><span class="csC05134DD">But note this fact: the Jews did not plunder the property of those they killed (</span></a><span class="csD04A7434">vv.6-10</span><span class="csC05134DD">). This fact is so important that it is repeated three times (</span><span class="csD04A7434">v.10</span><span class="csC05134DD">, </span><span class="csD04A7434">15-16</span><span class="csC05134DD">). The only motive of the Jews was to defend and protect their lives, not to steal property. They had as much a right to live and to defend themselves as any other people. At some point during the day, the number of the slain in Susa was reported to the king (</span><span class="csD04A7434">v.11</span><span class="csC05134DD">). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="51_esther3f_6"><span class="csC05134DD">5. Pleased with the report of the Jews&rsquo; success, Xerxes shared the news of the fighting with Queen Esther. He then asked if she had any other requests that might help the Jews against their attackers (</span></a><span class="csD04A7434">v.12</span><span class="csC05134DD">). To assure a complete victory over the brutal enemies, Esther made two additional requests:</span></p><p class="csE24B7A1B"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD"> That the Jews in Susa be given one more day to continue pursuing the attackers who sought to slaughter them (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Est+9%3A13"><span class="csD04A7434">v.13</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). </span></p><p class="csE24B7A1B"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD"> That the bodies of Haman&rsquo;s ten sons be hanged on gallows as a warning and deterrent to any future aggressor seeking to slaughter the Jews.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">King Xerxes granted the request of his beloved wife and queen (</span><span class="csD04A7434">v.14</span><span class="csC05134DD">). He immediately issued a decree in Susa that extended the right of the Jews to pursue and execute those who had so viciously attacked them, seeking to slaughter their families and steal their property. He also hung the bodies of Haman&rsquo;s ten sons in public as a warning, to bring a halt to any future aggressor who might wish to slaughter the Jews. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="51_esther3f_7"><span class="csC05134DD">6. In the additional day, the Jews were able to track down and kill 300 more of their attackers in the city of Susa. But again note, they did not plunder the enemy&rsquo;s property. </span></a></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="51_esther3f_8"><span class="csC05134DD">7. Throughout the rest of the empire, the Jews were able to successfully defend themselves. They killed 75,000 of their aggressors (</span></a><span class="csD04A7434">v.16</span><span class="csC05134DD">). But for a third time: they did not plunder their property. They sought only to protect themselves and to live peacefully without oppression. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="51_esther3f_9"><span class="csC05134DD">8. A great victory, the Jews celebrated their deliverance from the aggressors (</span></a><span class="csD04A7434">17-19</span><span class="csC05134DD">). Celebrations were held all over the empire on the day after their triumphant stand. In the city of Susa the Jews celebrated on the 15</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"> day of Adar, which was the 12</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"> month (</span><span class="csD04A7434">v.18</span><span class="csC05134DD">). But out in the provinces or districts, where they had not been given an extra day, the Jews celebrated on the 14</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"> day of Adar (</span><span class="csD04A7434">v.19</span><span class="csC05134DD">)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Preparation is an absolute essential if we are to be triumphant, victorious.
