<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: I Kings 20:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Somebody is praying and seeking for God and hungry for God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>1 Kings 20:22 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto
him, <b>Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest</b>: for at
the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>1Kings 17:3 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and <b>hide thyself</b>
by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. (Hide Thyself)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>1Kings 18:1 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the
LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying<b>, Go, shew thyself</b> unto
Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Emptied of self so the Lord may put in Faith, mercy,
compassion. In the hidden place God straightens things out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.5pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0in'>Israel has gotten away from
God in such a short time.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is that hidden place, there is that place where men
are emptied out of themselves and there God may administer, strength, victory,
faith. Hidden in God.</p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.5pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there is ever a time we need to mark and strongly mark
the difference between good and evil it is now. If we do not clearly mark evil,
we will fall into it. I want the distinction. I want a contempt for evil for
God hates sin. We strengthen ourself by knowing what is right and what is evil.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t learn by experience, but go by the Word. The way to
strengthen ourselves is by the Word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Jude  17 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Hebrews 4:11,12</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heb 4:11 ¶ Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest,
lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper
than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love Good and hate evil with NO INBETWEEN.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have got to be serious with the things of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Ex 19:12 -13</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about,
saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the
border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when
the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sinner needs to know that God hates sin. God will shew
mercy and his goodness will He shew in the heart the turns toward Him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>De 1:39 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey,
and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil,
they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Get away from the edge. Do not live on the sidelines, the
boundary by in the center of his will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Galatians 5:5</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of <b>righteousness
by faith</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Christian walk begins by grace through faith and we
depend upon the Holy Ghost step by step until he brings us unto God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Ps 85:10 </h1>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.5pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0in'>Mercy and truth are met
together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest. What
was the king doing? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
