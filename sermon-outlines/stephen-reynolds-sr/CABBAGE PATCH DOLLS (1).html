As a new entrepreneur, the artist consolidated his love for sculpting and his quilting abilities he learned from his mother to produce one of America&#39;s most popular dolls in history. &nbsp;Xavier went about marketing his product. Rather than using the traditional term in selling and purchasing toys, he incorporated the theme of adoption into the sale of his items. With this new twist of adoption, the purchase encompassed a new meaning. The parents and children alike sought out the emotional value behind a child in need of a home.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Xavier had staggered onto a wealthy idea that would flourish in the marketplace. Although his dolls are creative and authentic, his prospect of the marketplace was harnessed through the idea of adoption. Also keeping the dolls unique was the idea to incorporate different themes into each dolls character such as the U.S. Space Shuttle cabbage patch kid. This allowed the dolls to incorporate the popularity of times, keeping the eye of the consumer in mind.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You can find the dolls in Wal-mart and other popular toys stores nation wide. This wide availability gives clue to a rather successful history that began thirty years ago. Today the new dolls still sell for a &nbsp;high price tag and the resale market of older Cabbage Patch dolls bring a higher price. It has been quoted that the older originals bring a new adoption price tag of $190.00 and up and the collectors interested in adopting them have no problems with paying those figures. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Xavier Roberts</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (born October 31, 1955, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland,_Georgia" title="Cleveland, Georgia"><span class="cs92015F65">Cleveland, Georgia</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), the inventor and manufacturer of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage_Patch_Kids" title="Cabbage Patch Kids"><span class="cs92015F65">Cabbage Patch Kids</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, is an American artist and businessman.

Influenced by the quilts that his mother, Eula, made, he began experimenting with a quilted doll. After much experimentation, Roberts created a type of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doll" title="Doll"><span class="cs92015F65">doll</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> he called &quot;Little People&quot;. Roberts and a small group of friends began to travel from state to state in the southeastern U.S. attending folk art exhibitions. At these exhibitions, Roberts began selling these handcrafted dolls he called &quot;babies&quot;. Going into business as Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc., Roberts started producing Little People in his hometown of Cleveland, at a converted medical clinic, which he rechristened &quot;<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babyland_General_Hospital" title="Babyland General Hospital"><span class="cs92015F65">Babyland General Hospital</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;.

In 1984 alone, 20 million dolls were bought, and by 1999, 95 million had been sold worldwide.</span></p><p class="csB4A3870F"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">In 1976, Xavier Roberts invented &#39;Little Person&#39; dolls, the first Cabbage Patch Kids. Roberts was a teenager when he started the Babyland General Hospital in Cleveland, Georgia, where people could adopt a baby (the hand sewn dolls were never called dolls) complete with adoption papers. Roberts and five friends started the Original Appalachian Artworks company to produce the dolls. The Coleco toy company liked Roberts&#39; ideas and began mass-marketing the dolls in 1983, under the new name of &#39;Cabbage Patch Kids.&#39;</span><span class="cs1AA80D66"> </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs4090733E">Finding Turmoil in the toy box?</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

An abbreviated version of the story was reproduced on every Cabbage Patch Kids product from 1983 going forward. Parker Brothers published the original story retitled &quot;Xavier&#39;s Fantastic Discovery&quot; in 1984 and their Parker Records produced a Gold Album using the characters.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A notable extension to the line was the &quot;Talking Cabbage Patch Kid&quot;, equipped with a voice chip, touch sensors, and an infrared device for communicating with other such dolls. The touch sensors enabled the toy to detect when and how the toy was being played with in response to its vocalizations, e.g. the doll might say &quot;hold my hand&quot; and give an appropriate speech response when the touch sensor in the hand detected pressure. A more remarkable effect occurred when one doll detected the presence of another through its IR transmitter/receiver. The dolls were programmed to signal their &quot;awareness&quot; of each other with a short phrase, e.g. &quot;I think there&#39;s someone else to play with here!&quot;, and then to initiate simple conversations </span><span class="csC382D2BB">between the dolls themselves</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> with enough randomness to sound somewhat natural.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The high price ($100 or more), the need to have multiple dolls to take advantage of the full conversational effect, for some people the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%27s_Play" title="Child's Play"><span class="cs92015F65">spookiness</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of having dolls converse with each other without human intervention, and the limited play value of a talking doll over its silent counterpart.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
