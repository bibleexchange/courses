God has determined, judged sin. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living waters.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is living waters flowing for us tonight.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ther eis a union that God has in mind to bring us beyond just the state of free from sin and the things that war against the soul, but he wants to free us from the things that conquer. We work at the end from the beginning to know that it is worth the fight. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">TO God be the glory, God is the everlasting light of our soul. He will glorify Himself in us and will establish His works. Our works our vain unless the Spirit of God moves in us. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We need the Gospel made plain so that every taste is a cool drop from Heaven saying that Jesus Christ is the healer, deliverer, establisher of our hearts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A SURE FOUNDATION&lt; A LIVING STONE</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Not something that is dead, but LIVING. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Isaiah said, A SURE FOUNDATION&lt; &nbsp;you can know that He is there. You don&rsquo;t&rsquo; have to wonder whether God is there, but you can know him that He is there.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the ways the lord makes us to know He is there is He allows us to TASTE. He reveals to us HIS WORD. If we don&rsquo;t hunger and thirst for His Word our hunger for God is suspect.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Peter 2:8</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Out of the living stone is living water flowing. The living stone gives spiritual drink. (The natural mind does not receive the things of God) If you heart will reach out to God you will find that His word will defeat the enemy of your soul and will defeat the thing that is warring against your soul. He can make us more THAN CONQUERERS, but until then we must UNDERSTAND THE BATTLE.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">ABASTAIN FROM FLESHLY lust, You can find yourself to be the example, a living stone placed in a spiritual house so people can come and see God, your testimony is about Jesus, you are praising the Lord, you are living for Him and bringing Him glory.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So many don&rsquo;t believe in SALVATION let alone PERFECTION. You don&rsquo;t always have to be in a state of fighting against the flesh. Lust is an enemy, an evil desire. Abastina from fleshly lust which war against the soul, Through the power of the Holy Ghost and the Word we can say NO to sin and YES to God . We can have victory over sin. The fleshly desire is stronger than the spiritual desire. When we feed the fleshly desire, it causes us to stumble at the truth. You wander if it is fro you and whether it is for anybody. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I am not satisfied with a refuge of lies. We are going to fight the flesh and unbelief. Our heart is hungry, a spiritual desire for living waters. Wee are not any better than anyone else, but just taste and see that the Lord is Good, that he is a crown of glory for them that are willing to believe God. So many have disallowed Him as the cornerstone, but I am going to believe the truth, rising about the battle. He is the livning stone, he is the chief cornerstone, he has placed in our life to make our life sure, and we are to be like him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Peter 2:5 </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is living water flowing from the living stone. &nbsp;If you are a living stone than out of you is going to flow that river. If the lord is the living stone in our life then He is that spiritual drink. He is marvelous, and wonderful in his workings. So that we can become like Him. He is REAL</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many question, CHRIST AS THEIR SAVIOUR, many others, THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. There are a lot of fleshly desires that war against our soul. But God is going to bring judgment and lay it against the line. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We are all builders&hellip;either building as an UNBELIEVER building on false hopes and lies or a BELIEVER building on that sure foundation of truth, which is Jesus Christ, the chief cornerstone.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He that believeth on Him is not ashamed, is not confounded but shall have everlasting life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Holy Ghost came and visited Mary highly favoring her and therefore came the life of Jesus. The son of God was born of Mary, making her highly favored of God. She was a simple virgin lady betrothed to a man named Joseph, but God saw fit to do something special in her for a purpose. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul said that He was the chiefest of sinners. He can save anybody He saved me! Not all will be saved, but that is because of the choices that men make. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We are elected because we believed Him. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">4:2 They heard the Gospel but did not believe it, not mixing their hearing with faith. Help us to say &ldquo;Lord I need you crown me with your glory and loving kindness. I don&rsquo;t want to be drunk with the things of this world, but be filled with His spirit.&rdquo; Eph. 4:16 be not drunk with wine&hellip;be filled with the spirit.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">By your good works glorify God in the day of His visitation&hellip;There is a day that He will visit His people. The outpouring of God&rsquo;s Spirit. Knowing truth is not enough, but we must LOVE truth and it must be watered by the Spirit. The Spirit and the Word agree. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God is calling for a &nbsp;diligent heart to seek him with the whole heart. It is the little foxes that spoil the vine. Those little fleshly desires, a little bit of doubt and fear.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Matthew 17 Peter james and john whent up in the mountain and Jesus visited them in a special way. He gave them a taste that He is more than a man. They became afraid, but God has designed His word that we be not afraid of Him though in awe and reverance. Let us come boldly to the throne of grace&hellip; YOU are not going to run in haphazard and lukewarm and still receive from God, but it is going to take a whole hearted effort. All doubt and struggle must be done away with. These 3 disciples had the greatest opportunity of their life but were afraid to enter into it, Luke 9:45 Our questions should be with faith SHOW ME ZTHYZ TRUTH, TEACH MY THY WAYS. His path is that of victory and life. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We are going to overcome because we know God and the spirit of God is floing in our life and He is watering that Word every day. Every day allowing our flesh to be exposed too the power of God. Holding our flesh to the altar. The blossoms and buds will bring fruit that &nbsp;glorify God. It is the Holy Ghost in us that cause that word, seed, to germinate. Zit is the knowledge eof God revealed to us by His Spirit and not just knowledge ein general. ONLY CHRIST THROUGH THE HOLY GHOST can reveal to us. Bellieve for the watering. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csE2DF19C1">It gets pretty dry looking in the mirror of the Word and having no Spirit watering it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christ is the unseen cornerstone, solid foundation, living stone, rock that flows with water as the one that followed Israel in the wilderness.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We take root in places we do not belong.

God is going to send his righteousness to the plummet and his judgment to the line. God won&rsquo;t have to do anything the flood waters of sin will destroy you. A refuge of lies uncovered and overflowed with waters of destruction. Reject God and be overflowed by the waters of destruction.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">v. 8 the lord that is the living stone, became the stumbling stone. He laid his life down &lsquo;in our path&rsquo; that we would have to &lsquo;stumble&rsquo; over Him in order to go to hell, in order to go without. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He is the rock of offense. He has allowed himself to placed down and rejected, disallowed, disobeyed. He has allowed himself to become that rock of offense. He has laid Himself down before us that after we have stumbled over him, but that we remember how we rejected him, our unbelief, and our doubts. He promised to be sin for us. To be our offense. He who knew no sin, became sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some people think they can just plow so deep there is know dirt left.
