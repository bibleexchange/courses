		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Absalom had fled from Jerusalem under fear of David&#39;s anger; he was after a time permitted to return, but he was not admitted into the presence of the king. Earnestly desiring to be restored to his former posts of honour and favour, he besought Joab to come to him, intending to request him to act as mediator. Joab, having lost his liking for the young prince, refused to come; and, though he was sent for repeatedly, he declined to attend at his desire. Absalom therefore thought of a most wicked, but most effective plan of bringing Joab into his company. He bade his servants set Joab&#39;s field of barley on fire. This brought Joab down in high wrath to ask the question, &quot;Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?&quot; This was all that, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Absalom wanted; he wished a hearing,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;The burning of the barley-field brought Joab into his presence, and Absalom&#39;s ends were accomplished. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">often done by our gracious God with the wisest and best design. Often he sendeth for us, not for his profit, but for ours; he would have us come near to him and receive a blessing at his hands, but we are foolish, and cold-hearted and wicked, and we will not come. He, knowing that we will not come by any other means, sendeth a serious trial&mdash;he sets our barley-field on fire, which he has a right to do, seeing our barley-fields are far more his than they are ours. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">in God&#39;s case he has a right to do as he wills with his own. He takes away from us our most choice delight, upon which we have set out heart, and then we enquire at, his hands, &quot;Wherefore contendest thou with me?&quot;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

			<span class="cs75A07D5F">Burning the barley field</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Now, just as Absolem dealt with Joab in order to bring him unto him, so God uses discipline very often in order to bring wayward hearts to Himself. Many a reader may have had his barley-field set on fire; there are some even now whose fields are wrapped in flames or are covered with the ashes of extinguished hopes. With backsliders this method is often God&#39;s last resorts. He sees that the wayward wanderers care more for their earthly possessions than they do for His honour or His service. So He touches them in the tenderest spot, and sweeps away the objects they love so well. They have become idolaters, and He sternly dashes their idols to atoms.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">
			<span class="cs75A07D5F">Compulsory measures</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">For two whole years Joab paid no attention to the returned son of David, but the moment his barley-field was set on fire he paid Absalom a visit of inquiry. It was crafty on the part of Absalom. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Perhaps he looked upon it as a last resort </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">But there is a spiritual use of this incident which is well worth considering. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Is it not so that when we will not go to God lovingly, voluntarily, He sets our barley-fields on fire, saying, Now they will pray? We desert His Church, we abandon His book, we release ourselves from all religious responsibilities; God calls, and we will not hear; then He sets all the harvest in a blaze, and we become religious instantaneously. We are richer if we have lost a barley-field, and found the God of the harvest. He will make up the barley-field to us, if so be we accept the providence aright, and say, &quot;This is God&#39;s thought concerning us.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
