There is not a person that can make themselves into a successful Christian. You cannot do it in yourself.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	John 12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. If you truly give your heart over to the Lord, you will be tested and challenged, but God is going to use you for His glory.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	John 8:12 Jesus is the light of the world. Isaiah 50:10,11 (Verse 11 speaks of the self-confident--those that do not feel the burning of the fire of God and try anyways to do &quot;something.&quot;) It is the Spirit of God and His Word in us and not something we kindle ourselves that will give us the power to destroy the works of darkness.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csE2DF19C1">True Christians are people that follow Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	We must see Him to follow Him (Acts 6:19). If we are going to be a voice of God in this hour, a vessel of mercy in the hands of Christ, we must recognize we have no light of our own and see Jesus for ourself and receive the light of life, Christ.</span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;	John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. I want to see Him clearer, know Him better because I am watching people that profess to know God, but have no light, do not walk in the Light, nor do they have the fire of God (Isaiah 50:10). They do not see God or know God and so try to get something worked up (Isaiah 47:14) We do not need the wood, hay and stubble of the flesh. You produce a spark, but no FIRE. There is a GENUINE fire of God that has already been kindled at the cross. Let us commit our heart and works into God&#39;s hands. (Prov.16:2) God&#39;s fire will put out your fire and you will lie in sorrow.</span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In Song of Solomon 8, there is a feast and great reunion to take place that will never be broken. If His light is in you it will produce fruit after His Divine nature. SOS 5:4 He showed Himself and there was an ache and excitement in her to find him after she had laid there. There should be such an ache in our heart: I MUST BE WITH HIM WHERE HE IS AT! </span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Can you be the vessel that God can speak through? The ambassador in Christ&#39;s stead? When </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">He</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> speaks there is life and victory.</span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Isaiah 50:1 It is our sin that separates us from God. We must not become discouraged because of the sinfulness of man. With the light of God in your soul you can shine light into their darkness. We cannot just say what feels good, but we must KNOW THUS SAITH THE LORD.</span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Proverbs 23:6 Before we can be an effective voice for God, we must give Him our heart. If we leave of observing His ways we walk in darkness and lay down in sorrow. Make sure God has your heart! Jeremiah 17:5-11 Speak against those thoughts of your flesh that boast in self and your own ability. You cannot know your own heart when it is evil and set on this world, but you give your heart to the Lord and He searches out your heart. When there is a waning of God&#39;s Spirit cry out giving God your heart. </span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csEF956D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When there is no word or fire from God don&#39;t just make noise, get HUNGRY! Your strength will not last and cannot endure against the circumstances of life. Build an altar and let God put His fire on it.</span></p></body>
