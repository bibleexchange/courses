He expresses it this way... </span><span class="cs29B3F8FD">&quot;I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes&quot; </span><span class="cs1769A51A">(Rom 1:16). This lesson is about the meaning, means, and method of that salvation. Paul&#39;s remarks about being </span><span class="cs29B3F8FD">&quot;predestined&quot; </span><span class="cs1769A51A">to salvation are more difficult. But at least they clearly imply that God has a predetermined purpose and plan (Rom 8:29-30). This lesson examines God&#39;s plan of salvation under three headings. </span></p><h1 class="cs778DBFE2">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1769A51A">Salvation is the state of being saved. A child rescued after it has fallen into a swimming pool, or someone pulled back who was about to walk in front of a bus, has experienced salvation. But what is it that we are saved from in the salvation Paul had in mind? The answer is, we are saved from the wrath of God in the day of judgment (Rom 2:5-11) . Everyone (including you) has the need of that salvation (Rom 3:23) .</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1769A51A">Some folk wrongly imagine that on judgment day God will put their good deeds in one side of his scales of justice, and their evil deeds on the other side of his scales, and their righteousness will balance their wickedness. But when they are </span><span class="cs29B3F8FD">&quot;weighed in the balances&quot; </span><span class="cs1769A51A">they will be </span><span class="cs29B3F8FD">&quot;found wanting&quot; </span><span class="cs1769A51A">because God will put all their deeds together in one side of his scales. In the other side of his scales he will put his perfect and holy law. They will fall short of this perfect standard, even if they are guilty of offending God&#39;s law in but one point. They will not stand justified before God (Rom 7:12, 3:19-20) .</span></p><h1 class="cs778DBFE2">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1769A51A">The problem has a solution (Rom 3:23, 7:22-25). We can be justified (and thus saved from God&#39;s wrath) through Jesus Christ. This salvation is possible by virtue of his death in which he shed his blood, his resurrection, ascension, and his intercession for us (Rom 5:6-11, 8:32-34) . Isn&#39;t that wonderful?</span></p><h1 class="cs778DBFE2">
