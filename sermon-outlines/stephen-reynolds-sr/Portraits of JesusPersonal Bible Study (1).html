We know this</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">man primarily through four Bible books: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. First&minus;hand acquaintance with</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">these writings will help us understand Jesus and His message.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">This course surveys Mark&#39;s narrative of Jesus&#39; life. As you study each lesson, please keep a Bible at</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">your side so that you can verify what you are learning by the Scriptures. You will notice that Mark is</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">divided into sixteen major sections (chapters), each of which contains small divisions (verses). When</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">a notation like 5:12 is used in these lessons, you should look at the fifth chapter of Mark and the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">twelfth verse.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">A couple of items before we get started: to profit most from these lessons, you need an open heart to</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">receive what Jesus taught and did. Allow His words to direct you as you read. A prayer for God&#39;s</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">1</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">guidance at the beginning and end of each study is recommended. If you don&#39;t understand something</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">mentioned in this course or in your reading of Mark, please feel free to write your question down and</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">send it to us along with your completed lesson. We&#39;ll be happy to answer it if we can.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF6DBE6B4">John Prepares the Way</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Read Mark 1:1&minus;8. &lt;&lt;&lt;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Please read Mark 1:1&minus;8 in your Bible before continuing the lesson. In the very first verse, Mark</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">announced that he would write about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. It is surprising, therefore, that he</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">did not start out by telling about Jesus Himself; instead, he described the work of John the Baptist.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">This was because John was to prepare the way for Jesus. John fulfilled this mission by preaching to</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">get people ready for the coming of the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">John&#39;s message focused on two themes that will help us get ready to receive Christ. First, he</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">preached about repentance. To repent means to decide to change. John was telling his hearers that</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">they had to reverse their life&#39;s direction to get ready for Christ; those unwilling to change could not</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">come to Him. Second, John declared the greatness of Jesus. He said Jesus was so great that he</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">himself was not even worthy to stoop down and untie His shoes. This was an amazing declaration</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">because one does not have to have much worth to untie somebody&#39;s shoes. In fact, in John&#39;s day,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">untying shoes was considered to be a slave&#39;s lowest duty &minus; John wasn&#39;t worthy to be Jesus&#39; humblest</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">slave! So, for us to be ready to receive Jesus, we must repent (change our lives) and recognize His</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">awesome greatness.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*1* John came to prepare the way for whom? (a) Moses, (b) Mohammed, (c) Jesus, (d) Peter.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Answer: (put the letter of the correct answer in the blank) ______.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*2* What word in our study means &quot;to decide to change&quot;? Answer: The word is (put the correct</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">word[s] in the blank) ______ .</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*3* John said he was unworthy to: a) untie Jesus&#39; shoes; b) carry Jesus&#39; bags; c) stand beside Jesus;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">d) talk to Jesus. Answer : ______.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF6DBE6B4">Early Events in Jesus&#39; Career</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Read Mark 1:9&minus;15. &lt;&lt;&lt;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Just like thousands of others, Jesus came to John to be baptized. But as He emerged from the water,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">something startling occurred: The Holy Spirit came down upon Him in the form of a dove and a voice</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">from heaven said, &quot;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot; God was showing His</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">approval of Jesus in a dramatic way.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Then Jesus entered the wilderness where the devil tempted Him. While Matthew and Luke provide</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">more specific information about the temptations (Matthew 4; Luke 4), Mark&#39;s brief account shows two</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">things. First, Jesus experienced temptation as all men do. Second, doing what pleases God, as Jesus</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">did when He was baptized, does not exempt one from temptation. Satan often intensifies his efforts</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">when a person begins to serve God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*4&amp;5* What two amazing things happened when Jesus was baptized? Answer: The ______ came on</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Him in a form like a dove, and a voice spoke from ______ saying, &quot;This is my beloved Son.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*6* Where was Jesus baptized (v9)? Answer: He was baptized in the ______ River.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">2</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*7* For how many days was Jesus tempted by Satan in the wilderness (v13; cf. Luke 4:1,2)? Answer:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">______ days (give a number).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*8* What message did Jesus preach (v15)? Answer: He told people to repent and believe in the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">______.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF6DBE6B4">Jesus Calls Four Fishermen</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Read Mark 1:16&minus;20. &lt;&lt;&lt;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">As Jesus walked along, He saw two of His friends, Peter and Andrew, who were professional</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">fishermen. He asked them to follow Him and become fishers of men. At once, they quit their jobs and</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">began following Christ. He next found James and John, and requested that they do the same. With</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">no hesitation, they left not only their occupation but also their father, and began to accompany the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Lord. Clearly, these men recognized Jesus&#39; greatness. He was the one whose shoes John was</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">unworthy to untie. God had specially acknowledged Him by His own voice from heaven. So when</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Jesus demanded radical action (to drop everything and follow Him), they responded immediately.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE5F3F462">Note &minus;&minus; Characteristics of followers of Jesus: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">These fishermen demonstrated the meaning of</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">discipleship. When Jesus called, they: 1) acted immediately, 2) left both job and family, and 3) started</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">following Him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">Christ calls today through His Word. When we perceive His greatness, we too will: 1) obey</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">immediately all He says, 2) put Him ahead of everything, including our job and family, and 3) follow</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">Him, allowing His example to direct every step.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">People who know that Jesus wants them to change, but put it off, are not like these four fishermen.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*9* Which of these things did the disciples </span><span class="csE5F3F462">not </span><span class="csA7555675">do when Jesus called them? a) decide immediately; b)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">leave family and job; c) follow Jesus; d) go to school for training. Answer: ___d___.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">*10* What did Jesus say He would make these men (v17)? Answer: He would make them fishers of</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">__men____.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF6DBE6B4">Jesus Amazes the Crowds</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE5F3F462">&gt;&gt;&gt; Read Mark 1:21&minus;28. &lt;&lt;&lt;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Jesus&#39; teaching astounded the multitude in the synagogue (a synagogue was like a church among the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Jews). He taught with authority. He issued His commands as if He had the right to tell others exactly</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">what to do!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Jesus&#39; actions showed that He really had the authority that He claimed. In this paragraph, He cast out</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">a demon. How? By His words! Nothing more. When Jesus merely said, &quot;Be quiet and come out of</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">him,&quot; the demon left the man. His words had authority even over demons. The calmness with which</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Jesus expelled demons reflected His power: He never argued or struggled or created a scene. He</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">simply ordered the demons to leave and they left. No wonder people were amazed. He had</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">demonstrated the credentials to prove His authority.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE5F3F462">Note &minus;&minus; Need for authority: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">In every area, authority is essential. To determine distance, it is</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">necessary to have a yardstick or standard of measure by which to calculate length. Thus, if someone</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">wishes to know how long a room is, he measures it. There is no other way to know for sure. God has</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">3</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">provided a yardstick in religion: Jesus and His words. When we wish to know whether something is</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">right or wrong, we should evaluate it by the standard of the Scriptures. This should be done with</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">every teacher and teaching &minus; even this correspondence course. Therefore, you need to have a Bible</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">at your side while you are studying, and continually refer to it to be sure that what is taught in these</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5FB87F7">lessons is true.

He spoke to her, raised her up, and the fever left her. She then began waiting on Jesus</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">and the disciples. He also healed many others who were brought to Him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Several features of Jesus&#39; healings are noteworthy:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">* He healed immediately, with no delay.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">* He healed everyone who came to Him regardless of their disease.

Prayer during the daytime was nearly impossible since</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">the crowds continually pressed on Him, so He skipped sleep to be able to talk with His Father that He</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">4</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">missed so much.

Those who contracted it were quarantined</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">because the disease was highly contagious. In this story, Jesus did what no one else dared do &minus; He</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">touched a leper. When He did so, the man was healed immediately. His sores were instantly</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">transformed into smooth skin. The Lord then instructed the cleansed leper to report his healing to the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">priest (a requirement of the law of Moses &minus; Leviticus 13&minus;14), but to tell no one else. The man,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">however, went out and told everyone &minus; the exact opposite of what Jesus had said. Undoubtedly he</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">was thrilled that he had been healed and probably imagined that spreading the news about Jesus</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">would honor Him. But the fact remains that he did just what Jesus had said not to do. As a result, the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Lord was thronged by such large crowds that He could no longer publicly enter into cities, but had to</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">remain in unpopulated areas.
