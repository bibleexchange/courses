If a person lives a hypocritical life, feeling that he is safe and secure, immune from God&#39;s judgment&mdash;that person will bear the awesome weight of God&#39;s terrifying judgment. Note what Moses declared:</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord will never forgive him and will blot his name out from under heaven (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A20"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:20</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).

The answer is given above: because the person turned away from the Lord, turned away to false worship, to worship the gods of this world. By so turning away, he misled others to turn away from God and to engage in false worship. He became a hypocrite, claiming to follow God, while all the time he was following a false, lifeless, and senseless god. Following the false god, he felt safe and secure, immune from the holy judgment of the only living and true God. But the judgment of God is sure: this person will suffer all the curses of God&#39;s judgment.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses declares that the nation of Israel will become a spectacle (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A22-23"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:22-23</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Note that this is a prediction of what will happen to Israel in the future. The people will be chastised as a nation because they allowed idolatry to infiltrate and permeate the nation, because they allowed so many to be swept away by the hypocrites, swept away into false worship. The judgment upon the nation will be severe:</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;The land will suffer calamity after calamity and disease after disease (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A22"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:22</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;The land will become a burning waste, unproductive, with no vegetation growing (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A23"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:23</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;The land will suffer the same destruction that fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A23"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:23</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment will be so fierce and catastrophic that people will question why (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A24-28"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:24-28</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Very simply, the answer will be because the people broke the covenant of the Lord God. The people broke the promise they made to God when He saved them from Egypt (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A25"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:25</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Remember, this is a symbol of the believer being saved from the enslavement of the world. The Israelites broke their promise, turning away from the Lord to false gods and false worship. Tragically, they abandoned their commitment and covenant with the Lord.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">The result of their apostasy would be catastrophic and tragic: the Lord&#39;s anger would burn against them and devastate the land itself. In furious anger and wrath, the Lord would allow a nation to conquer and uproot them. They would be transported into a foreign nation. The people of Israel would be conquered and taken as slaves into the foreign nation (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A28"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:28</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prediction of these things are said to be &quot;secret things&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+29%3A29"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 29:29</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). They belong to the Lord and are known only by Him. The hypocritical spirit and apostasy of the Israelites would happen just as God reveals in Holy Scripture. The judgment upon Israel would also happen just as God predicted and history has now shown. But when the events were revealed for the first time here in Scripture&mdash;back in the days of Deuteronomy&mdash;they were secret things. The fact that they would actually happen, especially to those standing there before Moses, was incomprehensible. But today, history has shown that they did happen.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Now note this fact: Moses declares that the things revealed in God&#39;s Holy Word belong to us. But God has revealed them to us for a very specific purpose: that we may follow His Holy Word, keep His commandments.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="cs87110596">Thought 1</span><span class="csC05134DD">. The judgment of God will fall upon any person who lives a hypocritical life. No matter what a person professes, if he does not live for Christ, following and obeying Him, he will suffer the judgment of God. But not only the hypocrite: the idolater and false worshipper will also bear the judgment of God. The judgment of God is sure: the wrath of God will be executed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, in particular against those who hold the truth in unrighteousness.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+1%3A18"><span class="csE9323467">Romans 1:18</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth </span><span class="csEF62482">his</span><span class="cs821257DA"> sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+25%3A31-33"><span class="csE9323467">Matthew 25:31-33</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+3%3A36"><span class="csE9323467">John 3:36</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+2%3A8"><span class="csE9323467">Romans 2:8</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
