Some people shrink back when they hear the word humility mentioned. When they think of humility, they picture a shy, weak, unimpressive type of person. But this is not what God means by humility. The humility demanded by God strengthens a person and makes him one of the most striking and impressive persons around.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Before Honor is Humility</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Pr 15:33 &para; The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;Pr 18:12 &para; Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Before Humility is submission/obedience, surrender, giving in</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Subjection takes concentration and effort. It takes a deliberate decision to subject to someone else. But this is just what Scripture is demanding. Every believer is unique to God and has a very special gift and contribution to make to the world and to the church. All believers are to subject themselves to one another, to each one&#39;s uniqueness and gift. All believers are to acknowledge, respect, and honor one another, all because of who each one is and because of the gift God has given each one of us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Why Pride is a problem? They won&rsquo;t share in others&rsquo; gifts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">To be subject to one another is not enough, not for God. Scripture says that we must also &quot;be clothed with humility.&quot; The phrase &quot;be clothed&quot; means to gird oneself with an apron. It is the picture of what Jesus did in the upper room when He girded Himself with an apron and assumed the role of a servant and washed the feet of the disciples. Jesus, the Son of God and Sovereign Majesty of the universe, actually clothed Himself with the apron of humility and served the disciples. And, when he finished, He said:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">John 13:13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another&#39;s feet.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Humility means to offer oneself lowly and submissive; to walk in a spirit of lowliness; to present oneself as lowly; to act of low degree and low rank. It is the opposite of being high-minded, above and better than others, prideful, arrogant, superior, haughty, and self-assertive. The believer may have a high position, power, wealth, fame, and much more; but he is to carry himself in a spirit of lowliness and submission. He is to deny himself for the sake of Christ and in order to help others.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
