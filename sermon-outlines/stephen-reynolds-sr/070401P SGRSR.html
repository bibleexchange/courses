God has some things that He wants to do, but can&rsquo;t because men do not understand the will of God. We need to know the will of God. The Holy Ghost is real and will exalt Jesus.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Returning the king back</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a false spirit in the land counterfeiting the real. Absalom tried by way of the flesh to get the people to accept and receive him.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Lord wants to be king in our life.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a place that only the Lord can fill in our life. Israel looked for a man to fill that place of king. God does have a place to anoint men for his honor and His cause. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People often get caught on the service and really feel that what they are doing is the will of God, but God is working far beneath the service. We often hinder God&rsquo;s working and glorifying Him. All the people were at strife. It is equal to the task&mdash;in glorifying Christ as Israel did&mdash;that He is more than a man and He has a plan beyond this natural.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God has some things for His people beyond what they seek Him for.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">David here is a type of the king coming into Jerusalem. (Matthew 21:1-16)</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We are not just to get into a realm to understand Him today, but there is a spirit amongst the crowd set to deceive and to destroy and to abuse us. There is a false spirit. Not everything that comes upon you is of God. These points are very strong and very needed. There is a place in God if we can exalt his mercy. Understand holiness living, being kind. We need to understand these and have them applied to our hearts. It is not a matter of what I can do, but that God&rsquo;s will be accomplished.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The strife is real, is hard, is difficult and is separating the people.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">II Samuel 19:40 half, broken down the middle, debating, striving, dividing</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs67CC4EE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">DAVID WAS A MAN THAT WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN </span></p><p class="cs67CC4EE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">TO A POSITION THAT HE WAS DRIVEN OUT OF.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As we see David restored we see OTHER men forgiven and restored.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we are going to be anything for God we must first be a SERVANT FAITHFULLY serving Him. Right here and now. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Absalom fought against David and drove him out of position. God brought him back. David didn&rsquo;t do things for naught but was a praying man. He wasn&rsquo;t a compromiser. He dealt with momentary doubts but David was a warrior. GOD IS GOING TO ALLOW ME TO RETURN. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Asa lived loose and did not guard himself properly. But the greatness of God restored the man. IN HIS MERCY. We msut keep and GUARD what God in His mercy provides us. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Joab was rebellious.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Shimei was the man that disdained David. The Lord, v.16-20 allowed him to return. He was looking for mercy and forgiveness, but David in verse 22 was quick to give it. David said God&rsquo;s been merciful to ME to return to give me this place. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Saul of Tarsus declared as Paul that God has been merciful to me to give him the place to preach the Gospel and to show mercy to others. THE GOSPEL OF GRACE that enables men to depart from iniquity. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Amasa was so loose that he waas left wallowing in his own blood by a Joab always watching for opportunity to destroy. Amasa was careless in guarding his soul. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People want a lot of people to come back and a lot of people in position.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">BUT HOW DANGEROUS IS THIS???</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Joab was overall Israel, 20:23, We need to have men of principle in principle places. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
