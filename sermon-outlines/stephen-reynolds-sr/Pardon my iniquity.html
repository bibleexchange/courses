H. Stewart told me of a scene that occurred in a Pennsylvania prison, when Governor Pollock, a Christian man, was Governor of the State. A man was tried for murder, and the judge had pronounced sentence upon him. His friends had tried every means in their power to procure his pardon. They had sent deputation after deputation to the Governor, but he had told them all that the law must take its course. When they began to give up hope, the Governor went down to the prison and asked the sheriff to take him to the cell of the condemned man. The Governor was conducted into the presence of the criminal, and he sat down by the side of his bed and began to talk to him kindly&mdash;spoke to him of Christ and heaven, and showed him that although he was condemned to die on the morrow by earthly judges, he would receive eternal life from the Divine Judge if he would accept salvation. He explained the plan of salvation, and when he left him he committed him to God. When he was gone the sheriff was called to the cell by the condemned man. &quot;Who was that man?&quot; asked the criminal, &quot;who was in here and talked so kind to me?&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; said the sheriff, &quot;that was Governor Pollock.&quot; &quot;Was that Governor Pollock? O Sheriff, why didn&#39;t you tell me who it was? If I had known that was him, I wouldn&#39;t have let him go out till he had given me pardon. The Governor has been here&mdash;in my cell&mdash;and I didn&#39;t know it,&quot; and the man wrung his hands and wept bitterly. My friends, there is one greater than a Governor here to-night. He sent His Son to redeem you&mdash;to bring you out of the prison home of sin. I come to-night to tell you He is here.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
