God longs for our worship and praise. It is the very reason He created us and saved us. Note a significant point: a divided church cannot worship God. This is exactly what is being said. A church has to be of one mind and mouth to worship God. If a people are not of one mind and mouth, God is not glorified; He is not worshipped.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Every one of us must work for the harmony of the church so that we may be of one mind and fulfill the very purpose for our existence: to glorify God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">2Co 13:11 Finally, brethren, farewell.

The leaders and members of a church usually have joy in Christ, but their joy can be fulfilled only if unity exists between them. Joy is always disturbed when there is criticism, dissatisfaction, grumbling, murmuring, cliques, opposition, and a host of other divisive negatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are to worship, plan, organize, program, build, staff, finance, minister, and serve in the joy of Christ.

Fellowship among believers &nbsp;deteriorates among division and dissension in the ranks: verbal accusations, differing opinions, competitive positions, power struggles, envy, contention, grumbling, griping, complaining, murmuring, quarreling, attacking, and gossiping. Believer stood against believer, no give in any corner. Disaster could strike; the church was divided and a severe split was threatened.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Division was the first problem dealt with by Paul. It had to be dealt with first, for a house divided against itself cannot stand. There were other problems in the church, other matters that had to be handled, but the people could not handle them unless they were brought together in one spirit and mind. The ministry and mission of the church could not effectively go on until the people stood together. Worship, exhortation, missions, and reaching and ministering to people&mdash;the very cause of Christ, the very reason He came to earth and died&mdash;was affected and would continue to suffer until the people were brought together.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">There is an answer to every division, no matter how severe and threatening. In fact, the Holy Spirit through Paul gives eleven answers or solutions to division within the church. </span></p><p class="cs1DE0E72"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The cross (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">1:17-25</span><span class="csA521DC07">)</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="csA521DC07">1Co 1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;
