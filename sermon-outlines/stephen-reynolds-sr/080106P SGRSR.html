And I brought it to work to a man. Ken this is the only bible you need to read until you get saved because all you want to do is argue. I saw him 20 years later. I still believe what I always believed. He knew there was something real that is why he tried to fight us hard. Why he does I do not know. The wicked are like the troubled waves of the sea. They didn&rsquo;t have the ability to be barren. They went out and they adopted trouble. She was a women so nice and even so nice she couldn&rsquo;t even put up with him. NO rest no peacec just turning up division and strife. AS you grow and develop. The righteous perish and no man layeth it to heart. And the merciful man is taking away. It seems like they don&rsquo;t even care to see goood men God. As a matter fact they are glad. Showing that the rightoues face eternity with peace in verse two he shall enter into peace. In the last part of verse two walking in his uprightness walking obedient to the Lord the righteous that walk with God in truth. In verse 3 but draw near hiher ye sonos of sorceress there is a different seed. There lip service may be but there heart is wicked. The seed of the audulterer. Do ye spor tyourselves. Are not the childer of transgression a seed of falsehood. Prepare yourself to be a clear witness a righteous man. It is going to take the word of God to walk uprightly and mercifully. Men are going to open their mouth wide with demonic activity and powe rin their lips devising evil converstation against you to destroy you. There is an adversary against those that walk uprightly. There is an adversary against you. In recognizing that we don&rsquo;t have to be so quick to defend ourselves and fall into a snare to say things out of place. They made scorn of Christ, derieded him, but he opened not his mouth. WHY? Because we were guilty and he was taking our place. He is what he said He is. He is the saviour. You do&rsquo;t heal by fighting and defending yourself. He puts it into our heart to change us. That word creates and transforms it is a glorifying process so because of his great power we can declare his goodness. Peace peacec peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace peace say what his words says. You cannot be inspired of God with peace and continue the way of the world. It is better for a man to know the ways of righteousness than to know it and turn from it. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Though they come with all there ideas.
