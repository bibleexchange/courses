		<p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs5E43D023">O</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">n Nov. 13, 2013, we filmed an episode of the </span><span class="csB642136F">Key of David</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> television program that I developed around Ezekiel 38:1-2. Those scriptures say, &ldquo;Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying, &lsquo;Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him&rsquo;&rdquo; (New King James Version). </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">In that episode, which was broadcast on November 24, I showed that this is an end-time prophecy, and stressed my belief that this prophesied Eastern leader&mdash;which God inspired Ezekiel to write about 2,500 years ago&mdash;</span><span class="csF2CAA584">is in power today</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">. I said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was almost certainly going to be the &ldquo;prince of Rosh&rdquo; that this and other biblical passages say will rise up in this end time, revive Russian power, and &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; Europe (Daniel 11:44). This information also formed the basis of my cover story in last month&rsquo;s </span><span class="csB642136F">Trumpet</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> edition. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Then, </span><span class="csB642136F">in the days after that episode was filmed,</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> events took place in Russia and Europe that strengthened that explanation. </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">T</span><span class="csF2CAA584">he events showed that these prophecies are marching rapidly toward complete fulfillment</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">! </span></p><p class="cs81E27573"><span class="cs7F41AF6D">A History-Altering U-Turn </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Ever since Europe&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership program began in 2009, Ukraine has been working to join it. The plan was for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to make everything official on Nov. 29, 2013, by signing the deal with the EU. But on November 21, </span><span class="csB642136F">just a week after that Key of David was filmed,</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> Yanukovych abruptly announced that he </span><span class="csF2CAA584">would not</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> sign the agreement. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Many pundits and analysts were shocked. They had thought Ukraine would make the deal and become part of the EU, or at least become allied with it in some fashion. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Why did the Ukrainian president make such a dramatic U-turn? </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">It emerged in late November that Mr. Yanukovych had secretly flown to Moscow early in the month to meet with President Putin. No journalists or analysts knew anything about this meeting until November 21 when Yanukovych announced the landmark withdrawal. At the time that I wrote and recorded that </span><span class="csB642136F">Key of David</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> episode, the meeting was still a complete secret. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">For years, Mr. Putin has threatened and bullied Ukraine. Ukraine is dependent on Russia for its natural gas needs, and three separate times during harsh winters, Moscow has shut off gas flows to Ukraine. In recent months, Putin has tightened the screws, stopping shipments of Ukrainian goods and pressuring the nation, which depends heavily on the Russian market. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">This long-term strategy nudged Ukraine dangerously close to financial collapse. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">At this secret meeting in early November, Putin apparently agreed to ease up on these crippling measures. He also offered Yanukovych some rich financial rewards that would help him hold on to his power&mdash;if the Ukrainian president would pull out of the EU deal. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Experts agree that it was </span><span class="csF2CAA584">these tactics</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> that caused Ukraine to pull out! &ldquo;[T]he unprecedented pressure from the Russians was the decisive factor,&rdquo; said former Polish president and intermediary Aleksander Kwasniewski. &ldquo;The Russians used everything in their arsenal.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs81E27573"><span class="cs7F41AF6D">What Does It Mean? </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">After Yanukovych&rsquo;s announcement, about half a million Ukrainians took to the streets of Kiev for mass demonstrations. These people did not want to go back to mother Russia, and did not want to be a part of Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s strategy. For weeks, they protested and demanded Yanukovych&rsquo;s resignation. These protests continue even as I write, and have become violent. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">So what does it all mean? </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Putin has long known that if Ukraine allies with Europe, it would significantly diminish his power. His ultimate goal is to resurrect the Soviet empire. The architecture of that empire was built around Ukraine being a part of it. Ukraine is the breadbasket of Russia. To this day, Russia&rsquo;s largest military base outside its own borders is in Ukraine. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Putin applied all that pressure on Ukraine because that nation is the </span><span class="csB642136F">linchpin</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> of his goal of a renewed imperial Russia! A linchpin is the pin in an axle that keeps the wheel from coming off. Mr. Putin was doing everything in his power to keep the wheels from falling off his dream of a new Soviet empire. And that meant applying intense pressure on Ukraine. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="csE4A98CD4">T</span><span class="csF2CAA584">he fact that one man</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">&mdash;</span><span class="csB642136F">one man</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">&mdash;</span><span class="csF2CAA584">is responsible for this huge geopolitical shift is deeply significant</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">. It wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without him using his power and having the will to step out and </span><span class="csF2CAA584">shake the nations</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">, as Haggai says. (Order a copy of our free booklet <a class="csDC101810" href="http://www.thetrumpet.com/literature/1085/haggai-god-has-begun-to-shake-the-nations" target="_blank"><span class="cs5603B172">Haggai: God Has Begun to Shake the Nations</span></a></span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> to understand what this means.) </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Some leading analysts and journalists have called Putin&rsquo;s move on Ukraine a </span><span class="csF2CAA584">monumental</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> crisis. The American media didn&rsquo;t say much about it, but it is nevertheless something that will </span><span class="csB642136F">change the course of world history</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">. It is taking us a </span><span class="csF2CAA584">giant step</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> closer to World War </span><span class="csF2CAA584">iii</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">! Bible prophecy explains what is happening in Ukraine, and gives vital insight into what is </span><span class="csF2CAA584">behind</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> it all. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s goal is to restore the Soviet Union. And pulling Ukraine back into Moscow&rsquo;s orbit is the linchpin of that goal! In light of this understanding, Ezekiel 38:1-2 take on astounding meaning. </span></p><p class="cs81E27573"><span class="cs7F41AF6D">Europe&rsquo;s Response </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Mats Persson, director of the Open Europe think tank, said </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">U</span><span class="csF2CAA584">kraine&rsquo;s decision was a colossal defeat for the </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">E</span><span class="csF2CAA584">uropean </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">U</span><span class="csF2CAA584">nion</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">. &ldquo;The lesson is that EU&rsquo;s soft-power diplomacy has hit its limits,&rdquo; wrote Ambrose Evans-Pritchard. &ldquo;Playing carrot and stick doesn&rsquo;t work when you come up against a real hard power like Russia. </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">T</span><span class="csF2CAA584">his is a highly significant moment</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">&rdquo; (</span><span class="csB642136F">Telegraph,</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> Nov. 22, 2013; emphasis mine throughout). </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">It is &ldquo;a highly significant moment&rdquo; that could cause Germany and Europe to seek a strong leader to counter Putin. Franz Joseph Strauss, a famous German politician in the recent past, said that Germany usually seeks a strongman for emergencies. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Evans-Pritchard made these comments just one day after Yanukovych&rsquo;s announcement: &ldquo;Twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine is slipping back under Kremlin control. Ukraine&rsquo;s shock decision to opt for Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s Russia and pull out of EU talks on the eve of an historic deal is a dramatic upset to the European balance of power&rdquo; (ibid). </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">What does that mean if the whole balance of power is upset? </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">I</span><span class="csF2CAA584">t means the course of world history has changed</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">! That&rsquo;s what Evans-Pritchard is saying, and it is true! The pullout is incredibly damaging to the EU&rsquo;s prestige and power. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">What is Europe going to do about it? </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">So far neither Europe nor America has done much about Russia&rsquo;s bullying. For the United States, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect that to change. But in that television program filmed back on November 13, I warned that </span><span class="csB642136F">Europe&rsquo;s attention</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> would soon be captured by Putin&rsquo;s recent behavior&mdash;especially in Ukraine! </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">In my article last month, I elaborated on this warning: &ldquo;[Putin] rattled some European leaders to their core. &hellip; </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">E</span><span class="csF2CAA584">urope is deeply alarmed by what happened</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> to this country that is right in its own neighborhood! The changes this crisis provokes in Germany and Europe will shake the nations! The Ukraine debacle has taken us a giant step closer to World War </span><span class="csF2CAA584">iii</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">! &hellip; If you study Moscow&rsquo;s foreign policy under Putin&rsquo;s leadership, it is plain that the ultimate goal is to eventually conquer the whole world. Europe is certainly aware of this goal and is closely watching its neighbor to the east&rdquo; (&ldquo;<a class="csDC101810" href="http://www.thetrumpet.com/article/11228.30958.161.0/asia/russia/is-vladimir-putin-the-prophesied-prince-of-rosh" target="_blank"><span class="cs5603B172">Is Vladimir Putin the Prophesied &lsquo;Prince of Rosh&rsquo;?</span></a></span><span class="cs11B07D4D">&rdquo;). </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="csB642136F">Just a couple of weeks after that was written</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">, a certain European leader&mdash;a man the </span><span class="csB642136F">Trumpet</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> has been studying for some time&mdash;revealed that he is deeply aware of Russia&rsquo;s imperialist motives. </span></p><p class="cs81E27573"><span class="cs7F41AF6D">Leadership Vacuum </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">&ldquo;Putin Is Basking in an &lsquo;Astonishing Leadership Vacuum&rsquo;&rdquo; was the title of an opinion article that Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg wrote (with Garry Kasparov) for </span><span class="csB642136F">Time</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> on January 6. The article revealed that Mr. Guttenberg is very aware of Russia&rsquo;s ambitious goals. He is </span><span class="csF2CAA584">&ldquo;closely watching&rdquo;</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> Moscow, just as I had said that discerning European leaders would. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Here is some of what Guttenberg wrote: &ldquo;Since Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s official return to power in 2012, the Russian president seems to have set his mind on teaching the rest of the world &hellip; that he shall not be underestimated on the international stage [and] that Moscow will keep reasserting control over what it considers to be its legitimate sphere of influence for Russia. &hellip; From Syria and the Snowden saga to blatant human-rights violations and, </span><span class="csB642136F">most recently, pressuring Ukraine&rsquo;s leadership into a sudden change of heart on its association with the EU,</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> Putin has managed to bedevil the West all year long. &hellip; When it comes to the honorable title of Bully of the Year, the Russian president surely triumphed in 2013.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Mr. Guttenberg explained the main cause: &ldquo;The primary reason for Putin&rsquo;s self-aggrandizing behavior is the </span><span class="csB642136F">astonishing leadership vacuum</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> in the world.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Guttenberg can see that America is in retreat. That is the main cause for the leadership vacuum he is talking about. It can no longer be looked to for displays of real force. So, he proposes another solution! Guttenberg says Putin&rsquo;s bullying means it&rsquo;s time for </span><span class="csB642136F">Europe</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> to take action. Putin has &ldquo;achieved what no pleas from the U.S. president or fellow European leaders could do: </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">G</span><span class="csF2CAA584">ermany finally assumed leadership on a difficult foreign-policy issue. &hellip; </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">R</span><span class="csF2CAA584">ussia&rsquo;s behavior toward </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">U</span><span class="csF2CAA584">kraine might hand </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">E</span><span class="csF2CAA584">urope an opportunity to become more united and effective in its foreign policy</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">&rdquo; (ibid). </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Bible prophecy says this is precisely what will happen! </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Scripture shows that Russia&rsquo;s resurgence will cause Europe to unite in a way that this world can&rsquo;t even imagine. It will help mold Europe into the seventh and final resurrection of the biblically prophesied Holy Roman Empire. This means that the darkest time mankind has ever seen is extremely close! But it&rsquo;s going to lead to the best news this world has </span><span class="csB642136F">ever</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> experienced: </span><span class="csF2CAA584">the return of the </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">M</span><span class="csF2CAA584">essiah to end all of man&rsquo;s suffering</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">. The Bible contains more than a hundred prophecies that tell us that! And yet you hear almost nothing about them. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">The European Union has 28 nations now, but such scriptures as Revelation 17:12 show that it is going to be reduced to 10 &ldquo;kings.&rdquo; The Bible says 10 kings are going to rule over that Holy Roman Empire led by Germany, and we&rsquo;ve been proclaiming that for some 70 years. The Scriptures reveal that it is going to be a church-state combine, and it will be a </span><span class="csB642136F">real</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> superpower. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Biblical passages such as Daniel 8:23 and Isaiah 10:7 prophesy of a strongman who will rise up to lead Europe through this final crusade in the years just ahead. At the </span><span class="csB642136F">Trumpet, we have long viewed Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the former defense minister of Germany, as the likeliest candidate to become this prophesied strong leader</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> (&ldquo;<a class="csDC101810" href="http://www.thetrumpet.com/article/11331.31175.162.0/europe/germany/the-brilliance-of-karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg" target="_blank"><span class="cs5603B172">The Brilliance of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg</span></a></span><span class="cs11B07D4D">&rdquo;). </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">That is why this one act by Vladimir Putin is having such a momentous impact. It is building to history-altering events! We need to continue to watch Europe, and see how individuals like Mr. Guttenberg respond. World events are moving just like a flash of lightning these days. We need to be aware of what&rsquo;s happening. </span></p><p class="cs81E27573"><span class="cs7F41AF6D">Two Individuals </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Did you notice that there is a second individual discussed in Ezekiel 38:1-2? This is an Ezekiel-type that God calls &ldquo;son of man.&rdquo; God tells this individual to proclaim the message of Ezekiel 38 in the end time. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">So there are actually two individuals discussed here: the prince of Rosh, and the man commanded to proclaim the message about him. Two specific individuals! Can you believe that God would get that specific in the Bible? And He tells us we are to live by </span><span class="csB642136F">every word of God</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> (Deuteronomy 8:3; Matthew 4:4). </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Ezekiel 33:33 says that at a certain future time, people will finally &ldquo;know that a prophet hath been among them.&rdquo; They will know it </span><span class="csB642136F">after</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> these events come to pass. At that point it will be too late for them to be protected physically, but not spiritually. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Verse 7 of that same chapter speaks of a &ldquo;watchman.&rdquo; This same individual who is called a </span><span class="csB642136F">prophet</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> in verse 33 is called a </span><span class="csB642136F">watchman</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> here. He is also the same individual God commands in Ezekiel 38:2 to watch what is happening in Russia, Ukraine, Europe and elsewhere, and to </span><span class="csF2CAA584">warn</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> people about it! In Ezekiel 33:7, God says, &ldquo;I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt </span><span class="csB642136F">hear the word at my mouth,</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> and </span><span class="csF2CAA584">warn them from me</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">.&rdquo; This is not the word of man&mdash;it comes right from God&rsquo;s mouth! That is really significant. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="csE4A98CD4">T</span><span class="csF2CAA584">he </span><span class="csE4A98CD4">B</span><span class="csF2CAA584">ible comes alive when we can understand specific prophecies like this</span><span class="cs11B07D4D">! </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Is it just coincidence that Putin yanked Ukraine away from the EU right after our program was filmed and just around the time that it aired? Is it a coincidence that Baron Guttenberg responded to Putin&rsquo;s bullying with such eloquence and force so soon after that program was broadcast? Maybe it was. But if you are proclaiming God&rsquo;s prophecies, then God is going to work </span><span class="csF2CAA584">with</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> that message and bring events into sync to support His messenger. After all, it is </span><span class="csB642136F">God</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> who tells this &ldquo;son of man&rdquo; to warn the world of what is happening in Russia and what is coming upon the world. If a man is speaking about God&rsquo;s prophecies, you can be sure God is going to help him in many ways. I think a lot of what happened was orchestrated according to God&rsquo;s perfect timing. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">In light of the </span><span class="csB642136F">Key of David</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> program I gave about Mr. Putin, and the way the Ukraine crisis suddenly exploded </span><span class="csB642136F">just after</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> it, the identity of the second individual becomes hard to deny. God&rsquo;s very elect surely will know who these two individuals in Ezekiel 38:1-2 are. And that will tell them where God&rsquo;s work is, where God&rsquo;s message is, where God&rsquo;s fulfilled prophecy is, and where God&rsquo;s revelation is! </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">We have to realize that this is all </span><span class="csF2CAA584">good news</span><span class="cs11B07D4D"> because Jesus Christ is going to return to this Earth at the very end of this clash between the Putin-led Eastern power and the German-led European power, which could very likely be led by Mr. Guttenberg. Those two powers are going to be destroyed by Jesus Christ Himself! The Messiah will intervene, or else there would be no flesh saved alive, according to Matthew 24:21-22. </span></p><p class="cs6CD5348"><span class="cs11B07D4D">Jesus Christ is about to return&mdash;biblical prophecy makes that clear. Surely we ought to be studying our Bibles and understanding those prophecies.
