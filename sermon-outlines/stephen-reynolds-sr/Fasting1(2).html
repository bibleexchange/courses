In this situation God commanded the people to fast by not speaking.

When Peter said, &quot;These are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day,&quot; he was actually saying they were not eating or drinking. This was a holy day, and they were fasting until 3 o&rsquo;clock; it was only 9 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Fast for faith for Revival with God&rsquo;s promise from His Word.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">4. Fasting puts us in a position to do the Will of God (Romans 12:1,2).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">We are to present our bodies unto God. One way we do so is through fasting. When we fast we do it as unto the Lord. We experience hunger and sacrifice pleasures so we may draw closer to God. Fasting is not the answer&mdash;Jesus is; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Fasting puts us in a place to receive more of Jesus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God promises to show us His good, acceptable, and perfect will. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">To renew your mind, first begin devouring the Word of God every day. Secondly, you must fast. Fasting is much more than suffering a few hunger pains and not eating food. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Fasting is a mental discipline. It is much more difficult to fast mentally than it is physically. Through this process comes a renewal of the mind, a discipline of the mind, a desire to know the perfect will of God.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Fasting for Recovery, Revival and </span><span class="csF42C4B08">against all</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Reluctance; Unwillingness, Foot-dragging, Hesitancy, Lack of enthusiasm, Refusal, rebuttal, rebellion, selfishness, stubbornness.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">5.

They flee from you. Be not afraid. You have the name of Jesus. Power becomes greatly multiplied in your life when you seek Him in prayer and fasting.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">WARNING!!! Unless there is a breakthrough many will not remain in church, and some will leave the ministry. Victory belongs to you, and fasting is one of the keys to help bring it into your life and ministry.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The difference between what our Christianity ought to be and what it actually is; comes down to a lack of prayer and fasting. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Fasting for Personal Freedom</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">If you are miserable, and your prayers have remained unanswered, it is because you are not sufficiently in tune with God yourself. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Sometimes our impure motives block answers from coming, sometimes it is an impure theology which denies the power of God. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Combining FASTING with the Word and prayer will eventually eliminate both. The problem is not God&#39;s unwillingness to give good things. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Don&#39;t ever think that. (See Matthew 7:11). God is a good God, but we have become fleshly. To fast unto God means to stop eating for a few days, or many days, and intensify your prayers. Boldly speak out the promises of God during this time. Your answer will come.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Mt 7:11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Joe 2:21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Fasting to be like Jesus</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Jesus fasted 40 days before starting to destroy the works of the devil with power, and we won&#39;t do the works he did - especially the miracles - unless we also fast with similar dedication for long fasts. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Joh 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">few Christians believe Jesus enough to follow His example in fasting. But that is what it takes to consistently do the works He did. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Short fasts can produce miraculous results, but fall short of the glory of God. God is calling us to longer fasts. He is calling us to be prophetic, not </span><span class="csD3860DFD">pathetic</span><span class="csA521DC07">. We should stop making excuses. Yes, it is a battle, it does involve pain, The strong can proclaim Pain as weakness leaving THE BODY MIND AND SOUL. Being Godly is related to our willingness to bear pain, where required (and it often is).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Be serious about undertaking long fasts for the glory of God. God is calling His people everywhere to undergo extended periods of fasting and prayer, as well as many short fasts, in preparation </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Fasting and Grace</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">God has already given us every spiritual blessing in heavenly places (Ephesians 1:3), including the love of God poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5), but we don&#39;t experience much of it, we don&#39;t walk in much of it, until we learn to &quot;cash in&quot; God&#39;s checks through persistent fasting and prayer, with a focus on Jesus and the Word of God. Fasting, when combined with prayer and a determined focus on speaking and applying the Word of God, will root out the garbage which is clogging us up, both spiritually and physically. We see too much evidence of sin and unbelief to deny that we are need of radical cleansing.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Fasting does not earn us merit with God. The salvation and forgiveness of God is a gift (Ephesians 2:8,9) and fasting can&#39;t buy it. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">But fasting is a major key to actually, putting down the flesh and worthless thoughts, and humbling ourelves before God that we might </span><span class="cs75A07D5F">receive</span><span class="csA521DC07"> greater grace.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Jas 4:6 But </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">he giveth more grace</span><span class="csA521DC07">. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Fasting brings us into line with the will of God. Very few people experience much of the will of God for them. The will of God is the Word of God. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Consecration and faith towards God through fasting, Don&rsquo;t give in to the lack of power, lack of love or holiness in the church. God has given YOU and I the power to be a part of the solution. The ball is in our court. It is our time to fast and pray.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Benefits of Fasting</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Isaiah 58 tells us the benefits of fasting. Fasting won&#39;t benefit us much if we cling to impure motives and continue to treat people wrong. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">If you fast according to God&#39;s will, you will take delight in approaching God. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">6 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">9 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.

The real cure, fast and pray. God even favored the wicked king of Israel, Ahab, after he fasted in response to God&#39;s message of judgment. Then you will see a radical change, and you will start to take an amazing delight in God.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">1Ki 21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csA521DC07"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son&#39;s days will I bring the evil upon his house.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Jon 3:5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: &nbsp;8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. 9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4:1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</span></p></body>
