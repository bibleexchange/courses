Hebraism that pictures God as an Investigator “visiting” a person, city, or

decide the fate of Judah and to divide the good figs from the bad (Jer. 24).
The majority were bad figs by God’s definition in Jeremiah 24, because they
refused to submit to Rome according to God’s judgment and desired a military
messiah who would throw off the Roman yoke. Jesus found only a minority who
could accept the Prince of Peace as their Messiah. These were the good figs of
Judah. These were promised “another Comforter,” the Holy Spirit, who would come
on Pentecost to begin the next “time of visitation” in the Pentecostal Age
leading to Christ’s second coming. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;

convicted by the law (Rom. 3:19) to find justification—that is, be pronounced
not legally guilty. Jesus trained His disciples during His time of visitation.
And then toward the end of His ministry, He spoke of “another Comforter” (John
14:16) that was yet to be given. The use of the term “another” indicates that
Jesus Himself was a Comforter prior to the time when the Holy Spirit was given
in Acts 2. In fact, at the beginning of His life, Simeon called Him “the
consolation of Israel” (Luke 2:25). </span></p>
