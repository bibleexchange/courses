Imagine a torrential downpour that heavy falling for forty days and forty nights upon the earth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Imagine being caught in the middle of quake after quake&mdash;quakes so violent that all the subterranean waters broke loose and shot up from the caverns, rivers, lakes, and springs that lie underneath the crust of the earth.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The forty days of the erupting earth and torrential rain must have been a terrifying time, a time so terrifying that the small band of survivors often fell to their knees, individually and jointly. Their hearts must have cried out continually for the mercy of God as they went about their daily duties of survival and of taking care of the animals. After the violent storm and eruptions of the earth for forty days, everything apparently quieted down to some degree, although the water still rose and still churned and raged on for a total of 150 days (<a class="csA29FE1B1" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+7%3A24"><span class="csF16E459">Genesis 7:24</span></a></span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Noah and his dear family had plenty of work to do. Picture them caring for, feeding, and cleaning up after the animals and after themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were enclosed in a box-like structure, three stories high and 150 yards long, the length of one and one half football fields. They had to take care of the animals and themselves for 150 days, floating within the shell of the ark. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Cooped up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confined &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restless &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shut in &nbsp;enclosed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;almost imprisoned</span></p><table class="csF5F2E615" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;">

Emotions were bound to be ruffled and feelings were bound to be hurt. The little band of survivors were believers, but they were human beings, sinful human beings who had been saved only by God&#39;s mercy and grace. They were, therefore, just like us, subject to such human emotions and feelings. There must have also been times when they wondered, &quot;How much longer will the flood last? How much longer will we be cooped up? How much longer before God will deliver us and let us step on the earth again? And, what will it be like: no one left&mdash;no man, no woman, no child, no animal&mdash;just us, our family, the eight of us?&quot; Imagine the thoughts that crossed their minds and the conversation between them as they sat around together after a long and hard day&#39;s work. Imagine the questions, apprehension, anxiety, fear, and perhaps even trembling. Just four men and four women left upon earth. Can we imagine their feelings, emotions, and conversations? Is is possible?</span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"><a class="csA29FE1B1" href="about:blank#link335"><span class="csF16E459">1.&nbsp;Scene 1: God remembered and moved in behalf of Noah and the animals (v.1-5).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"><a class="csA29FE1B1" href="about:blank#link336"><span class="csF16E459">2.&nbsp;Scene 2: Noah&#39;s great patience and faith (v.6-14).</span></a></span></p></body>
