There was the weight of His body jolting and pulling against the spikes as the cross was lifted and rocked into place. There was the scorching sun and the unquenchable thirst gnawing away at His dry mouth and throat. There was the blood oozing from His scourged back, His thorn crowned brow, His feet, and His stick beaten head. In addition, just imagine the aggravation of flies, gnats, and other insects.

Note the exact words, &quot;This is Jesus the King of the Jews.&quot; This inscription disturbed the religious leaders. They went to Pilate and said, &quot;Write not, the King of the Jews; but that He said, I am King of the Jews.&quot; Pilate simply answered, &quot;What I have written, I have written&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+19%3A21-22"><span class="cs6C232F6B">John 19:21-22</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="cs87110596">Thought 1</span><span class="csC05134DD">. God overruled the shame and reproach of our Lord. God saw to it that the very charges against Him proclaimed His deity and honor. He was proclaimed King in three languages, languages which symbolized the world: the Aramaic (Jews), the Latin (the Gentiles), and the Greek (the intellectual Jew and Gentile).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

Perhaps this was a day set aside for execution. Or perhaps the Jewish leaders pressed Pilate to execute Jesus with other criminals. Such would add weight to their position that He was no more than a mere man, an imposter who deserved to die just as other criminals. Whatever the reason, the fact that the Son of God was executed right along with other criminals added to the shame and reproach He bore.
