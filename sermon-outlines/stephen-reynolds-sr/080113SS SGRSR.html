If it was left to us we would fail. The law has shone to us that man can&rsquo;t keep the law, cannot obey God on his own but needs a savior.

It is not in keeping the law for with that thinking it is only a matter of time before you mess up and if you break one part of the law the nyou are guilty of it all. Jesus Christ is the One that is going to provide for me and sustain me. If you try to keep yourself you&rsquo;ll find yourself in a great battle and be defeated at some time. I need you Jesus. Without his help we are guaranteed to fail. Just relying on our own good nature and good works we will be in trouble some day. Jesus Christ is our righteousness. Our boast is in Him. Sometimes you feel so good inside and humble in his presence and tears come down your face. Other times it feels that everything is against you and yet the Joy of the Lord is in our heart. Th erighteousness of God is without the law that you can make it without the trouble that Isreal had. Israel had a lot of trouble.</span></p><p class="cs36E056D4"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs36E056D4"><span class="csC382D2BB">Romans 3:23 We fail and we fail miserably.

You can be obedient to the Lord, but not just by your own grit and grind. You have got to believe the Lord. If you are still failing you are trusting in yourself. To trust in myself and do things my way I have to trample under my feet his blood.</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">Heb. 6:6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they </span><span class="cs31B015EA">crucify to themselves the Son of God</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> afresh, and put him to an open shame.</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">(You are going to have trust God in order to understand truth and for it to be revealed.)</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">vs.1,4 If you come to know Christ as Saviour and know his grace how He works and you refuse and reject him. </span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC382D2BB">At the dump the other day. &ldquo;We give no benefits to any church.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t it is fine, but I just saw his attitude and the look on his face was so hard.

Once you know Christ as Saviour and you trample him under you feet, there remains no other means of salvation. It is one thing to walk over the factthat he shed his blood, but it says trampling over Christ himself.

I can feel the results of what God has laid on my Spirit .If you want the warmth of God&rsquo;s love in your heart, it is the work of the Holy Ghost. We see inconsistencies in believers because there is a lack of covering. Feeling God about what we are doing only builds self righteousness. How can you lay in bed and be lazy and not day what god has asked and yet say you have faith? When you are sick is the best time to come to church! You can have an immediate manifestation of god&rsquo;s power in our body at these times. And receiving this, we have a testimony. Know that the word of God is true, trust His Word, and watch Him produce the miracle.Witht his righteousness upon us, we must receive it and act. </span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Acts 19&mdash;we are john&rsquo;s followers we haven&rsquo;t even heard if there be any Holy Ghost. He was preaching things that they weren&rsquo;t hearing. When we know truth we have a responsibility to preach it. And when people don&rsquo;t listen, we can&rsquo;t at every turn just say &lsquo; you viper&rsquo; timing is so important. The Scripture speaks much of the cup of iniquity being full and God&rsquo;s timing for judgment. We have to be careful that we don&rsquo;t just say things to hard hearted people just to correct them. John had the right attitude and died a martyr. If you aren&rsquo;t careful and try to be like John and you could end up like him. Theirs is something more than just being like a john, Isaiah, Abraham. The least in the King of heaven is greater than John. If you will obey Christ he can take you to a level above all of those beforehand.
