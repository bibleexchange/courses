Therefore, any person who believes that Jesus Christ died for him shall be saved from this world of death. God declares that he will count that person as having been crucified with Christ. The person never has to die. When the moment comes for the person to pass from this world into the next, God will transfer the person right into His presence to live eternally.

Worldly men do not like what they see, for the believer is rejecting the life-style and pleasures of the world. Consequently, the worldly want nothing to do with the believer. They want him out of their way. They want him as non-existent, as a dead person to them. Therefore, when a person comes to the cross of Christ, the cross crucifies him to the world and its ways. He is no longer attractive to the world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+6%3A6"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Romans 6:6</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus&#39; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Co+4%3A11"><span class="cs6C232F6B">2 Cor. 4:11</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Gal+2%3A20"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Galatians 2:20</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him&quot; (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Ti+2%3A11"><span class="cs6C232F6B">2 Tim. 2:11</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross creates a new man.

Therefore, if any man wishes to live with God, he has </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">to believe in Jesus Christ and approach God in the name of Jesus Christ</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Now a very practical question arises: How does using the name of Jesus Christ make a person live forever? Does a person become acceptable to God by just approaching God and saying, &quot;God, I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ&quot;? No! And there is one good reason. God knows who is really sincere and who is not. God cannot be deceived. </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Words and false profession</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;just using the words &quot;in the name of Jesus Christ&quot;&mdash;will not save anyone.

God actually places His divine nature, the presence of His own Spirit, into the person&#39;s life. The person is &quot;born again&quot; spiritually. He becomes what Scripture calls a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">new creature</span><span class="csC05134DD">, a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">new man</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
