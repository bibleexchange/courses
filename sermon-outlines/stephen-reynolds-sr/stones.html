Did Jesus transfer the anointing to his disciples? Yes, but you didn&rsquo;t see Him running around giving it out to thousands and making it &quot;cheap&quot;. They had to pay a price. The Scriptures as well as historians tell us that five hundred disciples were following Jesus daily. Jesus selected seventy (and then twelve) out of all those who followed. To the seventy, He said, &quot;I give you power and authority, and I send you forth.&quot; To the twelve, He said, &quot;I give you power to cast out devils. I call you apostles.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs90A83C94">Although there is great reward in being used of the Holy Ghost and walking in His anointing, there is still a price to pay. There is a reason why gold is of great value and brass is cheap. Gold shines while brass tarnishes. Gold is precious; it is rare and special. Isaiah 55:9 lays the foundation for us: &quot;</span><span class="cs2C025596">For [as] the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts</span><span class="cs90A83C94">.&quot; God&rsquo;s ways are the gold. Seek after His ways and His purposes. Don&rsquo;t settle for your own ways and thoughts, for they are only brass in comparison. The price is worth it!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs2C025596">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs90A83C94">distinguish between the gold and the brass, not substituting one for the other. When Solomon built the temple he made sure that everything inside the Holy of Holies consisted of pure gold. However, when Rehoboam refurnished the temple after Shishak king of Egypt took away the treasures, he replaced the gold shields with brass (2 Chronicles 12:9-10). Brass looks very similar to gold, but it is not gold. It is shiny like gold, but it is not the real thing. Unfortunately, this very same thing happens in ministry. There is the real in ministry, and there is the imitation in ministry. There is the gold, and there is the brass. You need to know the real thing so the imitation does not fool you. One example I can give you is the laying on of hands. I am saddened by the fact that we have almost cheapened the laying on of hands. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs90A83C94">You need to know the difference between the real and the imitation. The gold versus the brass. The very real versus that which looks similar but isn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
