		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Patience means, ready to await God&#39;s time, God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way without doubting God&#39;s truth. God works His Will in His own way and in His own time. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Ps 37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We are to &quot;rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him&quot; (Psalms 37:7), and not to fret ourselves because of the prosperity of the wicked and the apparent lack of God&#39;s work in the world.

Are we growing weary because we do not always see the harvest of our seed sowing? This glorious truth cries to us: &quot;Be patient.&quot; Do temptaions strike at us, pain and disappointment worry us? Our text preaches o us: &quot;Stablish your hearts.&quot; The King is coming, and only those who have such a hope can afford to wait.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">MEDITATION PRAYER: &quot;My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him&quot; (Psalms 62:5). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

There is an amusing story of a Chinese farmer who, to make his truck garden produce faster, pulled the plants up a little higher out of the ground each morning. That, he thought, would put him ahead of the other gardeners who just waited for their plants to grow. One day he discovered that every plant had died. &quot;Extremely foolish,&quot; we say; yet no more so than our complaints because our prayers are not answered immediately.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">From the doubt manifested by Christian workers, it might seem as though the work of God would never be finished. It appears that &quot;the times are out of joint,&quot; and some even go to the extreme of believing that God has &quot;forsaken the earth&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Eze 8:12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">But God is patient with us, and we must learn to be patient with life.
