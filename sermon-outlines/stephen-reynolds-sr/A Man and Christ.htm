<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
priorities of the marriage relationship, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Eph
5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave
himself for it;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Eph
5:28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his
wife loveth himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
principles of the marriage relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
Christian marriage, the model never to be forgotten is the Lord Jesus. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A
believer is a member of His body. No more intimate relationship could be
imagined than the relationship that exists between one member of a physical
body and another member. Each member of a body shares the same life, is
controlled by the same spirit, is washed by the same blood, and is ruled by the
same brain. The idea of a leg, an arm, or an eye existing independently is
ludicrous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Because
we are members of Christ's body, the high and holy standard of Christian
marriage is reachable; the standard is not just a lofty ideal. The link between
each believer and Christ may be mystical, but it is certainly not mythical. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'><a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eph+5%3A30"><span
style='color:windowtext'>Ephesians 5:30</span></a> says, &quot;We are members
of his body.&quot; Christ's life is our life. His love is our love. His Spirit
energizes our spirits. His blood cleanses all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>When
Paul wrote that husbands are to love their wives &quot;as the Lord the
church,&quot; he was not being idealistic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>He
is being intensely practical. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Because
we are members of His body, our lack of love is replaced by His boundless love.
Our little tributaries of love soon dry up, but the ocean tides of His
immeasurable love come in and overflow the banks of the narrow channels of our
love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
husband is not to resolve: &quot;I will love my wife as Christ loved the
church. I will do my best to imitate Christ.&quot; The result would only be an
imitation. The Holy Spirit tells every Christian husband to draw on the fact
that he is a member of Christ's own body—&quot;of his flesh, and of his
bones,&quot;. A relationship exists between the believer and Christ, making it
possible for a man to love his wife as Christ loved the church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If
this relationship between Christ and us did not exist, then Paul's whole idea
of marriage was just a noble dream. But this relationship is not merely a
glorious concept. It is a down-to-earth, hard-fact reality. It is the principle
on which all else rests. Our organic oneness with Christ certainly exists. We
have God's Word for that. Any breakdowns are on our side, not His.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
key to making the principles of the marriage relationship work is faith. Our
problem is that we only half believe them. The principles, however, remain the
same. We <i>are</i> members of His body. And, of course, this principle applies
to the wife in her role, in the same way it applies to the husband in his role.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:16.8pt'><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A Man and his bride (Christ's Bride will be
chosen) (<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eph+5%3A31-32"><span
style='color:windowtext'>5:31-32</span></a>)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:11.25pt;margin-right:.85in;margin-bottom:
11.25pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:16.8pt'><i><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Eph 5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his
father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
flesh.                         32 This is a great mystery: but I speak
concerning Christ and the church.                                                                                                                           
33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as
himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A
Christian is mystically linked with the body of Christ. On the other side, he
is maritally linked with his wife. Now Christ's life and love flow through him
to her, completing the circuit. Of course the Christian wife is also directly
linked with Christ and His love flows through her too. Faith throws the switch
that allows the power to flow and the results to show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Paul's
teaching on marriage, like the Lord's teaching in <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mk+10%3A2-12"><span
style='color:windowtext'>Mark 10:2-12</span></a>, is based on <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+2%3A23-24"><span
style='color:windowtext'>Genesis 2:23-24</span></a>. Marriage was God's purpose
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
instituting marriage, God had eternity's values in view and the ultimate
reality of Christ and His church in mind. Sin, however, has dimmed the bright
ideal. Even when we know the truth that is found in Christ, our chronic
unbelief often hinders us from seeing the truth work in our lives. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>God
intends the Christian home to be an outpost of Heaven in a sin-cursed world.
The home is to be a place where family, friends, visitors, and neighbors can
come, see, and sense the wonders of God's mysterious purposes at work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It
is no accident that the first and second times that love is mentioned in the
Bible occur when and where they do. The first mention of love is <i>the love of
the father for the son</i> in <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+22"><span style='color:windowtext'>Genesis
22</span></a>. Abraham loved Isaac, yet God demanded that he take his only
begotten son to mount Moriah and enact Calvary there. &quot;Take now thy son,
thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah;
and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will
tell thee of (<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+22%3A2"><span
style='color:windowtext'>22:2</span></a>). The spiritual significance of this
illumines all of a past eternity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
second mention of love is <i>the love of the son for his bride</i> in <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+24"><span style='color:windowtext'>Genesis
24</span></a>. &quot;Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+24%3A67"><span
style='color:windowtext'>24:67</span></a>). The spiritual significance of the
marriage of Isaac and Rebekah illumines all of the endless ages yet unborn. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>There
are hidden depths in Christian marriage that are linked with God's eternal
purposes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Paul
gave us glimpses, and a comprehensive study of Old Testament brides will reveal
more. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Some
of those brides teach us truth regarding Christ and His church; others (such as
Abraham and Sarah, Abraham and Katurah, and Hosea and Gomer) teach us truth
regarding Jehovah and Israel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Mt
14:22 ¶ And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and
to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> Mr
6:45 ¶ And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and
to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
{unto...: or, over against Bethsaida} </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> Lu
8:22 ¶ Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his
disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the
lake. And they launched forth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Peter
was doing just what Jesus was doing; he was doing the impossible. Peter's faith
in Christ enabled the power and authority of Christ over every circumstance to
operate in his life; in terms of what he was able to do at that moment and in
that situation, there was absolutely no difference between Peter and Christ.
Peter had not mastered the theory of whatever dynamic was involved in walking
on water, but his trust in Christ at that moment so linked him with Christ that
Christ's mastery was transmitted to him. Peter's faith turned on the power in
his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
<i>boldness of Peter's trust</i> during those few glorious moments when the
treacherous waves were as solid as dry land beneath his feet. But there was a
sudden <i>breakdown of Peter's trust</i> as he became aware of the angry wind
and sea. He took his eye off the Lord and fastened it on his circumstances.
Faith died and fear rose. The vital link to the source of power was severed and
Peter began to sink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>But
all was not lost. The Lord had not challenged Peter to try this new kind of
life only to let him perish when he failed. Jesus came alongside him. Peter
fixed his eye once more on the Master and cried out, &quot;Lord, save me&quot;
(<u>14:30</u>). Faith took hold once more and the Lord took hold. That mighty arm
was outstretched to save. That hand, able to contain in its hollow the waters
of the seven seas, caught the sinking disciple. &quot;O thou of little
faith,&quot; He said, &quot;wherefore didst thou doubt?&quot; (<u>14:31</u>)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Peter's
faith was little, but it was better than no faith. Peter had been given an
experience of victorious living that no one else in the boat had been given, an
experience he would remember to his dying day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Mt
14:32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Mt
14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a
truth thou art the Son of God.</span></b></p>
