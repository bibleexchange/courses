In the past we took in homeless wives with their children. We have helped broken family members until they get back together with their families.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">My mother Mrs.James Reynolds was involved with foster care at the Deliverance Center, taking care of young struggling boys that no one else wanted to help.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(Bobby Bowers, Freddie Myers)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Sunday School program that has reached as many as 80 children at a time, brought in by the Church bus out of the projects in Portland, Friday and Saturday night young people meetings, many special field trips, youth camps a week at a time.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">The Deliverance Bible Institute : &nbsp;Three year Bible school since 1969</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Christian Academy of Portland: Primary to 12th grade since 1979</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Vanda Siciliano Hope&rsquo;s Mother has never lived at the Deliverance Center but she has attended some classes in the bible School as well as her daughter Hope had attended a few classes at times and Vanda still attended the Church services even after Hope and Raymond Champagne got married.. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">It really is a long story of how many times we have spoken to her and warned of just potential problems between her and other children or just both of them feeling comfortable around the men in general that we have tried to help at the Deliverance Center or people that have attended church services, Bible school and the Academy.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">We can only help certain types of people at a time now because of the way the system is working with the insurance companies and the courts, you can have trouble just by someone making an accusation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">When Hope made her accusations the insurance company Church Mutual made her </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">an offer without even asking my Dad James Reynolds who has now passed or myself </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">I asked them (Judy Frymark, Mellissa Hamlon) why? and they said it is easier for them to make an offer to the plaintiff than it is to contest these types of accusations.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Vanda continued to attend church at the Deliverance Center right up until the time that Hope received from the Insurance company and we had to write Vanda a letter and ask her not to attend anymore church services to protect ourselves from anymore accusations.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Hope Siciliano right up to becoming married has never got along with any child but is always the other child or person&rsquo;s fault by her and her mother.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Hope Siciliano&rsquo;s birth in 1989 &nbsp;happened by Frank Siciliano (Vanda&rsquo;s husband at the time) &nbsp;took a young struggling teenager (Shawn Mcfarland) a 18 year old we were trying to help, into his own home, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Frank took Shawn and about six other men we didn&rsquo;t even know or ever have anything to do with into his home to live with him and his wife at the time (Vanda). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Vanda and Shawn Mcfarland slept together in Frank Siciliano&rsquo;s home (Hope was born from that disaster) </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Shawn Mcfarland went away and had nothing to do with them for 14 years. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Frank Siciliano divorced Vanda.

Why would Mrs. Gloria Luce attend services for 25-30 years, Vanda and her sister&rsquo;s attend the services.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">From 1989-1994 Hope (from birth to 5 years old) lived at home with her mother as they attended church at the Deliverance Center. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">From 1994-2000 was home schooled because she just couldn&rsquo;t get along with the other students at Christian Academy of Portland. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">From 1994-2003 Hope (5-14 years old) there were many times speaking with her and her mother over problems they would have here at the Church no mention of molestation.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Now Hope says she has kept a calendar of events that she is claiming took place here at The Deliverance Center.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">From 2003-2006 (4 yrs.) I Myself Stephen G. Reynolds Sr. Spent a lot of time trying to warn Raymond Champagne (a man living at the Deliverance Center) not to involve himself in any way with Hope, at this time she is Hope Siciliano.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">I warned Hope and her mother (14-16) she is too young to be married and Raymond Champagne 35+ was not at all ready for marriage for many reasons, just the fact that he was talking about a 14 year old.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">They insisted to get married, I made him leave the Deliverance Center, Raymond went and married Hope and shortly returned for a visit and apologized for not listening to me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Many things took place they didn&rsquo;t get along very good at all. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Hope Champagne while she is married to Raymond paid for hotels and slept with Charles Knox many times which is the man that my Dad has tried to help many times and now Hope is trying to say she kept records that Charles Knox has done things to her at the Deliverance Center, no mention of these things before while Charles Knox was living with us and we had many conferences.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Many accusations were brought up after Charles Knox had been made to leave the center for things that had nothing to do with anybody but himself.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">We have watched out for Hope since she was a little girl; she has never been a bit afraid of any adults. Hope would speak up to her mother and us at the Deliverance Center always lying and blaming someone else for the most simple things, (pushing, stealing a sandwich or something from someone&rsquo;s lunch bag, taking or moving someone&rsquo;s stuff, claiming that all the other children was being mean to her over and over) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">I have never heard or seen so much drama to disaster involving two people in 54 years, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs9C4758E0">							 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="cs6DA126DA">DOB.
