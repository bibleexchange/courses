Daniel couldn&#39;t read 2 Timothy 3:16, but he did believe the truth of it: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">iii. &quot;These verses show Daniel as a diligent student of Scripture who built his prayer life on the Word of God.&quot; (Archer)</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">iv. &quot;Oh! That you studied your Bibles more! Oh! That we all did! How we could plead the promises! How often we should prevail with God when we could hold him to his word, and say, &#39;Fulfill this word unto thy servant, whereon thou hast caused me to hope.&#39; Oh! It is grand praying when our mouth is full of God&#39;s word, for there is no word that can prevail with him like his own.&quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">b. </span><span class="cs31007154">The number of years specified by the word of the </span><span class="cs98DF28E">Lord </span><span class="cs31007154">through Jeremiah</span><span class="csA7555675">: Daniel knew that effective prayer comes out of knowing and praying both God&#39;s word and our present circumstances. His study of prophecy showed him a </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">specific number</span><span class="csA7555675"> - the 70 years described in Jeremiah 25:11-13 and Jeremiah 29:10, and his knowledge of the times led him to know those passages applied to his time.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">i. </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. &#39;Then it will come to pass, when seventy years are completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity,&quot; says the </span><span class="cs6AE5933">Lord</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">; &quot;and I will make it a perpetual desolation.

It is important to note that Daniel regarded these as </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">real, literal years</span><span class="csA7555675">. They were in no way understood as &quot;symbolic&quot; years.</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">iv. Daniel was undoubtedly also familiar with Isaiah&#39;s prophecies concerning Cyrus (Isaiah 44:28-45:4). He must have been encouraged to see a man named Cyrus rise in power over Persia.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">c. </span><span class="cs31007154">That He would accomplish seventy years</span><span class="csA7555675">: If Daniel believed that God </span><span class="cs31007154">would accomplish seventy years</span><span class="csA7555675"> of captivity, then why did he pray as passionately as he did in Daniel 9? Daniel knew that God&#39;s promises </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">invite</span><span class="csA7555675"> our prayers and participation; they don&#39;t </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">exclude</span><span class="csA7555675"> our prayers and participation.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. &quot;Nothing, therefore, can be better for us, than to ask for what he has promised.&quot; (Calvin)</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">ii. This principle is repeated in many passages. 2 Peter 3:12 indicates that there is a sense in which we can </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">hasten</span><span class="csA7555675"> the Lord&#39;s coming by our holy conduct and godly lives; we can also hasten the Lord&#39;s coming through evangelism because Paul says that God&#39;s prophetic focus on Israel will resume when the </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">fullness of the Gentiles has come in</span><span class="csA7555675"> (Romans 11:25). This means that we can also hasten the Lord&#39;s coming through prayer, even as Daniel asked for a speedy fulfillment of prophecy regarding captive Israel (Daniel 9). We can also pray </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Even so, come, Lord Jesus!</span><span class="csA7555675"> (Revelation 22:20) If you want Jesus to come soon, there is something you can </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">do</span><span class="csA7555675"> about it!</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iii. But a second important reason is that Daniel asked God, in His mercy, to take the earliest of all possible starting points (Daniel&#39;s abduction) for determining the beginning of the 70 years. There were three &quot;waves&quot; of captivity:</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iv. If Daniel can prevail with God in prayer, and God then takes the earliest starting point to determine the 70 years then His mercy comes to Israel 18 years earlier.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">v. At the time of this prayer was still three or four years short of 70 years since 605 </span><span class="cs6ADA811E">b.c.</span><span class="csA7555675"> - it was not too soon for Daniel to begin praying.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">d. </span><span class="cs31007154">The word of the </span><span class="cs98DF28E">Lord</span><span class="cs31007154"> through Jeremiah</span><span class="csA7555675">: Even in God&#39;s eternal decrees, human agencies are essential. God&#39;s plan of the ages is declared, yet Jeremiah made a prophecy, Daniel made a prayer, and Cyrus made a proclamation</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. &quot;Too often our interest in the prophetic Scriptures is of a curious and speculative nature, or else we conclude that God will carry out His sovereign purpose no matter what we do, and so we do not concern ourselves with those matters.&quot; (Strauss)</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">ii. By tribal heritage or calling Daniel was not uniquely qualified for a ministry of intercession. He did not belong to a priestly family like Ezekiel and he wasn&#39;t a &quot;career&quot; prophet like Isaiah or Jeremiah. Yet like all of us, he could pray. </span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iii. In fact, Daniel&#39;s calling and station in life made it </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">less</span><span class="csA7555675"> likely that he would be such a man of prayer. He was a high government official who almost certainly had a busy schedule - yet he took time and energy to pray.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iv. &quot;Do not, I pray you, get into the habit of neglecting the assembling of yourselves together for prayer. How often have I said, &#39;All our strength lies in prayer&#39;! When we were very few, God multiplied us in answer to prayer.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="csA7555675">2.

Daniel had an objective to achieve in prayer, and he approached God as a man who would not be denied. He did this because he was rightly convinced that his prayer was in the will of God, and knew it was not motivated by any selfish desire.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">b. </span><span class="cs31007154">To make request by prayer and supplications</span><span class="csA7555675">: Daniel wasn&#39;t </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">passive</span><span class="csA7555675"> as God&#39;s prophetic plan unfolded before him. In his approach to God, he made a </span><span class="cs31007154">request</span><span class="csA7555675">, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">asking</span><span class="csA7555675"> God to perform His promise in the way that Daniel thought would bring God most glory.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">i. &quot;We ask but little, and God gives it.&quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">c. </span><span class="cs31007154">With fasting, sackcloth, and ashes</span><span class="csA7555675">: This reflected Daniel&#39;s humble heart in approaching God. </span><span class="cs31007154">Fasting, sackcloth, and ashes</span><span class="csA7555675"> are emblems of humiliation and mourning.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. Daniel was determined to do what ever it took to get this job done in prayer. He &quot;left nothing undone that might possibly make his prayer more effective or more persuasive.&quot; (Walvoord)</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="csA7555675">3. (4-15) Daniel confesses the sin of his people, and glorifies the goodness and righteousness of God.</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="cs338C08B3">And I prayed to the </span><span class="cs5DE8585F">Lord</span><span class="cs338C08B3"> my God, and made confession, and said, &quot;O Lord, great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments, we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments. Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings and our princes, to our fathers and all the people of the land. O Lord, righteousness </span><span class="cs366CB853">belongs </span><span class="cs338C08B3">to You, but to us shame of face, as </span><span class="cs366CB853">it is </span><span class="cs338C08B3">this day; to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those near and those far off in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of the unfaithfulness which they have committed against You. O Lord, to us </span><span class="cs366CB853">belongs </span><span class="cs338C08B3">shame of face, to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You. To the Lord our God </span><span class="cs366CB853">belong </span><span class="cs338C08B3">mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him. We have not obeyed the voice of the </span><span class="cs5DE8585F">Lord</span><span class="cs338C08B3"> our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets. Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, and has departed so as not to obey Your voice; therefore the curse and the oath written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against Him. And He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great disaster; for under the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been done to Jerusalem. As </span><span class="cs366CB853">it is </span><span class="cs338C08B3">written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us; yet we have not made our prayer before the </span><span class="cs5DE8585F">Lord</span><span class="cs338C08B3"> our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth. Therefore the </span><span class="cs5DE8585F">Lord</span><span class="cs338C08B3"> has kept the disaster in mind, and brought it upon us; for the </span><span class="cs5DE8585F">Lord</span><span class="cs338C08B3"> our God </span><span class="cs366CB853">is </span><span class="cs338C08B3">righteous in all the works which He does, though we have not obeyed His voice. And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made Yourself a name, as </span><span class="cs366CB853">it is </span><span class="cs338C08B3">this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs3E7BDF06"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">a. </span><span class="cs31007154">O Lord, great and awesome God</span><span class="csA7555675">: Daniel began his prayer where we all should - by recognizing the greatness and goodness of God. Sometimes we approach God as a stingy person who must be persuaded to give us something. But Daniel knew the problem was not with God. God </span><span class="cs31007154">keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him</span><span class="csA7555675">.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. Daniel&#39;s prayer is remarkable for both its </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">understanding</span><span class="csA7555675"> and </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">earnestness</span><span class="csA7555675">. Many pray with understanding but not earnestness; others are earnest but have no understanding in prayer. The two together are a powerful combination.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">ii. &quot;Oh! That our prayers could get beyond praying, till they got to agonizing.&quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">b. </span><span class="cs31007154">We have sinned and committed iniquity</span><span class="csA7555675">: As Daniel confesses Israel&#39;s sin he prays as if he is as bad as the rest of Israel. This is a confession of </span><span class="cs31007154">we</span><span class="csA7555675">, not </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">they</span><span class="csA7555675">. In this sense, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">they</span><span class="csA7555675"> prayers never really reach God; genuine </span><span class="cs31007154">we</span><span class="csA7555675"> prayers see self correctly and see our fellow saints with compassion.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. Daniel&#39;s confession of sin might seem phony until we realize how passionately and completely he is focused on God. Compared to God, even the most righteous among us falls far short.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">ii. &quot;I firmly believe that, the better a man&#39;s own character becomes, and the more joy in the Lord he has in his own heart, the more capable is he of sympathetic sorrow; and, probably, the more of it he will have. If thou hast room in thy soul for sacred joy, thou hast equal room for holy grief.&quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">c. </span><span class="cs31007154">Righteousness belongs to You, but to us shame of face</span><span class="csA7555675">: Daniel knew that Israel&#39;s sin was not God&#39;s fault; God was utterly righteous and blameless. Any </span><span class="cs31007154">shame of face</span><span class="csA7555675"> belonged to Israel, not to God.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. It would be easy to </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">complain</span><span class="csA7555675"> to God about Israel&#39;s problems. Daniel didn&#39;t think for a moment that God was too hard on Israel; he knew God was completely righteous and any failure was on Israel&#39;s side.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">ii. Instead of </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">complaining</span><span class="csA7555675">, Daniel </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">confessed</span><span class="csA7555675">. During times of great revival among God&#39;s people, the Holy Spirit always brings a deep conviction and awareness of sin. When that is responded to rightly, confession is appropriately made. J. Edwin Orr gives a good principle to govern confession: &quot;If you sin secretly, confess secretly, admitting publicly that you need the victory but keeping details to yourself. If you sin openly confess openly to remove stumbling blocks from those whom you have hindered. If you have sinned spiritually (prayerlessness, lovelessness, and unbelief as well as their offspring, criticism, etc.) then confess to the church that you have been a hindrance.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iii. Genuine, appropriate confession will be sincere, specific, and thorough. Orr describes how in the 1952 revival in Brazil a woman in a crowded church confessed, &quot;Please pray for me, I need to love people more.&quot; The leader told her gently, &quot;That is not a confession, sister. Anyone could have said it.&quot; Later in the service the lady stood again and said, &quot;Please pray for me. What I should have said is that my sharp tongue has caused a lot of trouble in this congregation.&quot; The pastor leaned over to Orr and whispered &quot;Now she is talking!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iv. This is praying from a low place, and very effective. Football players try to hit their opponent </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">low</span><span class="csA7555675">, because they gain leverage from coming in low.

Even when they faced great trial and calamity, Israel still did not make their </span><span class="cs31007154">prayer before the </span><span class="cs98DF28E">Lord</span><span class="csA7555675">. When we sense trial or difficulty it should drive us </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">immediately</span><span class="csA7555675"> to prayer - when we are not so driven it should be a wake-up call to the coldness of our heart.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">g. </span><span class="cs31007154">Who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand</span><span class="csA7555675">: As Daniel prayed he remembered that the </span><span class="cs6ADA811E">Lord</span><span class="csA7555675"> delivered Israel from Egypt. He remembers the Old Testament &quot;standard&quot; of God&#39;s power, the deliverance from Egypt.

Daniel prayed as a patriot - but a patriot more of the Kingdom of God than the Kingdom of Israel. We should pray with similar patriotism for the Kingdom of God. &quot;Let it never be said that the Church of God has no feeling of patriotism for the Holy City, for the Heavenly Land and for her glorious King enthroned above.

Daniel asks for all this </span><span class="cs31007154">according to all Your righteousness</span><span class="csA7555675">. It is as if Daniel prayed, &quot;</span><span class="cs6ADA811E">Lord</span><span class="csA7555675">, I&#39;m not asking You to do anything against Your righteousness. I&#39;m praying this to advance Your righteous glory.&quot;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">b. </span><span class="cs31007154">Cause your face to shine</span><span class="csA7555675">: This is the heart of Daniel&#39;s plea. He knows that God&#39;s people need so much, but all their need can be summed up in this: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">they need God&#39;s face to shine upon them</span><span class="csA7555675">.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. &quot;Oh, that we might learn how to pray so that God should be the subject as well as the object of our supplications! O God, thy Church needs thee above everything else! A poor, little, sick, neglected child needs fifty things; but you can put all those needs into one if you say that the child needs its mother. So, the Church, of God needs a thousand things, but you can put them all into one if you say, &#39;The Church of God needs her God.&#39; &quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">c. </span><span class="cs31007154">For the Lord&#39;s sake cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary, which is desolate . . . Do not delay for Your own sake</span><span class="csA7555675">: Daniel&#39;s prayer is consumed with the glory of God, not primarily the benefit of man. His purpose in prayer was to see God&#39;s work accomplished and His cause glorified.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. It isn&#39;t wrong to pray for our own needs. Jesus invited us to ask, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">give us this day our daily bread</span><span class="csA7555675">. At the same time, we need to have an even greater passion for the glory and benefit of God.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">ii. We should pray with the same passion and concern for the work of God in our congregations and communities. We can pray the prayer of Psalm 85:6: </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?</span><span class="csA7555675"> Alone and in groups we can pray for God to pour out the Holy Spirit, to bring repentance and revival among His people, and to awaken the unconverted.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">iii. This also speaks to </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">purity of motive</span><span class="csA7555675"> in Daniel&#39;s prayer. Sometimes we pray for God to do a great work so we can be known as great workers for God. We need to pray for the sake of the </span><span class="cs6ADA811E">Lord</span><span class="csA7555675">&#39;s cause, both in our words and heart.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">d. </span><span class="cs31007154">We do not present our supplications before You because of our righteous deeds, but because of Your great mercies</span><span class="csA7555675">: Here Daniel prays on firm New Testament ground. His confidence isn&#39;t in </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">his</span><span class="csA7555675"> goodness, but in </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">God&#39;s</span><span class="csA7555675"> goodness.</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">i. This is what it means to pray </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">in the name of Jesus</span><span class="csA7555675">. Those aren&#39;t words we tack on to the end of a prayer, but they should express the fact we are praying in merits and righteousness of Jesus, not our own.</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">ii. Daniel was not great because he prayed. He was great because in prayer he expressed &nbsp;great trust and dependence on God. Many religious people spend countless hours in prayer but it achieves </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">nothing</span><span class="csA7555675"> because it is not rooted in the goodness and righteousness of God. </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Self righteous</span><span class="csA7555675"> or </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">self trusting</span><span class="csA7555675"> prayer is of no power before God.

If you have received a great blessing, say, &#39;Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him; because he has heard me once, therefore will I call again.&#39; &quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">ii. &quot;Cold prayers ask God to deny them: only importunate prayers will be replied to. When the Church of God cannot take &#39;No&#39; for an answer, she shall not have &#39;No&#39; for an answer. When a pleading soul must have it; when the Spirit of God works mightily in him so that he cannot let the angel go without a blessing, the angel shall not go till he has given the blessing to such a pleading one. Brethren, if there be only one among us that can pray as Daniel did, with intensity, the blessing will come.&quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9A9996D5"><span class="csA7555675">B.

Jesus said, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him</span><span class="csA7555675"> (Matthew 6:8). Whenever there seems to be a delay in answer to prayer, there is reason for the delay.

To every student of the word of God who would become a well-instructed scribe we would say, with all the means which you employ, with all your searchings of the commentaries, with all your diggings into the original, with all your researches among learned divines, mingle much fervent prayer.&quot; (Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csA7555675">ii. &quot;Luther affirmeth that he oft got more spiritual light by ardent prayer than ever he could do by the reading of many books, or by the most accurate meditation</span></p><p class="cs2CBA91A8"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD64A9282"><span class="csA7555675">b. </span><span class="cs31007154">For you are greatly beloved</span><span class="csA7555675">: Both Daniel and the Apostle John (John 13:23) were noted for their love-relationship with God.

Taking the description of what would be accomplished in the 70 Weeks from Daniel 9:24, we know that the 70 Weeks are not yet complete. Yet the events promised in the first 69 weeks are fulfilled, indicated that there is a lengthy &quot;pause&quot; in the 70 Weeks, between the 69</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> week and the 70</span><span class="csA7555675"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csA7555675"> week.

These &quot;gaps&quot; or &quot;pauses&quot; in prophecy may seem strange to us, but they are common.

We can think of it in this way: God has appointed 490 years of special focus on Israel in His redemptive plan. The years were &quot;paused&quot; by Israel&#39;s rejection of Jesus. Now, there is no </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">special</span><span class="csA7555675"> focus on Israel in God&#39;s redemptive plan because this is the time of the church.
