<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Living Waters Flowing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Isaiah 28:16,17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I Peter 2:3-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many have taken refuge in lies and they are appointed unto
death. God has determined, judged sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living waters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is living waters flowing for us tonight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ther eis a union that God has in mind to bring us beyond
just the state of free from sin and the things that war against the soul, but
he wants to free us from the things that conquer. We work at the end from the
beginning to know that it is worth the fight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TO God be the glory, God is the everlasting light of our
soul. He will glorify Himself in us and will establish His works. Our works our
vain unless the Spirit of God moves in us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need the Gospel made plain so that every taste is a cool
drop from Heaven saying that Jesus Christ is the healer, deliverer, establisher
of our hearts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A SURE FOUNDATION&lt; A LIVING STONE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Not something that is dead, but LIVING. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah said, A SURE FOUNDATION&lt;  you can know that He is
there. You don’t’ have to wonder whether God is there, but you can know him
that He is there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the ways the lord makes us to know He is there is He
allows us to TASTE. He reveals to us HIS WORD. If we don’t hunger and thirst
for His Word our hunger for God is suspect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I Peter 2:8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Out of the living stone is living water flowing. The living
stone gives spiritual drink. (The natural mind does not receive the things of
God) If you heart will reach out to God you will find that His word will defeat
the enemy of your soul and will defeat the thing that is warring against your
soul. He can make us more THAN CONQUERERS, but until then we must UNDERSTAND
THE BATTLE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ABASTAIN FROM FLESHLY lust, You can find yourself to be the
example, a living stone placed in a spiritual house so people can come and see
God, your testimony is about Jesus, you are praising the Lord, you are living
for Him and bringing Him glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So many don’t believe in SALVATION let alone PERFECTION. You
don’t always have to be in a state of fighting against the flesh. Lust is an
enemy, an evil desire. Abastina from fleshly lust which war against the soul,
Through the power of the Holy Ghost and the Word we can say NO to sin and YES
to God . We can have victory over sin. The fleshly desire is stronger than the
spiritual desire. When we feed the fleshly desire, it causes us to stumble at
the truth. You wander if it is fro you and whether it is for anybody. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am not satisfied with a refuge of lies. We are going to
fight the flesh and unbelief. Our heart is hungry, a spiritual desire for
living waters. Wee are not any better than anyone else, but just taste and see
that the Lord is Good, that he is a crown of glory for them that are willing to
believe God. So many have disallowed Him as the cornerstone, but I am going to
believe the truth, rising about the battle. He is the livning stone, he is the
chief cornerstone, he has placed in our life to make our life sure, and we are
to be like him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I Peter 2:5 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is living water flowing from the living stone.  If you
are a living stone than out of you is going to flow that river. If the lord is
the living stone in our life then He is that spiritual drink. He is marvelous,
and wonderful in his workings. So that we can become like Him. He is REAL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many question, CHRIST AS THEIR SAVIOUR, many others, THE
BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. There are a lot of fleshly desires that war against
our soul. But God is going to bring judgment and lay it against the line. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are all builders…either building as an UNBELIEVER
building on false hopes and lies or a BELIEVER building on that sure foundation
of truth, which is Jesus Christ, the chief cornerstone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He that believeth on Him is not ashamed, is not confounded
but shall have everlasting life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Holy Ghost came and visited Mary highly favoring her and
therefore came the life of Jesus. The son of God was born of Mary, making her
highly favored of God. She was a simple virgin lady betrothed to a man named
Joseph, but God saw fit to do something special in her for a purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul said that He was the chiefest of sinners. He can save
anybody He saved me! Not all will be saved, but that is because of the choices
that men make. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are elected because we believed Him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4:2 They heard the Gospel but did not believe it, not mixing
their hearing with faith. Help us to say “Lord I need you crown me with your
glory and loving kindness. I don’t want to be drunk with the things of this
world, but be filled with His spirit.” Eph. 4:16 be not drunk with wine…be
filled with the spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By your good works glorify God in the day of His
visitation…There is a day that He will visit His people. The outpouring of
God’s Spirit. Knowing truth is not enough, but we must LOVE truth and it must
be watered by the Spirit. The Spirit and the Word agree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is calling for a  diligent heart to seek him with the
whole heart. It is the little foxes that spoil the vine. Those little fleshly
desires, a little bit of doubt and fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Matthew 17 Peter james and john whent up in the mountain and
Jesus visited them in a special way. He gave them a taste that He is more than
a man. They became afraid, but God has designed His word that we be not afraid
of Him though in awe and reverance. Let us come boldly to the throne of grace…
YOU are not going to run in haphazard and lukewarm and still receive from God,
but it is going to take a whole hearted effort. All doubt and struggle must be
done away with. These 3 disciples had the greatest opportunity of their life
but were afraid to enter into it, Luke 9:45 Our questions should be with faith
SHOW ME ZTHYZ TRUTH, TEACH MY THY WAYS. His path is that of victory and life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are going to overcome because we know God and the spirit
of God is floing in our life and He is watering that Word every day. Every day
allowing our flesh to be exposed too the power of God. Holding our flesh to the
altar. The blossoms and buds will bring fruit that  glorify God. It is the Holy
Ghost in us that cause that word, seed, to germinate. Zit is the knowledge eof
God revealed to us by His Spirit and not just knowledge ein general. ONLY
CHRIST THROUGH THE HOLY GHOST can reveal to us. Bellieve for the watering. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><u>It gets pretty dry
looking in the mirror of the Word and having no Spirit watering it.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christ is the unseen cornerstone, solid foundation, living
stone, rock that flows with water as the one that followed Israel in the
wilderness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We take root in places we do not belong. If we see this
World as a refuge of lies, we would not drive one stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord change our heart, our mind, our attitude. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some builders who build in disobedience, building
on a lie. God is going to send his righteousness to the plummet and his
judgment to the line. God won’t have to do anything the flood waters of sin
will destroy you. A refuge of lies uncovered and overflowed with waters of
destruction. Reject God and be overflowed by the waters of destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v. 8 the lord that is the living stone, became the stumbling
stone. He laid his life down ‘in our path’ that we would have to ‘stumble’ over
Him in order to go to hell, in order to go without. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is the rock of offense. He has allowed himself to placed
down and rejected, disallowed, disobeyed. He has allowed himself to become that
rock of offense. He has laid Himself down before us that after we have stumbled
over him, but that we remember how we rejected him, our unbelief, and our
doubts. He promised to be sin for us. To be our offense. He who knew no sin,
became sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people think they can just plow so deep there is know
dirt left. There is certain place in our heart that man can’t find or touch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the battle is believing God in the face of adversity
and not taking counsel from our flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before every Pharaoh, Judas, Mary Magdalene, was laid the
rock of stumbling and offense. He is willing to take it all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
