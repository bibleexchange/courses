<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TITLE: The Calling of God is
Through Grief</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TEXT: Habakkuk 3:17-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Judgment is
coming. God is going to judge the idolater. They who govern their own selves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Habakkuk says, no
matter what happens I will serve you Lord, heed your call, obey you. Lord give
us that testimony! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>We have a lesson
here this morning of God calling us even through grief. The call of God is even
through strong grief. The men in the Bible who were called through suffering
and grievous times they responded like Habakkuk no matter what I will fallow
the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>How am I
answering the grief that is in my life now? Are there hard times that people
are going through. Sometimes people need to be pinched. When the body suffers
we need to suffer with them. When one rejoices, rejoice, when one weeps, weep.
JOY COMES IN THE MORNING! Habakkuk says that he will rejoice in the God of his
salvation. The call of God is not just a time to enjoy and just be happy and just
be lukewarm and be at ease. But is for the prayer warrior and as Jesus though
in agony prayed as though great drops of blood he sweat. Agonizing prayer,
intense prayer. Salvation to come to the lost is going to come by only a
tremendous prize. UNDERSTAND THE GRIEVING.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>My life is easy
and good in comparison to the lives and hardships of many. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Habakkuk 3:17-19
is a challenge to everyone of us to understand that the call of God is grieving
time. Not easy. You must KNOW God that if you knock seven times and they still
say NO we smut know that we heard from God to knock again. Grieving hurts and
is anguish. Jesus was in agony and being in agony He prayed more earnestly. We
need to strengthened on the inner man. We need to be tough skin and a tender
heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Noah’s testimony
Genesis 6, the whole world around him was against what he was doing. In face of
the sun not shining I must believe in the Word of God. I know He is real. The
closest one we can see being tested with that would be Noah in Genesis 6:6. God
repenting that he made man. Now because man has turned away from he is bringing
judgment. God didn’t say it just like Noah to make him feel like he is isolated
and like it was just him and his family, but God said it in such a way that
Noah had a tender heart to reach out to the people for 120 years, Please come
to God and repent, providing always a hope for room in the ark for any that
would receive the message he preached. But it did come down to only 8 people
alive. EVERYONE in the world gone but just his family. Would I trust God if it
was JUST my family left? Loving God NO MATTER WHAT. If mine was the ONLY family
left would I trurst God? would ANYTHING change? Genesis 6:8. Noah trusted and
believed God. Just 8 people left to believe. Is there wickedness, evil,
violence, things to grieve about? Yes, but we are not going to let it affect
our spirit and our faith in Christ. Things develop in people’s lives and they
begin to question God’s ways and even His existence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Isaiah 54—Man of
Sorrows acquainted with grief. Biography on Abraham Lincoln titled , “A Man of
Sorrows.” He was put down ad reject and lost everything he ran for until it was
time for God to use him. But at the right time when God needed him God rose him
up and used him there. Our vision is too narrow often, God used John the
Baptists for 6 months’ ministry. God give us the faith and the courage and
confidence if God is only going to use me special one day we will yet be
faithful and no less zealous. Put away selfishness. Let everything be taken away
and let nothing be changed in regards to our faith and trust in God. A Man of
Sorrows and not something to be rejected or looked down upon or misunderstood.
Christ who is the prince of prince and the giver of Joy answered the call
through grief. He has gone through it all and is familiar with all that we
suffer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Psalm 119:58
David was a man after God’s own heart. David learned how to suffer properly not
because of things he had done but over people not keeping the Word of God.
Sometimes we grieve just because we don’t’ like somebody, but David is grieve
because they kept not the law of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Psalm 139:21—a
right spirit required to hate them that hate God. Having the nature of Christ
to properly hate sin and hate sinners that are violent, and hate God. To HATE
properly. “Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated.” God’s hates
unrighteousness and hates evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Amos 6:1,6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>v.1 Woe to them
at ease                      v.4-Selfish They Are              v.6-Not grieved
by sin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>God is calling us
to grieve. To understand the prayer warriors avenue, disposition of weeping in
tears and agony. Not like the Pharisees walking around and making sure everyone
sees how sad I am and how pious I am. Weeping before the porch and the altar
before God and then there is a TIME for rejoicing in God. It doesn’t matter how
much we grieve over the things that we lose, yet I WILL REJOICE IN THE GOD OF
MY SALVATION. (Habakkuk 3:18) If I carry a dark countenance all the time how is
that attractive to the sinner? Joy in our spirit. Life in us like a river of
living water. But a grievance and a sorrow even with tears for the lost. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Samuel –takes
some time to see Hannah in chapter one. Hannah is not picking and choosing a
need for herself, but she cries out for the need of a nation in need of man of
God that will declare the WHOLE word of God. Praise that God will raise up men.
There is a lot of wickedness and evil out there. Little by little God will use
you more and more. You will never know the call of grieve until you have
offended someone for the truth’s sake. The greatest time of suffering comes
when have done all you can to help someone and they reject you. They came to
Samuel as an old man saying that he is washed up and they need ANOTHER man to
lead them, a king. I Samuel 15:35 in the days of Saul Samuel grived becaue God
had been rejected and disobeyed. Men had pushed away the ways of God and the
call of God. God is our way and our God we live for Him and ONLY for Him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>James –dealing
with me as an individual. Understanding that God leads us to victory in all
things. God always causes us to triumph. Many do not understand and the best
the can do is learn to ‘roll with the punches’ until they just get so tired
they throw in the towl. When I pray do I belive? Is my prayer in FAITH? Look at
the Scripture to be a mirror of my soul. Doon’t ever take any counsel of my
flesh. Look in the Word of God. Philippians 4:8 “Think ono these things”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>James 4:8 James
deals with 4 Classes of people, all classes are to draw nigh to God:</p>
