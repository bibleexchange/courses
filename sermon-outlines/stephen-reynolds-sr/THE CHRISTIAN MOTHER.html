They were greatly surprised and delighted in finding that out of one hundred and twenty students, over a hundred had been borne by a mother&#39;s prayers, and directed by a mother&#39;s counsels, to the Savior. Though some of these had broken away from all the restraints of home, and like the prodigal, had wandered in sin and sorrow, yet they could not forget the impressions of childhood, and were eventually brought to the Savior, to be a mother&#39;s joy and blessing. Many interesting facts have, within a few years, drawn the attention of Christians to this subject. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The efforts which a mother makes for the improvement of her child in knowledge and virtue, are necessarily retired and unobtrusive. The world knows nothing of them; and hence the world has been slow to perceive how powerful and extensive is </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">this secret and silent influence</span><span class="csC05134DD">. But circumstances are now directing the eyes of the community to the nursery, and the truth is daily coming more distinctly before the public, that the influence which is exerted upon the mind during the first eight or ten years of existence, in a great degree guides the destinies of that mind for time and eternity! And as the mother is the guardian and guide of the early years of life, from her goes the most powerful influence in the formation of the character of man. And why should it not be so? What impressions can be more strong, and more lasting, than those received upon the mind in the freshness and the vulnerability of youth? What instructor can gain greater confidence and respect than a mother? And where can there be delight in acquiring knowledge, if not when the little flock cluster around a mother&#39;s knee to hear of God and heaven?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;A good boy generally makes a good man.&quot; Said the mother of Washington, &quot;George was always a good boy.&quot; Here we see one secret of his greatness. George Washington had</span><span class="csF1BA8D25"> a mother who made him a good boy</span><span class="csC05134DD">, and instilled into his heart those principles which raised him to be the benefactor of his country, and one of the brightest ornaments of the world. The mother of Washington is entitled to a nation&#39;s gratitude. She taught her boy the principles of </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">obedience</span><span class="csC05134DD">, and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">moral courage</span><span class="csC05134DD">, and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">virtue.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> She, in a great measure, formed the character of the hero, and the statesman. It was by her own fire-side that she taught her playful boy to govern himself; and thus was he prepared for the brilliant career of usefulness which he afterward pursued. We are indebted to God for the gift of Washington; but we are no less indebted to him for the gift of his immeasurable mother. Had she been a weak, and indulgent, and unfaithful parent, the unchecked energies of Washington might have elevated him to the throne of a tyrant; or youthful disobedience might have prepared the way for a life of crime and a dishonored grave.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Byron had a mother just the reverse of lady Washington; and the character of the mother was transferred to the son. His character and conduct is from the education he received, and the scenes witnessed in his mother. She would at one time allow him to disobey and another time, she would fly into a rage and beat him. She thus taught him to defy all authority, human and divine; to indulge, without restraint, in sin; to give himself up to the power of every maddening passion. It was the mother of Byron who laid the foundation of his pre-eminence in guilt. She taught him to plunge into that sea of sin and wretchedness, upon whose frantic waves he was tossed for life. If the crimes of the poet deserve the execration of the world&mdash;the world cannot forget that it was the mother who fostered in his youthful heart those passions which made the son a curse to his fellow-men.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">There are innumerable causes constantly operating in the formation of character. </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">A mother&#39;s influence</span><span class="csC05134DD"> is by no means the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">only</span><span class="csC05134DD"> influence which is exerted. Still it may be the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">most powerful;</span><span class="csC05134DD"> for, with God&#39;s ordinary blessing, it may form in the youthful mind the habits, and implant the principles, to which other influences are to give permanency and vigor.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">A pious and faithful mother may have a immoral child. He may break away from all restraints, and God may leave him to &quot;eat the fruit of his own devices.&quot; The parent, thus afflicted and broken-hearted, can only bow before the sovereignty of her Maker, who says, &quot;be still, and know that I am God.&quot; The consciousness, however, of having done one&#39;s duty, divests this affliction of much of its bitterness. And beside, such cases are rare. Profligate children are generally the offspring of parents who have neglected the moral and religious education of their family. Some parents are themselves reckless, and thus not only allow their children to grow up unrestrained, but by their example lure them to sin. But there are others, who are very upright, and virtuous, and even pious themselves, who do, nevertheless, neglect the moral culture of their children; and as a consequence, they grow up in disobedience and sin. It matters but little what the cause is which leads to this neglect. The neglect itself will ordinarily be followed by disobedience and self-will.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Children of prominent men, both in church and state, are frequently the disgrace of their parents if the mother does not govern her children, if she looks to the father to enforce obedience, and to control; when he is absent, all family government is absent, and the children are left to run wild&mdash;to learn lessons of disobedience; to practise deception; to build, upon the foundation of contempt for a mother, a character of insubordination and iniquity. But if the children are under the efficient government of a judicious mother, the reverse of this is almost always the case. And since, in nearly every instance, the early years of life are entrusted to a mother&#39;s care, it follows that maternal influence, more than any thing else, forms the future character.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">John Newton is often mentioned as a proof of the deep and lasting impression which a mother may produce upon the mind of her child. He had a pious mother. She often retired to her closet, and placing her hand upon his youthful head, prayed God&#39;s blessing upon her boy. These prayers and instructions sunk deep into his heart. He could not but revere that mother. He could not but feel that there was a holiness in such a character, demanding reverence and love. He could not tear from his heart, in after life, the impressions then produced. Though he became a wicked wanderer, though he forsook friends and home, and every virtue; the remembrance of a mother&#39;s prayers, like a guardian angel, followed him wherever he went. He mingled in the most evil and disgraceful scenes of a sailor&#39;s life, and while surrounded with guilty associates, in midnight revelry, he would remember the soft hand of his mother upon his head, pleading with God to forgive and bless her boy. He went to the coast of Africa, and became even more degraded than the savages upon her dreary shores. But the soft hand of his mother was still upon his head, and the fervent prayers of his mother still thrilled in his heart. And this influence, after the lapse of many guilty years, brought back the prodigal, a penitent and a child of God; elevated him to be one of the brightest ornaments of the Christian church, and to guide many sons and daughters to glory. What a force, the power of a mothers love and influence! What encouragement &nbsp;to every mother to be faithful in her efforts to train up her child for God! Had Mrs. Newton neglected her duty, had she even been as careless as many Christian mothers, her son, to all human view, might have continued in sin, and been an outcast from heaven. It was through the influence of the mother that the son was saved. Newton became afterward a most successful preacher of the Gospel, and every soul which he was instrumental in winning, as he sings the song of Amazing Grace, will, through eternity, bless God that Newton had such a mother.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The influence thus exerted upon the mind, in early childhood, may, for many years, be apparently lost. When a son leaves home, and enters upon the busy world, many are the temptations which come crowding upon him. If he leaves home without established principles of religion and self-control, he will most assuredly fall before these temptations. He may indeed fall, even after all a mother has done, or can do; and he may become deeply involved in guilt.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">But he may apparently forget every lesson he learnt at home, while the influence of a mother&#39;s instructions, and a mother&#39;s prayers, is yet working powerfully and effectually in his heart. He will think of &nbsp;mother&#39;s tears, when remorse keeps him awake at midnight, or when danger threatens him. The thoughts of home will often throw bitterness into his cup of guilty pleasure, and compel him to sigh for the virtue and the peace he has forsaken. He must think of a broken-hearted mother. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Some were going to attend a meeting in the mariner&#39;s chapel. Directly opposite the chapel there was a sailor&#39;s boarding house. In the door-way sat a tough, weather-beaten sailor, with arms folded, and watching the people as they assembled the meeting. A gentleman walked up to him and said, &quot;Well, my friend, won&#39;t you go with us the meeting today?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; said the sailor, bluntly. The gentleman, mildly replied, &quot;You look, my friend, as though you have seen some hard days; have you a mother?&quot; The sailor raised his head, looked earnestly in the gentleman&#39;s face, and made no reply.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The gentleman continued&mdash;&quot;Suppose your mother were here now, what advice would she give you?&quot; The tears rushed into the eyes of the poor sailor; he tried for a moment to conceal them, but could not; and, hastily brushing them away with the back of his rough hand, rose and said, with a rough voice &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll go to the meeting with you.&quot; He crossed the street, entered the door of the chapel, and took his seat with the assembled congregation.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">What became of the man is not known. It is almost certain that he must have had a mother who had given him good instruction; and when the gentleman appealed to her, hardened as the sailor was, his heart melted!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">I once knew a mother who had an only son. She loved him most ardently, and could not bear to deny him any indulgence. He, of course, soon learned to rule his mother. At the death of his father, the poor woman was left at the mercy of this vile boy. She had neglected her duty when he was young, and now his ungovernable passions had become too strong for her control. Self-willed, turbulent, and revengeful, he was his mother&#39;s bitterest curse. His fits of rage at times amounted almost to madness. One day, infuriated with his mother, he set fire to her house, and it was burned to the ground, with all its contents, and she was left in the extremest state of poverty. He was imprisoned and, in his cell, he became a maniac, and madly dug out his own eyes. He now lies in permanent darkness, an infuriated madman.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">O how hard it must be for a mother, after all her pain, and anxiety, and watchings, to find her son a demoniac spirit, instead of a guardian and friend!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">You have watched over your child, through all the months of its helpless infancy. You have denied yourself, that you might give it comfort. When it has been sick, you have been unmindful of your own weariness, and your own weakness, and through many nights you have watched at its cradle, administering to all its needs. When it has smiled, you have felt a joy which none but a parent can feel, and have pressed your much loved treasure to your bosom, praying that its future years of obedience and affection might be your ample reward. And now, how dreadful a requital, for that child to grow up to hate and abuse you; to leave you friendless, in sickness and in poverty; to squander all his earnings in haunts of iniquity and degradation!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">How entirely is your earthly happiness at the disposal of your child! His character is now, in an important sense, in your hands, and you are to form it for good or for evil. If you are consistent in your government, and faithful in the discharge of your duties, your child will probably through life revere you, and be the stay and solace of your declining years. If, on the other hand, you cannot summon resolution to punish your child when disobedient; if you do not curb his passions; if you do not bring him to entire and willing subjection to your authority; you must expect that he will be your curse. In all probability, he will despise you for your weakness. Unaccustomed to restraints at home, he will break away from all restraints, and make you wretched by his life, and disgraceful in his death.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Thousands of parents now stand in our land like oaks blighted and scathed by lightnings and storms. Thousands have had every hope wrecked, every prospect darkened, and have become the victims of the most agonizing and heart-rending disappointment, solely in consequence of the misconduct of their children. And yet thousands of others are going on in the same way, preparing to experience the same suffering, and are apparently unconscious of their danger.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">It is true that there are many mothers who feel their responsibilities perhaps as deeply as it is best they should feel them. But there are many others&mdash;even of Christian mothers&mdash;who seem to forget that their children will ever be less under their control than they are while young. And they are training them up, by indecision and indulgence, soon to tyrannize over their parents with a rod of iron&mdash;and to pierce their hearts with many sorrows!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">If you are unfaithful to your child when he is young, he will be unfaithful to you when he is old. If you indulge him in all his foolish and unreasonable wishes when he is a child, when he becomes a man he will indulge himself; he will gratify every desire of his heart; and your sufferings will be rendered the more poignant by the reflection that it was your own unfaithfulness which has caused your ruin.
