<p class=MsoNormal>Title: The Shepherd's Voice</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Text: John 10:14-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a Good Shepherd and a Path of Life. We are never
alone. There is a purpose for every test. We must understand from the Word what
we are doing so that we are never in the dark. If you don't have Jesus in you
you are no light to the World. He is the Shepherd of life. He leads us into
pastures of life. If we are simply &quot;just making it&quot; there is something
wrong. God has somethings in store for His people and He is no respecter of
persons. Let us desire to know the Life of Christ and follow Him every step of
the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Romans 2:11--God has given us insight, but just because we
have recieved a revelation of truth does not mean we have a &quot;special&quot;
position with God. We must KNOW God and OBEY Him. The Jews boasted in that to
them was committed the law by God, but Paul exhorted that all men were given
the law in their conscience. There is no many ways to eternal life, but ONE
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is something lacking in each of us, but we have a Good
Shepherd in Whom is no lack. &quot;You will fail yourself and those around
you.&quot; Jesus will NEVER fail you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John 10:1-6  v.1 Judas had been called out by Jesus to be
His disciple, and yet he became a thief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God has given to us and we too often don't share as we
should and if that is so we will lose it. People have lost things by the thief
and they become hard and hold grudges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barabbas was a robber. Took advantage of people. Low, mean,
would take a person's life in his stealing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.6--they did not understand nor recieve the first 5 verses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pope died with a false hope. (1/6 of the world follow
him and the path he took.) We must make sure the life of Jesus is working in
our heart for that life is the light of the world. His Word in us in life and a
light to the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a thief around! He doesn't just steal but robs,
kills, and destroys. He is trying to destroy our faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People must see Jesus. Your words are not enought, &quot;I
am a Christian.&quot; They MUST SEE JESUS IN YOU. Not just willing to give but
GIVING.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Divide. Destroy. Is the goal of the theif. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Know, believe, obey, and give yourself to truth. and the
thief won't be able to hinder us.</p>
