<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>There
is a Good Shepherd and a Path of Life. We are never alone. There is a purpose
for every test. We must understand from the Word what we are doing so that we
are never in the dark. If you don't have Jesus in you you are no light to the
World. He is the Shepherd of life. He leads us into pastures of life. If we are
simply &quot;just making it&quot; there is something wrong. God has somethings
in store for His people and He is no respecter of persons. Let us desire to
know the Life of Christ and follow Him every step of the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Romans
2:11--God has given us insight, but just because we have recieved a revelation
of truth does not mean we have a &quot;special&quot; position with God. We must
KNOW God and OBEY Him. The Jews boasted in that to them was committed the law
by God, but Paul exhorted that all men were given the law in their conscience.
There is no many ways to eternal life, but ONE way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>There
is something lacking in each of us, but we have a Good Shepherd in Whom is no
lack. &quot;You will fail yourself and those around you.&quot; Jesus will NEVER
fail you.</span></p>

10:1-6  v.1 Judas had been called out by Jesus to be His disciple, and yet he
became a thief. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>God
has given to us and we too often don't share as we should and if that is so we
will lose it. People have lost things by the thief and they become hard and
hold grudges.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Barabbas
was a robber. Took advantage of people. Low, mean, would take a person's life
in his stealing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>v.6--they
did not understand nor recieve the first 5 verses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The
pope died with a false hope. (1/6 of the world follow him and the path he
took.) We must make sure the life of Jesus is working in our heart for that
life is the light of the world. His Word in us in life and a light to the
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>There
is a thief around! He doesn't just steal but robs, kills, and destroys. He is
trying to destroy our faith. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>People
