Christ’s Holiness must be Remembered, 
Christ’s Holiness must be Preached
Christ’s Holiness must be Received
Christ’s Holiness must be Lived

2Co 7:1 ¶ Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Heb 7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
Christ’s Holiness must be A Call to Separation
2Co 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,
18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

The Christian is not of this world

John 17:17 ¶ Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

There are two great currents of influence in the world.

The indwelling, inward working, outward manifestation of the life and holiness of God Separate from the indwelling inward working, outward death and destruction of Satan
The separated believer living for God, received by God and the unseparated believer living for self, rejected by God.
Task of the Gospel and task of the world
Good and evil
Righteousness and unrighteousness
Light and darkness
Faith and sin
Clean and unclean, filthy
Spirit of Truth and a spirit of error
Christ and the devil
Believer and unbeliever- infidel
The Holy Ghost and the spirit of the world
Temple of God and Idols
Perfect Holiness and the filthiness of the flesh, worldliness
The church and the world
The Christian and the sinner
Witnesses of Christ to continue His work and the work of the devil.

Severed, cut off, disassociated, separated, get away from the influence of the world

1John 3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.








HOLINESS IS ATTAINED BY FAITH
I. Run to Gain the Prize
  a.	Everyone must run to gain the prize, 
  b.	Most believe just grace and that (there is no need to exercise faith diligently to gain the prize)                
  RUN to Him in worship for His Holiness and in His –Righteousness – understanding - knowledge Salvation is a gift- that cannot be earned. 
  This prize is Christ – like character; only earned by running according to the rules to win the prize.  There are conditions that have to be met in order to win.
I Cor. 9: 24  “Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.”                                                             

Phil. 3: 14  “I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.   He has produced what we couldn’t – (now run in obedience)

2Ti 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:
11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
13 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.                                                                                                         
II Tim. 2: 5  “And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.” 
“Nomimos” – “Lawfully” – agreeable, contending and achieving according to the rules.
10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
10 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:
14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
2Ti 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
Heb 12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.                                                                                                                           1Pe 5:10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.                                                                            2Co 9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:                                                                                                                   Col 1:28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:                                                                                                                                 29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
II. Fight the Good Fight of Faith
I Tim. 6: 12  “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.”
a. You must Fight the Good Fight of Faith to be an overcomer.  
There are forces that will fight against the believer, and for the believer to be an overcomer they must fight to keep what has been given to them by grace through faith.  
b. This is a fight of faith.
II Cor. 10: 4  “(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)”                                     Eph. 6: 12, 13   
III. Live the Life
a. Live life conformed to the Word of God, 
b. Live life conformed to the image of Christ.  
Matt. 7: 21  “Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.”                                                                                                          Tit1:16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.                                                        Jas. 1: 22  “But be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”
IV. Make no Provision for the Flesh
Flesh struggles desperately hard to survive in the best of men, but with the help of the Holy Spirit the flesh can, and will be overcome.  The more of Christ that the believer has in his life, the less the flesh will rule.
Rom. 13: 14  “But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.”
V. Perfect Holiness
a. Perfect holiness-visible evidence in conduct
b. Perfect holiness-visible evidence in character
II Cor.7:1Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
This is not perfecting holiness in order to be saved; but because the believer has been saved.  Therefore, cleanse yourself “...from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”
This is not something that we do in ourselves only, as Paul said in Phillipians, “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” (Phil. 2: 12, 13)
God made great promises and provisions for the believer.
We can achieve all that God requires and promises through accepting and acting upon them by faith.
II Pet. 1: 4  “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine Nature...”
VI. Crucify the Flesh
a. Flesh has to be crucified, 
b. Flesh cannot reign in the life of the overcomer.
Gal. 5: 24  “And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.”
Rom. 6: 12  “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.”
Rom. 6: 16 –18  
 “his servants ye are to whom ye obey;”
“obedience unto righteousness”
II Cor. 4: 10 -11  
Php 3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
 9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;

Following Christ and continuing to seek after the excellency of the knowledge of Him—continuing to seek to know Him more and more.
VII. Follow the Leading of the Spirit
a. Know the voice of God 
b. Follow His leading.
Rom. 8: 14  “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons (huios) of God.”
Jesus said in Jn. 10: 27  “My sheep (“Probaton” – advanced in years – distinct from “Arnia” lambs) hear My voice, and I know them, and they (the mature sheep) follow Me.”
Jn. 10: 4, 5  “And when He putteth forth His own sheep, He goeth before them, and the sheep follow Him: for they know His voice.  And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.”
Rev. 14: 4  “...These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth...”
