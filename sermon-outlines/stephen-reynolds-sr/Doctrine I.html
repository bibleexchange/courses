		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">As scientists learn about the Universe, the more they speak of &ldquo;the anthropic principle.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">The term &ldquo;anthropic&rdquo; derives from the Greekword </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">anthropos,</span><span class="csA7555675"> &ldquo;man,&rdquo; hence the expression suggests that the Universe in general, and our solar system in particular, has been specially designed for human existence.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">(1) The Sun&rsquo;s temperature (10,800 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface) is ideal for the right range of light wavelengths Which allow for life on this planet. Higher temperatures would result in too much ultraviolet radiation, and lower temperatures in too much infrared.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">(2) The Earth is situated the right distance from the Sun (93,000,000 miles) to maintain life. If the Earth were 10 per cent closer to the Sun, it would be an inferno; if it were</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">10 per cent farther away, it would be but an icy wasteland.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">(3) The Earth is balanced in a position relative to the Sun by the forces of gravity (pulling toward the Sun) and centrifugal force (an outward pushing due to the Earth&rsquo;s orbital movement in circling the Sun). It is traveling in its journey around the Sun (a distance of 600 million miles) at the speed of almost nineteen miles per second. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">In its orbital trip, the Earth varies from a straight line only one-ninth of an inch every eighteen miles. If its direction were altered by only one-tenth of an inch, the orbit would be so large that life on Earth would be impossible due to freezing conditions;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">if it changed by as much as one-eighth of an inch, we would be so close to the Sun as to exclude the possibility of life Moreover, the Earth&rsquo;s orbit is not a perfect circle; rather it is elliptical. Sometimes we are closer to the Sun than at other times. In January we are closest to the Sun; in July we are farthest away. When we are closer, however the Earth&ldquo; speeds up&rdquo; to avoid being pulled into the Sun, and when we are</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">farther away, our planet slows down. This evinces an amazing system of mechanics. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">Earth completes its orbit around the Sun once each three hundred and sixty-five and one-quarter days&mdash; making our year. This consideration, together with the fact that the Earth is tilted on its axis, allows for seasonal changes that enhance the Earth&rsquo;s productivity.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">The Earth rotates on its axis at the rate of about 1,000 miles per hour (at the equator); this rotation with reference to the Sun provides for periods of light and darkness, aphenomenonso necessary for sustaining life in this our &ldquo;home&rdquo; in the Universe. If the Earth rotated much faster, fierce cyclones would stir the features of our planet like a</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">mixer. If the Earth turned significantly slower, the days and nights would be impossibly hot or cold. Venus turns only once in 243days, which accounts in part for some daytime</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">temperatures as high as 500 degrees Celsius! And remember water boils at 100 degrees C.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">(4) The Earth&rsquo;s axis is inclined from the perpendicular to the plain of its orbit by twenty-three and one-half degrees</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">This accounts for the seasons. If it were not tilted, the poles would be in perpetual twilight Too, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The water vapor from the ocean would move north and south, piling up continents of ice and leaving possibly a desert between the equator and the ice. Glacial Rivers would erode and roar through canyons into the salt-covered bed of the ocean to form temporary pools of brine. The weight of the unbelievably vast mass of ice would depress the poles, causing our equator to bulge or erupt.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The lowering of the ocean would expose vast new land areas and diminish the rainfall in</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">all parts of the world, with fearful results</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">(5) TheMoon is 240,000 miles from Earth, circling our planet in its own orbit.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">The Moon&rsquo;s gravitational pull upon the Earth causes tidal waves, also the two low tides and two high tides every twenty-four hours. These are valuable to the Earth.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">The lunar tides have the greatly beneficial effects of cleansing shorelines and diluting stream discharges from land by the large-scale mixing process of currents. These tidal currents regularly scour out shipping channels and keep them open. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">The high tide permits navigation of waters which are too shallow at other times</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">If the Moon was closer to the Earth,huge tidal waves would daily devastate our globe.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">(6) Wrapped around our Earth is a protective blanket that We call atmosphere. It is composesd mainly of nitrogen (78 per cent), oxygen (21 per cent), and carbon dioxide (0.03 per cent), along with water vapor and minute levels of several other gases. The proper balance of these elements is absolutely essential to life on Earth. God mixed them just right! The atmosphere of Venus is much too thick to sustain life, and that of Mars is far too thin. There are tremendous advantages to our atmosphere. For instance, it diffuses light so that you can read these words even if you are Indoors and out of the direct sunlight. If there were no atmosphere, We never would have twilight (with its gorgeous sunsets). Without atmosphere, our solar heat would escape as soon as the Sun set and Earth&rsquo;s nightswould be unbearably cold. Millions of meteors fall from space each day. Were it not for the fact that most of them are burned up by the friction of striking the atmosphere, think what awful devastation might be wrought upon the Earth. In one of the upper layers of the atmosphere (the mesosphere), there is a special form of oxygen called ozone. Ozone filters out most of the ultraviolet rays, which would be quite harmful in larger amounts. This is why scientists are concerned about the use of certain substances that tend to deplete the ozone layer. Electronically charged particles in the upper atmosphere (ionosphere), called ions, facilitate radio communication.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Our atmosphere also has weight. It exerts a pressure of about fifteen pounds per square inch at the surface of the Earth. This amounts to about thirty thousand pounds of pressure upon our bodies. If it were not for the fact that we have been designed with air inside our bodies to balance this pressure, we could not live upon the Earth. If the pressure was more, we would &ldquo;cave in,&rdquo; and if it was less, we would explode. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Ps 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The Earth is turning on its axis once a day from west to east at more than 1000 miles per hour on the equator!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Earth revolves around the Sun at a speed of about 18.5 miles/sec</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Earth goes completely around the sun every 365 day (one year)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">8 minutes and 8 seconds for light to come from the sun to the earth. </span><span class="csC57700C4">...</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The circumference of the earth has a speed of 1,520 feet per second</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">28.4 degree orbit is chosen for Shuttle missions</span></p></body>
