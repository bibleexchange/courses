It marked Joseph out as the one to whom Jacob intended to bestow rulership of the family and the lion&#39;s share of his property. It set him apart from his brothers and put him on a plane of equality with his father.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The other brothers eyed that coat with undisguised jealousy. </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCEBE42A"><span class="csA521DC07">Reuben, the firstborn, eyed it and read his own second-rate future in it. </span></li><li class="csCEBE42A"><span class="csA521DC07">Judah eyed it,</span></li><li class="csCEBE42A"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;cruel Simeon eyed it, </span></li><li class="csCEBE42A"><span class="csA521DC07">and so did his buddy Levi. </span></li><li class="csCEBE42A"><span class="csA521DC07">The four sons of the slave wives eyed it, and the sight of it added fresh venom to their hatred. </span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Joseph drew that robe around his youthful shoulders and wore it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not his father&#39;s firstborn son? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the firstborn of Rachel, the true bride of Jacob&#39;s heart? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The robe was his and his by right, no matter what the jealous brothers might think. It was his by virtue of his unique relationship to the father and by virtue of his blameless life, a life that that marked the misbehavior of his brothers. The robe of </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">priesthood</span><span class="csA521DC07">, </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">position</span><span class="csA521DC07"> and </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">privilege</span><span class="csA521DC07"> was his.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Three things were wrapped up in the robe that Jacob presented to Joseph that day. As Joseph unwrapped the gift and saw it lying there before him he saw, at once, all that it implied. His jealous brothers saw it too.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">That robe spoke of </span><span class="csD3860DFD">priesthood.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">The family priesthood should have gone to Reuben, but Reuben&#39;s basic instability was well known to Jacob. So, for the time being, the custodianship of the priesthood was given to Joseph. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">That robe spoke of </span><span class="csD3860DFD">progenitorship.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> That, too, should have gone to Reuben&mdash;the right to be the one from whose descendants the promised Seed would come. Within the year Reuben would forever disgrace himself in a night&#39;s lustful passion. Again, for the time being at any rate, only Joseph qualified to be Jacob&#39;s heir in the matter of progenitorship. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">That robe spoke of </span><span class="csD3860DFD">priority and priviledge.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">It was the custom for the oldest son to receive a double portion of the father&#39;s estate, that is, he received twice as much as any of the other sons. The double portion was to go to Joseph; the robe proclaimed it and history assured it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The splendid dress given to Joseph, then, spoke volumes of the special place Joseph held in his father&#39;s heart and of Jacob&#39;s determination to see his beloved son lifted high. Old Jacob acted with eternity&#39;s values in view, for his act was typical in significance and scope. Beyond the story of Jacob and Joseph we catch a glimpse of God delighting in that unique and beloved Son of His, His firstborn. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Beyond Jacob and Joseph we see the Father in communion with His Son, finding all His delight in Him, determining that even though, by virtue of His coming into the world, He would have kinsmen according to the flesh, yet He would be distinct from them all and lifted up on high, above and beyond them all. The priesthood, the property, and the power were to be His. &nbsp;Jacob acted in such a way that, through him, God could display in some measure His own great, eternal thoughts. We pray He would do the same through us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">4.
