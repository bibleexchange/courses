On that day he probably entered the Holy of Holies three or four times, first to burn incense, <a class="cs4B967788" href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/16-12.htm"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Leviticus 16:12</span></a></span><span class="cs6F2C7003">; then to sprinkle the blood of the bullock on the mercy-seat, <a class="cs4B967788" href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/16-14.htm"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Leviticus 16:14</span></a></span><span class="cs6F2C7003">; then he was to kill the goat of the sin-offering, and bring that blood within the Veil and sprinkle it also on the mercy-seat, and then, perhaps, he entered again to bring out the golden censer. The Jewish tradition is, that he entered the Holy of Holies four times on that day. After all, however, the number of times is not certain, nor is it material, the only important point being that he entered it only on one day of the year, while the holy place was entered every day.</span></p><p class="csE36605C5"><span class="cs6F2C7003">Not without blood - That is, he bare with him blood to sprinkle on the mercy-seat. This was the blood of the bullock and of the goat - borne in at two different times.</span></p><p class="csE36605C5"><span class="cs6F2C7003">Which he offered for himself - The blood of the bullock was offered for himself and for his house or family - thus keeping impressively before his own mind and the mind of the people the fact that the priests even of the highest order were sinners, and needed expiation like others; <a class="cs4B967788" href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/9-7.htm"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Leviticus 9:7</span></a></span><span class="cs6F2C7003">.</span></p><p class="csE36605C5"><span class="cs6F2C7003">And for the errors of the people - The blood of the goat was offered for them; <a class="cs4B967788" href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/16-15.htm"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Leviticus 16:15</span></a></span><span class="cs6F2C7003">. The word rendered &quot;errors&quot; - &alpha;̓&gamma;&nu;&omicron;́&eta;&mu;&alpha; agnoēma - denotes properly &quot;ignorance, involuntary error;&quot; and then error or fault in general - the same as the Hebrew משׁגה mishgeh - from שׁגה shaagah - &quot;to err.&quot; The object was to make expiation for all the errors and sins of the people, and this occurred once in the year. The repetition of these sacrifices was a constant remembrancer of sin, and the design was that neither the priests nor the people should lose sight of the fact that they were violators of the Law of God</span><span class="cs1092A6E0">. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Ac 27:9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, {the fast: the fast was on the tenth day of the seventh month}</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="Ransom"><span class="cs5A8D6493">A Ransom Payment</span></a></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs892FC600">In Mark 10:45 Jesus said, &quot;the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many&quot; (cp. Matt. 20:28, NIV). This is a powerful statement. Jesus redeemed his followers from sin. The price of this redemption, however, was his own life (1 Tim. 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:18,19), the supreme expression of his love for us (cf. John 15:13).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">De 7:8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs892FC600">The Penal Substitution theory invokes more than just metaphors and prepositions, however. It also invokes Romans 3:25, which describes Jesus &quot;whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith&quot; (NASV; cp. 1&nbsp;John 2:2; 4:10). The meaning of &quot;propitiation&quot; here is brought out in an NIV footnote, &quot;as the one who would turn aside his wrath.&quot; Certainly if Jesus&#39; death &quot;propitiated&quot; or &quot;satisfied&quot; the offended Father then the Satisfaction/Penal Substitution theory would be strengthened.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs892FC600">So what is the key word in Romans 3:25 and related verses? Does it really mean &quot;propitiation&quot;? The Greek word is </span><span class="csFB23D480">hilasterion </span><span class="cs892FC600">and it means &quot;mercy-seat.&quot; The related term in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 is </span><span class="csFB23D480">hilasmos,</span><span class="cs892FC600"> the term used to describe the sin-offering of the old covenant.</span><span class="cs892FC600"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="cs892FC600"> Whether these terms imply propitiation depends upon how one believes the mercy-seat and sin-offering functioned. Hence the wisdom of the NIV&#39;s reading &quot;an atoning sacrifice&quot; instead of the NASV&#39;s &quot;a propitiation.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">Rom. 5:10; 2 Cor. 5:18,19; Col. 1:20).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs892FC600">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3A3152D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3A3152D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Christ the Reconciler of All Things, <a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Col+1%3A20-23"><span class="cs835A930E">1:20-23</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Col+1%3A20-23"><span class="cs92015F65">1:20-23</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) </span><span class="csA657E9A2">Introduction</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: this passage is one of the great studies of Scripture, the message of reconciliation.

This is one of the great verses of Scripture, but it is a shocker, an eye-opener. It seems to be teaching universal salvation, that is, that everything in heaven and earth has been saved through the blood of Christ. This, of course, could not be what Paul meant, for it is not what the rest of Scripture teaches. Note three significant facts.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great need for peace between God and man. Man is not at peace with God. His soul is restless and disturbed, lonely and empty, without direction and purpose: his soul is as separated from God as it can be. Man&#39;s relationship with God can be described in three ways.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Man is not at </span><span class="csC382D2BB">peace with God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

Man does not know God personally; he is not near God nor close to God. He often questions the very existence of God, and even if he believes that God exists, he knows little if anything about talking and sharing with God.</span></p><p class="csC9DCC425"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Instead of sensing </span><span class="csC382D2BB">peace with God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, he senses separation from God, as though God is out in space someplace, far away from the earth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+5%3A1"><span class="cs835A930E">Romans 5:1</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Man does not experience the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">peace of God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Note the word &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">of</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;: the peace &quot;of&quot; God refers to possessing the peace of God within one&#39;s heart and life. As man walks throughout the day taking care of his affairs, his heart is not settled; he lacks peace; he knows little if anything of the peace of God. He lacks complete assurance as he faces the circumstances, problems, difficulties, trials, and temptations of life.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

There are two pictures that show us.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the picture of unjust punishment and death. The cross was the place where criminals were executed. This means that Jesus Christ died as an unjust criminal, yet He was not a criminal. He did not deserve to die, for He had broken no law. He was not upon the cross because He deserved to die; He was not there because of His own sins. Therefore, He was bound to be dying for someone else. He was the Just dying for the unjust.</span></p><p class="csC9DCC425"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is very significant. If the Just died for the sins of the unjust, then the unjust is no longer guilty of sin. He is freed from the charge of being a sinner: he is no longer considered unjust; he is considered just. How? By faith. When a person truly believes that the Just Christ died for his unjust sins, God counts it so. God takes the person&#39;s faith and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">accepts it as his identification with Christ</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Being freed from the charge of sin, the person becomes acceptable to God. The person is reconciled and brought near God by Christ dying for his unjust sins.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit&quot; (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+3%3A18"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Peter 3:18</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the picture of blood or of sacrifice. When the blood of Christ is mentioned, the idea of sacrifice is meant. The blood of Christ is tied to the blood of animal sacrifices in the Old Testament. Down through the centuries God had told man that sin was serious, very serious&mdash;a matter worthy of death. It was sin that separated man from God. Therefore, man either had to die for his sins or else someone else who was innocent and without transgression had to be sacrificed for him. That Someone, of course, had to be God Himself, for no one else is innocent and perfect. But it was not yet time for God to come to earth in the person of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; the fulness of time had not yet come. Man had not yet learned the awfulness of sin and the great price that God would be paying in sacrificing His Son for man.</span></p><p class="csC9DCC425"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Animal sacrifice was one of the ways God was going to teach these truths to man. A man was to believe that the animal was sacrificed for him. If he truly believed, then God accepted the animal sacrifice as bearing his sins. This, of course, meant the man was freed from the charge of sin. He was thereby reconciled and made acceptable to God by the blood that was shed.</span></p><p class="csC9DCC425"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The point is this: the shed blood of Christ is the supreme sacrifice. The perfect blood of God&#39;s own Son has now been sacrificed for man&#39;s sins. Therefore, the sacrifice of animals find their fulfillment in Christ. If a man believes that the blood of Christ (His life) was sacrificed for his sins, then God accepts his faith as the fact. God credits the believer&#39;s faith as the death of Christ. The believer is identified with the death of Christ, as having already died. Therefore, he never again has to die. He is reconciled and brought near God by the blood or sacrifice of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed&quot; (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+2%3A24"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Peter 2:24</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the picture of the cross or of being cursed. The death of Christ on the cross is always the picture of a curse:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree&quot; (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Gal+3%3A13"><span class="cs835A930E">Galatians 3:13</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csDF1756D1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The curse, of course, is death. Everyone who ever hung on the cross was doomed to die as a criminal. However, the picture goes much deeper than physical death. Spiritual and eternal death are also meant. Man is doomed to spiritual and eternal death and there is no escape other than Christ. When Christ hung on the cross, He bore the curse of condemnation, punishment, and death for man. The man who truly believes that Christ bore his curse and condemnation becomes acceptable to God. Very simply, God loves His Son so much that He will accept any person who honors His Son through genuine trust and belief. If a person believes that his sins are forgiven through the cross of Christ, then God will forgive his sins. God loves His Son that much. He will make His Son&#39;s death effective for whatever a man believes. Therefore, if a person believes that the blood of Christ reconciles him to God, God will reconcile him. God will honor His Son by doing it; God will allow the person of true faith to draw near Him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

All things are reconciled to God, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven. As stated earlier, this does not mean universal salvation. Scripture does not teach that every person shall be reconciled to God. Common sense and looking around with a dose of honesty tell us this. The next verse and point make it clear that only true believers are reconciled to God. The height of injustice would be for the unjust to be accepted by God. If the unjust continues to deny and curse God and to act selfishly toward his neighbor, God would not be God if He accepted the unjust. What this verse means is this:</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;God has reconciled all things in earth: both man and his world have been reconciled to God. The door of reconciliation with God is now open, and man is to enter and live with God forever. God has done all He can: He has made it possible for man to draw near Him through reconciliation. It is up to man to draw near. God has done His part; man must now do his part. Man must now turn to God through faith in the blood of Christ.</span></p><p class="csC9DCC425"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Note another point as well. The reconciliation of &quot;all things&quot; includes all of creation, the world itself. The earth was created for man, to be his place of residence; therefore, creation shall be redeemed even as man shall be redeemed. There shall be a new heaven and a new earth even as there shall be a new man that lives eternally.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body&quot; (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+8%3A21-23"><span class="cs835A930E">Romans 8:21-23</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Pe+3%3A10-13"><span class="cs835A930E">2 Peter 3:10-13</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;God has reconciled all things in heaven: by heaven is probably meant all the worlds of all dimensions. All worlds, all dimensions of being, have been reconciled to God by Christ. No matter what dimensions there are&mdash;even if there is only one other dimension, the spiritual dimension&mdash;every being in it has been reconciled to God through the death of Christ. The death of Christ is so great and wonderful, it embraces all worlds, no matter what or where they are.</span></p><p class="csC9DCC425"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Note: the idea of the verse is looking ahead&mdash;looking ahead to the life that will exist in the new heavens and earth. The life of the future will be a life of reconciliation with God, a life that will see everything in the new heavens and earth reconciled to God. This does not mean that murderers, adulterers, idolaters, and the host of other unbelievers will be there. It means that everyone who is there will be reconciled to God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation&quot; (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Co+5%3A18-19"><span class="cs835A930E">2 Cor. 5:18-19</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eph+2%3A16"><span class="cs835A930E">Ephes. 2:16</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Col+1%3A20"><span class="cs835A930E">Col. 1:20</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+2%3A17"><span class="cs835A930E">Hebrews 2:17</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="sp10186"></a><a name="link535"><span class="cs3D5B4455">2.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (</span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Col+1%3A21-22"><span class="cs92015F65">1:21-22</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) </span><span class="csA657E9A2">Reconciliation&mdash; Jesus Christ, Death</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: God has reconciled those who were alienated and were enemies of God.

A man thinks about doing something and he knows it is against God&#39;s will and Word. But the thought is planted in his mind, and he harbors the thought. It is the thought, the mind that leads to wicked works. And any behavior or act that is not in accordance with God&#39;s will is rebellion. When the human heart is aroused to disobey God, it acts against God. And acting against the King of kings is insurrection.

He stood before the human race as the Ideal and perfect Man, and as the Ideal and Perfect Man, His perfection and righteousness could stand for all men.

This is the great love of God, for Jesus Christ was willing to die for man. When a man really believes that Christ died for him, God takes the man&#39;s faith and counts it as his death. Therefore, the man never has to die. When he passes from this life into the next, he will never taste or experience death. Quicker than the blink of an eye God will transfer the believer into His presence. Why? Because the death of Jesus Christ covers him. Jesus Christ has already paid the penalty and suffered the condemnation of the believer&#39;s sin.

Three things are essential for us to be allowed to stand before God.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be holy (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">hagios</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">): separated, set apart, and consecrated to God.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;We must live lives that are set apart to Christ, to the belief that He died for our reconciliation and that His death covers us.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;We must live lives that are separated from worldliness and selfishness and from the flesh and its sins.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;We must live lives that are set apart and consecrated to God and His service, lives that live for His cause.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also be &quot;unblameable&quot; (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">amōmous</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup></sup></span><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=U\#4111: Unblameable"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;4111</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71">): without blemish, without spot, faultless, without any defect whatsoever.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also be &quot;unreproveable&quot; (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">anegklētous</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup></sup></span><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=U\#4169: Unreproveable"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;4169</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71">): beyond reproach, blameless, unchargeable. Imagine standing before God holy, unblameable, and beyond reproach. Imagine how pleased God would be!

We would be speechless, no doubt. But what a day of coronation, of glory, of greatness&mdash;standing face to face with our Father, the God of all glory, the Sovereign Majesty of the whole universe.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is God&#39;s one great purpose in reconciliation: to present us perfect before Him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints&quot; (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Th+3%3A12-13"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Thes. 3:12-13</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Th+5%3A23"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Thes. 5:23</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Pe+3%3A14"><span class="cs835A930E">2 Peter 3:14</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye </span><span class="csA657E9A2">present</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
