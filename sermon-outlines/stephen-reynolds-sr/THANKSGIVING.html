She and her sister, Betsy, had just been transferred to the worst German prison camp they had seen yet, Ravensbruck. On entering the barracks, they found them extremely overcrowded and flea-infested.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That morning, their Scripture reading in 1 Thessalonians had reminded them to rejoice always, pray constantly, and give thanks in all circumstances. Betsy told Corrie to stop and thank the Lord for every detail of their new living quarters.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Corrie at first flatly refused to give thanks for the fleas, but Betsy persisted, and Corrie finally succumbed to her pleadings. During the months spent at the camp, they were surprised to find how openly they could hold Bible study and prayer meetings without guard interference.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It was not until several months later that they learned the reason the guards would not enter the barracks was because of the fleas.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Repeated Thanks Not Copyrightable</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One item sent in for copyright at the Library of Congress was a book written by a whimsical Texas businessman, who intended to hand out copies to his customers and friends.

The following prayer by kindergarten children was declared illegal:</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;We thank you for the flowers so sweet;</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We thank you for the food we eat;</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We thank you for the birds that sing;</span></p><p class="cs8C7BE0DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We thank you God for everything.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">George Washington&#39;s final remarks to the nation in 1796 should be widely publicized. He said, &quot;Of all the habits that lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would men claim the tributes of patriotism who would work to destroy these great pillars of human happiness.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Ty Cobb&#39;s Deathbed Conversion</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Then there is Ty Cobb, that all-time great who played 3,033 games and for 12 years led the American League in batting average. For four years, he batted over 400. On his death bed, July 17, 1961, he accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior. He said, &quot;You tell the boys I&#39;m sorry it was the last part of the ninth that I came to know Christ. I wish it had taken place in the first half of the first.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">The First Thanksgiving</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The first American Thanksgiving Day was celebrated within sight of forty graves in the Plymouth cemetery, while fifty-five English-speaking people, including only four women, survivors of the original band of Pilgrim exiles, gathered to praise God after the epidemic and death of those first crushing twelve-months</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Lincoln And Book Of Job</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Where have you been, Father?&quot; asked the family of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;To the war department,&quot; he answered.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Any news?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Yes, plenty of news, but no good news. It is dark, dark everywhere.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He then reached forth one of his long arms and took a small Bible from a stand near the head of the sofa, opened its pages, and was soon absorbed in reading them.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fifteen minutes passed, and on glancing at the sofa his wife observed that the face of the president was more cheerful. His dejected expression was gone, and his countenance was lighted up with new resolution and hope. Wondering at the marked change, and desiring to know what book of the Bible had comforted Mr. Lincoln, she walked gently around the sofa and saw that he was reading the comforting book of Job.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Bail faster ---- the economy ------ a sinking Titanic ---- all the 7/11 will want bail out</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs7554B081"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2Ti 3:2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents</span><span class="csA657E9A2">, unthankful</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, unholy, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2Ti 3:9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Some Most Important Words</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE SIX MOST IMPORTANT WORDS:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I admit I made a mistake.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE FIVE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;You did a good job.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE FOUR MOST IMPORTANT WORDS:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;What is your opinion?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;If you please.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT WORDS:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE MOST IMPORTANT WORD:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE LEAST IMPORTANT WORD:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">SUPERLATIVE WORDS</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fabulous</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Magnificent</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Splendid</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Marvelous</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Wonderful</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Glorious</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Supreme</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Awesome</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Amazing</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Bountifulness</span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2Co 9:11 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Only God is Holy Awesome &nbsp;love good true</span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Ex 15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods?
