The Septuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Old Testament, can be accurately placed at least two-hundred and fifty years before the birth of Christ. &nbsp;Since the Greek Septuagint was translated from the Hebrew text there had to have been the Hebrew Old Testament in existence at least two-hundred and fifty years before the New Testament. &nbsp;This is historical proof that these prophecies were written hundreds of years in advance of their detailed fulfillment in the New Testament.
