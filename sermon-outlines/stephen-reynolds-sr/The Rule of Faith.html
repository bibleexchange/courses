The primary arena of the Christian woman&rsquo;s ministry</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">is to her husband and family. From the beginning she was fashioned for this distinctive purpose. She was</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">molded by the hand of God to be a helper for the man.

Her</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">contribution is thus complimentary to his objectives and labors.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">Helpers, by definition, are not initiators. They do not take the prominent role. They are not the leaders.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">They occupy a support position and lend aid to those they are associated with.

She is a follower, not the leader. He guides</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">and directs, she responds. He has prominence, she, retirement.
