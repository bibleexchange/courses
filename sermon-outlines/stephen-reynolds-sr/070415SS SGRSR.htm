<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Overcoming Temptation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: James 4:7-10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Good, Faithful, almighty, true, salvation, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can never make myself like God. That is the devil’s lie
from the Beginning Genesis 3. There is no possible way to becomelike God on
your own. He has to do it. He has designed a plan and it workds and it is good.
How many times have I felt miserable when I did wrong? Thank God He did not let
me be happy in my sin. We are thinking about What is the Lord Like? Who is the
Lord? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Satan is the tempter, what is the Lord?</p>

</span></span>God cannot be moved, set, established, always knows what He is
going to do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The best way to deal with temptation is before it ever
starts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I Thessalonians 3:5 Who is the tempter? Does the Lord ever
tempt me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lord is not a tempter, the devil is the tempter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I Thessalonians 2:4 <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span>God
trieth our hearts. There is a big difference between tempting you and trying
your heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The First Key to Overcoming Temptation is Submitting
     Yourself to God, Ja. 4:7</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This submission is not just when temptation is upon
you. That would be like walking on the edge of a cliff. We must know God and
that He is going to test us: Get away from the edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Matthew 4:1 The devil is the
tempter, God tries the Heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Deuteronomy 8:2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mt. 4&amp; Lk. 4 The tempter comes
by to tempt Christ to satisfy the flesh in <u>response to his words</u>. That
is the key, there is noting wrong with eating. Especially when you have gone 40
days without food. The key is the fact that the devil is behind it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I don’t like silk on a man. I was
taught when you go to church you wear a dress shirt and tie. My tie is probably
made of silk. But, I am not going to strain at gnats. I am not going to touch
what the devil says. Instead of arguing is this right or wrong or is that
person right or wrong, but find out if the design of devil is involved. Luke
22:31 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jesus is being asked three
questions: 1)If you be the son of God, make bread of these stones. The devil is
always looking for opportunity to best tempt. Jesus had been fasting for 40
days. The stones were no problem for Christ, but He would not doing anything to
satisfy the devil. There is nothing wrong with making bread out of stones. What
is wrong is the suggestion of the devil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>You can know the difference between
the devil the tempter and God the tester. God tests us with His Word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>What is it in my heart that the
devil is using to tempt me? Get it out! I don’t have to live a life of
constantly perpetually being tempted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>James 1:2 Temptations will be MANY
not few. But not forever, not all day long seven days a week. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The Second Key is Walking in the Path of Duty, (IN HIS
     WILL&lt; GOD IS MY PROTECTOR) You will never fail trusting God. </li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the midst of the temptation is not the time to start
learning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James 1:12-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
lust, and enticed. v.15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lust—evil desires</p>
