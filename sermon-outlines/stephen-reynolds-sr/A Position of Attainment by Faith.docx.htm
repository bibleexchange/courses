<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Rev. 19: 8</span>  “And to her was granted
that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen
is the righteousness of saints.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is not just imputed righteousness, this is ‘acts of
righteousness’ (acquired righteousness).  This is righteousness acquired
through appropriation by faith, and through application of the truth by grace.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Eph. 4: 13</span>  “Till we all come in the
unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, <b>unto a perfect
man</b>, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:”</h2>

</span></span><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bride will Run to Gain the
Prize</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not everyone will run, for most have been taught that they
have been given everything by grace and there is no need to exercise energy to
gain the prize.  Salvation is a gift that can not be earned. This is a prize
that is only earned by running, and not by running only, but running according
to the rules to win the prize.  Therefore, there are conditions that have to be
met in order to win.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>I Cor. 9: 24</span>  “Know ye not that they
which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may
obtain.”</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Phil. 3: 14</span>  “I press toward the
mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>II Tim. 2: 5</span>  “And if a man also
strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive <b>lawfully</b>.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nomimos” – “Lawfully” – agreeable to the rules</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This word “nomimos“ is used in contending in the games and
achieving according to the rules.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Heb. 12: 1</span>  “Wherefore seeing we
also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with

Fight of Faith</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bride of Christ is an overcomer.  To be an overcomer
something has to be overcome.  There are forces that will fight against the
believer, and for the believer to be an overcomer they must fight to keep what
has been given to them by grace.  This is a fight of faith.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>II Cor. 10: 4</span>  “(For the weapons of
our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
strong holds;)”</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Eph. 6: 12, 13</span>  “For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
places.  Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able
to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.”</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>I Tim. 6: 12</span>  “Fight the good fight
of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast
professed a good profession before many witnesses.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;

</span></span><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bride will Live the Life</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bride will not only profess a good profession, but will
live a life conformed to the Word of God, and to the image of Christ.  There
has to be a connection between the character of those who profess Christ as
Lord, and those who adorn themselves in a suitable life-style that pleases the
Lord.  Like Enoch of old “<i>...before his translation he had this testimony,
that he pleased God.</i>”</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Matt. 7: 21</span>  “Not every one that
saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.”</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Titus 1: 16</span>  “They profess that they
know God; but in works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and
unto every good work reprobate.”</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Jas. 1: 22</span>  “But be ye doers of the
Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”</h2>

</span></span><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bride will Make no
Provision for the Flesh</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Flesh struggles desperately hard to survive in the best of
men, but with the help of the Holy Spirit the flesh can, and will be overcome. 
The more of Christ that the believer has in his life, the less the flesh will
rule.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Rom. 13: 14</span>  “But put ye on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
thereof.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;

</span></span><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bride will Perfect Holiness</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bride of Christ will perfect holiness both in the flesh
and in the spirit.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>II Cor. 7: 1</span>  “Having therefore
these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is not perfecting holiness in order to be saved; but
because the believer has been saved.  Therefore, cleanse yourself “<i>...from
all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness <b><u>in</u></b> <b><u>the</u></b>
<b><u>fear</u></b> <b><u>of</u></b> <b><u>God</u></b>.</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is not something that we do in ourselves only, as Paul
said in Phillipians, “<i>Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  For
<b><u>it</u></b> <b><u>is</u></b> <b><u>God</u></b> <b><u>which</u></b> <b><u>worketh</u></b>
<b><u>in</u></b> <b><u>you</u></b> both to will and to do of His good pleasure.</i>”
(Phil. 2: 12, 13)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God has made great promises and provisions for the believer
to achieve all that God requires, but only if these promises are accepted and
acted upon by faith.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>II Pet. 1: 4</span>  “Whereby are given
unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that <b><u>by</u></b> <b><u>these</u></b>
ye might be <b>partakers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D<b>ivine</b> <b>Nature</b>...”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:.75in;text-align:left;text-indent:-35.95pt'><span

</span></span><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bride will have Crucified
the Flesh</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bride of Christ will have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts.  The flesh has to be crucified, flesh cannot reign in the
life of the <b>overcomer</b>.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Gal. 5: 24</span>  “And <b><u>they</u></b> <b><u>that</u></b>
<b><u>are</u></b> <b><u>Christ's</u></b> have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bible makes it very plain that the believer is commanded
not to let sin reign.  If the believer is commanded not to let sin reign, then
the believer is capable of not letting sin reign.  God does not require that
which is impossible to do.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Rom. 6: 12</span>  “Let not sin therefore
reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember, ye are servants to (owned by) whoever ye yeild
yourselves to obey.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Rom. 6: 16–18  </span>“Know ye not, that to
whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, <b>his servants ye are to whom ye
obey</b>; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?  But
God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the
heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.  Being then made free from
sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, the flesh must be crucified if the life of Jesus is to
be made manifest in us.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>II Cor. 4: 10, 11  </span>“Always bearing
about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
might be made manifest in our body.  For we which live are alway <b>delivered</b>
<b>unto</b> <b>death</b> for Jesus' sake, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>also</b>
<b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>manifest</b> <b>in</b>
<b>our</b> <b>mortal</b> <b>flesh</b>.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;

</span></span><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Bride will Follow the
Leading of the Spirit</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bride of Christ, having attained to full maturity
(huios), positioned as sons, will know the voice of the Lord and will follow
His leading.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Rom. 8: 14</span>  “For as many as are led
by the Spirit of God, they are the sons <span style='font-style:normal'>(huios)</span>
of God.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus said in Jn. 10: 27  “<i>My sheep</i> (“Probaton” –
advanced in years – distinct from “Arnia” lambs) <i>hear My voice, and I know
them, and they</i> (the mature sheep) <i>follow Me.</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only mature saints hear the voice of the Lord and follow His
leading.  Babes, like lambs, often confuse the voice of other shepherds with
the voice of their Master.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Matt. 24: 5</span>  “For many shall come in
My name, saying, I am Christ; and <b>shall deceive many.</b>”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only the immature babes (lambs) will be deceived.  The
mature sons (sheep) will not be deceived and led astray.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Jn. 10: 4, 5</span>  “And when He putteth
forth His own <b><u>sheep</u></b>, He goeth before them, and the <b><u>sheep</u></b>
follow Him: for they know His voice.  And a <b><u>stranger</u></b> will <b><u>they</u></b>
<b><u>not</u></b> <b><u>follow</u></b>, but will flee from him: for they know
not the voice of strangers.”</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Rev. 14: 4</span>  “...These are they which
follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth...”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:.75in;text-align:left;text-indent:-35.95pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus said:</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Mk. 12: 30</span>  “…Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy <b>heart</b>, and with all thy <b>soul</b>, and with
all thy <b>mind</b>, and with all thy <b>strength</b>:” </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To do this requires perfection, full growth in the Spirit,
and perfect obedience.  This is a command, “<i>Thou shalt,</i>” but it is also
a promise, “<i>Thou shalt.</i>”  The Lord is promising the ability to do it. 
The Lord will never require what we cannot do without giving the ability to do
it.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Phil. 2: 13</span>  “For it is God which
worketh in you…”</h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Jn. 14: 21</span>  “He that hath My
commandments, and <b>keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me:</b> and he that
loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest <span
style='font-style:normal'>(reveal)</span> Myself to him.” </h2>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>I Jn. 2: 3–5</span>  “…Hereby we do know
that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.  He that saith, I know Him, and
keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  But
whoso keepeth His Word, in him verily is the love of God perfected…”</h2>

crowns of gold.  Crowns are not gifts, they are awarded for achievement.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>Rev. 4: 4</span>  “…And they had on their
heads crowns of gold.”</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Salvation is not a prize to be gained or earned; it is a
gift that must be received by faith.  However, there is promised to the
believer that will run, that will fight the good fight of faith, and that will
walk obediently in the truth, a crown.</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>I Cor. 9: 24, 25</span>  “Know ye not that
they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye
may obtain.  And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
things.  Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an

promise of throne rights is only given to the overcomer, not to the whole
Church.  He was addressing the whole Church, but the whole Church will not
listen.  The promise to sit with Him on His throne is to the overcomer.  </p>
