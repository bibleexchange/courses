<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: A New Concept of Worship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: John 4:10-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.32 <i>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye
know not of.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He knows what we are going through, HE KNOWS. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter begins with the Lord knowing how the Pharisees
were talking about him and putting him on a level of competition with the rest
of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Jesus made and
baptized more disciples than John,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True worship has to do with worshipping Him. Not just to get
him to do something for me but he HAS already done something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
(and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full
of grace and truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lu 12:23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more
than raiment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Php 3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for
the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have
suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win
Christ,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John 4:32 <i>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that
ye know not of.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HOW IMPORTANT TRUTH IS:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Often we are looking for a certain feeling, but
feelings go up and down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The truth is the foundation for true worship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he
will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but
whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to
come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ge 1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the
herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose
seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to see revival, worship Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must
worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eph 4:3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the
bond of peace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jas 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
devil, and he will flee from you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Hab 3:18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in
the God of my salvation.</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joh 9:9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him:
but he said, I am he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 1Jo 3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we
shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</p>
