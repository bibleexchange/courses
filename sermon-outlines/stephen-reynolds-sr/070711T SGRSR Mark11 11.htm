<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Tent Revival Crusade</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Kennedy Park, Lewiston,
Maine </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Rev. Stephen G.
Reynolds, Sr.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>July 11, 2007</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: He Looked Upon All Things</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Mark 11:11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>And Jesus entered
into Jerusalem, and into the temple: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>and when he had
looked round about upon all things, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>and now the eventide
was come, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>He went out unto
Bethany with the twelve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is looking for something:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Obedience</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Faith</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obedience is not really obedience unless we are doing what
God has told us to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fait without works is dead. Faith is not just doing
something. Faith is doing what God wants you to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is looking and He wants something from me. What is it
that God wants from me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When was the last time I checked my motive? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What a privilege to have Jesus come to town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this Scripture, Jesus is come to Jerusalem. Jesus has
come to Lewiston! Jesus is here. God has been here and we have witnessed to His
power. He has come by this way for a purpose and for a reason. Not just ‘try
better’, but GO AND SIN NO MORE, DEMONSTRATE YOUR FAITH. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before they went running around town all excited he sent
them back home first. (Don’t be so excited over the physical if you don’t
understand the spiritual miracles.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God’s grace and mercy does not judge me as He sees me all
the time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not everyone is hungry for God’s correction and chastening. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><u>when he had looked round about upon all things</u></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus is looking He sees it all. God has not lost His
eyesight and his concern for how we are doing and what we are involved with.
The things of the world DO matter. He looked at ALL things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jesus sees things that are wrong He does not look with
the eyes of human nature, but as God almighty, sees beyond, knows how to act
and respond, knows the timeing and acts in strength and power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day Jesus is not just looking but takes action and
begins casting them out of the temple. You cannot do these things here. THIS is
THE HOUSE OF PRAYER.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.11 He simply looked around, this day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus showed His obedience. There is something more that
ought to be going on in the House of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><span style='text-decoration:none'>Isaiah 60:1,2</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the
LORD is risen upon thee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 2 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and
gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory
shall be seen upon thee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is looking for something tonight of the BELIEVER. When
the Word of God is spoken, you know He will keep His Word. What He has promised
He will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>UPON YOU that will believe in something better than what he
world offers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mark 11:11, for a reason, taking inventory, looking,
searching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Lu 19:10 </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which
was lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Rev. 3:20</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He doesn’t just come the first time he sees something wrong
and starts casting people out, but He comes as a merciful Savior full of
compassion, patience and is longsuffering. God’s grace is so rich. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Depart from sin and darkness. If the glory of God’s gracec
will cover us, then we must equally shun the darkness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Genesis 6:8</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I trust God and believe His grace then I can make it! Not
my struggling alone, but I will make a struggle against sin. He will give more
faith by His grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we live in darkness we can’t expect the glory of God’s
grace to continually cover us. God warned through Noah that judgment would
come. </p>
