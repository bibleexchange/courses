		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The writer of Hebrews has already discussed a </span><span class="csC382D2BB">new covenant</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> into which the believer is brought. He mentions it again, going back once more to <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jer+31"><span class="cs92015F65">Jeremiah 31</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. His purpose is to assure believers in the Lord Jesus that they have, indeed, a perfect redemption.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the quotation here, the Holy Spirit is expressly declared to be the author of Jeremiah&#39;s words. As the divine Author of the original statement, the Spirit of God exercises the right of any author to edit and revise and enlarge upon a previous statement. In <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jer+31"><span class="cs92015F65">Jeremiah 31</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, the covenant was clearly with the house of Israel. Here, in Hebrews, the blessings are deliberately expanded to include a more general and universal group. &quot;This is the covenant that I will make with </span><span class="csC382D2BB">them</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A16"><span class="cs92015F65">Heb. 10:16</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, italics added). The &quot;them&quot; originally referred to the house of Israel, and, of course, it still does. Israel is yet to come into the good of the New Covenant as a nation. But here the &quot;them&quot; refers to those previously mentioned in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jer+31%3A14"><span class="cs92015F65">verse 14</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: &quot;For by one offering he hath perfected for ever </span><span class="csC382D2BB">them that are sanctified</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; (italics added). By interpretation, the Jeremiah passage belongs to the nation of Israel; by application, it belongs to the Christian.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The successive &quot;I wills&quot; of the covenant make its clauses sure. God&#39;s Word is to be permanently and indelibly impressed on our hearts and minds. No longer will we be forgetful or faithless in regard to the Word. The whole sin question is forever settled. We are going to </span><span class="csC382D2BB">remember</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> intuitively all that is of God; He is going to </span><span class="csC382D2BB">forget</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> infinitely all our guilt and shame. &quot;Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A17"><span class="cs92015F65">10:17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Then comes the writer&#39;s punch line. &quot;Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A18"><span class="cs92015F65">10:18</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). He says it again! The Levitical offerings are now completely meaningless. If there is no more remembrance of sins because of Calvary, why continue the offerings?

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Three great themes occupy this closing section of the great argument based on the superior provisions of Calvary. There is a tremendous word of welcome, there is a terrible word of warning, and there is a timely word of wisdom. The believer today has an access to God far greater than anything allowed by the Levitical ritual, and he therefore needs to avail himself of it. The seeker who has come this far must beware of the terrible dangers of drifting back into a dead Judaism (or, today, into a dead, Christ-rejecting religion). The believer needs to press on, for the Lord Jesus is coming again.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt;">
			<span class="csE5F3F462">a. The Great Reality (<a class="cs81AA2860" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19-21"><span class="csAC606827">10:19-21</span></a></span><span class="csE5F3F462">)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First the believer is given, by God, a tremendous welcome. Mention is made of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the place of access.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The believer is invited to do something only the high priest of Israel could do: have &quot;boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19"><span class="cs92015F65">10:19</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). We are invited into the Holy of Holies itself.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To picture what this means, imagine a Moabite of old gazing down upon the tents and Tabernacle of Israel from some lofty mountain height. Attracted by what he sees, he descends to the plain and makes his way toward the sacred enclosure surrounding the Tabernacle. It is a high wall of dazzling linen, which reaches over his head. He walks around it until he comes to the gate, where he sees a man.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;May I go in there?&quot; he asks, pointing through the gate to where the bustle of activity in the Tabernacle&#39;s outer court can be seen.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Who are you?&quot; demands the man suspiciously. Any Israelite would know he could go in there.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;I am a man from Moab,&quot; the stranger replies.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Well,&quot; says the man at the gate, &quot;I&#39;m very sorry, but you cannot go in there. It&#39;s not for you. The law of Moses has barred the Moabite from any part in the worship of Israel until his tenth generation.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Moabite looks sad. &quot;What would I have to do to go in there?&quot; he insists.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;You would have to be born again,&quot; replies the gatekeeper. &quot;You would have to be born an Israelite. You would need to be born of the tribe of Judah, perhaps, or of the tribe of Benjamin or Dan.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;I wish I had been born an Israelite of one of the tribes of Israel,&quot; the Moabite says. As he looks more closely, he sees one of the priests, having offered a sacrifice at the brazen altar and cleansed himself at the brazen laver, go on into the Tabernacle&#39;s interior.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;What&#39;s in there?&quot; asks the Moabite. &quot;Inside the main building, I mean.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Oh,&quot; says the gatekeeper, &quot;that&#39;s the Tabernacle itself. Inside there is a room containing a lampstand, a table, and an altar of gold. The man you saw is a priest. He will trim the lamp, eat of the bread upon the table, and burn incense to the living God upon the golden altar.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Ah,&quot; sighs the man of Moab. &quot;I wish I were an Israelite so that I could do that. I should love to worship God in that holy place and help to trim the lamp, to offer Him some incense, and to eat at that table.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Oh, no,&quot; says the man at the gate, &quot;even I could not do that. To worship in the holy place one must not only be born an Israelite, one must be born of the tribe of Levi and of the family of Aaron.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The man from Moab sighs again. &quot;I wish,&quot; he says, &quot;that I had been born of Israel of the tribe of Levi of the family of Aaron.&quot; Gazing wistfully at the closed Tabernacle door, he says, &quot;What else is in there?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;There is a veil,&quot; replies his informant. &quot;It is a beautiful veil, I&#39;m told, which divides the Tabernacle in two. Beyond the veil is what we call &#39;the Most Holy Place,&#39; &#39;the Holy of Holies.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Moabite is more interested than ever. &quot;What&#39;s in the Holy of Holies?&quot; he asks.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;There&#39;s a sacred chest in there called the Ark of the Covenant,&quot; answers the gatekeeper. &quot;It contains certain holy memorials of our past. Its top is made of gold, and we call that the mercy seat because God sits there between the golden cherubim. You see that pillar of cloud hovering over the Tabernacle? That&#39;s the Shekinah glory cloud. It comes to rest on the mercy seat.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Again a look of longing shadows the face of the man from Moab. &quot;Oh,&quot; he says, &quot;if only I were a priest! I should love to go into the Holy of Holies and there gaze upon God and worship Him there in the beauty of holiness.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; says the man at the gate. &quot;You couldn&#39;t do that even if you were a priest! To enter into the Most Holy Place you would have to be the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">high</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> priest of Israel. Only he can go in there, nobody else, only he.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Moabite&#39;s heart yearns once more. &quot;Oh,&quot; he cries, &quot;if only I had been born an Israelite, of the tribe of Levi of the family of Aaron. If only I had been born the high priest! I would go in there, into the Holy of Holies. I would go in there every day. I would go in three times a day. I would worship continually in the Holy of Holies.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The gate keeper looks at him again and once more shakes his head. &quot;Oh, no!&quot; he says, &quot;You couldn&#39;t do that. Even the high priest of Israel can go in there only once a year, and then only after the most elaborate of preparations, and even then only for a little while.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sadly the Moabite turns away. He has no hope in all the world of ever entering there.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19"><span class="cs92015F65">10:19</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), says the writer of Hebrews. It is a revolutionary truth. It is understandable that the Lord Jesus should enter the Holy of Holies in heaven. But here it is, a tremendous word of welcome, extended to Jew and Gentile alike, to come on in and worship, not in the holiest place of the human Tabernacle, but into the Holy of Holies in heaven itself.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Think, however, of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the price of access</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to that glorious place. We enter there &quot;by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the vail [veil], that is to say, his flesh&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19-20"><span class="cs92015F65">10:19b-20</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). That&#39;s the price of access. We are taken at once back to Calvary.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The veil, a most instructive feature of the Temple, was blue, scarlet, and purple and spoke of Christ in His incarnation. The blue is the color of heaven, and it suggests to us, surely, that Jesus was the Son of God, the One who came from heaven itself. The scarlet reminds us that He was the Son of Man, the last Adam, for the very name </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adam</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> simply means &quot;red.&quot; But what about the purple? If we take a measure of the blue dye and an equal measure of the red, then pour the one into the other and mix the two so that it is impossible to tell where the one ends and other begins, that&#39;s the purple. In the person of the Lord Jesus, deity is perfectly blended with humanity, and humanity is perfectly blended with deity so that it is impossible to tell where the one ends and the other begins.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Take, for instance, the Lord&#39;s meeting with the woman at the well. &quot;Give me to drink&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+4%3A7"><span class="cs92015F65">John 4:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), He said. That was His humanity. He was thirsty. But a moment later He was confronting her with details about her life that as a mere man He could not possible know. That was His deity. Where does the one end and the other begin? We can never say.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Think, too, of when He slept in Simon Peter&#39;s boat. That was a demonstration of His humanity: the Lord Jesus asleep. A storm came, and the boat was filled with water so that the frightened disciples awoke Him in direst alarm. He arose and spoke to the heaving waves and howling winds. &quot;Be still!&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mk+4%3A39"><span class="cs92015F65">Mark 4:39</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), He said, and at once there was a great calm. That was His deity. Where does the humanity end and the deity begin? It is impossible to say. The two are perfectly blended into one.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The veil, then, spoke of the incarnate Christ. But that veil separated men&mdash;even good, consecrated men&mdash;from God. It was a barrier to shut men out from the Holy of Holies. And is not that exactly what the life of Jesus does? His life is so perfect, so spotless, so free from taint and sin that it forms an impassable barrier. We run into it the moment we seek to approach God on our own. God says, &quot;I demand absolute perfection. I demand a life just like the one lived by the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; But that is more than we can ever produce, so His life, as lived on earth, is an impossible bar to God&#39;s presence.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Except for one thing. The veil was rent. When, as the Lord Jesus hung upon the cross of Calvary, the soldier took the spear and rent His side, God reached down from heaven and with His own hand rent the Temple veil. The veil has not been removed; it has been rent. We can approach God, not because of Christ&#39;s life, important and needful as that peerless life was, but because of Christ&#39;s death.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the proof of access?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> We have &quot;an high priest over the house of God&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A21"><span class="cs92015F65">Heb. 10:21</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). He has entered into the Holy of Holies, and because He is there we can be there. He does what no priest of Israel ever dared to do. He takes others with Him into the Holy of Holies.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That is the great reality of the Christian faith. It is a reality of which Judaism, at its brightest and its best, never dreamed. This is the wonderful word of welcome extended to us: &quot;Come into the Holy of Holies.&quot;</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt;">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The great reality, however, is matched by an equally great responsibility. First, there is our responsibility </span><span class="csC382D2BB">as believers.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Three times the writer of Hebrews says, &quot;Let us.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The first time he points to our Godward responsibility; he emphasizes the purity of worship demanded in the Holy of Holies. &quot;Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A22"><span class="cs92015F65">10:22</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). We must be </span><span class="csC382D2BB">conscientious</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> when we come; it must be with a true heart, not with an empty profession of faith. We must be </span><span class="csC382D2BB">confident</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> when we come; there must be no natural hesitation about approaching God. He has told us to come. We must be </span><span class="csC382D2BB">cleansed</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> when we come; our hearts must be sprinkled from an evil conscience. The reference to bodies washed with pure water speaks of the same truth. The idea is not so much that of mere physical cleanliness (although the constant ablutions demanded under the law all urged the importance of personal hygiene); the idea is one of spiritual cleanliness. God is still a holy God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we have a Godward responsibility, we have a responsibility selfward, too; the writer emphasizes the possibility of wavering. &quot;Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A23"><span class="cs92015F65">10:23</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). &quot;Faith&quot; here is a forward-looking word. The Hebrews were in constant danger of going back because of all the pressures brought to bear upon them by religion, society, and government. In view of the dazzling heights now open to the one who is truly saved, there can be no question of going back. There can be no wavering.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Moreover, we have a responsibility manward. &quot;Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A24"><span class="cs92015F65">10:24</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). One believer will encourage, help, and stimulate another believer to evidence the fruit of a saved life. It is no part of the Christian life to willfully &quot;go it alone.&quot; Christians need the help to be derived from each other&#39;s fellowship.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This leads the writer to a final word on our great responsibility. He has been emphasizing our responsibilities as believers; he turns naturally to our responsibilities as </span><span class="csC382D2BB">brethren.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A25"><span class="cs92015F65">10:25</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I was brought up in Britain where most of the houses were not centrally heated; instead, each room had its own small fireplace. I well remember the good fire that was always kept burning in the fireplace of the living room whenever the weather was inclement and cold. The coals would be heaped up, and the flames would roar up the chimney. Occasionally we would take an iron poker and stir up the coals so that the air could circulate and the fire stay alive and hot. Once in a while a coal would fall down and roll off to one side. When it first fell it would be bright red and glowing with the fire. But after a short while&mdash;a very short while&mdash;the isolated coal would lose some of its luster. The glow would fade, and it would look dull and listless. Soon it became black with just a wisp or two of smoke ascending from it as evidence of its former heat, until presently it was cold enough to be picked up by hand.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That is the picture the writer has in mind. We are to exhort one another, stir one another up, keep the fires of the Spirit burning brightly. We need to be kept close together so that Christian warmth can be communicated back and forth from one member of the fellowship to another. And what a tragedy it is when we begin to stop attending the gatherings of those of like precious faith. We soon begin to lose our fervor. We grow, imperceptibly but surely, colder toward the things of God until, at last, for all the evidence there is of life, we are no different from the worldly, unsaved people around us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must note the great </span><span class="csC382D2BB">imperative,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together.&quot; The word is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">episunagōge</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (&quot;gathering together&quot;) and is used only here and in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Th+2%3A1"><span class="cs92015F65">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Here it refers to the gathering together of believers on earth; there it refers to the gathering together of believers in the air. That gathering is no more important, no more momentous, no more thrilling than the gathering together of believers for fellowship and exhortation on earth. Both are of equal, vital importance in God&#39;s plans for His people in a cold, hostile world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must note, too, the great </span><span class="csC382D2BB">incentive,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.&quot; &quot;The day&quot; here is a reference to the rapture. The expression &quot;the day&quot; or &quot;that day&quot; is usually reserved in the New Testament for &quot;the day of Christ&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Php+1%3A6"><span class="cs92015F65">Philippians 1:6</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Php+1%3A10"><span class="cs92015F65">10</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Php+2%3A16"><span class="cs92015F65">2:16</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), or &quot;the day of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+1%3A8"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Corinthians 1:8</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+5%3A5"><span class="cs92015F65">5:5</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Co+1%3A14"><span class="cs92015F65">2 Corinthians 1:14</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), except in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Th+5%3A4"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, where the context plainly indicates a reference to the day of wrath. The day of Christ stands in contrast to &quot;the day of the Lord,&quot; a subject of much Old Testament prophecy, beginning with <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Isa+2%3A12"><span class="cs92015F65">Isaiah 2:12</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (and including the important <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Th+2%3A12"><span class="cs92015F65">2 Thessalonians 2:12</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> where the true reading is &quot;day of the Lord&quot;). The day of Christ has to do with the rapture of the church to heaven; the day of the Lord has to do with the return of the Lord to earth. The day of Christ heralds joy for the church, &quot;joy unspeakable and full of glory&quot;; the day of the Lord heralds </span><span class="csC382D2BB">judgment</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> for the world. The author of Hebrews is here exhorting God&#39;s suffering people to keep in mind the rapture, the coming of the Lord in the air (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Th+4%3A14-17"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Thessalonians 4:14-17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) to catch away His Bride before the day of wrath begins. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">That</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is the &quot;blessed hope&quot; of the church. It is hard to see how anyone can regard the coming great day of wrath as a &quot;blessed hope.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As the darkness deepens all around&mdash;and what abundant evidences there are everywhere today that the Lord&#39;s coming is near&mdash;believers especially need each other&#39;s fellowship. We are to cling together and resist every pressure that would draw us away from the assembly of God&#39;s people. Business pressures, family pressures, social pressures, economic pressures, entertainment pressures, and physical pressures all militate against our being present at the gatherings of God&#39;s people. Let us face our great responsibility. Having been invited to come into God&#39;s immediate presence, we must resist anything that would draw us away.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the light of all that has been said, the writer now turns his attention once more to those who have made all the initial responses to the gospel but who are still about to turn away. In spite of everything, they are still looking back to a dead religion. The warning now placed before them is the strongest in the epistle. It has to do with despising the Spirit of God, and the consequences are clearly judicial.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt;">
			<span class="csE5F3F462">a. The Warning Expressed (<a class="cs81AA2860" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A26-27"><span class="csAC606827">10:26-27</span></a></span><span class="csE5F3F462">)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First the warning is expressed; then it is explained in fuller detail.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Note </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the characteristics</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of this sin. It is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">a deliberate sin.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The writer warns against sinning &quot;wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A26"><span class="cs92015F65">10:26a</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). It is something done, not by a sudden impulse of the will, but with settled intention. The only other use of the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">ekousiōs</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+5%3A2"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Peter 5:2</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, where elders are exhorted to undertake their work willingly and not by constraint. The willful sin envisioned by the writer of Hebrews is that of apostasy. The truth has been received, but not Christ. The warning is against turning from Christ in favor of an obsolete religion, a Christ-rejecting religion as, indeed, Judaism had become.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This sin is not only a deliberate sin; it is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">a damning sin.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The writer warns that &quot;there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A26"><span class="cs92015F65">10:26b</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). To renounce the sacrifice of Christ is to be left without any sacrifice. There is no other place to go for salvation.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC382D2BB">The consequences</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of such a sin are sobering. Such a person can anticipate nothing but &quot;a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A27"><span class="cs92015F65">10:27</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). To become an apostle is to become an adversary. This is not a case of backsliding or failure in the life of a child of God. This is a deliberate repudiation of the gospel. Vine says, &quot;The word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">krisis</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> here signifies the punishment following upon judicial condemnation; this is confirmed by the word &#39;punishment&#39; in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29"><span class="cs92015F65">verse 29</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; God&#39;s righteous wrath will descend upon a person guilty of this sin.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The history of the Christian church is littered with the debris of the lives of men who have made such shipwreck concerning the faith. One more recent example, surely, has to be that of Bishop James Pike, the one-time controversial bishop of the Episcopal diocese of California. He started out as a brilliant lawyer and became a high-placed cleric. He ended up embroiled in the snare of spiritism and was lured to his death in the burning desert on the Israel side of the Dead Sea in his attempt to make contact with his dead son.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This unhappy man&#39;s first encounter with the occult began three years after his son had committed suicide. The young man had frequently used psychedelic drugs. His sudden death shocked the bishop. The boy&#39;s body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered on the Pacific Ocean.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Then the heartbroken father took a sabbatical from his church and made a pilgrimage to his son&#39;s apartment in Cambridge, England.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There the haunting began. The bishop had long since abandoned whatever Bible faith he once had had, his only insurance against the terrible deception that now took over in his life.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">From the weird phenomena he encountered in that Cambridge apartment, the bishop was lured into having sessions with one of England&#39;s best-known spiritist mediums. He was possessed by his desire to communicate with the spirit of his son. It was not long before he did indeed establish contact with a spirit that purported to be that of his son. Had he believed his Bible, the bishop would have known that all spiritism is forbidden by God and that, far from contacting his son, he was really in touch with an impersonating demon.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Even more startling to the bishop, however, was his contact with another spirit who claimed to be the ghost of the deceased German-American theologian and philosopher Paul Tillich, who had died the previous winter and who had been one of the bishop&#39;s close friends. Both had abandoned traditional Christianity in favor of soul-destroying liberal theologies. The supposed spirit of Tillich urged the bishop to keep up his campaign against historic Christian doctrines. This was timely encouragement for the bishop, who was soon to return to the United States to answer to charges of heresy before Episcopal officials.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Once back in the United States, the bishop made contact with American spiritist mediums, particularly with Arthur Ford, a Disciples of Christ clergyman and an established medium, and also with George Daisley of Santa Barbara, known as a healer and a medium.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before long the bishop became a firm believer in spiritism and an eloquent apologist for the cause. Having rejected the Christian doctrine of the bodily resurrection of Christ as the believer&#39;s ground of assurance of life after death, the bishop succumbed to the spiritist lie that there is no death. Having denied Christ&#39;s bodily resurrection and all that it promises to the believer, the rationalist bishop was robbed of all hope for life after death until his rationalism was swept away by supernatural, demonic phenomena. Step by step the bishop was lured away from the Scriptures, enmeshed in psychic manifestations, deluded into the belief that he had found the real thing, that he had found his son and his comrade in apostasy, and then lured by demons to his lonely and tragic death, overcome by heat and weakness in the Judean wilderness.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt;">
			<span class="csE5F3F462">b. The Warning Explained (<a class="cs81AA2860" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A28-31"><span class="csAC606827">10:28-31</span></a></span><span class="csE5F3F462">)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Having given expression to his warning, the writer now explains in fuller detail what is involved in this warning to them. He first gives an </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Old Testament</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> example of sin </span><span class="csC382D2BB">against God&#39;s government.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;He that despised Moses&#39; law died without mercy under two or three witnesses&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A28"><span class="cs92015F65">10:28</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). A case in point would be that recorded in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+17%3A2-7"><span class="cs92015F65">Deuteronomy 17:2-7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, where apostasy is in view. A person guilty of idolatry was to be stoned to death. The law of Moses revealed God&#39;s holiness and His abhorrence of false religions. No compassion was to be shown those who deliberately chose other gods. In fact, the two terrible deportations that loom so large on the pages of Old Testament history&mdash;the deportation of the Northern Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians and the later deportations of Judah by the Babylonians&mdash;were both expressions of God&#39;s anger against the Hebrew people for their persistent idolatry and for their failure to execute His will upon the guilty.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We would do well to appreciate the seriousness of false teaching. Consider the story of a young woman with her baby traveling by train across the Canadian prairies. It was a cold, winter night, with the temperature far below freezing. Obviously anxious, the woman asked the porter several times to be sure to put her off at the right stop. Outside the wind blustered, and snowflakes burst against the window. It was dark as pitch.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A helpful salesman sitting across the aisle said, &quot;Lady, I&#39;ve traveled this line for years and know every train stop. If the porter forgets to tell you, I&#39;ll be sure to let you know when we arrive at your stop.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Presently the train stopped, and the passengers could hear the usual commotion outside, but it was too dark to see. Anxiously the woman looked around.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;This isn&#39;t your stop,&quot; said the salesman. &quot;Yours is the next one.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Again the train pulled off into the night, and the salesman helped the woman gather her bags. Presently the train stopped, and the man carried her bags to the door while she bundled up her child. He handed her down the steps into the cold, dark blustering night. Nothing could be seen, but it was dark and the woman was sure she would be met. Anyway, she couldn&#39;t stay on the train. She thanked her helper and watched the train pull off into the night.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Shortly afterward the porter came down the coach and stopped at the empty seat. &quot;Where&#39;s the lady who was sitting here?&quot; he asked.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Oh,&quot; said the salesman, &quot;she got off at the last stop a few minutes ago. That was her stop; I&#39;ve been keeping check. You forgot to tell her to get off.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The porter said in alarm, &quot;That wasn&#39;t a station! It was a temporary signal stop. We&#39;ll have to back up the train.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The train was reversed to the emergency stop, and volunteers poured off to look for the mother and child. They found her&mdash;frozen to death with her baby&mdash;a victim of wrong information.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Religious error is even more deadly. It not only kills; it damns. God warns repeatedly against wrong information in matters involved with eternity. Under the law, a sin against God&#39;s government was met with the death penalty. In the New Testament, the sin is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">against God&#39;s grace.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The writer underlines </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the seriousness of the crime.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God?&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29"><span class="cs92015F65">10:29</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To set aside the law of Moses called for death; to set aside the Son of God calls for damnation. To tread under foot the Son of God! This is a total, willful rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is not merely thoughtless unbelief; this is willful unbelief, the deliberate rejection of Christ by one &quot;almost persuaded.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The seriousness of the offense goes deeper still. It involves not only rejecting the Son of God but refusing the salvation of God. Such a person has &quot;counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29"><span class="cs92015F65">10:29b</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The person envisioned here is one who professed faith in Christ and came, as it were, under the shadow of the cross and was outwardly identified with the Christian community. He was associated in the public eye with those set apart by Christ. He was identified with &quot;the blood of the covenant.&quot; He professed to be sanctified. But it was not real. He has turned his back on all that now. One step more and he would have truly been covered by the blood and saved forevermore, but now he has willfully refused God&#39;s salvation.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">More serious still, he has repudiated the Spirit of God. He has &quot;done despite unto the Spirit of grace&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29"><span class="cs92015F65">10:29c</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). He has treated with disdain and insult the One by whom alone all grace is ministered to the soul. He has revealed himself an apostate, has gone back to Judaism (or some other dead religion), and has sinned beyond recall.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The seriousness of such a crime against God&#39;s grace is matched only by </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the solemnity of the consequences</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of the crime. First, mention is made of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">a formal judgment.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, the Lord shall judge his people&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A30"><span class="cs92015F65">10:30</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).

The vengeance that will overtake the apostate results not from personal passion but from outraged law. We are dealing with serious issues when dealing with God&#39;s Son, God&#39;s salvation, and God&#39;s Spirit. They are not to be trifled with, ignored, or despised. And they are certainly not to be rejected with impunity.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mention is made of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">a fearful judgment.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A31"><span class="cs92015F65">v. 31</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). God always triumphs in the end. All hell is witness to that.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Julian the Apostate was a nephew of the Roman emperor Constantine, the man who established Christianity as the state religion of the Empire. Julian was raised in the teachings of the church. His main teacher was the celebrated Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Julian, however, secretly revolted against the Christian faith when still in his early teens, and he became the champion of heathenism. However, so long as he had no power, he played the hypocrite. But once he became the emperor he threw off all his pretense and declared himself for what he was, what he has been called for centuries&mdash;an apostate.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Julian reigned only for eighteen months. But in that short space of time he did all a human being could do, backed by almost limitless imperial power and moved by fanatical zeal, to restore to paganism the control and destiny of the world. He even went so far as to openly defy God by attempting to rebuild the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in the mistaken notion that Christ had not only predicted the destruction of that Temple but had declared it would never be rebuilt.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Julian threw himself body and soul into pagan religion. He sacrificed every morning to the rising sun and every evening to the setting sun. He pointed his dagger to the sky, defying the Son of God, whom he contemptuously called &quot;the pale Galilean.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Julian&#39;s short reign came to an ignominious and sudden end. He was slain in a skirmish on the Persian front. When he saw that he was wounded to death and that it was all over, he took handfuls of his own blood and threw them into the air crying: &quot;Thou hast conquered, O Thou Galilean!&quot; He was buried, of all places, at Tarsus, the birthplace of the apostle Paul, a man he had hated second only to Jesus Himself.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Thou hast conquered, O Thou Galilean!&quot; Julian the Apostate is crying it still in the desolation of a lost eternity. He sees Him now, high and lifted up, surrounded by angelic throngs, mightier than all the Caesars of time. No &quot;pale Galilean&quot; He, but King of kings and Lord of lords, God over all, blessed for evermore. And there he lies, the apostate, waiting his summons to the great white throne and knowing now that it is &quot;a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A31"><span class="cs92015F65">10:31</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The apostate&#39;s fate will be terrible beyond words. Thus the writer balances his tremendous word of welcome with his terrible word of warning. He has one more word to add before turning his attention to a whole new line of argument. He adds a timely word of wisdom in which he urges his readers to take stock and press on.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The writer urges his readers to think about some past events. He reminds them of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the persecution that once assailed them.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> They have already endured some fearful persecutions because of their profession of faith in Christ. &quot;Call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A32"><span class="cs92015F65">10:32</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Darkness hates the light. The early church in Jerusalem ran into persecution almost from the beginning. The sufferings of the believers, to whom the writer addresses himself, had been severe. He calls it &quot;a great fight of afflictions&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A32"><span class="cs92015F65">10:32</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Judaism arose, virile with hate against the infant church. The spirit that led the Jews to reject the Lord Jesus as their Messiah led them to reject Him as Savior. Peter and John were arrested for healing a lame man in the name of Jesus, the apostles were thrashed for preaching the gospel of Christ, Stephen was martyred, James was beheaded, Peter was imprisoned, and then the militant Sanhedrin commissioned Saul of Tarsus to uproot the church at home and abroad. In only two instances in the book of Acts did persecution initiate with the Gentiles. The writer of Hebrews reminds his readers of the sufferings they had borne because of their enlightenment.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They had </span><span class="csC382D2BB">shown the faith of Christ to sinners.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> They had been made a &quot;gazingstock&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A33"><span class="cs92015F65">10:33a</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The word is &quot;theatrize,&quot; from which comes our English word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">theater.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> They had been put on the stage, as it were, and exposed to ridicule and shame and contempt. In the arena of testimony, with catcalls and missiles being hurled at them by an infuriated audience, they had endured. They had shown their faith in Christ to sinners.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the persecution that had assailed them, they had </span><span class="csC382D2BB">shared the faith of Christ with saints</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in a most practical way, by becoming &quot;companions of them that were so used&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A33"><span class="cs92015F65">10:33b</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). They had taken compassion on those who had been imprisoned for the confession of their faith, an act of singular courage, since it meant that the attention of the persecutors would be directed next against them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the midst of all these things, they had been buoyed up by their persuasion that the gospel was true, that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the Savior, and the Son of God, and that they had found the substance behind all the shadows of their former faith. They had carefully balanced in their minds earthly loss against eternal gain.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Indeed, they had taken the spoiling of their possessions joyfully, knowing they had a better possession, an abiding one, in Christ. Yes! These Hebrew believers should think about the past. They already had taken such giant strides.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt;">
			<span class="csE5F3F462">b. The Believers Should Think About the Present (<a class="cs81AA2860" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A35-36"><span class="csAC606827">10:35-36</span></a></span><span class="csE5F3F462">)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But they should also think about their present condition. &quot;Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A35-36"><span class="cs92015F65">10:35-36</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Boldness in the face of opposition is the real need.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Geoffrey Bull, who for a number of years was the prisoner of the Chinese Communists and who was subjected to long, dark months of loneliness accompanied by constant brainwashing, learned by bitter experience that no form of compromise, no matter how slight, pays off under circumstances like that.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of Satan&#39;s favorite tactics is to &quot;wear out the saints of the Most High.&quot; The antidote to this is patience. Think of John Bunyan&#39;s long years in Bedford Jail. How productive they became! He might have spent the time pacing the floor, gazing stolidly into space, working himself into passions of rage or fits of despair. Instead, he took his pen and began to write:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place, where was a Den; and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and as I slept I dreamed a Dream. I dreamed, and behold I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a Book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back.</span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Thus his cell became &quot;a den&quot; from which he wrote one of the greatest classics of all times, </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress,</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2"> a book which, in former years, was a best seller second only to the Bible itself.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;That... ye might receive the promise,&quot; says the writer of Hebrews. He is about to launch into a major exposition of that, summoning up a host of Old Testament saints who dared to believe God in spite of circumstances and who triumphed gloriously.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt;">
			<span class="csE5F3F462">c. The Believers Should Think About the Prospect (<a class="cs81AA2860" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A37-39"><span class="csAC606827">10:37-39</span></a></span><span class="csE5F3F462">)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So the writer urges his readers to think about the prospect, too. &quot;For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A37"><span class="cs92015F65">10:37</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). He tells them to think of the Lord&#39;s </span><span class="csC382D2BB">coming return.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> A little while! It seems so long to us. The centuries have come and gone, and it seems such a long, long time since the promise was given. But the Spirit says it is just a little while. In the light of eternity, what is a couple of thousand years? And, if it was viewed as &quot;a little while&quot; in the first century of the Christian era, what must it be today when, on every hand, the portents of His coming loom large? The clue to boldness and patience in the face of opposition is to look for Christ&#39;s soon return.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the meantime, our lives need to be kept under </span><span class="csC382D2BB">constant review.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The writer closes this section in his epistle by drawing a contrast and by stating a confidence. The twofold use of the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">but</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> underlines his summary. &quot;Now,&quot; he says, &quot;the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A38"><span class="cs92015F65">10:38</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). It is faith that keeps a man from apostasy. He quotes from a familiar passage from Habakkuk, a verse picked up by the Holy Spirit and dropped into the New Testament three times. Each time the verse is cited the emphasis is on a different clause. &quot;The </span><span class="csC382D2BB">just</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> [<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+1%3A17"><span class="cs92015F65">Rom. 1:17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] shall </span><span class="csC382D2BB">live</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> [<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Gal+3%3A11"><span class="cs92015F65">Gal. 3:11</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] by </span><span class="csC382D2BB">faith</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A38"><span class="cs92015F65">Heb. 10:38</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, italics added). It is faith that draws the line of demarcation between the apostate and the true believer. The apostate has neither the faith nor the faithfulness to continue, so he draws back; and in so doing, he incurs God&#39;s active displeasure. The true believer takes a fresh look at the Lord Jesus and reaffirms his faith. The emphasis on faith as the vital ingredient prepares the writer&#39;s way for the next major section of his letter in which he gives the best definition and the finest illustrations of faith anywhere in the Word of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Having warned again about the danger of apostasy, the writer states his absolute confidence in his Hebrew brothers in the faith. &quot;But,&quot; he says, &quot;we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A39"><span class="cs92015F65">10:39</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The &quot;we&quot; is emphatic and differentiates between true believers and empty professors. Perdition is not for the child of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thus the writer concludes the second major section of his letter. He has demonstrated great truths concerning the superior person of Christ. He has discussed at great length Calvary&#39;s superior provisions by showing that, both in His preeminence and in His priesthood, the Lord Jesus is a better Savior. He has shown that, because of Calvary, we have not only a better Savior but a better security, a better sanctuary, and a better sacrifice&mdash;better, indeed, than anything to be found in the Hebrew religion. He has introduced three warning passages, two of them of major importance, to prove that the seeker after truth has everything to gain by going on and everything to lose by drawing back. The substance in Christ cannot be traded away with impunity for the mere shadows of Judaism. He is now prepared to discuss the superior principles of Christianity, and he begins by showing how, even in Old Testament times, men and women walked by faith and not by sight.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 457.25pt;"><span class="csA7555675"><br/></span></p></body>
