The expression in verse 2 &ldquo;count it all joy&rdquo; speaks of full and complete joy. James speaks of the experience of trials of many kinds. There are many different trials testing us. Sometimes they are at the same time, and seem to be heaped upon each other.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">James uses the term &quot;fall into&quot; as if one were to fall into the midst of people, objects, or circumstances - trials </span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Lu 10:30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span></p><p class="cs7A459A2"><span class="csA7555675">5281. &nbsp;upomonh &nbsp;hupomone, &nbsp;hoop-om-on-ay&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheerful (or hopeful) endurance, constancy:--enduring, patience, patient continuance (waiting). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5278. &nbsp;upomenw &nbsp;hupomeno, &nbsp;hoop-om-en&#39;-o &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to stay under (behind), i.e. remain; figuratively, to undergo, i.e. bear (trials), have fortitude, persevere:--abide, endure, (take) patient(-ly), suffer, tarry behind.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">It speaks of </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">tenacity</span><span class="csA7555675"> &ldquo;to stay under&rdquo; and </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">stick-to-itiveness</span><span class="csA7555675">. &ldquo;remain; &nbsp;to undergo&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Patience is not passively enduring it&#39;s the quality that enables us to stand on our feet through the fiercest storms.

It is absolutely correct. </span></p><p class="cs7A459A2"><span class="csA7555675">Patience and perseverance in facing trials develops maturity of character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trials, as a means for joy, are capable of developing </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">patience</span><span class="csA7555675"> (</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">perseverance</span><span class="csA7555675">). Trials put our faith to the test. The question is whether or not faith will persevere in patience. If it is genuine faith, testing serves to develop faith&#39;s persistence. </span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Patience and perseverance have a work to do, and this can be accomplished only by</span><span class="csE5F3F462"> </span><span class="csA7555675">persistence in trials. If patience is to have &quot;its perfect work&quot; or, perseverance is to &quot;finish its work,&quot; </span><span class="csC57700C4">faith must not falter or give up</span><span class="csA7555675">. Trials enable us to </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">improve</span><span class="csA7555675"> and </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">prove</span><span class="csA7555675"> our faith. Paul uses Abraham as an example of someone who grew strong in his faith as he went through the test of waiting twenty-five years for the birth of his son, Isaac.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Romans 4:16 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara&#39;s womb:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;20 &nbsp;He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Abraham passed the test. He believed God could make the impossible possible. True faith in God always triumphs in trial, or tests. As long as we believe that everything depends on our efforts, we are bound to be pessimists &mdash; because experience has taught the unforgiving lesson that our own efforts can achieve very little. When we realize that it is not our effort, but God&#39;s grace and power that matter, then we become optimists &mdash; because we are bound to believe that with God nothing is impossible. And from faith in the Word comes joy!</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675"><br/>Patience and perseverance </span></p><p class="cs7A459A2"><span class="csA7555675">The oppressing rich will be brought to judgment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oppressed poor must be patient. </span></p><p class="cs7A459A2"><span class="csA7555675">Farmer (in verses 7-9), Prophets (in verse 10), and Job (in verse 11).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Jas 5:7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. {Be...: or, Be long patient, or, Suffer with long patience}</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. </span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">So there&#39;s an area [today] that we are being tested in every day. That is, the grumbling that we have for each other, at times.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Jas 5:10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">patience and perseverance</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">The </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">farmer</span><span class="csA7555675"> waits patiently &quot;for the early and latter rains&quot; [that is, the fall and the spring rains]. In Palestine, the early rains came in October and November - soon after the grain was sown through the farmer&#39;s perseverance; the latter rains came in April and May - as the grain was maturing. Both rainy seasons were necessary for a successful crop. Knowing this, the farmer was willing to wait patiently until both rains came and provided the needed moisture. And, of course, it is similar with our own </span><span class="csC57700C4">character development.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">The </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">prophets</span><span class="csA7555675"> who spoke in the name of the Lord. In their position [as His representatives], they experienced affliction and responded to it with long-suffering patience. Although James refers to the prophets as a group, Jeremiah certainly stands out as one who endured mistreatment [with patience and with perseverance]. He was put in the stocks, thrown in prison, and lowered into a miry dungeon - yet he persisted in his ministry without bitterness or recrimination. That testing was severe for him, but he came out </span><span class="csE5F3F462">passing the test.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csD5FB87F7">Job</span><span class="csA7555675">. Those who have endured are considered blessed. In verses 7-10, James&#39; plea is for patience [Greek, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">makrothymia</span><span class="csA7555675">] - which is the self-restraint that doesn&#39;t retaliate. But here, in verse 11, James&#39; plea is for perseverance [Greek, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">hypomone</span><span class="csA7555675">] -</span><span class="csD5FB87F7"> </span><span class="csA7555675">which is perseverance in difficult circumstances. So though we often hear of &quot;the patience of Job,&quot; in the original Greek it is more closely &quot;the perseverance of Job.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">It&#39;s significant that James doesn&#39;t speak of Job&#39;s patience, since - despite the popular phrase</span><span class="csD5FB87F7"> &quot;the patience of Job&quot; - </span><span class="csA7555675">he hardly ever exemplified the quality of patience. [Some examples of that are <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/13131/eVerseID/13131"><span class="csB2A6C030">Job 12:2</span></a></span><a name="1313113131"></a><span class="csA7555675">; <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/13157/eVerseID/13158"><span class="csB2A6C030">Job 13:3-4</span></a></span><a name="1315713158"></a><span class="csA7555675">; and <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/13241/eVerseID/13241"><span class="csB2A6C030">Job 16:2</span></a></span><a name="1324113241"></a><span class="csA7555675">.] However, he was an outstanding example of perseverance in the most trying situations. You are very familiar with the story of his life. [And you&#39;ll find examples of that in <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/12891/eVerseID/12892"><span class="csB2A6C030">Job 1:21-22</span></a></span><a name="1289112892"></a><span class="csA7555675"> and also <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/13323/eVerseID/13325"><span class="csB2A6C030">Job 19:25-27</span></a></span><a name="1332313325"></a><span class="csA7555675">.]</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Job&#39;s experience was also proof that God is full of compassion and mercy, as we see in what God finally brought about for him. Because of Job&#39;s perseverance, God gave him twice as much as he had before. In fact, a comparison of the number of Job&#39;s livestock at the end of the story with the number at the beginning - verifies that the number is doubled. This is a story of the passing of a test, being </span><span class="csC57700C4">rewarded </span><span class="csA7555675">and prosperity not only restored - but also magnified. Out of sorrow and tragedy, God chose to bring increase and blessing. Job&#39;s perseverance was developed through testing, and his character was strengthened in the meantime.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">T</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">esting</span><span class="csA7555675"> (1) produces character and (2) shows us where we stand with our character in relationship to God. To sum up, in </span><a name="3036230366"><span class="csDA02FF29">James 5:7-11</span></a><span class="csA7555675">, James urges us not to fight back but to exercise long-suffering patience toward those who oppress us; he is calling for stouthearted perseverance in the trying circumstances that confront us.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">The </span><span class="csDA02FF29">book of Hebrews</span><span class="csA7555675"> is addressed to Christians enduring persecution. It likewise stresses endurance, or holding fast, as the virtues required to pass a test.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Heb 3:6 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Jesus Christ knows our human condition. It&#39;s not something He has heard about [so to speak], but something He knows - since He, too, was a man in the flesh. We may approach Him confidently because He knows and understands our weaknesses.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Heb 4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Though Jesus did not sin, we must not infer that life was easy for Him. Many times, we give in before the temptation has fully spent itself; but Christ didn&#39;t do that. In a sense, He </span><span class="csC57700C4">earned </span><span class="csA7555675">the sinlessness as He gained victory after victory [in the constant battle with temptation that life dealt out to Him] while He was on earth. The Sinless One knows the force of temptation in a way that - we who sin - do not. Many times we give in before that temptation is fully spent. Only he who does not yield knows its full force &mdash; because a person giving into temptation is blind to the consequences.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">So if we fail the test, or we don&#39;t overcome the temptation, we have not really and truly seen all the lessons to be learned in that temptation that we failed. But Jesus Christ, who was so perfect and passed every test, saw the true impact and consequences of the temptations and the tests that came His way.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">The goal of life itself is linked to the test </span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Jas 1:12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Romans 5 catalogs in ladder-like sequence the specific virtues produced by suffering through tests.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Ro 5:3 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Trouble produces </span><span class="csC57700C4">pressure</span><span class="csA7555675"> for us to show perseverance. The word Paul uses for </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">tribulation</span><span class="csA7555675"> in verse 3 literally means </span><span class="csC57700C4">pressure</span><span class="csA7555675">. That&#39;s exactly what we feel when we are being tested. We feel pressure. Even at a physical level - when we are going through school and we are tested - we are sitting there and laboring over that test and we feel the pressure at that point. It&#39;s similar in our spiritual lives.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">All kinds of things weigh heavily upon us - desire, sorrow, persecution, unpopularity and loneliness. All that pressure produces </span><span class="csE5F3F462">fortitude</span><span class="csA7555675">, or produces perseverance. And the word Paul uses here for </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">perseverance</span><span class="csA7555675"> is the same word he used in </span><a name="3027030270"><span class="csA7555675">James 1:3</span></a><span class="csA7555675"> and </span><a name="3036630366"><span class="csA7555675">James 5:11</span></a><span class="csA7555675">It means more than endurance. It means the spirit that can overcome the world. It means the spirit that does not passively endure but that </span><span class="csC57700C4">actively overcomes</span><span class="csA7555675"> the trials and tribulations of life.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Perseverance</span><span class="csA7555675">,&quot; Paul goes on, &quot;</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">produces character</span><span class="csA7555675">.&quot; The word he uses for </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">character</span><span class="csA7555675"> is used to describe metal that has been passed through the fire so that everything base has been purged out of it. It is used to describe coinage [as we use the word &quot;sterling&quot;] as in sterling silver. When affliction is met with perseverance - out of the battle we emerge stronger, purer, better, and nearer to God. There&#39;s much to be joyous about in trials.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Character</span><span class="csA7555675">,&quot; Paul continues, &quot;</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">produces hope</span><span class="csA7555675">.&quot; Two people can meet the same situation. It can drive one of them to despair. And it can spur the other on to triumphant action. The same trial! To the one it can be the end of hope. To the other it can be a challenge to greatness. The difference corresponds to the difference in the character of the people involved.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csA7555675"><br/>IF we insist on meeting life with determination [with God&#39;s help] - IF we have always faced tests, and by facing them, conquered things &mdash; THEN, when the challenge comes, we meet it with eyes aflame [with </span><span class="csC57700C4">hope]</span><span class="csA7555675">. We meet it with a force [with God&#39;s help] that can overcome anything - just as Abraham learned after twenty-five years of waiting for a son. The character that has endured the test always emerges in hope. Our hope never proves to be an illusion because it is founded on the love of God.<br/><br/></span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5FB87F7">The special reward to those who attain a worthy character is peace of mind or inner happiness.</span><span class="csA7555675"><br/><br/></span><span class="csD5FB87F7">This is not necessarily a life free of problems, nor one of ease and comfort, but it is a life free of inner turmoil and emotional disturbances.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csD5FB87F7">Spiritual growth means mental health. These two parallel one another. Only as we overcome, only as we lose self-centeredness and self-indulgence and grow in the grace of a noble character can we gain peace of mind. This truth is supported in the most advanced knowledge of mental health.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675"><br/>Ultimately, how does God know we love Him and are deeply loyal to Him? Jesus Christ summarized the answer when He said in John 15:8:</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Joh 15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Just as creation produces both good and bad fruit - so humans can produce fruit that </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">may </span><span class="csA7555675">or </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">may not</span><span class="csA7555675"> be acceptable to God. And God wants us to </span><span class="csE5F3F462">bear good fruit!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Mt 7:16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Now, a person can </span><span class="csC57700C4">live an illusion</span><span class="csA7555675"> in their life that &quot;fakes out&quot; other people. But, when you look at the fruit that they bear [if it is an illusion] - it is going to bear </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">bad fruit</span><span class="csA7555675"> &mdash; thereby exposing them.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Christ Himself used many examples from agriculture and nature to emphasize the need for Christian growth - for spiritual character building. Here are just a few:</span></p><p class="cs2552D3EA"><span class="csA7555675">1. </span><a name="2670526705"><span class="csA7555675">John 15:5</span></a><span class="csA7555675"> says, &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">2. God inspired David to write in </span><a name="1394313943"><span class="csA7555675">Psalm 1:3</span></a><span class="csA7555675">, &quot;He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">3. Paul tells us in <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/28967/eVerseID/28967"><span>II Corinthians 9:10</span></a></span><a name="2896728967"></a><span class="csA7555675"> &quot;Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness.&quot; So, we see there THE SOURCE of us bearing fruit.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">4. Christ also used the term &quot;good works&quot; - similar to the term &quot;good fruit&quot; - to express the importance of spiritual growth. A </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">good work</span><span class="csA7555675"> is the manifestation of righteousness. </span><a name="2325123251"><span class="csA7555675">Matthew 5:16</span></a><span class="csA7555675"> says, &quot;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Obviously then, God desires that we do good works and bear holy, righteous fruit in order that we might </span><span class="csE5F3F462">glorify Him</span><span class="csA7555675">. If we are not glorifying Him, we are living the life of a &quot;Christian&quot; as an illusion &mdash; and not as a true Christian.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Before it is fully ripe, a peach is tart, green and inedible. In order for it to become ripe and ready for use, it must go through a lengthy process of development. Our goal must be to become perfect. Remember, earlier, that we mentioned that becoming perfect is to become mature [complete or fully developed].</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Mt 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Becoming perfect, mature, and complete is </span><span class="csE5F3F462">a lifelong process</span><span class="csA7555675">. It takes </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">a lifelong testing of our character</span><span class="csA7555675">. It may take years from the moment we are&nbsp;regenerated until we are fully mature and ready for the Kingdom. However, in order to attain this high calling, we must become more mature a little each day. And one of the ways that this is done is by the testing, trials, and tribulations that we go through. This means our fruits of righteousness are not just one-time acts. The fruits of God&#39;s Spirit are to be expressed again and again in our daily lives - until we actually take on God&#39;s likeness. So then, as we continue to allow God&#39;s Spirit to motivate our behavior, we will take on, little by little, &quot;the fullness of God,&quot; as </span><a name="2927129271"><span class="csA7555675">Ephesians 3:19</span></a><span class="csA7555675"> tells us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Eph 3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;True righteousness that is imparted is not attained quickly. It involves faith to faith, intense effort and a long period of time - with many, many trials and tests. Out of those trials and tests, we can become an optimist [that gets joy out of them] or we can be a pessimist [that fails them more than not].</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">The tares in God&#39;s Church show only &quot;the appearance&quot; - or give &quot;the illusion&quot; - of a healthy tree; but they have never borne fruit. Others produce blossoms and buds but, through neglect, allow the flow of the Holy Spirit to stop; and the fruit withers and drops off. Still others let the cares of this world, or persecution, drain their strength so that they become barren and fruitless. Jesus Christ warned about these conditions. In one instance, He cursed an unproductive fig tree to show this principle. (fig trees yeild fruit with their leaves)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Mr 11:12 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;14 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Mr 11:20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Now quickly, flip over to John 15; and let&#39;s look at another caution by Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs7A459A2"><span class="csA7555675">Joh 15:1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;That fig tree wasn&#39;t bearing any fruit. So it was useless; and it was cut away, so to speak.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Joh 15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;It would be wise for us to </span><span class="csE5F3F462">examine our lives daily</span><span class="csA7555675"> to be sure that we&#39;re connected to the Vine - tied to Jesus Christ and God the Father in a vital relationship of love - so that we will have the continual strength to produce the rich and abundant crop of spiritual character that God desires. And in the process [in the meantime], He is testing us. He is building that character and developing it in us. The true test of our spiritual character and our right standing with God is that we bear good fruit - not the illusion of fruit - but truly good fruit.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">Just as an example, you can look at any of the mainstream Christian churches; and you will see many people serving others. That is, doing what appears to be the right thing. They may be verbally against killing people [committing murder], or they may be out serving more than anyone could possibly have normal time for. But that is &quot;an illusion&quot; of fruit. That&#39;s all we are seeing there.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675">And that is what </span><span class="csC57700C4">a tare</span><span class="csA7555675"> in the church does. A tare in the church shows &quot;the illusion&quot; of fruit, but it is not necessarily true fruit. </span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csA7555675"><br/>True Christians don&#39;t live illusions. We have the truth, and with truth comes </span><span class="csC57700C4">reality</span><span class="csA7555675">. The way we perceive ourselves, and those around us, reflects our spiritual character. God is training us and revealing what we are really like. He lets us know where we stand in relation to Him by constantly testing our spiritual character! The final test of our character is </span><span class="csC57700C4">our fruits</span><span class="csA7555675"> - how we live, what we say, what we do. It involves the totality of our being! What we really are.</span></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><a name="3075730758"><span class="csC57700C4">Re 3:10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</span></a></p><p class="cs8CF1677C"><span class="csC57700C4">&nbsp;11 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
