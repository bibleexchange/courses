<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Academy Engraved LET"'>INTRODUCTION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to recognize what God has given to us and fight for
our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham Lincoln stood and gave the Gettysburg Address in 2.5
minutes declaring not a dedication of the land to the men who gave their lives,
but a dedication of us to preserve that which they gained by dieing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What we have here is the Apostle Paul pouring out his heart
the mysteries that God has revealed to him. Mysteries are being revealed in
this hour. A mystery coming alive. This word is penetrating his heart and
causing his heart to act in mercy, love, and kindness. People have turned
hateful and unkind, but God is revealing to him that it is not over yet. God
showed some things to him. Before He shows things to him regarding Israel he
says, don’t go on thinking YOU ALREADY NOW. If you already know and have 
preconceived idea you have no room for the revelation, new understanding. NO
room for revival. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I Cor. 2:14-16 Though there be few in number that receive
the truth, God is faithful to cause his Word to abound. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does it take to bring Israel to holiness? Captivity,
judgment. It is going to happen. Isreal shall be saved and Jerusalem shall be
holy. </p>
