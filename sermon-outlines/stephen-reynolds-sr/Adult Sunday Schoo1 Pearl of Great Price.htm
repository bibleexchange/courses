<p>Seeking &quot;<b>goodly pearls</b>.&quot; Those words must have astonished
the disciples because Jews in those days did not count pearls as precious gems.
Pearls are mentioned once in the Old Testament. Gentiles, prized pearls and
associated them with the wealth of kings. <b><u>Job 28:18</u></b> <u>No mention</u>
shall be made of coral, or <u>of pearls</u>: <u>for <b>the price of wisdom</b>
is above</u> rubies. The fact that the pearl was a Gentile treasure helps
explain the parable. The Jews despised the Gentiles and wanted to have as
little to do with them as possible. But the merchant was seeking something
precious in the Gentile world, something strange to Old Testament values. The 
merchant was &quot;seeking&quot; good pearls. </p>

<p>The merchant was seeking “<b><u>the Pearl of Great Price</u></b>”</p>

<p>Mt 13:46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all
that he had, and bought it.</p>

<p>The merchant found “<b><u>one pearl of great price</u></b> “- a costly
pearl. </p>

<p>The counterfeit is so close to the natural that only experts can tell the
difference, but there is no comparison in their value. One is real; the other
is fake. You cannot produce this on your own, only as He works in you as you
pay the full price through the blood of His Cross and through the Word of His
Cross. </p>

<p>Man has produced a counterfeit church; Christendom is a clever fraud, but it
has no value in the eyes of the divine expert, like the Pearl that is found by
Him in Him for Him. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Col 1:20 And, having made peace <u>through the blood of his cross</u>, by
him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things
in earth, or things in heaven.                                               
23 If ye <u>continue in the faith</u> <u>grounded</u> and <u>settled</u>, and <u>be
not moved away</u> from the hope of the gospel, which <b><u>ye have heard</u></b>,
and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul
am made a minister;</p>

<p>1Co 1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;
but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>

<p>The merchant in the parable was looking for real pearls, not fakes. The
church, of which the costly pearl speaks, is unique and cannot be duplicated by
human means.                                                      Man has
produced a counterfeit church; Christendom is a clever fraud, but it has no
value in the eyes of the divine expert. </p>

<p>The Lord came to seek the real thing. It has no value—it is just human
calcium carbonate, dust of the earth—but when it is made into a pearl, it is
beyond pricing.</p>

and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>

Gentiles, prized pearls and associated them with the wealth of kings. </p>

<p><b><u>Job 28:18</u></b> <u>No mention</u> shall be made of coral, or <u>of

<p>The fact that the pearl was a Gentile treasure helps explain the parable.
The Jews despised the Gentiles and wanted to have as little to do with them as
possible. But the merchant was seeking something precious in the Gentile world,
something strange to Old Testament values.</p>

<p>The  merchant was &quot;seeking&quot; good pearls. The word
&quot;seeking&quot; implies that he was going from one place to another. It
implies an actual departure from one place and an arrival at another. </p>

<p>The word depicts the Lord Jesus leaving Heaven for earth to look for those
who in His eyes would become of Great value.</p>

<p>Re 21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of

glass.</p>

</span></span></b><b><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif'>What
the Merchant found </span></b></p>

<p>Mt 13:46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all
that he had, and bought it.</p>

<p>The merchant found “one pearl of great price “- a costly pearl. By
geological standards the pearl is dust and irritations.. The lowly oyster can
make one in three to five years, while it takes many years of fierce heat and
pressure to create a diamond. Crush a pearl and all you have is a little heap
of lime dust. </p>

<p>This natural Gentile treasure pearl is made of calcium carbonate, the same
substance we find in ordinary chalk. Yet modern man, for all his skill and
genius, cannot take calcium carbonate and turn it into a pearl.</p>

<p>Man can no more capture the living miracle of a pearl than he can capture a
sunbeam and turn it into a star. He can make artificial pearls, cultured pearls
by implanting smooth beads of mother-of-pearl into oysters so that they can grow
the imitation. The counterfeit is so close to the natural that only experts can
tell the difference, but there is no comparison in their value. One is real;
the other is fake.</p>

<p>It is the same between a professing Christian and a pearl of Great price
Christian. You cannot produce this on your own, only as He works in you as you
pay the full price through the blood of His Cross and through the Word of His
Cross..</p>

<p>Col 1:20 And, having made peace <u>through the blood of his cross</u>, by
him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things
in earth, or things in heaven.                                               
23 If ye <u>continue in the faith</u> <u>grounded</u> and <u>settled</u>, and <u>be
not moved away</u> from the hope of the gospel, which <b><u>ye have heard</u></b>,
and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul
am made a minister;</p>

<p>1Co 1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;
but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>

<p>The merchant in the parable was looking for real pearls, not fakes. The
church, of which the costly pearl speaks, is unique and cannot be duplicated by
human means.                                                      Man has
produced a counterfeit church; Christendom is a clever fraud, but it has no
value in the eyes of the divine expert. </p>

<p>The Lord came to seek the real thing. It has no value—it is just human
calcium carbonate, dust of the earth—but when it is made into a pearl, it is
beyond pricing.</p>

<p>Mt 13:46 Who, when he had found <b><u>one pearl</u></b> of great price, went
and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>

</span>The Great Question (13:46)</h6>

<p>Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that <b><u>diligently
seek him</u></b>.</p>

<p>Are you willing to give your all that you might partake of His All.</p>

<p>As a sinner He sought us and paid the price in full for our full
salvation.                                                                  As
a believer we are to search for Him with our whole heart.</p>

<p>Heb 8:6 ¶ But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much
also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better
promises.</p>

<p>Having discovered a costly pearl, the merchant had to decide what it was
worth, how much he would pay for it. Then he &quot;went and sold all that he
had, and bought it.&quot; That is how the Lord bought the overcomer; He bought
it at the full cost of His life at Calvary.</p>

<p>There is only one Pearl of Great Price in the parable because the Overcomers
are unique. </p>

<p>It is a separated People an incomparable people in God's dealings with
mankind. </p>

<p>The church is not merely spiritual
Israel.                                                                                                       
             The church is not merely the spiritual
Family.                                                                                                           
The church is the Body of
Christ.                                                                                                                 The
church as a whole will not attain in rewards as the Pearl of Great Price.</p>

<p>The fully matured Sons of God are distinct from all else and so highly
esteemed on high that for the sake of this pearl the heavenly merchant paid His
all, but all can benefit the same if we are obedient in all things.</p>

<p>The fully matured Sons of God are what Paul called &quot;the purchased
possession&quot; </p>

<p>Eph 1:14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the
<b><u>purchased possession</u></b>, unto the praise of his glory.</p>

<p>Lu 21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift
up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p>

<p>Ro 8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of
God.                                                                                                                                                             
23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
redemption of our body.</p>

put Him, sorely pierced, in His grave. Yet out of that suffering and death God
has produced the church. The church is God's answer to Calvary.</p>

<p>A pearl is silky white in color and time cannot rust or tarnish it. </p>

<p>In the days of the Lord, pearls were the special treasure of kings and were
destined for the throne. It seems that Christ had all this in mind when he
selected a pearl to be a vehicle for conveying mystery truth to His disciples.
He had set His heart on a rare, unique, and priceless pearl. He had counted the
cost and was about to pay the price. Before long He bought it. And as an
oyster's pearl is salvaged from the stormy sea, so the true believer was taken
from the restless sea of the Gentile world. Destined for the throne, the
overcomer will be exhibited eternally as the prime example of God's sovereign grace
.</p>

<p>Eph 2:7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>The heavenly merchant bought the pearl with His all and that is what gives
inestimable value to the overcomer. Christ considered it of such worth that He
came from afar to seek it and gave His life to possess it.</p>

<p>Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
and gave himself for it; 32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning
Christ and the church.</p>

<p>The True church was a mystery, an entity undreamed of at the time the Lord
spoke the parable of the costly pearl. The Jewish people knew nothing about the
church since it was not revealed in the Old Testament. The truth would soon be
revealed to the disciples. </p>

<p>After Pentecost the full truth about the church would be revealed. What is
made plain in the New Testament was embodied in mystery in Matthew
13.                                                                                              
        Lu 21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p>

of Israel was about to be dissolved by the armies of Rome.</p>

escape eternal destruction.</p>

repentance.</p>
