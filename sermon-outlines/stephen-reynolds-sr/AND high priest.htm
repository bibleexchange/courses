offend, to irritate, to incense; but its original meaning is, to arouse, to
excite, to call into action, and it is used in this sense here. The Greek is,
literally, &quot;unto a paroxysm of love&quot; eiv paroxusmon; the word
paroxysm meaning excitement or impulse; and the idea is, that they were to
endeavour to arouse or excite each other to the manifestation of love. The word
is that which properly expresses excitement, and means that Christians should
endeavour to excite each other. Men are sometimes afraid of excitement in
religion. But there is no danger that Christians will ever be excited to love each
other too much, or to perform too many good works.</span></p>

</span>An Everlasting Assurance  (10:13-18)</h4>

<p>Since the Lord Jesus is seated at God's right hand, the future is assured
both for Him and for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Heb 10:12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice
for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
footstool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that
are sanctified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for
after that he had said before,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after
those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their
minds will I write them;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more
offering for sin.</p>

<h5 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Expectation of a Perfect Reign for the Christ (10:13)</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
footstool.</p>

<p>The expectation of a perfect reign for Him. He is from &quot;henceforth
expecting till his enemies be made his footstool&quot; (10:13). What
&quot;great expectations&quot; there are in the heart of God's beloved Son as
He sits upon His throne! Those mysterious &quot;times or the seasons, which the
Father hath put in his own power&quot; (Acts 1:7)  are still being worked out
on earth. The Bride is being made ready; the world is ripening fast for
judgment; and the Lord Jesus is waiting, eagerly anticipating the day when He
can call home His Bride and turn His attention to those who for so long have
scorned Him and mismanaged His world. The day is surely coming when He will
deal with his enemies, no matter who or where they are, and usher in that
glorious kingdom so long heralded by the prophets of old.</p>

<h5>b. The Experience of a Perfect Redemption for the Christian (10:14-18)</h5>

<p>Along with those great expectations that fill the heart of the ascended Lord
today, there is something for His waiting people on earth: the experience of a
perfect redemption. For, in a spiritual sense, His kingdom has already come.</p>

<p>Joh 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.                                                                                                                                                               5

and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>The writer of Hebrews has already discussed a <i>new covenant</i> into which
the believer is brought. He mentions it again, going back once more to <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jer+31">Jeremiah 31</a>. His
purpose is to assure believers in the Lord Jesus that they have, indeed, a
perfect redemption.</p>

<p>In the quotation here, the Holy Spirit is expressly declared to be the author
of Jeremiah's words. As the divine Author of the original statement, the Spirit
of God exercises the right of any author to edit and revise and enlarge upon a
previous statement. In <a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jer+31">Jeremiah
31</a>, the covenant was clearly with the house of Israel. Here, in Hebrews,
the blessings are deliberately expanded to include a more general and universal
group. &quot;This is the covenant that I will make with <i>them</i>&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A16">Heb. 10:16</a>,
italics added). The &quot;them&quot; originally referred to the house of
Israel, and, of course, it still does. Israel is yet to come into the good of
the New Covenant as a nation. But here the &quot;them&quot; refers to those
previously mentioned in <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jer+31%3A14">verse 14</a>:
&quot;For by one offering he hath perfected for ever <i>them that are
sanctified</i>&quot; (italics added). By interpretation, the Jeremiah passage
belongs to the nation of Israel; by application, it belongs to the Christian.</p>

<p>The successive &quot;I wills&quot; of the covenant make its clauses sure.
God's Word is to be permanently and indelibly impressed on our hearts and
minds. No longer will we be forgetful or faithless in regard to the Word. The
whole sin question is forever settled. We are going to <i>remember</i>
intuitively all that is of God; He is going to <i>forget</i> infinitely all our
guilt and shame. &quot;Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more&quot;
(<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A17">10:17</a>).</p>

<p>Then comes the writer's punch line. &quot;Now where remission of these is,
there is no more offering for sin&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A18">10:18</a>). He says
it again! The Levitical offerings are now completely meaningless. If there is
no more remembrance of sins because of Calvary, why continue the offerings? The
Christian believer has already entered into the spiritual side of the New
Covenant.</p>

<h3>C. What Was Taught by Christ's Sacrifice (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19-39">10:19-39</a>)</h3>

<p>If something has been <i>wrought</i> by Christ's sacrifice (the complete
banishment of sin and the probating of a new will, to be executed by the Lord
Himself), and if something has been <i>sought</i> by Christ's sacrifice (the
replacing of the age of shadows with the reality of the substance), then
something is <i>taught</i> by Christ's sacrifice as well.</p>

<h4>1. A Tremendous Word of Welcome (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19-25">10:19-25</a>)</h4>

<p>Three great themes occupy this closing section of the great argument based
on the superior provisions of Calvary. There is a tremendous word of welcome,
there is a terrible word of warning, and there is a timely word of wisdom. The
believer today has an access to God far greater than anything allowed by the
Levitical ritual, and he therefore needs to avail himself of it. The seeker who
has come this far must beware of the terrible dangers of drifting back into a
dead Judaism (or, today, into a dead, Christ-rejecting religion). The believer
needs to press on, for the Lord Jesus is coming again.</p>

<h5>a. The Great Reality (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19-21">10:19-21</a>)</h5>

<p>First the believer is given, by God, a tremendous welcome. Mention is made
of <i>the place of access.</i> The believer is invited to do something only the
high priest of Israel could do: have &quot;boldness to enter into the holiest
by the blood of Jesus&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19">10:19</a>). We are
invited into the Holy of Holies itself.</p>

<p>To picture what this means, imagine a Moabite of old gazing down upon the
tents and Tabernacle of Israel from some lofty mountain height. Attracted by
what he sees, he descends to the plain and makes his way toward the sacred
enclosure surrounding the Tabernacle. It is a high wall of dazzling linen,
which reaches over his head. He walks around it until he comes to the gate,
where he sees a man.</p>

<p>&quot;May I go in there?&quot; he asks, pointing through the gate to where
the bustle of activity in the Tabernacle's outer court can be seen.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; demands the man suspiciously. Any Israelite would
know he could go in there.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a man from Moab,&quot; the stranger replies.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; says the man at the gate, &quot;I'm very sorry, but you
cannot go in there. It's not for you. The law of Moses has barred the Moabite
from any part in the worship of Israel until his tenth generation.&quot;</p>

<p>The Moabite looks sad. &quot;What would I have to do to go in there?&quot;
he insists.</p>

<p>&quot;You would have to be born again,&quot; replies the gatekeeper.
&quot;You would have to be born an Israelite. You would need to be born of the
tribe of Judah, perhaps, or of the tribe of Benjamin or Dan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I had been born an Israelite of one of the tribes of
Israel,&quot; the Moabite says. As he looks more closely, he sees one of the
priests, having offered a sacrifice at the brazen altar and cleansed himself at
the brazen laver, go on into the Tabernacle's interior.</p>

<p>&quot;What's in there?&quot; asks the Moabite. &quot;Inside the main building,
I mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; says the gatekeeper, &quot;that's the Tabernacle itself.
Inside there is a room containing a lampstand, a table, and an altar of gold.
The man you saw is a priest. He will trim the lamp, eat of the bread upon the
table, and burn incense to the living God upon the golden altar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; sighs the man of Moab. &quot;I wish I were an Israelite so
that I could do that. I should love to worship God in that holy place and help
to trim the lamp, to offer Him some incense, and to eat at that table.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; says the man at the gate, &quot;even I could not do
that. To worship in the holy place one must not only be born an Israelite, one
must be born of the tribe of Levi and of the family of Aaron.&quot;</p>

<p>The man from Moab sighs again. &quot;I wish,&quot; he says, &quot;that I had
been born of Israel of the tribe of Levi of the family of Aaron.&quot; Gazing
wistfully at the closed Tabernacle door, he says, &quot;What else is in
there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a veil,&quot; replies his informant. &quot;It is a beautiful
veil, I'm told, which divides the Tabernacle in two. Beyond the veil is what we
call 'the Most Holy Place,' 'the Holy of Holies.'&quot;</p>

<p>The Moabite is more interested than ever. &quot;What's in the Holy of
Holies?&quot; he asks.</p>

<p>&quot;There's a sacred chest in there called the Ark of the Covenant,&quot;
answers the gatekeeper. &quot;It contains certain holy memorials of our past.
Its top is made of gold, and we call that the mercy seat because God sits there
between the golden cherubim. You see that pillar of cloud hovering over the
Tabernacle? That's the Shekinah glory cloud. It comes to rest on the mercy
seat.&quot;</p>

<p>Again a look of longing shadows the face of the man from Moab.
&quot;Oh,&quot; he says, &quot;if only I were a priest! I should love to go
into the Holy of Holies and there gaze upon God and worship Him there in the
beauty of holiness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; says the man at the gate. &quot;You couldn't do that
even if you were a priest! To enter into the Most Holy Place you would have to
be the <i>high</i> priest of Israel. Only he can go in there, nobody else, only
he.&quot;</p>

<p>The Moabite's heart yearns once more. &quot;Oh,&quot; he cries, &quot;if
only I had been born an Israelite, of the tribe of Levi of the family of Aaron.
If only I had been born the high priest! I would go in there, into the Holy of
Holies. I would go in there every day. I would go in three times a day. I would
worship continually in the Holy of Holies.&quot;</p>

<p>The gate keeper looks at him again and once more shakes his head. &quot;Oh,
no!&quot; he says, &quot;You couldn't do that. Even the high priest of Israel
can go in there only once a year, and then only after the most elaborate of preparations,
and even then only for a little while.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly the Moabite turns away. He has no hope in all the world of ever
entering there.</p>

<p>&quot;Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
blood of Jesus&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19">10:19</a>), says the
writer of Hebrews. It is a revolutionary truth. It is understandable that the
Lord Jesus should enter the Holy of Holies in heaven. But here it is, a
tremendous word of welcome, extended to Jew and Gentile alike, to come on in
and worship, not in the holiest place of the human Tabernacle, but into the
Holy of Holies in heaven itself.</p>

<p>Think, however, of <i>the price of access</i> to that glorious place. We
enter there &quot;by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath
consecrated for us, through the vail [veil], that is to say, his flesh&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A19-20">10:19b-20</a>).
That's the price of access. We are taken at once back to Calvary.</p>

<p>The veil, a most instructive feature of the Temple, was blue, scarlet, and
purple and spoke of Christ in His incarnation. The blue is the color of heaven,
and it suggests to us, surely, that Jesus was the Son of God, the One who came
from heaven itself. The scarlet reminds us that He was the Son of Man, the last
Adam, for the very name <i>Adam</i> simply means &quot;red.&quot; But what
about the purple? If we take a measure of the blue dye and an equal measure of
the red, then pour the one into the other and mix the two so that it is impossible
to tell where the one ends and other begins, that's the purple. In the person
of the Lord Jesus, deity is perfectly blended with humanity, and humanity is
perfectly blended with deity so that it is impossible to tell where the one
ends and the other begins.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the Lord's meeting with the woman at the well.
&quot;Give me to drink&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+4%3A7">John 4:7</a>), He said.
That was His humanity. He was thirsty. But a moment later He was confronting
her with details about her life that as a mere man He could not possible know.
That was His deity. Where does the one end and the other begin? We can never
say.</p>

<p>Think, too, of when He slept in Simon Peter's boat. That was a demonstration
of His humanity: the Lord Jesus asleep. A storm came, and the boat was filled
with water so that the frightened disciples awoke Him in direst alarm. He arose
and spoke to the heaving waves and howling winds. &quot;Be still!&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mk+4%3A39">Mark 4:39</a>), He
said, and at once there was a great calm. That was His deity. Where does the
humanity end and the deity begin? It is impossible to say. The two are
perfectly blended into one.</p>

<p>The veil, then, spoke of the incarnate Christ. But that veil separated
meneven good, consecrated menfrom God. It was a barrier to shut men out from
the Holy of Holies. And is not that exactly what the life of Jesus does? His
life is so perfect, so spotless, so free from taint and sin that it forms an impassable
barrier. We run into it the moment we seek to approach God on our own. God
says, &quot;I demand absolute perfection. I demand a life just like the one
lived by the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; But that is more than we can ever
produce, so His life, as lived on earth, is an impossible bar to God's
presence.</p>

<p>Except for one thing. The veil was rent. When, as the Lord Jesus hung upon
the cross of Calvary, the soldier took the spear and rent His side, God reached
down from heaven and with His own hand rent the Temple veil. The veil has not
been removed; it has been rent. We can approach God, not because of Christ's
life, important and needful as that peerless life was, but because of Christ's
death.</p>

<p>And <i>the proof of access?</i> We have &quot;an high priest over the house
of God&quot; (<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A21">Heb.
10:21</a>). He has entered into the Holy of Holies, and because He is there we
can be there. He does what no priest of Israel ever dared to do. He takes
others with Him into the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>That is the great reality of the Christian faith. It is a reality of which
Judaism, at its brightest and its best, never dreamed. This is the wonderful
word of welcome extended to us: &quot;Come into the Holy of Holies.&quot;</p>

<h5>b. The Great Responsibility (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A22-25">10:22-25</a>)</h5>

<p>The great reality, however, is matched by an equally great responsibility.
First, there is our responsibility <i>as believers.</i> Three times the writer
of Hebrews says, &quot;Let us.&quot;</p>

<p>The first time he points to our Godward responsibility; he emphasizes the
purity of worship demanded in the Holy of Holies. &quot;Let us draw near with a
true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A22">10:22</a>). We must
be <i>conscientious</i> when we come; it must be with a true heart, not with an
empty profession of faith. We must be <i>confident</i> when we come; there must
be no natural hesitation about approaching God. He has told us to come. We must
be <i>cleansed</i> when we come; our hearts must be sprinkled from an evil
conscience. The reference to bodies washed with pure water speaks of the same
truth. The idea is not so much that of mere physical cleanliness (although the
constant ablutions demanded under the law all urged the importance of personal
hygiene); the idea is one of spiritual cleanliness. God is still a holy God.</p>

<p>If we have a Godward responsibility, we have a responsibility selfward, too;
the writer emphasizes the possibility of wavering. &quot;Let us hold fast the
profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that
promised;)&quot; (<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A23">10:23</a>).
&quot;Faith&quot; here is a forward-looking word. The Hebrews were in constant
danger of going back because of all the pressures brought to bear upon them by
religion, society, and government. In view of the dazzling heights now open to
the one who is truly saved, there can be no question of going back. There can
be no wavering.</p>

<p>Moreover, we have a responsibility manward. &quot;Let us consider one
another to provoke unto love and to good works&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A24">10:24</a>). One
believer will encourage, help, and stimulate another believer to evidence the
fruit of a saved life. It is no part of the Christian life to willfully
&quot;go it alone.&quot; Christians need the help to be derived from each
other's fellowship.</p>

<p>This leads the writer to a final word on our great responsibility. He has
been emphasizing our responsibilities as believers; he turns naturally to our
responsibilities as <i>brethren.</i> &quot;Not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so
much the more, as ye see the day approaching&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A25">10:25</a>).</p>

<p>I was brought up in Britain where most of the houses were not centrally
heated; instead, each room had its own small fireplace. I well remember the
good fire that was always kept burning in the fireplace of the living room
whenever the weather was inclement and cold. The coals would be heaped up, and
the flames would roar up the chimney. Occasionally we would take an iron poker
and stir up the coals so that the air could circulate and the fire stay alive
and hot. Once in a while a coal would fall down and roll off to one side. When
it first fell it would be bright red and glowing with the fire. But after a
short whilea very short whilethe isolated coal would lose some of its luster.
The glow would fade, and it would look dull and listless. Soon it became black
with just a wisp or two of smoke ascending from it as evidence of its former
heat, until presently it was cold enough to be picked up by hand.</p>

<p>That is the picture the writer has in mind. We are to exhort one another,
stir one another up, keep the fires of the Spirit burning brightly. We need to
be kept close together so that Christian warmth can be communicated back and
forth from one member of the fellowship to another. And what a tragedy it is
when we begin to stop attending the gatherings of those of like precious faith.
We soon begin to lose our fervor. We grow, imperceptibly but surely, colder
toward the things of God until, at last, for all the evidence there is of life,
we are no different from the worldly, unsaved people around us.</p>

<p>We must note the great <i>imperative,</i> &quot;not forsaking the assembling
of ourselves together.&quot; The word is <i>episunag&#333;ge</i>
(&quot;gathering together&quot;) and is used only here and in <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Th+2%3A1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>.
Here it refers to the gathering together of believers on earth; there it refers
to the gathering together of believers in the air. That gathering is no more
important, no more momentous, no more thrilling than the gathering together of
believers for fellowship and exhortation on earth. Both are of equal, vital
importance in God's plans for His people in a cold, hostile world.</p>

<p>We must note, too, the great <i>incentive,</i> &quot;and so much the more,
as ye see the day approaching.&quot; &quot;The day&quot; here is a reference to
the rapture. The expression &quot;the day&quot; or &quot;that day&quot; is
usually reserved in the New Testament for &quot;the day of Christ&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Php+1%3A6">Philippians 1:6</a>, <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Php+1%3A10">10</a>; <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Php+2%3A16">2:16</a>), or
&quot;the day of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+1%3A8">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>;
<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+5%3A5">5:5</a>; <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Co+1%3A14">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>),
except in <a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Th+5%3A4">1
Thessalonians 5:4</a>, where the context plainly indicates a reference to the
day of wrath. The day of Christ stands in contrast to &quot;the day of the
Lord,&quot; a subject of much Old Testament prophecy, beginning with <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Isa+2%3A12">Isaiah 2:12</a> (and
including the important <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Th+2%3A12">2 Thessalonians 2:12</a>
where the true reading is &quot;day of the Lord&quot;). The day of Christ has
to do with the rapture of the church to heaven; the day of the Lord has to do
with the return of the Lord to earth. The day of Christ heralds joy for the
church, &quot;joy unspeakable and full of glory&quot;; the day of the Lord
heralds <i>judgment</i> for the world. The author of Hebrews is here exhorting
God's suffering people to keep in mind the rapture, the coming of the Lord in
the air (<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Th+4%3A14-17">1
Thessalonians 4:14-17</a>) to catch away His Bride before the day of wrath
begins. <i>That</i> is the &quot;blessed hope&quot; of the church. It is hard
to see how anyone can regard the coming great day of wrath as a &quot;blessed
hope.&quot;</p>

<p>As the darkness deepens all aroundand what abundant evidences there are
everywhere today that the Lord's coming is nearbelievers especially need each
other's fellowship. We are to cling together and resist every pressure that
would draw us away from the assembly of God's people. Business pressures,
family pressures, social pressures, economic pressures, entertainment
pressures, and physical pressures all militate against our being present at the
gatherings of God's people. Let us face our great responsibility. Having been
invited to come into God's immediate presence, we must resist anything that
would draw us away.</p>

<h4>2. A Terrible Word of Warning (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A26-31">10:26-31</a>)</h4>

<p>In the light of all that has been said, the writer now turns his attention
once more to those who have made all the initial responses to the gospel but
who are still about to turn away. In spite of everything, they are still
looking back to a dead religion. The warning now placed before them is the
strongest in the epistle. It has to do with despising the Spirit of God, and
the consequences are clearly judicial.</p>

<h5>a. The Warning Expressed (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A26-27">10:26-27</a>)</h5>

<p>First the warning is expressed; then it is explained in fuller detail.</p>

<p>Note <i>the characteristics</i> of this sin. It is <i>a deliberate sin.</i>
The writer warns against sinning &quot;wilfully after that we have received the
knowledge of the truth&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A26">10:26a</a>). It is
something done, not by a sudden impulse of the will, but with settled
intention. The only other use of the word <i>ekousi&#333;s</i> is in <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+5%3A2">1 Peter 5:2</a>, where
elders are exhorted to undertake their work willingly and not by constraint.
The willful sin envisioned by the writer of Hebrews is that of apostasy. The truth
has been received, but not Christ. The warning is against turning from Christ
in favor of an obsolete religion, a Christ-rejecting religion as, indeed,
Judaism had become.</p>

<p>This sin is not only a deliberate sin; it is <i>a damning sin.</i> The
writer warns that &quot;there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A26">10:26b</a>). To
renounce the sacrifice of Christ is to be left without any sacrifice. There is
no other place to go for salvation.</p>

<p><i>The consequences</i> of such a sin are sobering. Such a person can
anticipate nothing but &quot;a certain fearful looking for of judgment and
fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A27">10:27</a>). To become
an apostle is to become an adversary. This is not a case of backsliding or
failure in the life of a child of God. This is a deliberate repudiation of the
gospel. Vine says, &quot;The word <i>krisis</i> here signifies the punishment
following upon judicial condemnation; this is confirmed by the word
'punishment' in <a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29">verse
29</a>.&quot; God's righteous wrath will descend upon a person guilty of this
sin.</p>

<p>The history of the Christian church is littered with the debris of the lives
of men who have made such shipwreck concerning the faith. One more recent
example, surely, has to be that of Bishop James Pike, the one-time
controversial bishop of the Episcopal diocese of California. He started out as
a brilliant lawyer and became a high-placed cleric. He ended up embroiled in
the snare of spiritism and was lured to his death in the burning desert on the
Israel side of the Dead Sea in his attempt to make contact with his dead son.</p>

<p>This unhappy man's first encounter with the occult began three years after
his son had committed suicide. The young man had frequently used psychedelic
drugs. His sudden death shocked the bishop. The boy's body was cremated, and
his ashes were scattered on the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Then the heartbroken father took a sabbatical from his church and made a
pilgrimage to his son's apartment in Cambridge, England.</p>

<p>There the haunting began. The bishop had long since abandoned whatever Bible
faith he once had had, his only insurance against the terrible deception that
now took over in his life.</p>

<p>From the weird phenomena he encountered in that Cambridge apartment, the
bishop was lured into having sessions with one of England's best-known
spiritist mediums. He was possessed by his desire to communicate with the
spirit of his son. It was not long before he did indeed establish contact with
a spirit that purported to be that of his son. Had he believed his Bible, the
bishop would have known that all spiritism is forbidden by God and that, far
from contacting his son, he was really in touch with an impersonating demon.</p>

<p>Even more startling to the bishop, however, was his contact with another
spirit who claimed to be the ghost of the deceased German-American theologian
and philosopher Paul Tillich, who had died the previous winter and who had been
one of the bishop's close friends. Both had abandoned traditional Christianity
in favor of soul-destroying liberal theologies. The supposed spirit of Tillich
urged the bishop to keep up his campaign against historic Christian doctrines.
This was timely encouragement for the bishop, who was soon to return to the
United States to answer to charges of heresy before Episcopal officials.</p>

<p>Once back in the United States, the bishop made contact with American
spiritist mediums, particularly with Arthur Ford, a Disciples of Christ
clergyman and an established medium, and also with George Daisley of Santa
Barbara, known as a healer and a medium.</p>

<p>Before long the bishop became a firm believer in spiritism and an eloquent
apologist for the cause. Having rejected the Christian doctrine of the bodily
resurrection of Christ as the believer's ground of assurance of life after
death, the bishop succumbed to the spiritist lie that there is no death. Having
denied Christ's bodily resurrection and all that it promises to the believer,
the rationalist bishop was robbed of all hope for life after death until his
rationalism was swept away by supernatural, demonic phenomena. Step by step the
bishop was lured away from the Scriptures, enmeshed in psychic manifestations,
deluded into the belief that he had found the real thing, that he had found his
son and his comrade in apostasy, and then lured by demons to his lonely and
tragic death, overcome by heat and weakness in the Judean wilderness.</p>

<h5>b. The Warning Explained (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A28-31">10:28-31</a>)</h5>

<p>Having given expression to his warning, the writer now explains in fuller
detail what is involved in this warning to them. He first gives an <i>Old
Testament</i> example of sin <i>against God's government.</i> &quot;He that
despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A28">10:28</a>). A case
in point would be that recorded in <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+17%3A2-7">Deuteronomy 17:2-7</a>,
where apostasy is in view. A person guilty of idolatry was to be stoned to
death. The law of Moses revealed God's holiness and His abhorrence of false
religions. No compassion was to be shown those who deliberately chose other
gods. In fact, the two terrible deportations that loom so large on the pages of
Old Testament historythe deportation of the Northern Kingdom of Israel by the
Assyrians and the later deportations of Judah by the Babylonianswere both
expressions of God's anger against the Hebrew people for their persistent
idolatry and for their failure to execute His will upon the guilty.</p>

<p>We would do well to appreciate the seriousness of false teaching. Consider
the story of a young woman with her baby traveling by train across the Canadian
prairies. It was a cold, winter night, with the temperature far below freezing.
Obviously anxious, the woman asked the porter several times to be sure to put
her off at the right stop. Outside the wind blustered, and snowflakes burst
against the window. It was dark as pitch.</p>

<p>A helpful salesman sitting across the aisle said, &quot;Lady, I've traveled
this line for years and know every train stop. If the porter forgets to tell
you, I'll be sure to let you know when we arrive at your stop.&quot;</p>

<p>Presently the train stopped, and the passengers could hear the usual
commotion outside, but it was too dark to see. Anxiously the woman looked
around.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn't your stop,&quot; said the salesman. &quot;Yours is the next
one.&quot;</p>

<p>Again the train pulled off into the night, and the salesman helped the woman
gather her bags. Presently the train stopped, and the man carried her bags to
the door while she bundled up her child. He handed her down the steps into the
cold, dark blustering night. Nothing could be seen, but it was dark and the
woman was sure she would be met. Anyway, she couldn't stay on the train. She
thanked her helper and watched the train pull off into the night.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the porter came down the coach and stopped at the empty
seat. &quot;Where's the lady who was sitting here?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the salesman, &quot;she got off at the last stop a few
minutes ago. That was her stop; I've been keeping check. You forgot to tell her
to get off.&quot;</p>

<p>The porter said in alarm, &quot;That wasn't a station! It was a temporary
signal stop. We'll have to back up the train.&quot;</p>

<p>The train was reversed to the emergency stop, and volunteers poured off to
look for the mother and child. They found herfrozen to death with her babya
victim of wrong information.</p>

<p>Religious error is even more deadly. It not only kills; it damns. God warns
repeatedly against wrong information in matters involved with eternity. Under
the law, a sin against God's government was met with the death penalty. In the
New Testament, the sin is <i>against God's grace.</i> The writer underlines <i>the
seriousness of the crime.</i> &quot;Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God?&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29">10:29</a>).</p>

<p>To set aside the law of Moses called for death; to set aside the Son of God
calls for damnation. To tread under foot the Son of God! This is a total,
willful rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is not merely thoughtless
unbelief; this is willful unbelief, the deliberate rejection of Christ by one
&quot;almost persuaded.&quot;</p>

<p>The seriousness of the offense goes deeper still. It involves not only
rejecting the Son of God but refusing the salvation of God. Such a person has
&quot;counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
thing&quot; (<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29">10:29b</a>).
The person envisioned here is one who professed faith in Christ and came, as it
were, under the shadow of the cross and was outwardly identified with the
Christian community. He was associated in the public eye with those set apart
by Christ. He was identified with &quot;the blood of the covenant.&quot; He
professed to be sanctified. But it was not real. He has turned his back on all
that now. One step more and he would have truly been covered by the blood and
saved forevermore, but now he has willfully refused God's salvation.</p>

<p>More serious still, he has repudiated the Spirit of God. He has &quot;done
despite unto the Spirit of grace&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A29">10:29c</a>). He has
treated with disdain and insult the One by whom alone all grace is ministered
to the soul. He has revealed himself an apostate, has gone back to Judaism (or
some other dead religion), and has sinned beyond recall.</p>

<p>The seriousness of such a crime against God's grace is matched only by <i>the
solemnity of the consequences</i> of the crime. First, mention is made of <i>a
formal judgment.</i> &quot;For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth
unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, the Lord shall judge his
people&quot; (<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A30">10:30</a>).
The reference is to <a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+32%3A35-36">Deuteronomy
32:35-36</a>. The vengeance that will overtake the apostate results not from
personal passion but from outraged law. We are dealing with serious issues when
dealing with God's Son, God's salvation, and God's Spirit. They are not to be
trifled with, ignored, or despised. And they are certainly not to be rejected
with impunity.</p>

<p>Mention is made of <i>a fearful judgment.</i> &quot;It is a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the living God&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A31">v. 31</a>). God
always triumphs in the end. All hell is witness to that.</p>

<p>Julian the Apostate was a nephew of the Roman emperor Constantine, the man
who established Christianity as the state religion of the Empire. Julian was
raised in the teachings of the church. His main teacher was the celebrated
Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia.</p>

<p>Julian, however, secretly revolted against the Christian faith when still in
his early teens, and he became the champion of heathenism. However, so long as
he had no power, he played the hypocrite. But once he became the emperor he
threw off all his pretense and declared himself for what he was, what he has
been called for centuriesan apostate.</p>

<p>Julian reigned only for eighteen months. But in that short space of time he
did all a human being could do, backed by almost limitless imperial power and
moved by fanatical zeal, to restore to paganism the control and destiny of the
world. He even went so far as to openly defy God by attempting to rebuild the
Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in the mistaken notion that Christ had not only
predicted the destruction of that Temple but had declared it would never be
rebuilt.</p>

<p>Julian threw himself body and soul into pagan religion. He sacrificed every
morning to the rising sun and every evening to the setting sun. He pointed his
dagger to the sky, defying the Son of God, whom he contemptuously called
&quot;the pale Galilean.&quot;</p>

<p>Julian's short reign came to an ignominious and sudden end. He was slain in
a skirmish on the Persian front. When he saw that he was wounded to death and
that it was all over, he took handfuls of his own blood and threw them into the
air crying: &quot;Thou hast conquered, O Thou Galilean!&quot; He was buried, of
all places, at Tarsus, the birthplace of the apostle Paul, a man he had hated
second only to Jesus Himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Thou hast conquered, O Thou Galilean!&quot; Julian the Apostate is
crying it still in the desolation of a lost eternity. He sees Him now, high and
lifted up, surrounded by angelic throngs, mightier than all the Caesars of
time. No &quot;pale Galilean&quot; He, but King of kings and Lord of lords, God
over all, blessed for evermore. And there he lies, the apostate, waiting his
summons to the great white throne and knowing now that it is &quot;a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A31">10:31</a>).</p>

<p>The apostate's fate will be terrible beyond words. Thus the writer balances
his tremendous word of welcome with his terrible word of warning. He has one
more word to add before turning his attention to a whole new line of argument.
He adds a timely word of wisdom in which he urges his readers to take stock and
press on.</p>

<h4>3. A Timely Word of Wisdom (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A32-39">10:32-39</a>)</h4>

<h5>a. The Believers Should Think About the Past (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A32-34">10:32-34</a>)</h5>

<p>The writer urges his readers to think about some past events. He reminds
them of <i>the persecution that once assailed them.</i> They have already
endured some fearful persecutions because of their profession of faith in
Christ. &quot;Call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A32">10:32</a>). Darkness
hates the light. The early church in Jerusalem ran into persecution almost from
the beginning. The sufferings of the believers, to whom the writer addresses
himself, had been severe. He calls it &quot;a great fight of afflictions&quot;
(<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A32">10:32</a>).</p>

<p>Judaism arose, virile with hate against the infant church. The spirit that
led the Jews to reject the Lord Jesus as their Messiah led them to reject Him
as Savior. Peter and John were arrested for healing a lame man in the name of
Jesus, the apostles were thrashed for preaching the gospel of Christ, Stephen
was martyred, James was beheaded, Peter was imprisoned, and then the militant
Sanhedrin commissioned Saul of Tarsus to uproot the church at home and abroad.
In only two instances in the book of Acts did persecution initiate with the
Gentiles. The writer of Hebrews reminds his readers of the sufferings they had
borne because of their enlightenment.</p>

<p>They had <i>shown the faith of Christ to sinners.</i> They had been made a
&quot;gazingstock&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A33">10:33a</a>). The
word is &quot;theatrize,&quot; from which comes our English word <i>theater.</i>
They had been put on the stage, as it were, and exposed to ridicule and shame
and contempt. In the arena of testimony, with catcalls and missiles being
hurled at them by an infuriated audience, they had endured. They had shown
their faith in Christ to sinners.</p>

<p>In the persecution that had assailed them, they had <i>shared the faith of
Christ with saints</i> in a most practical way, by becoming &quot;companions of
them that were so used&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A33">10:33b</a>). They
had taken compassion on those who had been imprisoned for the confession of
their faith, an act of singular courage, since it meant that the attention of
the persecutors would be directed next against them.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these things, they had been buoyed up by their
persuasion that the gospel was true, that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the
Savior, and the Son of God, and that they had found the substance behind all
the shadows of their former faith. They had carefully balanced in their minds
earthly loss against eternal gain.</p>

<p>Indeed, they had taken the spoiling of their possessions joyfully, knowing
they had a better possession, an abiding one, in Christ. Yes! These Hebrew
believers should think about the past. They already had taken such giant
strides.</p>

<h5>b. The Believers Should Think About the Present (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A35-36">10:35-36</a>)</h5>

<p>But they should also think about their present condition. &quot;Cast not
away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye
have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might
receive the promise&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A35-36">10:35-36</a>).
Boldness in the face of opposition is the real need.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Bull, who for a number of years was the prisoner of the Chinese
Communists and who was subjected to long, dark months of loneliness accompanied
by constant brainwashing, learned by bitter experience that no form of
compromise, no matter how slight, pays off under circumstances like that.</p>

<p>One of Satan's favorite tactics is to &quot;wear out the saints of the Most
High.&quot; The antidote to this is patience. Think of John Bunyan's long years
in Bedford Jail. How productive they became! He might have spent the time
pacing the floor, gazing stolidly into space, working himself into passions of
rage or fits of despair. Instead, he took his pen and began to write:</p>

<p>As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain
place, where was a Den; and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and as I
slept I dreamed a Dream. I dreamed, and behold I saw a man clothed with rags,
standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a Book in his
hand, and a great burden upon his back.</p>

<p style='margin-top:2.4pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.4pt;margin-left:
0in;text-align:justify;line-height:16.8pt'><span style='font-size:11.5pt'>Thus
his cell became &quot;a den&quot; from which he wrote one of the greatest
classics of all times, <i>The Pilgrim's Progress,</i> a book which, in former
years, was a best seller second only to the Bible itself.</span></p>

<p>&quot;That... ye might receive the promise,&quot; says the writer of
Hebrews. He is about to launch into a major exposition of that, summoning up a
host of Old Testament saints who dared to believe God in spite of circumstances
and who triumphed gloriously.</p>

<h5>c. The Believers Should Think About the Prospect (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A37-39">10:37-39</a>)</h5>

<p>So the writer urges his readers to think about the prospect, too. &quot;For
yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry&quot;
(<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A37">10:37</a>). He
tells them to think of the Lord's <i>coming return.</i> A little while! It
seems so long to us. The centuries have come and gone, and it seems such a
long, long time since the promise was given. But the Spirit says it is just a
little while. In the light of eternity, what is a couple of thousand years?
And, if it was viewed as &quot;a little while&quot; in the first century of the
Christian era, what must it be today when, on every hand, the portents of His
coming loom large? The clue to boldness and patience in the face of opposition
is to look for Christ's soon return.</p>

<p>In the meantime, our lives need to be kept under <i>constant review.</i> The
writer closes this section in his epistle by drawing a contrast and by stating
a confidence. The twofold use of the word <i>but</i> underlines his summary.
&quot;Now,&quot; he says, &quot;the just shall live by faith: but if any man
draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A38">10:38</a>). It is
faith that keeps a man from apostasy. He quotes from a familiar passage from
Habakkuk, a verse picked up by the Holy Spirit and dropped into the New
Testament three times. Each time the verse is cited the emphasis is on a
different clause. &quot;The <i>just</i> [<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+1%3A17">Rom. 1:17</a>] shall <i>live</i>
[<a href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Gal+3%3A11">Gal. 3:11</a>] by
<i>faith</i>&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A38">Heb. 10:38</a>,
italics added). It is faith that draws the line of demarcation between the
apostate and the true believer. The apostate has neither the faith nor the
faithfulness to continue, so he draws back; and in so doing, he incurs God's
active displeasure. The true believer takes a fresh look at the Lord Jesus and
reaffirms his faith. The emphasis on faith as the vital ingredient prepares the
writer's way for the next major section of his letter in which he gives the
best definition and the finest illustrations of faith anywhere in the Word of
God.</p>

<p>Having warned again about the danger of apostasy, the writer states his
absolute confidence in his Hebrew brothers in the faith. &quot;But,&quot; he
says, &quot;we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that
believe to the saving of the soul&quot; (<a
href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+10%3A39">10:39</a>). The
&quot;we&quot; is emphatic and differentiates between true believers and empty
professors. Perdition is not for the child of God.</p>

<p>Thus the writer concludes the second major section of his letter. He has
demonstrated great truths concerning the superior person of Christ. He has
discussed at great length Calvary's superior provisions by showing that, both
in His preeminence and in His priesthood, the Lord Jesus is a better Savior. He
has shown that, because of Calvary, we have not only a better Savior but a
better security, a better sanctuary, and a better sacrificebetter, indeed,
than anything to be found in the Hebrew religion. He has introduced three
warning passages, two of them of major importance, to prove that the seeker
after truth has everything to gain by going on and everything to lose by
drawing back. The substance in Christ cannot be traded away with impunity for
the mere shadows of Judaism. He is now prepared to discuss the superior
principles of Christianity, and he begins by showing how, even in Old Testament
times, men and women walked by faith and not by sight.</p>
