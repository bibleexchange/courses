In spite of religious reforms, God did not change His mind about sending Judah into captivity. </span></p><p class="cs9D75A178"><span class="csA7555675">In &ldquo;</span><span class="csDCC2CFE">Innocent Blood</span><span class="csA7555675">&rdquo;, written by Robert P Meyers, we read (bolding mine):</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csC57700C4">God has always taken a special interest in the murder of the innocent</span><span class="csA7555675">.&nbsp; In our text, He has determined to give Judah grief over the practice during the rule of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah.&nbsp; Hezekiah&nbsp; who was a faithful servant of God and a holy man, yet, Jewish history does not record, perhaps, a more wicked ruler than his son, Manasseh.&nbsp; It seems a shame that this man should even carry the same name as the godly son of Joseph who was the founder of the family of this name.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">Manasseh had been wicked beyond comprehension.&nbsp; &hellip; Incidentally, some of you might be surprised to learn that after all the wickedness Manasseh acted out (see 2 Kings 21&amp; 2 Chron. 33; defied and reversed all his dad&rsquo;s work at destroying idolatry in Judah, practiced idolatry even so far as to put an idol in the house of God; offering his children to idols; practiced sorcery, divination, etc.), he repented and the bible tells us that God pardoned him (2 Chron. 33:12-13)&nbsp; This should be held forth as proof that there is hope in Christ for even the most wicked sinner on the planet.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">Nevertheless, we find that Manasseh&rsquo;s repentance did not happen until he and all Judah were carried away into slavery by the king of Assyria [sic].&nbsp; That is, until God afflicted them greatly in judgment.&nbsp; And the thing that keeps recurring in the Lord&rsquo;s condemnation on Judah and Israel is that they, along with their leader, Manasseh, shed innocent blood.&nbsp; Our text says in v. 4 that the Lord &ldquo;would not pardon&rdquo; this sin.&nbsp; </span><span class="csC57700C4">There is something strikingly meaningful about the fact that God separated this particular sin from the rest of those which He lumped together as &ldquo;things that he (Manasseh) did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs9D75A178"><span class="csA7555675">The </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Word of God </span><span class="csA7555675">explores this tension between the personal forgiveness of Manasseh&rsquo;s sins and yet not obliterating the punishment in &ldquo;</span><span class="csDCC2CFE">It&rsquo;s All His Fault: Blaming the Exile on Manasseh (Jeremiah 15.4)</span><span class="csA7555675">&rdquo;.&nbsp; Before that, however, he makes an interesting and important observation.</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">What makes this interesting is not just the obvious fact that more people than just Manasseh were to be blamed for the exile. He was not the only king to worship other gods, even though he took it to new levels of wickedness. Moreover, the people of Judah also worshipped other gods and refused to obey the Lord&rsquo;s commandments. And whereas Jeremiah 15.4 lays the exile at Manasseh&rsquo;s feet, the rest of the prophecies of Jeremiah </span><span class="csC57700C4">make it very clear that the entire population from the priests down to the common man and woman were just as guilty</span><span class="csA7555675">.</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">Jer 15:4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">Because of Manasseh--He was now dead, but the effects of his sins still remained. How much evil one bad man can cause! The evil fruits remain even after he himself has received repentance and forgiveness. The people had followed his wicked example ever since; and it is implied that it was only through the long-suffering of God that the consequences had been suspended up to the present time </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">2Ki 21:11 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">2Ki 23:26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">2Ki 24:3 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">4 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.</span></p><p class="cs9D75A178"><span class="csA7555675">Would I be too repetitive to state that nations often get the leaders they deserve?&nbsp; Why was Manasseh allowed to continue in his bloodshed?&nbsp; Could he have carried it out alone?&nbsp; Obviously, he had to have help. </span></p><p class="cs9D75A178"><span class="csA7555675">It is also worthy of note that Manasseh was taken captive before he repented.&nbsp; His back was against the wall, and God had to humble him first.&nbsp; Likewise, the people he ruled were stiff necked and hard hearted.&nbsp; Only by captivity would they be humbled as well.&nbsp; This is made most obvious in the Book of Jeremiah.</span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>13 </sup></span><span class="csA7555675">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>14 </sup></span><span class="csA7555675">At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>15 </sup></span><span class="csA7555675">And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>16 </sup></span><span class="csA7555675">But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>17 </sup></span><span class="csA7555675">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. </span></p><p class="cs4FC78CB5"><span class="csA7555675">~ </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">Jer 34:13-17</span></p><p class="cs9D75A178"><span class="csA7555675">If someone is in power, then it is because someone is supporting them.&nbsp; Leadership does not exist in a vacuum.&nbsp; The wicked rise up when no one restrains them.&nbsp; The support of evil is the same as committing evil, which Paul makes clear in the end of Romans 1.&nbsp; When the majority are following God&rsquo;s laws, however, evil is normally nipped in the bud before it has a chance to take root and prosper. </span></p><p class="cs9D75A178"><span class="csA7555675">Manasseh repented.&nbsp; He was allowed to return for a time to Judah and clean things up, but only for a short time.&nbsp; If all of Judah had repented, who knows how much longer the Kingdom of Judah would have survived?
