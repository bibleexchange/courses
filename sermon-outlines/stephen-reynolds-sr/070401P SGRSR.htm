<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TEXT: II Samuel 20:2; 19:9-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>The
church is in trouble because of the strife and confusion. God has some things
that He wants to do, but can’t because men do not understand the will of God.
We need to know the will of God. The Holy Ghost is real and will exalt Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Returning
the king back</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>There is
a false spirit in the land counterfeiting the real. Absalom tried by way of the
flesh to get the people to accept and receive him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>The Lord
wants to be king in our life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>There is
a place that only the Lord can fill in our life. Israel looked for a man to
fill that place of king. God does have a place to anoint men for his honor and
His cause. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>People
often get caught on the service and really feel that what they are doing is the
will of God, but God is working far beneath the service. We often hinder God’s
working and glorifying Him. All the people were at strife. It is equal to the
task—in glorifying Christ as Israel did—that He is more than a man and He has a
plan beyond this natural.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>God has
some things for His people beyond what they seek Him for.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>David
here is a type of the king coming into Jerusalem. (Matthew 21:1-16)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>We are
not just to get into a realm to understand Him today, but there is a spirit
amongst the crowd set to deceive and to destroy and to abuse us. There is a
false spirit. Not everything that comes upon you is of God. These points are
very strong and very needed. There is a place in God if we can exalt his mercy.
Understand holiness living, being kind. We need to understand these and have
them applied to our hearts. It is not a matter of what I can do, but that God’s
will be accomplished.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>The
strife is real, is hard, is difficult and is separating the people.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>II
Samuel 19:40 half, broken down the middle, debating, striving, dividing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=center style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:
center;text-indent:-.5in'>DAVID WAS A MAN THAT WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=center style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:
center;text-indent:-.5in'>TO A POSITION THAT HE WAS DRIVEN OUT OF.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>As we
see David restored we see OTHER men forgiven and restored.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>If we
are going to be anything for God we must first be a SERVANT FAITHFULLY serving
Him. Right here and now. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Absalom
fought against David and drove him out of position. God brought him back. David
didn’t do things for naught but was a praying man. He wasn’t a compromiser. He
dealt with momentary doubts but David was a warrior. GOD IS GOING TO ALLOW ME
TO RETURN. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Asa
lived loose and did not guard himself properly. But the greatness of God
restored the man. IN HIS MERCY. We msut keep and GUARD what God in His mercy
provides us. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Joab was
rebellious.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Shimei
was the man that disdained David. The Lord, v.16-20 allowed him to return. He
was looking for mercy and forgiveness, but David in verse 22 was quick to give
it. David said God’s been merciful to ME to return to give me this place. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Saul of
Tarsus declared as Paul that God has been merciful to me to give him the place
to preach the Gospel and to show mercy to others. THE GOSPEL OF GRACE that
enables men to depart from iniquity. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Amasa
was so loose that he waas left wallowing in his own blood by a Joab always
watching for opportunity to destroy. Amasa was careless in guarding his soul. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>People
want a lot of people to come back and a lot of people in position.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>BUT HOW
DANGEROUS IS THIS???</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Joab was
overall Israel, 20:23, We need to have men of principle in principle places. </p>
