Isaiah &ldquo;treading the courts.&rdquo; No real lasting change or growth and development.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">God&rsquo;s power is glorious. Understand the Word and not just go away with a feeling. More than a feeling, but to dwell in God&rsquo;s presence. The knowledge of God is more than just &nbsp;afew little facts. Knowing God, we can experience Him today.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Joh 8:31 &para; Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; 32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">We must KNOW Him.

Losing the desire and power to pray. There is trouble on every side, but we need not worry what the enemy is doing so much as we have a job to do. We will get no where debating and arguing, but the Lord will STRENGTHEN the heart of the HUMBLE. We are being influenced like one rotten apple spoils an entire bushel of apples. The influences of question, debate are weakening our faith and resolve in the Word of God. Why would we allow something that is NOT Scriptural to interest us?</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">There is a glorious power in the &nbsp;Gospel to strengthen God&rsquo;s people, but we must exercise FAITH. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
