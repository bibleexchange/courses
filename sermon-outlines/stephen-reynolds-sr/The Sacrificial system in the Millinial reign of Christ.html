Although detailed instructions concerning the institution of the sacrificial system appear for the first time in these chapters, frequent references to the practice have been made since the beginning of the prophecy (40:38-43, 46-47; 41:22; 42:13-14).Moreover, these references are not incidental, but intrinsic to the entire presentation of Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision in chapters 40-48. For example, there is a statement concerning the sacrificial system in every chapter but one (chapter 47). These references include: &ldquo;new moons and Sabbaths . . . all the appointed feasts&rdquo; (Ezekiel 44:24; 45:17; 46:3, 11-12),&ldquo;daily offerings&rdquo; (Ezekiel 46:13-14), &ldquo;burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the libations&rdquo; (Ezekiel 45:17; 46:2, 4, 11-15), &ldquo;blood sacrifices&rdquo; (Ezekiel 43:20), an &ldquo;altar&rdquo; for burnt offering (Ezekiel 40:47; 43:13-27), an &ldquo;altar&rdquo; for incense offering (Ezekiel 41:22), &ldquo;boiling places&rdquo; to &ldquo;boil the sacrifices of the people&rdquo; (Ezekiel 46:23-24); a &ldquo;Zadokite&rdquo; priesthood to &ldquo;offer Me the fat and the blood&rdquo; (Ezekiel 40:46; 42:13-14: 43:19; 44:15-16; 48:11), a &ldquo;Levitical&rdquo; priesthood to &ldquo;slaughter the burnt offering&rdquo; (Ezekiel 44:10-11;48:22). Furthermore, the offerings are stated to be for &ldquo;a sin offering&rdquo; (Ezekiel 43:22, 25; 44:24, 29) and to &ldquo;make atonement&rdquo; (Ezekiel 43:20; 45:25). Since the sacrifices and sacrificial personnel are so prominent throughout these chapters, the treatment of the sacrifices cannot be avoided.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">SIN OFFERINGS </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ezekiel 45:23 &nbsp;And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily&nbsp;</span><span class="cs79659084">for a sin offering</span><span class="csA7555675">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5A8D6493">&quot;What is the purpose of the thousand-year reign of Christ?&quot;<br/><br/></span><span class="cs637B72C0">The Millennium (</span><span class="cs892FC600">Millenial Kingdom</span><span class="cs637B72C0">) is the 1000-year reign of Jesus after the Tribulation and before all the people of the world are sent to heaven or hell.

They expected Him to be a military/political leader that would liberate them from the Romans and make Israel a great nation again.
