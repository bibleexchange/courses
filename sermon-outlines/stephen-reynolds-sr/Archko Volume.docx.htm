ghost, he proved to all that he was hypostatical (that is, a human body) and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Georgia",serif;
color:#333333'>It also contains a very unflattering description of Joseph [whom
the Bible describes as a just man] alongside a glowing description of Mother
Mary. And who allegedly pens these contrasting descriptions? Why, the great
teacher Gammaliel himself! And since Archko relates a near-conversion of a
pious and misunderstood Pontius Pilate; why not convert Herod as well? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Georgia",serif;color:#333333'>the
Archko Volume describes the events of Jesus’ Birth and states that the
shepherds saw strange lights and heard voices and that they felt afraid at
first but then felt a great peace. This sounds similar to the Biblical account,
but we are forced to consider upon further thought that bright lights are
hardly angels. In fact, bright lights lend more credence to UFOs than angelic
choirs. Too, we wonder that the Bible says that the angel specifically said, “Fear
Not!” rather than that their fear simply faded away. Strikingly, there is no
mention in the Archko Volume that the Babe would be lying in a manger wrapped
in swaddling clothes as a sign to the shepherds that they had found the Christ
Child. On the other hand, there is considerable emphasis on a priest who seems
to comprehend perfectly that Jesus’ birth is a fulfillment of Messianic
prophecies and who allegedly defends both the Virgin Birth and Zacharias the
father of John the Baptist to the Sanhedrin. As mentioned, the Archko Volume
describes Joseph as a mean-spirited man who is “as gross and glum as he looks,”
while the Bible Canon records that he was a just man.</span></p>
