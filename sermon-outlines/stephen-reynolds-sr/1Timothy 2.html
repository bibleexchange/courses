From the following verses we can see that those condemned there will burn in flames and experience bites upon their flesh. Hell will be full of souls, but each will seem to be in isolation in a void of darkness. We read from Luke that the &quot;rich man&quot; saw those in Paradise and that they weren&rsquo;t suffering this torment. Could you image enduring this pain and then the mental agony of seeing what you missed out on? If you go to Hell, you will have plenty of time to regret refusing the Lord&rsquo;s gift, but remorse at that time will be too late. Once we pass from this mortal life, we have established forever our eternal destiny.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">Luke 16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham&#39;s bosom: the </span><span class="cs5E98E930">rich man also died, and was buried</span><span class="csA16174BA">; 16:</span><span class="cs5E98E930">23 And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments</span><span class="csA16174BA">, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, </span><span class="cs5E98E930">that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame</span><span class="csA16174BA">. 16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 16:26 And beside all this, </span><span class="cs5E98E930">between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot</span><span class="csA16174BA">; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">Revelations 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. 20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.

This lack of understanding is due to the limited capability of the human mind in understanding eternity. In our meager mortal existence we know that everything in our world has a start and end just as we are born and eventually die. It is hard to understand the concept of something lasting forever. For us &quot;forever&quot; means a lifetime or less than 120 years, but to God forever has no end. We could be in Hell for 9,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 years and still have just as long left as when we started. When a criminal is committed to prison, they typically have a jail term to serve with a fixed number of years, but Hell doesn&rsquo;t work that way. As I write this commentary, I pray that God will open your eyes (sinner and Christian) to the seriousness of eternal damnation in Hell. If he does open your eyes, then it would cause sinners to repent and Christians to pray for their lost loved ones like they have never prayed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs9F09FF22">As Christians, if we can grasp this understanding of eternity, then we can see the gravity and seriousness for every lost soul. Each sinner is only a breath away from burning in a Hell that was planned for Satan! I&rsquo;m not talking about suffering for a few minutes and being burned up, we are talking about a repetitive continual dying that will never stop!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs9F09FF22">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs46C03EEC">But, I&rsquo;m not sure that I can live the life that God expects from a Christian</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs9F09FF22">We can&rsquo;t live a holy life without the Lord&rsquo;s help, but his grace is sufficient.
