He promised to make Abraham&rsquo;s descendants as numerous as the stars of the sky, to make them a great nation, to bless them in a unique way, to give them a land forever, to enter into a special and unique relationship with them that would endure forever, and even to bless the whole world through them. The salvation of the Gentiles and the very existence of the Church is part of the outworking of God&rsquo;s promise to bless the whole world through Abraham&rsquo;s descendants. God first shared these promises in Genesis chapters 12 to 22, and in a sense these eleven chapters are the very heart of the Bible. What comes before Genesis 12 serves as background to God&rsquo;s promises, and everything what comes after Genesis 22 in some way relates to their fulfillment. The whole story of the Bible is about how God is working in the lives of his people, Israel, to bring about the fulfillment of the promises he made to Abraham and his seed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The fulfillment can only happen when God&rsquo;s people choose to love him in return.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">In order for God to fulfill his promises to Israel, as a nation, God is going to have to bring the nation of Israel to repentance and faith </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The promises God made to Israel were to &ldquo;a seed,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a people&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The promises will be fulfilled to a generation of Israel in the future that turns to the Lord with their whole heart. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">In order for the promises to be fulfilled, it will be necessary for Israel, as a nation, to be regenerated, because the fulfillment of the promises involves an intimate personal relationship with God. So, not surprisingly, the theme of the Bible is how God is working in the lives of his people, Israel, to bring them to faith in him, his word, and his Messiah, without which, they cannot be born again </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Now concerning Hosea&rsquo;s message, the events recorded in the book happened in the years just before the northern kingdom of Israel was carried off into captivity in 722 B.C. (over 2700 years ago).&nbsp; The story of the book is about how God, who found Israel to be stubbornly faithless and spiritually rebellious, </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">had to allow them to experience the consequences of their waywardness</span><span class="csA521DC07">. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">God didn&rsquo;t let this to happen because he stopped loving Israel, or because he ran out of patience, he did it as part of a plan for the redemption of his people. God is very patient, and this plan is still being worked out today, and it won&rsquo;t come to completion until Israel comes to faith in Christ, which the Bible says will happen in the last days, that is, the last days prior to the second coming of Christ. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ho 1:1 </span><span class="csF42C4B08">The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea</span><span class="csA521DC07">, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 </span><span class="cs75A07D5F">The beginning of the word of the LORD</span><span class="csA521DC07"> by Hosea.

It would not be long after this prophecy that Israel would be invaded by Assyria; that invasion happened in 722 B.C. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The Assyrians were the cruelest people in history. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Jonah was sent to proclaim judgment upon the city of Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian Empire. The reason Jonah didn&rsquo;t want to go was because the Assyrians were so violent and pitiless that Jonah actually wanted them to be destroyed; he didn&rsquo;t want to see them have the opportunity to repent and be spared. When the Assyrians invaded a land, they had no mercy on the people they conquered. When they conquered a city, they were known to throw the children off the city walls, or if there were no wall, they would take them to a nearby cliff and throw them onto the rocks below. Conquered people they thought would not make good slaves, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">They were experts at making their victims suffer as much, and as long, as possible. Those that survived had metal hooks driven through their jaws and were connected to chains and led away into captivity. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">So the name &ldquo;Lo-ruhamah&rdquo; is prophetic of where Israel&rsquo;s decision to leave the shelter of God&rsquo;s protection is about to lead them. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">They walked away from God&rsquo;s protective care. If God had continued to shield Israel from the consequences of their sins, they would have never understood the true nature of their choices. So, God was saying by the naming of this child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to shield you any longer from the consequences of the sinful choices you have made. If you&rsquo;re going to worship other gods, then you&rsquo;re going to have to depend on those gods to provide for you, and we&rsquo;ll see if they are able to take care of you&mdash;of course they couldn&rsquo;t, because these &ldquo;gods&rdquo; were only wood, metal, and stone. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">You&rsquo;ve got to learn that there are consequences for the choices you make. Go ahead, compare the love, provision, and protection I&rsquo;ve given you to what your idols can do for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The third child was named </span><span class="csD3860DFD">Lo-ammi</span><span class="csA521DC07">, meaning &ldquo;not mine.&rdquo; This name seems to have significance both to Hosea&rsquo;s marriage and to Israel&rsquo;s relationship to God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Hosea came to the realization that this child was not his, and we can well imagine the personal devastation Hosea felt. Of course the prophetic symbolism is that just as Gomer had brought forth a child born of her harlotry, so Israel had brought forth its children in spiritual harlotry by going after idols.&nbsp; Now Lo-ammi&rsquo;s name isn&rsquo;t simply an acknowledgment of the fact that Israel had played the harlot, it is a declaration of disownership. Israel, having been unfaithful, is about to experience the full effect of being cut off from God.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;When a person persistently sins and never has to pay a penalty, what happens? Well, often they develop a distorted view of reality. They begin to think they can sin without consequences.&nbsp; So even though it can be very painful, having to deal with the consequences of sin can be a positive thing if it leads to repentance.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Hosea&rsquo;s story continues in chapter two&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Hosea and Gomer&rsquo;s marriage fell apart, and Gomer left. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Gomer appears to have gone from one man to the next, until somewhere along the way she became the woman of a man who didn&rsquo;t have the means, or the will, to support her. Some other man might have been happy to see his wayward wife fall on such hard times, but not Hosea. We learn that Hosea, in some way or another, found a way to secretly provide for Gomer&rsquo;s support. So while Gomer was living in her adulterous relationship, Hosea was behind the scenes making sure she had clothes, food, and money. At some point Hosea came to the realization that providing for Gomer&rsquo;s needs wasn&rsquo;t going to help unless her heart changed; in fact, it would only enable her to continue her wayward lifestyle, so he made the very difficult decision to cut off her support. In time the consequences she had been protected from began to roll in. Eventually Gomer&rsquo;s lover sold her into slavery, and she discovered the sad truth that so many others have discovered: that often what presents itself as an opportunity for self-fulfillment, ends in bondage and despair.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Now even though Gomer deserved what she got, this is a sad story. It&rsquo;s sad for Hosea because his family was broken apart and he was robbed of the love for which he longed. It&rsquo;s sad for Gomer because her sin caused her to lose her family and eventually led her to slavery. But of course the real story of this book isn&rsquo;t the story of Hosea and Gomer, it&rsquo;s the story of God and Israel. Hosea&rsquo;s love for Gomer is only a picture of God&rsquo;s love for Israel, because all the while that Israel was unfaithful to God, he was providing for them, and they took his blessings and used them for their idol worship. But it&rsquo;s important for us to recognize that just as Hosea never stopped loving Gomer, no matter how low she sank, so God never stopped loving Israel, even though he had to stand by and watch them be given over to the terrible consequences of their sin.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">While the Book of Hosea goes on for several more chapters, the story of Hosea and Gomer&rsquo;s relationship comes to a close in chapter 3. Chapter 3, verses 1-5 says,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ho 3:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Gomer may have been sold into slavery, but Hosea never forgot her and never stopped loving her, and when God revealed to him that the time was right, Hosea went and redeemed Gomer out of slavery. Now you might be thinking, &ldquo;Wow, what a wonderful ending for a love story,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not the end of the story, because a marriage can&rsquo;t go through what Hosea and Gomer went through without a lot of wreckage and brokenness. Their relationship needed a lot of mending before they could again live together as man and wife. We notice that Gomer, though purchased, was not immediately restored to her former status as a wife, and things would remain that way until her heart changed. The same is true with God and Israel. God allowed Israel to experience the consequences of their unfaithfulness. He allowed them to experience the destruction of their nation, and captivity; and although he purchased them, they have remained in an unrestored condition for all these years. So what is God waiting for? He&rsquo;s waiting for a change of heart, and it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, but it&rsquo;s going to happen. Did you notice when? Verse&nbsp;5 says, &ldquo;in the last days.&rdquo; If we look back in chapter two this is explained to us. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Ho 2:6 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. {wine: Heb. new wine} {which...: or, wherewith they made Baal}</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">10 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;11 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. {Ishi: that is, My husband} {Baali: that is, My lord}</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;18 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;21 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;22 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">At the present time Israel is without a king, without sacrifices, without a temple, without a priesthood, It has been that way for almost 2,000 years, but there&rsquo;s coming a day when their hearts are going to be changed and they will seek their Messiah&mdash;Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Now aside from the obviously important truth that God has a future for Israel, you may be wondering how any of this applies to us today. Did you notice the cycle that Israel went through? They belonged to God. Somewhere along the way they got their eyes onto other loves. God patiently pleaded with them, but they wouldn&rsquo;t listen. Finally they reached a point where there was no alternative but to expose them to the consequences of their choices. Later, after God would redeem them out of their enslavement it would be a long process before they could be fully restored. Israel&rsquo;s rejection of God was deep and persistent; and the deeper and longer the rejection, the more difficult the restoration. Did God stop loving them? No. Does he still want a relationship with them? Yes. Can they be restored? Yes&mdash;and there&rsquo;s more than hope, there&rsquo;s a promise that Israel will be restored, but it won&rsquo;t be easy, and it won&rsquo;t be quick, and it won&rsquo;t be painless, but it will happen at the appointed time in the &ldquo;last days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Is there a personal lesson here for us? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Some of you reading this might have walked close to the Lord at one time, but something happened; you allowed other things to come between you and him. It seemed that you took your eyes off of him for only a moment, but that moment turned into an hour, and the hour into days, weeks, months, perhaps even years. You used to hear his voice calling you back, but now all you hear is deafening silence. You pray, but there is no answer. You confess your sins, but you feel no release from the burden, and you worry that somehow you&rsquo;ve wandered so far away, or done something so terribly wrong that you can never get home again. Can I share a great truth from the story of Hosea&rsquo;s life? No matter what you might have done, no matter how long it&rsquo;s been since you walked with the Lord, no matter how far you may have wandered from his presence, no matter what you may have said to him in your anger, frustration, or disappointment, the truth is that God has never stopped loving you, and he will never give up on you. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Only a true altar with Jesus will heal you&rsquo;re wounded spirit.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">We&rsquo;ve seen from the example of Hosea and Gomer that sometimes deeply broken relationships take time to heal. But I want you to know that no matter how horrible your failure may seem to you, God has never stopped loving you, and he will never give up on you. Why? -Because he has always known the end from the beginning. Just like Hosea knew before he married Gomer that she would be an unfaithful wife, and just like God knew before he chose Israel that they would be an unfaithful people, so he has always known everything about you, and me; and he chose to love us in spite of what he has always known. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">I know, you look into that spiritual &ldquo;mirror,&rdquo; and you see tangled matted hair, worn and ragged clothes, a weathered face, and dirty feet and hands. The thought of God&rsquo;s presence no longer brings peace and joy, but apprehension, maybe even dread. Somehow you can&rsquo;t believe God would even want to look at you, much less put his arms around you.
