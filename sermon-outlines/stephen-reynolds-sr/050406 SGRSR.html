The peace of a good clear conscience is of great value. Matthew 11:28 There is a peace in obedience to God. </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a law to love one another. Their will be a lot of tests of your conscience. If you go to war with an unclear conscience it is going to show up. In the midst of the battle when you find yourself wounded, do not give up or let down. The grace of God works in the heart of a man whereas the peace of God prevails. If wounded in battle do not blame God, but remember that you missed something in the Word. Be honest. Forgive yourself and others, be forbearing, loving, kind, gentle. A good conscience is necessary weapon of our daily battles.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">WHAT IS A GOOD CONSCIENCE? </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A good conscience is a mighty weapon just as faith is. &quot;Holding faith and a good conscience.&quot; Holding that experience/ground that God has given to you. The devil can get at you through your feelings, but not through your faith. A good conscience is a might weapon of defense when the great accuser comes by because we know by God&#39;s grace we have been CHANGED. I Cor. 5:17 The devil as a liar tries to bring us back down after God has placed us on our feet. By the righteousness of Christ we have been made righteous. His righteousness is imparted to our heart when His life is flowing freely making us STRONG.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It takes believing God&#39;s Word to have the peace of a clear conscience. You can&#39;t meditate on unbelief and evil thoughts and yet have faith. Faith is a shield that cuts off those evil thoughts to where they cannot penetrate and wound. If we allow those evil thoughts to get in it wounds so that our conscience cannot work properly.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God&#39;s Word is holy. God is holy. Leviticus 20:7 We must know Who He is--GOD IS HOLY! The devil cannot defeat the life of Christ in you. It is His nature in you and his nature is Holy. Every part of your life must be holy. I Peter 1:15,16</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A good clear conscience is a weapon you need that brings a peace the devil cannot bring down. God&#39;s Word is what we need in our hearts to keep us from offending Him. People find no steadiness or consistency in merely memorizing truth and Scripture and trying to live a better Christian life. We must have the life of Christ in us working, flowing, a fresh and intimate relationship with God. You can know God and have Him working in your heart. John 4:14 It won&#39;t flow until the conscience is clear and faith is exercised. His life working in our heart will produce victory.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Exodus 15:2 We need to get beyond simply not offending God and just admitting failure. We must seek after Him and worship and praise him asking Him to work in our heart what we could not do ourself. Speak against the voice of the flesh. </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">PREPARATION IS SO NEEDED TO HAVE AND HOLD A GOOD CONSCIENCE. </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ephesians 6:15 There is a process producing a good conscience to bring us into a place to where we may exalt Christ and walk in newness of life. In Christ we are restored and our conscience becomes clear. THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH. Prepare God a habitation and do not allow the devil to have place in our mind. Speak life, speak God&#39;s holiness, power, grace, and what He is saying. Do not rest in past promises or future promises (remember it), but rest in a promise that is ALIVE now. John 14:1,2 There is preparation that God has made for us and preparation for us to make in following after what He has done. God has something for us. The devil brings negative, but the Word of God holds us steady. Rev. 19:7,8 You can only make yourself ready by what the Holy Ghost brings to you.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To hold a good conscience is to live a transparent life, an experience that reaches deep inside, GENUINE. &quot;Rivers of water feeding the hungry.&quot; Psalm 119:11 God is going to help us. Psalm 10:17 Make preparation for the Holy God. 1 Cor. 14:8 We NEED God&#39;s Word. Labor in study to know truth so that the Holy Spirit may reveal it to your heart. A clear conscience is a mighty weapon that stands together </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">with</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> faith. Your conscience can&#39;t stand clear and pure by itself. &quot;Some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck.&quot; Hold faith, hold a clear conscience that we may hold to the Truth and not let up.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE? </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Peter 3:16 God has &nbsp;a purpose greater for His people than just fighting the devil. We can know a Christian experience above just fighting the adversary. We must conquer the enemy, but more so--&quot;more than conquerors.&quot; PURPOSE: so that when we are falsely accused, ridiculed, there will be a shining forth of the life of Christ from us. That light is a light to the world. Memory verses are not a light to the world, but when the life of Christ shines from you that is the light of the world. Divine life is Divine light. Study the Word to know that this is for you. More than conquerors, but also a light to the world. &quot;IF WE CAN HEAR THAT CERTAIN SOUND...&quot; We must understand how the promise works. We must hear that sound that only the Spirit of God can speak to you. If we know what we are doing, we can conquer and be in victory. Do not fault others, hold no bitterness, and speak the love of God.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">HOW POWERFUL IS A GOOD CONSCIENCE? </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It doesn&#39;t work by itself or just happen, but it must be exercised by faith. Hebrews 5:13,14 Acts 24:16 It takes strength to exercise a good conscience. It didn&#39;t come easy, but he did those things he knew to do according to the Word of God. The power of a good conscience is to void out every onslaught of the enemy.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith with a good conscience is powerful.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">HOW CAN A MAN REINFORCE A GOOD CONSCIENCE?</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A cry of faith unto Jesus will be heard. Reach out to Him knowing He is watching. When we call on His name He will answer. John 1:9 Men have been dashed against the rocks, but He is that great Lighthouse warning of us of the way of sin and its inevitable destruction. A Clear conscience makes it possible for the Light to shine.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must have a good conscience. We cannot have it without conviction or repentance.</span></p></body>
