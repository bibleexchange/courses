			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Witchcraft in the Church! </span></h3>
		<p class="csCDDC8C82"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A number of Satanists and practicing witches are infiltrating the church -- especially charismatic churches. Some of the witches that have authored books, enter congregations posing as super-spiritual Christians. Their purpose is to deceive and shipwreck pastors and to lead multitudes of naive believers into occult worship. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many evil witches, are already established in numerous churches, controlling both the pastor and congregation and causing great confusion, wickedness, divorce, perversion -- even death. Pastor&rsquo;s without prayer and protection of constant examination of their faith in God and the leading of the Holy Ghost can be under some kind of demonic influence. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Saints, we in the Body of Christ dare not allow the devils power to be magnified in the house of God! His power is limited, and he cannot penetrate a Holy Ghost wall of fire. When the disciples were sent out with power to heal the sick and raise the dead, they came back rejoicing: &quot;Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name&quot; (Luke 10:17) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The only pastor who can fall under the control of a witch is one who indulges in secret sin -- who is driven by greed or success, or who has betrayed the Lord through unbelief or neglect! A man of God who has mortified the deeds of the flesh and wields the sword of the Lord will know the enemy. He will discern any trap and will stand against the wicked one, as Paul did with the witch at Philippi. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Heres what happened: A slave girl possessed by the devil -- that is, a practicing witch with a spirit of divination -- sought to infiltrate Pauls ministry! She followed after Paul and his companions, crying out, &quot;These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation&quot; (Acts 16:17) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But Pauls spirit was disturbed. He discerned that the girl was not converted and that she had no right to touch holy things. He perceived a trap. So he turned and said to the evil spirit in her, &quot;I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And (the demon) came out the same hour&quot; (verse 18). </span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul was unmoved by the demon powers. He was led by the Holy Spirit and full of the Word of God. But the Bible tells of one group of supposed ministers that was attacked -- literally -- and overcome by a demon. These were the seven sons of Sceva. When they tried to cast a demon out of a man, the evil spirit leaped on them, tore off their clothes and sent them running into the street in a panic -- all because they didnt know Jesus. They were not full of Christ! </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCC95C18">Those Who Walk In Holiness<br/>Resist the Devil </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ministers of the gospel who fall into deep sin dont exactly have a demon &quot;leap&quot; upon them; they arent seduced by a witch. They are led astray by their own lusts and desires! They have gotten off holy ground and have begun to cruise the devils territory! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No congregation that walks in holiness and the fear of God can be deceived or controlled by witches or evil spirits. Only pleasure-mad, Bible-and-holiness-rejecting churches are open to Satans attempts to move in. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Wherever the Word of God is exalted, wherever people separate themselves from wickedness and the world, wherever there is true repentance and obedience to the Holy Ghost -- there Jesus will always manifest His presence! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A congregation that is bathed in the presence of Jesus doesnt have to scream commands at wicked powers. The very power of Jesus drives out all that is wicked! Satan and his evil hordes simply cannot coexist with Christs presence. We resist the devil by being full of Jesus -- by living and worshipping in His presence! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Are there really churches and pastors today that are falling under the control of witches and demons? Absolutely, yes! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I know of one large Pentecostal church wholly given over to Satan. The pastor had a lustful, evil spirit. He committed one act of adultery after another, and soon his wife became involved. The pastor and his wife eventually introduced something into the congregation called &quot;connections&quot;. They developed an entire doctrine around it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First they brought ballroom dancing into the sanctuary. The pastor told the people to look into their partners eyes until the Holy Spirit made a &quot;connection&quot;. Pastors, leaders and deacons became involved. They began swapping wives, committing adultery. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before long, it all became chaotic. Divorce became rampant. Parishioners began having nervous breakdowns. The pastors son committed suicide. His daughter divorced and ran off with another man. More suicides broke out. One young mother was so distraught over her husbands leaving her that she drowned her baby in the bathtub so the babys soul would be safe with Jesus! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That church has been utterly destroyed -- it is embroiled today in numerous lawsuits -- all because of the unbridled lust of a backslidden pastor! That one man, full of Satan, opened up his entire flock to demonic powers! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Beloved, be careful where you go to church! Be careful that you have discernment, because a pastor who has opened himself to Satan can open your heart to demonic powers. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yet this message has to do with a kind of witchcraft that is a even more dangerous than that. It is much more subtle. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is brought into the church not by evil shepherds or by witches -- but by multitudes of Christians who dont know they are under the spell of witchcraft! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The kind of witchcraft I want to expose is present here in Times Square Church -- and in every church in America! In fact, it is in every church in the world, to some measure. It may be only a seed -- but it is still there. </span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You ask, &quot;How could the devil possibly deceive Gods elect? With occult seductions?&quot; No! Thats too obvious. We could easily discern the devices of Satan in that area. No, he comes to us in another way. His attack is so very subtle that few Christians ever recognize it. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCC95C18">Rebellion Is As the Sin of Witchcraft<br/>(1 Samuel 15:23). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When the Lord showed me the kind of witchcraft present in the church today, it shook my soul. It is revealed in 1 Samuel 15:22-23: &quot;Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible describes here a witchcraft far more dangerous than the occult. It controls more pastors and congregations than any other kind of demonic influence. It is rebellion against the Word of God! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Dont be quick to sit back and relax, thinking, &quot;Thank God, that cant possibly mean me. Im not rebellious against Gods Word. I love the Word. Im walking in obedience!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thats what I thought, too. But then God convicted me of the dangers of falling under the spell of this witchcraft! He showed me the seed of its beginnings -- exactly what erupted in the Garden of Eden! We all have the seed of this sin. In fact, you may unknowingly be under the influence of this evil charm. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus gives us a parable that exposes this witchcraft! Ive read the parable of the evil husbandmen many times. Ive prayed over it. But not until now have I seen in it the witchcraft that Jesus was exposing. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again, he sent other servants more that the first: and they did unto them likewise. But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons&quot; (Matthew 21: 33-41) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This parable is more than a retelling of how the Jews rejected Gods appeal from heaven -- and how they would be cast aside and the Gentiles made the husbandmen. It is also about a great supernatural battle over an inheritance. Its about a battle between the power of Jesus Christ and the power of Satan for the souls and allegiance of mankind! Its about who is going to rule and reign in the hearts of Gods chosen! And beloved, youre either under the power of Jesus Christ or under the influence of Satan! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You see, this parable is about how a people of God can become bewitched by the devil and end up totally possessed by an anti-Christ spirit. Christ was talking here of a most powerful form of witchcraft -- rebellion against the truth! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Here is the Key to this parable: &quot;This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance&quot; (verse 38). That is the devil speaking! &quot;Let us create rebellion against the Son! Let us crucify Him! We will take control!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is true that when the Pharisees heard this parable, &quot;they perceived that he spake of them&quot; (verse 45). But Jesus is also speaking to His church! In Hebrews 6:5, we find a people who &quot;have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come....&quot; They have rebelled against that good Word they heard, and as a result, &quot;they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame&quot; (verse 6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Who is crucifying Christ over and over again, putting Him to open shame before the whole world? Are they witches? Satanists? Homosexuals? Murderers? No! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They are those who heard, tasted and partook of the true Word of God -- and then allowed a spirit of rebellion to take root! Satan moved in, and they ended up possessed -- crucifying Christ! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Believer, I tell you on the authority of Gods Word that as long as you have this spirit of rebellion in you, it is impossible for God to revive or renew you! &quot;For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost...if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance&quot; (verse 4,6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I believe this means that repentance has no effect whatsoever in those who are in rebellion against the Word! </span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Lets look more closely at this form of witchcraft in the church. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCC95C18">The Witchcraft of Rebellion Begins<br/>With a Little Root of Bitterness! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I want to talk to you about being poisoned with the &quot;gall of bitterness.&quot; Peter introduced this phrase when he rebuked Simon, a new convert who had offered money in exchange for the power of the Holy Ghost to lay hands on people for baptisms and miracles. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity&quot; (Acts 8: 18-23). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Gall&quot; here means envy -- a dangerous poison. And Simon was infected with it! I believe he also had a heart to help people, which helped disguise his condition. Verse 13 says he believed, was baptized and &quot;continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done&quot;. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Something deadly lay underneath! All the while Simon was saying to himself, &quot;I can do that, too! Im gifted. I feel for people. Give me a chance!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Simon had a dangerous mixture in his heart. It was a desire to be used by God -- mixed with a desire for preeminence! He truly wanted God to use him, but he also needed recognition. He wanted power and place, without paying the right price! He wanted a shortcut. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So it is in the work of God today. Many are trying to take shortcuts to get to a place of power and usefulness. We offer our talents and abilities to the Lord -- but if you have the talent and dont have a servants heart, God cant use you! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In his third epistle, John tells of a man named Diotrephes who &quot;loved to have the preeminence among them&quot; (3 John 9). When things did not go his way, he began &quot;prating against&quot; the brethren with malicious words. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A &quot;prater&quot; is one who babbles over trifles. Diotrephes was offended by Johns message, and he began to gossip. His vanity had been pricked, his pride wounded. So he went about telling a story of being wounded by other servants of God. He disrupted the peace of the brethren and won many to his side. </span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This wasnt gross sin; it wasnt doctrinal error. It was the sin of impatience! He couldnt wait for God to do the work. He wanted preeminence -- and he probably sounded so right! </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCC95C18">A Wounded Spirit Is Fertile Ground<br/>For a Root of Bitterness! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;A wounded spirit who can bear?&quot; (Proverbs 18:14). How could the Israelites of Isaiahs time have become so fallen, so backslidden, so depressed in such a short time? Isaiah explains it: &quot;From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: They have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment&quot; (Isaiah 1:6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The prophet went on to warn the people of God who had open wounds, sores and bruises. He said as long as they went on bleeding, with blood on their hands, God could not hear them in such a condition: &quot;And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood&quot; (verse 15). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Whose blood is the Lord talking about? Your own! Youre bleeding from an open wound in your heart! Its oozing blood! You need healing! You need your wound softened with the oil of the Holy Ghost! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yet many of you dont run to the Master for healing. You dont realize that Satan is trying to get you into the witchcraft of rebellion. You see, God wont listen to a voice that cries out but wont accept His deliverance! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Let me show you how dangerous rebellion is, and why God calls it witchcraft: The husbandmen of the parable were Gods children. They were engaged in religious work. How could an upright Pharisee -- who paid tithes on every mint leaf in his garden, loved his children, traveled the whole world just to make a single convert, faithfully spent Sabbaths poring over the law-- turn into such a vicious person? How could these husbandmen eventually kill and steal and crucify? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They were enraged! They had murder in their hearts. Thats not from the flesh -- thats demonic! They stoned the messengers of the law! They knew what was demanded of them -- but once they rebelled against the word of God, bitterness took root in their hearts. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Beloved, bitterness blinds! You lose your spiritual vision in proportion to the growth of your bitterness. The more your bitterness grows, the more your blindness grows. Let a root of bitterness fester -- let the wound turn to gangrene, -- let the sore spread its poison all through your soul -- and you will end up just like these violent Pharisees, so blind they finally crucified the Son of God! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you continue in the gall of bitterness, you will end up with other bitter souls, prating; throwing stones at Gods holy servants, playing the part of a poor misunderstood martyr. You will end up at gall-gatherings, where others share your rebellion. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you continue in the gall of bitterness, you will open your very heart and soul to demon possession! You will end up a mouthpiece of the devil. Your tongue will become a spear that pierces the side of Christ. You will hang Him on open shame before all who know you. And you will shut out the voices of all preachers and prophets! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The work of God will go on, with other husbandmen willing to obey. God will say to you what Peter said to Simon : &quot;Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God&quot; (Acts 8:21) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Has someone in the house of God wounded you? Do you have a root of bitterness? I beg you: Run to the healer of all wounds and ask Him to pluck it out by the roots! </span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Let all bitterness, and wrath and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice&quot; (Ephesians 4:31) Stop it -- now! </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCC95C18">The Witchcraft of Rebellion Ends<br/>in a Lack Of Reverence for Jesus! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son&quot; (Matthew 21:37). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The immediate application of this parable was to the Pharisees and religious leaders Jesus was addressing. They had shut their ears to the prophets and watchmen God had sent them so often. &quot;Behold I send unto you prophets... some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city&quot; (Matthew 23:34). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus was speaking this parable to expose the plan of Satan. He was trying to show that a satanic plot was behind their lack of reverence for Him -- and their shutting out His truth! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christ had told them their rebellion had turned them into children of Satan: &quot;Why do you not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.... And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not&quot; (John 8:43-45). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This was the message: &quot;You became bitter, rebellious! You opened your soul to the devil. He filled you with wounds, bruises, putrefying sores -- and now you are full of death. Violence is in your heart. You cant hear a word I say. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;No prophet can reach you now, no watchman! Not even I can touch you. You are giving my inheritance to Satan! You were to be my people, but you would not. You sold yourself to the enemy. You despised my authority!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These husbandmen did not reverence Him. They rebelled and killed Him. But Satan did not get the inheritance -- a resurrected Christ gave it to others. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Looking at those Pharisees, you have to wonder: Why did they show such disrespect to Him? Why no reverence? Why could they not hear or understand His words? Why such blindness? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many in Gods house today suffer an even greater blindness. The Holy Ghost comes to us, willing to show us the meaning of all that Jesus said to us. He convicts us of our sin. We have been translated out of darkness, into His light. So why, then, do so many in the church still go about under this spell of witchcraft -- still prating, bitter and wounded -- still holding onto this spirit of rebellion? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some have already gone too far, as did these Pharisees. &quot;He will miserably destroy those wicked men&quot; (Matthew 21:41). Others are falling deeper and deeper into the devils snare, and only a thunderbolt from heaven can wake them up to the danger! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You simply cannot go on with roots of bitterness. You cannot go on green with envy and jealousy. You cannot go on wounded and hurt, blaming others. You cannot go on disregarding the clear hand of God -- unless you have lost your reverence for Jesus! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus is standing at your hearts door even now. He is saying, &quot;The Father sent Me. Show me your fruit -- your obedience! You were planted in good soil; you have had time to grow. What kind of harvest do you have for Me?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Reverence for Jesus is not a feeling; it is not words. Respect and reverence mean doing what He said! It means obeying His Word, laying aside all the hurt and putting yourself completely in His hands. </span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you put down this message still clinging to your wounds, holding onto your grudges, justifying your bitterness -- you not only disrespect Christ, but you are also putting Him to open shame and crucifixion once again. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCC95C18">There Is Hope For the Rebellious </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Beloved, I could not deliver this message if God had not given me a word of encouragement for those who long to be free of their rebellion. Its found in Psalm 107: 9-14. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned the counsel of the most High: Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; they fell down, and there was none to help. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Have you been &quot;brought down&quot; by your rebellion, your bitterness? Cry out to the Lord of Hosts for divine deliverance! Let Him break the demonic bands around your heart -- and bring you out of the shadow of death and into His marvelous light! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">---</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs8926E06">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
