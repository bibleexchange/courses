		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6EA37F08">Zephaniah barely preceded Jeremiah-Nahum, Habakkuk, Obadiah were his contemporaries.

He dictated these to his scribe or secretary, Baruch, who wrote them on a scroll (36:1-4). Because Jeremiah had been banned from entering the royal court, he sent Baruch to read the messages to King Jehoiakim. To show his contempt for Jeremiah and his message, the king cut the scroll apart and threw it in the fire (36:22-23). Jeremiah promptly dictated his book to Baruch again, adding &quot;many similar words&quot; (36:32) that had not been included in the first scroll.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">He was sensitive who could weep over the sins of his nation: &quot;Oh, that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears&quot; (9:1). But he was also a courageous man of GOD who could endure persecution and affliction. He narrowly escaped death several times as he carried out GOD&#39;s command to preach His message of judgment to a wayward people. A patriot who passionately loved his nation, he drew the tough assignment of informing his countrymen that Judah was about to fall to a pagan power. Many of his fellow citizens branded him a traitor, but he never wavered from the prophetic ministry to which GOD had called him. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">With the fall of Jerusalem in 587 B.C., most of the leading citizens of the nation were carried away as captives to Babylon. But Jeremiah was allowed to remain in Jerusalem with other citizens of Judah who were placed under the authority of a ruling governor appointed by Babylon. When the citizens of Jerusalem revolted against this official, Jeremiah and others were forced to seek safety in Egypt, where he continued his prophetic ministry (chaps. 43-44). This is the last we hear of this courageous prophet of the LORD.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">He was a sensitive poet who could weep over the sins of his nation: &quot;Oh, that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears&quot; (9:1).

He showed great compassion for his people and shed tears for them. He suffered their ingratitude, but forgave them. Jeremiah is one of the personalities in the Old Testament who most resembles Christ. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">In his teachings Jesus alludes to many passages of Jeremiah: &quot;Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?&quot; (7:11; Matt. 21:13); &quot;which have eyes and see not, which have ears and hear not&quot; (5:21; Mark 8:18); &quot;you shall find rest for your soul&quot; (6:16; Matt. 11:29); &quot;My people have been lost sheep&quot; (50:6; Matt. 10:6).</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><a name="HS"></a><span class="cs616FEBB5">The Holy Spirit in Action:</span><span class="cs6EA37F08"> Fire is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">GOD assured Jeremiah, &quot;I will make my words in your mouth fire&quot; (5:14). There was a moment in which Jeremiah wanted to quiet the voice of GOD, but &quot;it was in my heart like a burning fire inside my bones; I tried to bear it, and couldn&#39;t&quot; (20:9). Today we would say that the Holy Spirit was working in Jeremiah. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">Aside from his normal action of inspiring the prophet and revealing GOD&#39;s message, the Holy Spirit is the one who accomplishes the promise of a new covenant, who will put the Law of GOD in the minds of his people and write it in their hearts. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">The commandments of the old covenant shall then be in&middot;ter&middot;nal&middot;iz&middot;ed, and the believer shall receive the power to act according to each one of GOD&#39;s moral laws. Knowledge of GOD shall be universal, and other peoples shall be recipients of its blessings. Forgiveness was promised under the old covenant, but now it comes with the divine promise that the sin will be blotted out forever with the Nature Of His Holiness</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs6EA37F08">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs247C8E02"><span class="cs6EA37F08">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
