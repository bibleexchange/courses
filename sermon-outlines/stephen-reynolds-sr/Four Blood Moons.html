Although the statement is clearly millennial in context, by application it is one of those &quot;exceeding great and precious promises&quot; (2 Peter 1:4) that the believer can claim when he finally gets right with God.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt;">

The more obvious nations will be treated first then proceeding to the more difficult.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Libya, Persia, Ethiopia<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Libya (Put) remains today, bearing the same name, lying just west of Egypt. Persia, also remaining to the present, is now known as Iran. Biblical Ethiopia (Cush, K&Scaron;) is not the Ethiopia of today but rather the land just to the south of Egypt, Northern Sudan.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Togarmah<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Togarmah (TGRM) presents only a little more difficulty. Togarmah was a descendant of Noah through Japheth then Gomer (Gen.10:1-3). He is know to Assyrian records as Tilgarimmu (TLGRM). The inserted &quot;L&quot; is not uncommon and, more than likely, was silent. Tilgarimmu was a city state in Eastern Anatolia (Asia Minor, modern Turkey), more specifically, as Ryrie states, &quot;the southeastern part of Turkey near the Syrian border.&quot; This identification is generally acknowledged by all.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Gomer<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gomer (GMR) has often been mistaken to refer to Germany because of a supposed similarity of linguistic construction. This position has two serious errors. One is that the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are reversed. Ezekiel wrote of GMR not GRM. The reversal is unwarranted linguistically. Furthermore, this similarity and inversion is based upon a comparison of Ezekiel&#39;s GMR with a modern English (from Latin) designation for </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Deutschland.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Clearly, the similarity is only superficial. These two errors rule out, absolutely, any possible identification of Gomer with Germany.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, GMR is well known to the ancient world as Gimarrai (GMR) of north central Asia Minor (Cappadocia). These people are also known as the Cimmerians (KMR, note the change in gutturals from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;C&quot;). This seems to be the simplest, most obvious interpretation.<br/><br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Rosh<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">The identification of Rosh (R&Scaron;) presents some difficulty. Some understand it to be a proper noun referring to Russia rather than as a simple noun or adjective, &quot;head&quot; or &quot;chief&quot; (KJV), which is its normal meaning.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this interpretation may be allowable on grammatical grounds, it suffers from several problems. The first is that there is absolutely no place on earth known by this name, Rosh. Of all the occurrences of Meshech and Tubal (M&Scaron;K and TBL) in Biblical and non-Biblical writings, they are never associated with a place called Rosh, as the translation &quot;prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal&quot; would suggest.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are linguistic problems here as well. As Unger admits, &quot;Linguistic evidence for the equation [of Rosh with Russia] is confessedly only presumptive.&quot; The first problem is that the similarity is in sound only, not in consonantal configuration. Notice it is Rosh (R&Scaron;) not Rus (RS). Furthermore, the problem encountered earlier, the supposed similarity is based on a comparison with a much more modern word. The term &quot;Russia&quot; comes from a late eleventh-century A.D. Viking word &quot;Rus&quot; (RS; again notice the difference in consonants). Reading modern words and spellings into ancient Semitic terminology is to ignore all known linguistic norms.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is no place named Rosh associated with Meshech or Tubal, and since the attempted equation of it with modern Russia is obviously fallacious, it is easiest to understand both &quot;chief&quot; (rosh) and &quot;prince&quot; as related appositionally and used in reference to Meshech and Tubal: &quot;chief prince of Meshech and Tubal&quot; (KJV). This is also the reading of the Targum, Aquila, and the Vulgate.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Meshech<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Meshech (M&Scaron;K) is often mistaken for the Modern Russian city of Moscow, capitol and largest city of the Soviet Union. Again, this identification, as even Ryrie admits, is unfounded also. The problems are similar to those associated with the identification of Gomer with Germany. First of all, the &Scaron; is changed to S. This again is unwarranted linguistically. Furthermore, the similarity is based upon a comparison of M&Scaron;K with the English designation Moscow; the Russian word is Moskva (MSKV) and is less similar still.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Mushki (M&Scaron;K) of central and western Asia Minor, known in the classics (Homer, etc.) as Phrygia, fits very well. These people were well known to Ezekiel, and this seems clearly the easier interpretation.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Tubal<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Tubal (TBL) is commonly identified with the Russian city of Tobol&#39;sk. Although this is allowable linguistically, it is not the best hermeneutically. Ezekiel knew nothing of Tobol&#39;sk (or Moscow or Germany, for that matter); it did not exist. He was, however, well acquainted with Tabal (TBL) of Eastern Asia Minor (and Gimarrai and Mushki) of central and western Asia Minor). Granted, God could have revealed Tobol&#39;sk (and Moscow and Germany) to the ancient prophet, but to assume so when Tabal was well known to him is unjustified apart from Biblical warrant. If a man in New York, for example, speaks of Manhattan, he would not want anyone to assume that he is speaking of a Manhattan, Kansas; much less would he want anyone to interpret his words as referring to a Manhattan somewhere else in the world of which he is unaware! Similarly, to assume a place unknown to the prophet (Tobol&#39;sk) when clear options are available is both hermeneutically and exegetically untenable. Tabal is clearly to be preferred.</span></p><p class="csD321B878"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Gog<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gog is extremely difficult to identify. Some have identified him with Gyges (seventh century B.C.), king of Lydia (extreme western Asia Minor), who is called Gugu in the Ashurbanipal texts. Some have suggested the place name Gagai, referred to in the Tell el Amarna letters as a land of Barbarians. A god named Gaga found in the Ras Shamra writings; Gagu, a ruler of the land of Sakhi, North of Assyria; and Gaga, a mountainous region north of Meletene, have all been offered as alternatives. Some have understood Gog to be a historical figure such as Alexander the Great. One plausible explanation is that Gog is merely an official title or general designation for any enemy of God&#39;s people. This interpretation is based on the Septuagint rendering of several Kingly names in the Old Testament. Perhaps Gog is only a derivative of the related word Magog. None of the above suggestions has sufficient evidence for certain identification. It is most probable that Gog is a person, but geographical identification is not given.</span></p><p class="csD321B878"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Magog<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Magog, a descendant of Noah through Japheth (Gen. 10:1-2), presents the most difficulty. Those who see it as Russia appeal to Josephus who said &quot;Magog founded those that from him were named Magogites, but who are by the Greeks called Scythians,&quot; who lived north and northeast of the Black Sea. The fact of the matter, however, is that nothing is known about Magog--nothing. Josephus&#39; guess may be as good as any, but the place is as yet unidentified. The appeal to Gesenius is impressive, but it must be remembered that Gesenius was a great lexicographer and grammarian, not an authority on ancient history. His statement was but a guess also; in fact, it is highly probable that Josephus was Gesenius&#39; source for this information. Furthermore, though the Scythians are of the Japhetic line, they are believed by historians to be descendants of Gomer through Ashkenas; this is not true of Magog. To identify Magog as the Scythians is without support from historical anthropology.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Magog cannot be identified specifically, it seems that Scripture does give a clue at least to its general vicinity. First, &quot;Gog&quot; is known to be an Anatolian name. Further, if Meshech and Tubal have been identified correctly and are in Asia Minor, Magog must be a part of Asia minor as well since &quot;they [Meshech and Tubal] lived in the neighborhood of Magog.&quot; Ezekiel 38:2 states that Gog, who is the &quot;chief prince of Meshech and Tubal,&quot; is &quot;of the land of Magog.&quot; If Gog is prince of Meshech and Tubal and lives in the land of Magog, it seems reasonable that Magog is in close proximity.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the Scythians were a people other than Magogites, and Magog is not able to be specifically identified, unless it is a general reference to the land of Asia Minor.</span></p><p class="csD321B878"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;North Parts&quot;<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another argument for seeing Russia in this prophecy of Ezekiel remains, namely, Ezekiel&#39;s statement that Gog will descend &quot;from the north parts&quot; (38:15). The word indicates &quot;uttermost parts of the north&quot; or &quot;farthest north.&quot; This, it is assumed, points directly to Russia. The major objection to this is again based upon a commitment to consistent historical interpretation. Scriptural terminology must not be forced into a twentieth-century A.D. map. To Ezekiel the &quot;farthest north&quot; was Asia Minor (from there you jump off the edge!). To extend Ezekiel&#39;s frame of reference any further, without exegetical warrant, cannot be right.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, if Asia Minor is not the &quot;farthest north,&quot; then why stop with Russia? Why not go on to the north pole? If this seems ridiculous, then why not Finland? Norway? Sweden? These all extend directly above Moscow. If these interpreters will not interpret within Ezekiel&#39;s geographical frame of reference, demanding a &quot;more literal&quot; understanding of &quot;farthest north,&quot; then their own hermeneutic demands they go farther north than Moscow. Their own argument falls.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more fact is worthy of observation here. In verse 6 this same geographical description (&quot;farthest north&quot;) is also given of Togarmah, yet virtually all agree that this is eastern Asia Minor! If Asia Minor was far north enough for Togarmah, why not for Gog? The problem is obvious.<br/><br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">SUMMARY<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">It has been shown on the basis of exegesis, hermeneutics, linguistics, and historical anthropology that, 1) Gomer cannot be Germany but rather Gimarrai, 2) Meshech cannot be Moscow but Mushki, 3) Tubal is not Tobol&#39;sk but Tabal, 4) Gog is probably a personage, 5) Magog is unidentifiable except as a general reference (&quot;land of Gog&quot;) to Asia Minor, 6) rosh is not a reference to a place but is to be translated &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;head,&quot; and 7) the terms &quot;north parts&quot; and &quot;north quarters&quot; cannot mean Russia but, within Ezekiel&#39;s frame of reference, refer to modern Turkey.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Ezekiel prophesied, then, is an end-time battle involving the following nations coming against Israel: 1) Turkey (Meshech, Tubal, Magog[?], Gomer, Togarmah; 2) Iran (Persia), 3) Sudan (Ethiopia or Cush), and 4) Libya.<br/><br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS<br/><br/>Concerning Turkey<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Precisely why Turkey (Anatolia, Asia Minor) is set forth in Ezekiel&#39;s prophecy under four names (Meshech, Tubal, Gomer and Togarmah) cannot be determined. Perhaps it points to some future political break-up of that area. Perhaps it is simply to clearly specify that the entire nation or land will be involved: west (Meshech), Central (Gomer), and east (Tubal and Togarmah).<br/><br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Concerning the Nations Involved--And Those Who are Not<br/><br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">With Turkey, Iran, Libya and Sudan, Gog leads an Islamic coalition of nations against Israel: Turkey from the north, Iran from the east, Libya from the west and Sudan from the south.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note also the nations who are (surprisingly!) absent: Egypt and Syria. Why? The only plausible answer is that they both have somehow been relegated to an inferior position militarily. This fits nicely into Daniel chapter 11 with both the King of the North (Syria) and the King of the South (Egypt) being destroyed by Antichrist.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Re 9:3 And there came out of the smoke </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">locusts</span><span class="csA521DC07"> upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a </span><span class="csF42C4B08">scorpion</span><span class="csA521DC07">, when he striketh a man.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Locusts</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">With a king</span><span class="cs75A07D5F"> </span><span class="csF42C4B08">scorpion</span></p></body>
