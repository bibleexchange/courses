		<p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Just as it is dangerous to follow a preacher or teacher because they are popular, it is equally dangerous to follow a preacher or teacher because they are unpopular.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">I have been a follower of Andrew Wommack since 1998, when he rocked my world with a message called &ldquo;Two Kinds of Righteousness&rdquo;. Back then he wasn&rsquo;t on TV in Europe, and nobody in the circles I moved in knew who he was.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Now Andrew is one of the leading TV ministers in this nation and his ministry has garnered a measure of success and his Bible Colleges are taking off and his conferences are growing, I actually know people who have stopped listening to his ministry, stopped going to his conferences, stopped being part of it all because &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it all before&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the new thing&rdquo;, &ldquo;I want to be on the fringe&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Sometimes the fringe is exactly where it is happening. Sometimes it is just the lunatic fringe. Some people actually like being unpopular and being persecuted &ndash; sometimes they deliberately choose to go to a church that rejects tongues or healing or the grace message because they enjoy the feeling of being rejected and being persecuted. It makes them feel better than other people. Not being secure in their righteousness, they like being around people they feel superior to because that assuages their sense of guilt and inferiority.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Sometimes they come up with increasingly outlandish revelations in the name of grace most of which tend to universalism or a licentiousness which even our worst religious accusers wouldn&rsquo;t dream we are capable of. Just to stay persecuted. Just to stay on that high of being on the &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The fact is some days they will praise you, some days they will crucify you. Learn to live immune to both through faith in His work. Don&rsquo;t let a need for popularity lead you to disobedience, and don&rsquo;t let a need for unpopularity lead you to disobedience.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Find out where you fit into the body of Christ, get there and stay there. &nbsp;People left Tree of Life Church because it was too unpopular, and people have left the church because it was too popular. &nbsp;Being popular doesn&rsquo;t mean anything &ndash; honouring God does.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861">Posted in <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/category/uncategorized/" title="View all posts in Uncategorized"><span class="csCD76006D">Uncategorized</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | Tagged <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/abundance/"><span class="csCD76006D">Abundance</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/andrew-wommack/"><span class="csCD76006D">Andrew Wommack</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/benjamin-conway/"><span class="csCD76006D">Benjamin Conway</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/guilt/"><span class="csCD76006D">guilt</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/popular/"><span class="csCD76006D">popular</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/popularity/"><span class="csCD76006D">popularity</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/righteousness/"><span class="csCD76006D">righteousness</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/sense-of-guilt/"><span class="csCD76006D">sense of guilt</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/tree-of-life-church/"><span class="csCD76006D">tree of life church</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/tv-ministries/"><span class="csCD76006D">TV ministries</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/unpopular/"><span class="csCD76006D">unpopular</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2013/06/03/popularity-doesnt-matter/#respond" title="Comment on Popularity Doesn’t Matter"><span class="csCD76006D">Leave a comment</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2011/08/16/ever-wondered-how-andrew-wommack-ended-up-in-england/" title="9:26 pm"><span class="cs2449679F">August 16, 2011</span></a></span><span class="cs70DEDCF8"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/author/treeoflifelondon/" title="View all posts by treeoflifelondon"></a> </span></p><h1 class="csC5ACDC54">

		<p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This is how, in Andrew&rsquo;s own words:</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">(Yes, this is another blog post in light of Dave Duell&rsquo;s imminent visit to Dagenham!)</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">In September of 1989, I was holding a tent meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was the night that hurricane Hugo hit. The tent was flapping in the breeze, and we needed to drop and tie it off. But just before the service ended, Pastor Dean Mellon gave me a prophecy that changed my life and ministry.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">He said, &ldquo;you have a nation of the world on your heart, and you know exactly which nation I&rsquo;m speaking of&rdquo;. In less than a month, you will meet a man who will be a porter, a door opener to the whole nation.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">I knew exactly which nation the Lord was speaking of, and I knew in my heart that the Lord was about to bring my dreams and vision concerning the U.K. and Europe to pass. I&rsquo;ve had the U.K. on my heart ever since I took a trip to Europe in 1968. While in London, I spent hours walking the streets, praying for the people and believing God that someday I would get the opportunity to minister to them.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">However, it&rsquo;s not wise to just take a prophecy and run with it. If it was really the Lord speaking to me through this man, then it would come to pass without my help. Two weeks later at our U.S. Ministers&rsquo; Conference in Buena Vista, Colorado, I noticed that Will Graham from Rugeley, England was listed as an attendee. I figured Will was the man the Lord had spoken about, but I didn&rsquo;t say a thing to anyone.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">In the very first session, my good friend, Dave Duell, was ministering and calling people forward for prayer. He called Will to the front and said. &ldquo;Will, God has made you a porter, a door opener to all of the U.K.&rdquo; BINGO! That was it. This had to be the man the Lord had spoken to me about in Charlotte.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">I told Will about that prophecy I received in Charlotte and asked him what he thought. He said his church had received a special offering to send him to the conference to get Dave and me and bring us to England. Praise the Lord! A few months later we opened our first international office in Coventry, England, and its been going strong ever since.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">We have distributed hundreds of thousands of tapes and CDs through our European office and have thousands of people on our mailing list. We minister in many churches and hold two conventions in the U.K. each year. The Gospel Truth television program is broadcast daily in the U.K. on the God Channel International, which also reaches all of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">The open doors to the U.K. and Europe were a supernatural opportunity that came directly from the Lord. We are committed to walking through every door the Lord opens for us and minster the nearly too-good-to-be-true news of God&rsquo;s love to hungry people throughout Europe.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">Andrew</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861">Posted in <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/category/uncategorized/" title="View all posts in Uncategorized"><span class="csCD76006D">Uncategorized</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | Tagged <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/andrew-wommack/"><span class="csCD76006D">Andrew Wommack</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/charlotte/"><span class="csCD76006D">charlotte</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/dave-duell/"><span class="csCD76006D">Dave Duell</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/england/"><span class="csCD76006D">England</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/europe/"><span class="csCD76006D">Europe</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/prophecy/"><span class="csCD76006D">prophecy</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/prophet/"><span class="csCD76006D">Prophet</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/prophetic-word/"><span class="csCD76006D">Prophetic Word</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/supernatural-call/"><span class="csCD76006D">supernatural call</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/uk/"><span class="csCD76006D">UK</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2011/08/16/ever-wondered-how-andrew-wommack-ended-up-in-england/#respond" title="Comment on Ever Wondered How Andrew Wommack Ended Up in England?"><span class="csCD76006D">Leave a comment</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2010/02/01/a-better-way-to-pray-andrew-wommack/" title="8:04 pm"><span class="cs2449679F">February 1, 2010</span></a></span><span class="cs70DEDCF8"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/author/treeoflifelondon/" title="View all posts by treeoflifelondon"></a> </span></p><h1 class="csC5ACDC54">

		<p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Decades ago, I was participating in an all-night prayer meeting bombarding the gates of heaven. I remember beating the wall and yelling,&nbsp;</span><span class="cs3BC4135E">&ldquo;God, if You loved the people in Arlington, Texas, half as much as I do, we&rsquo;d have revival!&rdquo;</span><span class="csE613E19A"> Immediately, my lightning-fast mind realized that something was seriously wrong with my theology.</span><span class="cs3BC4135E"> What was I thinking?</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Did I really believe I loved these people more than God did? No, not exactly. Like many Christians, I believed God was angry with the human condition, and it was up to me to turn Him from wrath and judgment. I was interceding, or so I thought, pleading with God on the behalf of others. What could possibly be wrong with that? As I learned later, a lot.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">The things the Lord has revealed to me about prayer since then have totally changed my life, and I&rsquo;m now seeing miraculous results.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> If you aren&rsquo;t getting the results you know the Lord wants you to have, maybe it&rsquo;s time to consider a better way to pray. I&rsquo;m not saying that anyone who doesn&rsquo;t pray as I do is &ldquo;of the devil.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;of the devil&rdquo; in the way I used to pray. I loved God with all my heart, and the Lord loved me. But the results weren&rsquo;t there.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">First, we need to recognize that God isn&rsquo;t angry at mankind anymore. </span><span class="csE613E19A">He is no longer imputing or holding our sins against us.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation&rdquo; </span><span class="csE613E19A">(2 Cor. 5:19).</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">We are NOW reconciled to God through Jesus. That means we are in harmony and are friendly with God right now. He isn&rsquo;t mad; He&rsquo;s not even in a bad mood. The war between God and man is over. That&rsquo;s what the angels proclaimed at the birth of Jesus.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Luke 2:14 says,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">These angels weren&rsquo;t saying that peace would reign on earth and that wars between people would cease. That certainly hasn&rsquo;t happened. They were proclaiming the end of war between God and man. Jesus paid a price that was infinitely greater than the sins of the whole human race.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">God&rsquo;s wrath and justice have been satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span class="cs3BC4135E">Jesus changed everything. God isn&rsquo;t angry. </span><span class="csE613E19A">His mercy extends to all people. He loves the world, not just the church, but the whole world. He paid for all sin.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The Scriptures say in 1 John 2:2,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">In the Old Testament, God&rsquo;s judgment was poured out on both individuals and nations. In the New Testament,&nbsp;</span><span class="cs3BC4135E">God&rsquo;s judgment was poured out on Jesus. That is the nearly-too-good-to-be-true news of the Gospel. </span><span class="csE613E19A">We no longer get what we deserve; we get what Jesus paid the price for, if we will only believe.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Before I understood this, I would say, &ldquo;If God doesn&rsquo;t judge America, He will have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah.&rdquo; Now I say, &ldquo;If God judges America, He will have to apologize to Jesus.&rdquo; Understanding what Jesus did completely changes our perspective.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">Second, Jesus is now the Mediator. </span><span class="csE613E19A">A mediator is one who seeks to reconcile, or make peace between, two opposing parties. In the Old Testament, man had not yet been reconciled to God through Jesus. The people needed a mediator, someone to intercede with God on their behalf. That is where we find people like Abraham and Moses pleading with God.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">In Genesis 18:23-25, Abraham interceded with God on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah:</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">In fact, Abraham actually negotiated with God until He agreed not to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for the sake of ten righteous people. But there weren&rsquo;t ten righteous people in the whole city, and only some of Lot&rsquo;s family survived. A similar account is recorded in Exodus 32:9-12 and 14. Here God was furious with the people, and Moses interceded for them:</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;The LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people&hellip;And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Moses actually told God, &ldquo;Repent!&rdquo; What nerve! What&rsquo;s more amazing is that God repented. From these and other stories in the Old Testament,&nbsp;</span><span class="cs3BC4135E">modern-day &ldquo;intercessors&rdquo; believe we, too, must stand in the gap, or mediate, between God and man.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> Just as I did decades ago, they believe we must plead with God to save the lost, to withhold His wrath from those He is ready to judge, and to be merciful to those whose needs He is unwilling to meet because of their unworthiness.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">That couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth</span><span class="csE613E19A">, but it is what&rsquo;s being taught in many churches today. It ignores the fact that Jesus is now seated at the right hand of the Father (Heb. 10:12), ever making intercession for us (Heb. 7:25). If Moses or Abraham could persuade God, don&rsquo;t you think Jesus could do at least as well?</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">In 1 Timothy 2:5, we read,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">In the New Covenant, Jesus is the ONLY mediator</span><span class="csE613E19A"> needed to stand between God the Father and mankind.&nbsp;</span><span class="cs3BC4135E">Sin is no longer a problem with God</span><span class="csE613E19A">; it&rsquo;s been atoned for, and we are now the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. That is how God sees us. If we understand that, it will change the way we pray.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">It was appropriate for Abraham and Moses to pray as they did because God&rsquo;s wrath had not yet been appeased through Jesus. Today, under the New Covenant, if people try to mediate in that way, they are actually antichrist&mdash;against Christ. They are saying that Jesus was not enough and are not esteeming what Christ has done.&nbsp;</span><span class="cs3BC4135E">When Jesus became our Mediator, He put all other mediators out of business&mdash;forever.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> I know these words are strong, but they are the truth.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Satan is behind much of the wrong teaching on &ldquo;prayer.&rdquo; Consider how crafty his plan is and the fruit it produces. He has convinced believers to stay in their closets, taking the place of Jesus in intercession. They spend hours pleading with God to turn from His wrath, to pour out His Spirit, and to meet the needs of the people.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Meanwhile, families, coworkers, and neighbors are going to hell and dying from disease. The Bible doesn&rsquo;t say that salvation comes through intercession, but by the foolishness of preaching (1 Cor. 1:21). And we are not told to pray for the sick, but to heal the sick (Matt. 10:8) by commanding healing into their broken bodies.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">We have been deceived into believing prayer is all about persuading God to release His power.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> We believe He can save, heal, and deliver but that He is waiting on us to shape up and earn it. The truth is, we don&rsquo;t deserve it, and we will never be good enough. Because of Jesus, all that God has is ours. That&rsquo;s good news. We no longer need to beg or plead; we need to exercise the authority He has given us and receive His blessings.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><div style="float:left;margin:2.25pt 2.25pt 2.25pt 2.25pt;width:128.25pt;height:130.5pt;">

		<span class="cs3BC4135E">There really is a better way to pray. </span><span class="csE613E19A">I am not saying it&rsquo;s the only way, but it is working for me.

		<p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This is one of my favourite verses ever. Everyone should memorize this verse in my opinion, it is so powerful. It is life changing truth.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Paul starts by saying &ldquo;I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The Greek word for ashamed is the word </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">epaischynomai </span><span class="csE613E19A">which means guilty, disgraced and embarassed. How do we feel about the good news of Jesus Christ? Are we disgraced by it? Does it embarass us?</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">I think it often does embarass us. I am not talking about not sharing the gospel and being afraid to share the gospel &ndash; you should never be afraid to tell people the good news. I think that the gospel embarasses us as Christians because it is a message of entire grace and no merit.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The gospel (Gk. </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">euaggelion</span><span class="csE613E19A">) is the good news of Christ. It is the truth that we don&rsquo;t have to be spiritually dead, we don&rsquo;t have to be sick, we don&rsquo;t have to be poor, we don&rsquo;t have to be rejected because of the redemptive work of Christ on the cross.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">I think Christians are embarassed of the gospel because it is so unbelievable &ndash; as Andrew Wommack calls it, it is the &ldquo;too good to be true news&rdquo;. So what we do is add a little to the gospel to make it more acceptable and less embarassing: you have to go to church for it to work, you have to be a good person, you have to change, you have to pray for this long. None of this is the gospel &ndash; the gospel is that we are redeemed, we are righteous, we are healthy, we are wealthy because of Jesus Christ and because of His goodness and His brilliance.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Stop being embarassed of the gospel. Tell people the truth: Jesus Christ has done it all. Jesus has paid the price for every sin you have ever committed, ever will commit, and you are free in Him if you believe in Him. You are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This gospel &ndash; this news that it is all Jesus and not our works, not our righteousness, not our attitudes, but His redemptive work on the cross &ndash; this gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This is the most important truth you can ever, ever receive: the power of God is in the good news that Jesus has completely paid the price for us.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The power of God is not in fasting. The power of God is not in prayer. The power of God is certainly not in binding demons and screaming in tongues for hours. The power of God is not in our holiness. The power of God is not in special people &ndash; charismatic superstars.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The power of God is in the gospel &ndash; the good news that Jesus paid the price.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">If you know someone who needs healing, you don&rsquo;t need to pray and fast. You don&rsquo;t need to bind the devil, you don&rsquo;t need to drag them to a crusade.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">You need to tell them the good news. You need to tell them the truth that Jesus Christ has completely paid the price for their healing. The power of God is in the good news.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Don&rsquo;t be embarassed about the good news. Tell people they can be healed &ndash; not because of their merit, but because of Jesus. Tell people they can be wealthy because of Jesus &ndash; not because of their background or any other reason. Tell people that they can be righteous because of Jesus &ndash; not due to their actions, their prayer life, their anything! It is all Jesus.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The power is only in what Jesus has done. It is not anywhere else. If we don&rsquo;t tell people boldly that Jesus has done it all, then we will not see the power of God.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This is why the church at large does not see the power of God. Galatians 3 says that we see miracles because of grace and faith, not works of the law. We have made miracles subject to our holiness, to our goodness. We have told people that they need to clean up their lives to see the goodness of God, to see healings, to see wealth, to see salvation, to be righteous.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">It is all untrue &ndash; in fact, Paul calls it witchcraft in Galatians 3. It is witchcraft to say that you need to do something to be saved other than believe in Christ and His redemptive work.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Get out of witchcraft, and get into the gospel. Stop being embarassed about the gospel and tell people boldly that Jesus has done it all. Then you will see the power of God &ndash; you will see people born again, people healed, people released from poverty, from shame, from rejection. You will see people who used to hold their heads down low lift them high, their entire faces will change as the gospel renews their mind.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Stop trying to find the power of God where it is not. Stop being embarassed that Jesus has done it all and you have done nothing, are nothing and deserve nothing without Him! Admit it &ndash; you are nothing without Christ. You can do nothing without Christ. You deserve nothing without Christ.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Christ has done it all &ndash; paid the total price so we, and the world, can be righteous, can be saved, can be accepted, can be loved, can be redeemed, can be joyous, can be healed, can be happy, can work miracles, can enjoy life in abundance. It is all HIM!</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">All we have to do to enjoy salvation (which in the Greek means healing, peace and prosperity) is believe. That is the greatest truth in the Bible. It is the most wonderful truth in the universe. That is the most important truth you can ever realize.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861">Posted in <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/category/run-through-the-bible/romans-verse-by-verse/" title="View all posts in Romans Verse by Verse"><span class="csCD76006D">Romans Verse by Verse</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/category/run-through-the-bible/" title="View all posts in Run Through the Bible"><span class="csCD76006D">Run Through the Bible</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | Tagged <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/andrew-wommack/"><span class="csCD76006D">Andrew Wommack</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/believeth/"><span class="csCD76006D">believeth</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/christian/"><span class="csCD76006D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/embarassed/"><span class="csCD76006D">embarassed</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/epaischynomai/"><span class="csCD76006D">epaischynomai</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/good-news/"><span class="csCD76006D">Good News</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/gospel/"><span class="csCD76006D">Gospel</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/gospel-of-christ/"><span class="csCD76006D">gospel of Christ</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/greek/"><span class="csCD76006D">Greek</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/healing/"><span class="csCD76006D">healing</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/jew/"><span class="csCD76006D">Jew</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/life-changing/"><span class="csCD76006D">life changing</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/power/"><span class="csCD76006D">Power</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/salvation/"><span class="csCD76006D">salvation</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2009/09/13/romans-1-16/#respond" title="Comment on Romans 1.16"><span class="csCD76006D">Leave a comment</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2009/08/17/gods-word-the-seed-of-his-blessing-by-andrew-wommack/" title="12:11 am"><span class="cs2449679F">August 17, 2009</span></a></span><span class="cs70DEDCF8"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/author/treeoflifelondon/" title="View all posts by treeoflifelondon"></a> </span></p><h1 class="csC5ACDC54">

		<p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">A true revelation of God&rsquo;s Word is the single most important element of a victorious Christian life. </span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">The Word of God often refers to itself as a seed. </span><span class="csE613E19A">There are a total of forty-four verses in the New Testament where the Greek word &ldquo;sperma&rdquo; was translated &ldquo;seed.&rdquo; This is the same word from which we derive our English word &ldquo;sperm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">To conceive and give birth to the miracles you need, you must first plant God&rsquo;s Word like a seed in your heart. </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">Conception cannot take place without first planting the seed. </span><span class="csE613E19A">There has only been one virgin birth, and the birth of you&rsquo;re miracle won&rsquo;t be the second.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">I constantly meet Christians who pray and believe for God&rsquo;s intervention in their lives, but remain frustrated with the results. It&rsquo;s because </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">they are missing the seeds of conception; they just don&rsquo;t know God&rsquo;s Word</span><span class="csE613E19A">.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">In Mark 4, the Lord taught three parables which illustrate that the Word is to the kingdom of God what a natural seed is to a harvest. The first of these parables, the story of the sower, is the key to unlocking all the Word of God (Mark 4:13). If we don&rsquo;t understand these truths, Jesus said we won&rsquo;t understand any of His other parables.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">There are many life-changing truths in these parables, but one fact must be understood to get the full benefit of this teaching. The Lord used the comparison of His Word to a law of nature that is unchangeable, not an institution of man.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Here&rsquo;s what I mean. </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">You can cheat or manipulate nearly all systems that men have created.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> The legal system can be beaten, letting the guilty go free. Our educational system can be beaten, passing students who haven&rsquo;t really learned the material. </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">But you can&rsquo;t change seedtime and harvest.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">What if a farmer waited until he saw his neighbors reaping their crops before he sowed for his crop? Regardless of how sincere he was, or the justification for not sowing his seed at the proper time, he would not reap a crop overnight. </span><span class="csD14FFDD7">The law of seedtime and harvest cannot be violated</span><span class="csE613E19A">.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This is why our Lord chose to compare the way His Word works to a seed. There is a germination process of the Word of God in your life that takes time and can&rsquo;t be avoided. In the second parable of</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Mark 4, Jesus said in verses 26-29,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">The seed is the Word of God (verse 14), and the ground is our hearts (verse 15).</span><span class="csE613E19A"> Our hearts were created by God to bring forth fruit when His Word is planted in them. Just as a seed has to remain in the ground over time to germinate, so the Word of God has to abide in us.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Jesus said in John 15:7,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">What would happen if you planted a seed in your garden and then dug it up each morning to see if anything was happening? It would die and never produce fruit. You have to have faith that the seed is doing what God created it to do.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Some people put God&rsquo;s Word in their hearts for a day or two, but </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">if they don&rsquo;t see fruit almost immediately, they dig up the seed through their words and actions</span><span class="csE613E19A"> and wonder why it didn&rsquo;t work. You have to leave it in the ground over time. Then, there are also different stages of growth.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Mark 4:28 says,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Many people are impatient, wanting to bypass the growth cycle and get the full ear right now. I&rsquo;ve actually had to tell people that what they were believing God for was not going to happen, not because the vision wasn&rsquo;t good, but because they were expecting a complete ear of corn immediately.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">For example, one of our Charis Bible College students came to me who had never held a job, had been in a mental hospital, and had lived on welfare his whole life. When he heard the teaching on prosperity and vision, he started dreaming big. He had a plan to buy and renovate an old hotel. The total cost would be over four million dollars.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">It really was a grand plan. I complimented him for the fact that he was dreaming and told him to keep dreaming big. Then I told him that it might work for someone but it wouldn&rsquo;t work for him. Why? Because this person had never believed for a dime before. There has to be </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">You may think that&rsquo;s not so. It&rsquo;s possible that he could have won the lottery or the </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">Publisher&rsquo;s Clearing House Sweepstakes.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> It&rsquo;s possible, but that wouldn&rsquo;t have been God. God&rsquo;s kingdom operates on laws, like the laws that govern the fruit-bearing process of a seed. </span><span class="csD14FFDD7">God will not give you the full ear of corn if you haven&rsquo;t seen the first blade</span><span class="csE613E19A">.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">That&rsquo;s the way God&rsquo;s kingdom works. And </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">this is precisely the reason most people don&rsquo;t see God&rsquo;s best come to pass in their lives</span><span class="csE613E19A">. They think that since God loves them, He will just grant their request regardless of whether they put the miracle of the seed to work or not.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Look at what happened after Jesus taught His disciples these principles of the seed.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Mark 4:35 says,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">In a sense, Jesus was giving them a test. On the same day that He taught them the principles of God&rsquo;s Word as a seed, He gave them a seed. He said, </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Let us pass over unto the other side.&rdquo;</span><span class="csE613E19A"> He didn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Let us go halfway across and drown.&rdquo; The disciples had a seed from the lips of the Creator that gave them authority over the creation.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">What happened? A two-hour trip turned into a fight for the disciples&rsquo; lives. Instead of using the seed the Lord had given them, they did all they knew to do in the natural and then got put out with the Lord.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">They said in verse 38,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Master, carest thou not that we perish?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This wasn&rsquo;t a cabin cruiser. Jesus was in an open boat full of water (verse 37) sloshing all around Him. He was well aware of their plight and yet was trying to sleep. They wanted Him to pick up a bucket and bail or row or do something.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">How did Jesus respond? Did He apologize and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry guys. I was really tired&rdquo;? No!</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Instead He said, </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?&rdquo;</span><span class="csE613E19A"> (verse 40).</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Jesus was telling them that they should have stilled the storm. </span><span class="csD14FFDD7">If they would have operated in faith instead of fear, that&rsquo;s exactly what they could have done</span><span class="csE613E19A">.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">The Lord did His job by giving them the seed of His Word.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> Their job was to take the seed and make it work. Instead, they doubted Jesus&rsquo; love for them and thought He wasn&rsquo;t pulling His weight. Likewise, we often complain to the Lord, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t You love me? Why aren&rsquo;t You healing me or prospering me, etc.?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">God has done His part; He has given us the Word. For example, the Lord doesn&rsquo;t give us money directly. Deuteronomy 8:18 says that the Lord gives us the power to get wealth. </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">The power is in His promises, His Word.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> As we plant those promises in our hearts, the truth of His Word germinates and prosperity comes.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Healing operates the same way. There are numerous scriptures that get the point across that God&rsquo;s Word is health to all our flesh. Here&rsquo;s two:</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh&rdquo;</span><span class="csE613E19A"> (Prov. 4:22).</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions&rdquo; </span><span class="csE613E19A">(Ps. 107:20).</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Yes, a person can get healed without planting God&rsquo;s Word in their heart. It comes through the prayers of others with the gifts of healing (1 Cor. 12:9), but it is not God&rsquo;s best. We should never be too proud to ask for help, but </span><span class="csD14FFDD7">the proper way to get healed is to take God&rsquo;s promises of healing and plant them in our hearts until they release their life-giving power into our physical bodies</span><span class="csE613E19A">.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">This law of seedtime and harvest operates in every area of our lives.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> If we will plant God&rsquo;s Word in our hearts, then allow the seed to germinate and the plant to grow to maturity, we will reap the fruit of a harvest. That is God&rsquo;s best!</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs3BC4135E">I cannot tell you strongly enough how important it is that you know God&rsquo;s Word and that you plant the seed of His Word</span><span class="csE613E19A"> in your heart long before you need the fruit of the harvest. </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">It could mean the difference between prosperity and poverty, or even life and death. </span><span class="csE613E19A">I believe this is so important that it&rsquo;s the very first class I teach to new students at CBC every year.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csD14FFDD7">My teaching series </span><span class="cs5AFB93E">A Sure Foundation</span><span class="csD14FFDD7"> will help you understand the power and importance of God&rsquo;s Word in your life. It will help you go beyond the &ldquo;touchy-feely,&rdquo; emotion-based thinking that many mistake for faith. It&rsquo;s not about what you feel; it&rsquo;s about what has been planted in your heart and come to full fruit. It&rsquo;s the foundation to receiving the promises of God</span><span class="csE613E19A">.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">So, make this year your personal </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">Year of the Bible</span><span class="csE613E19A"> and build a sure foundation in your own life. It will be the best decision you have ever made.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861">Posted in <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/category/biblical-teaching/" title="View all posts in Biblical Teaching"><span class="csCD76006D">Biblical Teaching</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | Tagged <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/andrew-wommack/"><span class="csCD76006D">Andrew Wommack</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/blessing/"><span class="csCD76006D">blessing</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/gods-word/"><span class="csCD76006D">God&#39;s Word</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/harvest-time/"><span class="csCD76006D">harvest time</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/mark-4/"><span class="csCD76006D">Mark 4</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/seed/"><span class="csCD76006D">seed</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/seed-faith/"><span class="csCD76006D">Seed Faith</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/seedtime/"><span class="csCD76006D">seedtime</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/study-of-the-word/"><span class="csCD76006D">study of the Word</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861">, <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/tag/the-sower-sows-the-word/"><span class="csCD76006D">the sower sows the word</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> | <a class="cs746B3A72" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2009/08/17/gods-word-the-seed-of-his-blessing-by-andrew-wommack/#respond" title="Comment on God’s Word – The Seed Of His Blessing (By Andrew Wommack)"><span class="csCD76006D">Leave a comment</span></a></span><span class="cs56E42861"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs56E42861"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/2009/08/08/grace-and-faith-camp-2010/" title="12:01 pm"><span class="cs2449679F">August 8, 2009</span></a></span><span class="cs70DEDCF8"><a class="csC936271F" href="http://treeoflifeblog.com/author/treeoflifelondon/" title="View all posts by treeoflifelondon"></a> </span></p><h1 class="csC5ACDC54">

		<p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Did you know that most Christians still believe their relationship with God is dependent on their performance? They believe answered prayers and God&rsquo;s blessing in their lives are in direct proportion to their holiness and ability to overcome sin. If they attend church, pay their tithes, read their Bibles, and control their flesh, they have somehow earned the blessing of God.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">That may sound reasonable at first, but that line of thinking will destroy your confidence in God and couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. The truth is, sin isn&rsquo;t even an issue with God. That may seem like a radical statement, but it is exactly what the Word teaches. Romans 3:4 says,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">When Jesus came on the scene, one of the first things He had to do was counter all the religious traditions and doctrines of His day. Paul recognized the same problem. He said in Romans 10:2-3,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Just because people are zealous or religious does not mean what they believe is correct. One of the most misunderstood doctrines in the Bible is what really happened when Jesus came to earth, fulfilled the Law, and was sacrificed for our sins. When He said in John 19:30 </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo;</span><span class="csE613E19A"> everything changed.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Jesus forever changed the way God relates to mankind. Sure, there are scriptural examples of God&rsquo;s catastrophic judgment on sin. But God&rsquo;s greatest act of judgment was when He placed His entire wrath upon Jesus for our sins. This forever satisfied God&rsquo;s wrath. Since that time, God hasn&rsquo;t been judging our sins (2 Cor. 5:19). God&rsquo;s not angry with us; He&rsquo;s not even in a bad mood.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Look at the angels&rsquo; joy at the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. Luke 2:13-14 says,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">This scripture is very familiar to many, yet there is a lot of misunderstanding about what it&rsquo;s saying. Some translations say they were proclaiming &ldquo;good will among men&rdquo; or &ldquo;peace to men of good will.&rdquo; Basically, this passage has been interpreted that Jesus was bringing peace on earth among people. But that&rsquo;s not why these angels were praising God. If that interpretation were true, then Jesus&rsquo; own words in Matthew 10:34-36 would contradict this. He said,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man&rsquo;s foes shall be they of his own household.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Jesus Himself said He was not sent to bring peace on the earth among people. The peace that the angels were praising God for (Luke 2:13-14) was peace BETWEEN God and man. They were announcing the end of God&rsquo;s war on sin. Peace now reigns between God and man.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Prior to Jesus&rsquo; coming, God&rsquo;s wrath was against man for his sins. It wasn&rsquo;t total wrath. Even in the Old Testament, we see God&rsquo;s mercy and grace. Yet the Old Testament Law was a ministry of wrath (Rom. 4:15; 2 Cor. 3:7, and 9), and man&rsquo;s sins were held against him. But when Jesus came, God quit holding man&rsquo;s sins against him. This is exactly what 2 Corinthians 5:19 and 21 say,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation&hellip;For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">The word &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; is talking about making peace. God was no longer holding us accountable. Instead, He imputed our sins to Jesus, making Jesus accountable for our sins. Jesus became what we were so we could become what He was&mdash;the righteousness of God.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Jesus was like a lightning rod that drew all the judgment of God unto Himself. He not only bore our sins; He actually became sin (2 Cor. 5:21). Jesus said in John 12:27-32:</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Many have thought John 12:32 means that if God is properly glorified in our preaching, then He will draw all people to Himself. But that is not what this scripture is saying.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">If you look in the </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">King James Version</span><span class="csE613E19A">, notice that the word &ldquo;men&rdquo; in verse 32 is italicized. That means it wasn&rsquo;t in the original language. The translators put this word in italics to let people know this was their addition, but it wasn&rsquo;t a part of the text. If you take this verse in context, I believe the Lord was saying that He would draw all JUDGMENT to Himself. Jesus, like a lightning rod, attracted all of God&rsquo;s judgment for all of mankind&rsquo;s sins for all time unto Himself.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">All the murder, all the perversion, every vile and rotten sin imaginable, all sickness, and all disease ever known to mankind actually entered into His physical human body. Isaiah 52:14 talks about the crucifixion of Jesus and says that He was marred more than any man, to the point that He was unrecognizable as a human being.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">That could not have happened just from physical beatings, especially since the Word says that not a single bone was broken in His body (Ps. 34:20 with John 19:36). I believe His body was completely disfigured from cancers, tumors, diseases, deformities, and anything else that human beings have ever suffered.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Jesus didn&rsquo;t ask for the cup to be taken from Him just because of the physical pain He would suffer, but because He did not want to become sin. He hated becoming what He came to redeem us from. And the worst of all Jesus&rsquo; sufferings was total rejection from His Father. Matthew 27:46 says,</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="cs8F1CF677">&ldquo;And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">God the Father forsook Jesus so that you and I would never be forsaken. All that we would have suffered through billions of years in eternity&mdash;the grief, the pain, and worst of all, the complete separation from the presence of God&mdash;Jesus experienced. And He experienced all of this for us. The judgment was made and the sentence carried out. The price was paid in full, once for all.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">When we say God is still judging us for our sins as individuals or corporately as a nation, we are saying that the price Jesus paid wasn&rsquo;t enough. Therefore, a judgment must again be made and a sentence passed. That would be &ldquo;double jeopardy,&rdquo; and that is not what the Bible teaches.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">Some of you may not like this, but it&rsquo;s true. Sin isn&rsquo;t a problem with God anymore. It&rsquo;s the church that has made it a major deal. Neither past, present, nor future sins can separate us from God. The only people who will go to hell are those who have spurned and rejected the greatest sacrifice that has ever been made. In heaven, we won&rsquo;t answer for our individual sins; Jesus already has. We will answer for our acceptance or rejection of Jesus.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">You might now be thinking, </span><span class="cs8F1CF677">You&rsquo;re just giving people a license to sin.</span><span class="csE613E19A"> Well, it seems to me that people are doing a pretty good job of that without a license. What I&rsquo;m saying will not free you to sin; it will free you from the condemnation and the guilt that comes when you do sin.</span></p><p class="csAFC56F56"><span class="csE613E19A">To continue in sin is just stupid. You&rsquo;ll be opening the door for Satan to have an inroad into your life (Rom. 6:16). If you sin, you will suffer the natural consequences of it, but it will not be because of the judgment of God.</span></p></body>
