Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father&#39;s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 And his brethren went to feed their father&#39;s flock in Shechem.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian&#39;s house for Joseph&#39;s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 And he left all that he had in Joseph&#39;s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat.
