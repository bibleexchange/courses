			<span class="cs821257DA">America is in a Spiritual and Moral Crisis</span></h2>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">America&rsquo;s foundation is Christian, We as Americans have a Christian heritage, Many in America are rebelliously degenerating into a godless society. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The professing church in America, is powerless to stop and redirect the rushing secular currents. Mired in a spiritual and moral crisis, America&#39;s only hope is a national revival, like God has graciously bestowed in the past. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">From the beginning, Christian values ingrained America&#39;s political and social fabric. Its democratic form of government was founded on faith in God. To this day United States currency bears the inscription, &quot;In God We Trust.&quot; America flourished while Christianity permeated all aspects of life, including the laws, education, and culture. </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6B7F7C6"><span class="cs821257DA">The thought of the Removal of God is a disgrace</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The powers in America are rejecting God and His ways. Federal courts have re-interpreting our constitution as requiring the Bible, prayer and religious discussion be removed from classrooms, community buildings and places of public gatherings. Government officials and educators across the country are disgracefully trying to eliminate God from society. Militant secularists have vowed, not be satisfied until God is erased from every facet of American life. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">American laws are being reinterpreted and rewritten to sanction what is abominable to a holy God. In 1973 the Supreme Court legalized abortion for any reason, and Congress subsequently passed a law providing government funds for such barbarous acts. Old laws making homosexual practices criminal are being repealed, and new legislation is being enacted requiring society to support such deathstyles. While religious discussion is gagged, pornography is permitted to saturate our culture. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Our society is fast becoming openly hostile to Christian values. The media trivializes and ridicules Christianity in the name of humanistic and pluralistic concerns. American culture is dominated by television and movies, whose profanity and lewdness tramp God&#39;s honor into the mud, inculcating non -Christian values from infancy. Public schools teach our children how to practice various forms of immorality. One school curriculum in America teaches acceptance of homosexuality in the first grade and immoral acts in junior high. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">America is reaping the dire consequences of rejecting God. Our society is morally bankrupt, and the problems resist government cures. William J. Bennet, in his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, </span><span class="csC05134DD">provides the following statistics for the past 30 years. Despite increased funding and stricter laws, violent crime has increased more than 500 percent. While sex education programs have boomed, illegitimate births have increased over 400 percent, significantly among teenagers. The divorce rate has multiplied, and single parent homes have become the majority. Our young people today exhibit a hopelessness, with a more than 200 percent increase in the teenage suicide rate. And America appears helpless before its great problems. </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6B7F7C6"><span class="csC05134DD">The church backsliding is a disgrace</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs17F7BAC2"><span class="csC05134DD">The church in America, despite its many activities and apparent successfulness, has had no measurable affect in reversing this downward spiral. No country has had more Christian organizations, more radio stations, more books, more seminars, and more churches with proportionately less impact on society. It is a disgrace when researchers tell us that religion is up but morality is down. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Sadly, the influence has been in the wrong direction, as we see evidence that our culture has begun to permeate our churches. The church is seduced by the social agenda of wealth and pleasure, and has condoned sinful compromises. There is moral decay within the church, with highly publicized scandals involving ministers, and divorce statistics which are not much better than those outside the church. Think of all that we and our churches would have to repent of if a spirit of holiness began to captivate us. How can America be influenced by an inconsistent and hypocritical church? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">If the strength of the church should be determined by its impact on its surrounding culture, we desperately need an injection of spiritual life. The present powerlessness of the church may be a sign that God has withdrawn His blessing that we might seek Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs821257DA">A National Revival Needed. </span><span class="csC05134DD">There is reason to believe that only a national revival can pull us out of the ditch into which we have slid. I am convinced &nbsp;as all of us must be &nbsp;that every human resource is now inadequate and only the direct intervention of God can reverse our country&#39;s spiritual decay. If America will really be given another chance, at least some kingdoms of darkness will have to fall like dominoes. That can only happen if God chooses to show us the mercy we most assuredly do not deserve. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">America has experienced three great periods of revival in the previous two centuries, during which all of society was dramatically affected. There was a widespread restoration of the people of God, that resulted in tens of thousands of conversions greatly affecting the culture of the day. America returned to its Christian roots. Taverns were closed, families were reconciled, and young people became sober in their pursuit of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">From our past, we learn the clear lesson that a genuine spiritual revival can do more to transform culture than all of our political/social activism. We need a renewal that can only be effected by widespread repentance before the Almighty whom we have so grievously offended. The forces of evil are so deeply entrenched that any cultural shifts will only be cosmetic unless they are accompanied by a spiritual awakening that affects large segments of our population. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">When Ephesus experienced revival, the people brought their occult books and artifacts, and publicly burned them (Acts 19:18-19). What bonfires of pornography, rock music, artifacts, and books of occultism we would have if God&#39;s presence was manifestly felt! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs821257DA">There is Hope. </span><span class="csC05134DD">Revival is possible as long as God is God. Jonathan Edwards, a leader during the First Great Awakening in America, argued that God grants light when the darkness is the greatest, and it was in just such times that the glorious periods of revival occurred in America&#39;s history. When there was disinterest in religion, gross immorality and rampant unbelief, God poured out His undeserved gracious blessing. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Catch the vision of crowded churches from coast to coast, shops closing during the noon hours for special prayer, and our legislators turning to God for wisdom in making decisions. Think of the nightly news telling the story of tens of thousands of believers making restitution for past wrongs, and reports of thousands of conversions to Christ. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Imagine a country where abortion would become rare, not just through legislation but because mothers valued their children and immorality was on the decline. Imagine a country in which homosexuals repented and sought God for help in overcoming their deathstyles rather than imposing their immorality on society. Imagine a country where the courts would reflect America&#39;s Christian roots. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">We must believe God for something more than our generation has seen. May our sights be raised and our faith increased, to fervently seek God for a national revival. What God has done in the past, He can do again! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs87110596">Josiah and the people immediately launched a major reform</span><span class="csC05134DD"> throughout the nation. Never in history has a reformation of such magnitude been witnessed. Not only was Judah affected, but the reformation also swept throughout the land of the old Northern Kingdom of Israel. </span><span class="csD04A7434">14</span><span class="csC05134DD"> specific reforms are mentioned by Scripture.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

For over 75 years the feast had been neglected, and no one had celebrated the Lord&#39;s wonderful deliverance. But now Josiah reinstituted the feast that God had commanded the people to celebrate annually in remembrance of their deliverance </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Josiah gave only one very important instruction regarding the feast: the Passover was to be carried out exactly as God&#39;s Word said. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">The result of Josiah&#39;s charge: this was the first Passover celebrated correctly&mdash;exactly as God&#39;s Word dictated&mdash;since the days of the Judges (2&nbsp;Kings 23:21-22).

In his zeal for the Lord, he was determined to obey the Word of God and its commandments to the fullest. As a result, note what Scripture says about him: his commitment to obey God&#39;s Word was unparalleled (2&nbsp;Kings 23:25). He sought to obey the Lord wholeheartedly, with more zeal than any other king who had ever lived.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;Josiah had a concern for true belief, a concern that people would trust the only living and true God. When dealing with truth, there is only one living and true God&mdash;the Lord God Himself (Jehovah, Yahweh). All other so-called gods are false, only the creations of peoples&#39; minds and imaginations. These imaginary gods are not living, are not able to help us nor respond to us. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">No other god can answer our prayers, except the Lord Himself. Only the Lord has loved the world so much that He sent His Son to take our sins upon Himself and to bear the punishment for those sins. Only the Lord has redeemed us, paid the ransom price to set us free from sin, death, and hell&mdash;through sending His Son to die in our place. Only the Lord has given His own Son to bear the punishment of our sin so that we might live with God and for Him eternally. No so-called god has ever demonstrated such an incomprehensible love for us. Only the Lord has demonstrated such love. And He did it to prove that He is the only living and true God. For this reason, no human being has an excuse for living in unbelief. If a person chooses to reject the Lord as the only living and true God, he will suffer the consequences of his decision, will bear the punishment for his own sin.</span></p><p class="csC9D7C422"><span class="csC05134DD">Listen to God&#39;s Holy Word the Lord is the only living and true God:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs87110596">He turned not from His wrath</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">2Ki 23:26 Notwithstanding </span><span class="csD04A7434">the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath</span><span class="csC05134DD">, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;27 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;29 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre.

For centuries, the wickedness of the people had accumulated to such a degree that they would never genuinely turn to the Lord, not consistently and not permanently. Because of all the wickedness down through the centuries and especially under Manasseh , the anger of the Lord had been aroused (2&nbsp;Kings 21:1-18). As a result, the fatal judgment of God was to fall upon the nation. They were to be removed from God&#39;s presence, from the promised land, just as the Northern Kingdom of Israel had been removed. The city that God had chosen, Jerusalem, and the temple upon which God had said He would put His Name were both now rejected by the Lord and would be destroyed.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">After Josiah&#39;s death at the Battle of Megiddo, his body was brought back to Jerusalem where he was buried in his own tomb (2&nbsp;Kings 23:30).

They refused to be genuinely converted, refused to consistently and continually walk with the Lord. Disobeying the commandments of God, they lived lives of worldly pleasure, immorality, lawlessness, and violence. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">As a result, God had no choice but to bring His judgment upon them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">So it is with us if we continue in sin and wickedness. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">When we refuse to be genuinely converted, never turning to the Lord, we condemn ourselves. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We choose the judgment of God instead of the mercy of God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">God&#39;s mercy is available to us, but if we reject His mercy, justice has to be executed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We must face the hour of God&#39;s justice due to all the sin and wickedness of this earth committed by us&mdash;all the bitterness, anger, hatred, assaults, abuses, rapes, and murders. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">The day of judgment&mdash;that day when perfect justice will be executed&mdash;is coming.
