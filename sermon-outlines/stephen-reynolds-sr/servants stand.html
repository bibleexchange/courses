		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA7555675">People began to respect the truth </span><span class="csDA02FF29">displayed in Wycliffe&#39;s life</span><span class="csA7555675">, yet his enemies still raged fiercely against him. He was honored nationwide. Feeling threatened, the pope and his supporters were greatly upset by his works. In 1377, John Wycliffe was called before the Bishop of London. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of Wycliffe&#39;s influential friends traveled with him to the hearing. The bishop began arguing with one of Wycliffe&#39;s friends and the chaotic situation soon forced the trial to be closed. One year later, in April of 1378, Wycliffe was called to another trial. God&#39;s hand was upon His servant, for in the middle if the trial, a message from the queen mother was delivered, stating that Wycliffe should not be harmed, and the trial was closed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Wycliffe became very ill. Wishful friars, hoping to hear some death-bed recanting of his beliefs, hurriedly arrived at his bedside, only to hear the bold words of faith &quot;I shall not die, but live, and declare the evil deeds of the friars.&quot; This statement proved to be true, and Wycliffe was restored to health. &nbsp;The third trial was in 1382, Wycliffe appeared before the Bishop of London. God was angry that men would again try to harm his servant, so this time, He caused the earth to shake. Though he was condemned at this trial, God&#39;s mighty hand was displayed and he was not harmed for the rest of his life. Wycliffe made the decision to return to his home and live the rest of his life </span><span class="csDA02FF29">quietly shining a light to the next generation</span><span class="csA7555675">. Though he was aged, his influence did not end. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA7555675">Wycliffe &nbsp;worked on translating and overseeing &nbsp;the first English Bible . He also trained men to share the gospel and instructed them in the truths of scripture. These followers of Wycliffe who continued his legacy of living with the Word of God as ultimate truth were known as the Lollards. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA7555675">What really separated Wycliffe and the Lollards from the general population of the time was</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA7555675">Wycliffe lived many years before Martin Luther. &nbsp;&nbsp;There was Reformation even in the 1300s. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA7555675">Though </span><span class="cs79659084">John Wycliffe</span><span class="csA7555675"> lived many years before the reformation period, John Wycliffe, a &quot;man ahead of his time&quot;, truly was a &quot;Morning Star of the Reformation.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csA7555675">In 1384, Wycliffe suffered from his second or third stroke and went to be with his Lord. Death did not silence his influence, however. In fact, he had caused such disturbance in the minds and hearts of those who most hated him, that thirty years after his departure, he was officially condemned by the church for a second time</span></p><p class="cs72A88C6"><span class="csA7555675">Instructions were given for his bones to be dug up and burnt as well as his writings, and finally, his ashes thrown into the river. Throwing his ashes into the river turned out to be quite an ironic act, as William Wordsworth explains in his poem on the subject:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/> &nbsp;Wycliffe is disinhumed, Yea his dry bones to ashes are consumed <br/>And flung into the brook which travels near Into the Avon-Avon to the main ocean they- this deed accursed<br/>An emblem yields to friends and enemies<br/>How the bold Teacher&#39;s Doctrine sanctified<br/>By truth, shall throughout the world dispersed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(His influence still lives)</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csBB9A6325">SOLOMON&rsquo;S Servants stood and heard wisdom</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">1Kings 10:4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon&#39;s wisdom, and the house that he had built,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">5 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; </span><span class="csBB9A6325">there was no more spirit in her</span><span class="cs6DA126DA">. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">1Kings 10:8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
