The murder of Abner - II Sam. 3</span><span class="csC05134DD"><br/>David&rsquo;s many wives were chosen in direct violation of Deut. 17:15-17. This undoubtedly led to future family problems. Amnon violated his half-sister Tamar (ch. 13); Absalom rebelled against David and tried to capture the crown (ch. 13-18); and Adonijah tried to wrest the kingdom from Solomon (I Kings 1:5) Abner took one of Saul&rsquo;s concubines and incurred the displeasure of the pretended king. This led to a disruption between Abner and Ishbosheth; Abner tried to make a peaceful agreement with David, but the &ldquo;sons of Zeruiah&rdquo; plotted against him and killed him (vs. 26-30). Joab not only killed Abner, but Absalom (II Sam. 18:14) and Amasa (II Sam. 20). David asked his son Solomon to deal with Joab, and he did (I Kings 2:5-6, 28-34).<br/>With the exception of Uriah, David allowed God to do the killing but was tolerant of Joab which probably contributed to God&rsquo;s evaluation of David&rsquo;s bloody career (I Chron. 22:8).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs821257DA">II. The murder of Ishbosheth - II Sam. 4</span><span class="csC05134DD"><br/>This was the turning point: when Ishbosheth died, the way was wide open for David to rule over the entire nation. However, it must be noted that David did not approve of the method the sons of Rimmon used, and he had the murderers slain for their crime. David knew that God was able to elevate him to the throne; he did not do evil that good might come from it (Rom. 3:8). These three murders are evidence that David&rsquo;s road to the throne was a bloody one. What a contrast to our Saviour Who shed His own blood and not the blood of others to gain His throne.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs821257DA">III. The Throne is secured - II Sam. 5</span><span class="csC05134DD"><br/>David had reigned 7 &frac12; years in Hebron over the tribe of Judah; now he was to reign over the entire nation for 33 years, making a total of over 40 years. Psalm 18 is the appropriate passage that parallels this time frame.<br/>David chooses Jerusalem as his capitol city. This stronghold had not been previously captured (Josh. 15:63; Judges 1:21), and the Jebusites were arrogant and essentially said, &ldquo;The lame and the blind could defeat you.. <br/>(vs. 6) The inference of vs. 8 is that David&rsquo;s army may have gained entrance into the fort through the water system.<br/>No sooner is David established in his own city than the old enemy, the Philistines, return! David knew that the Lord&rsquo;s direction was the only way to victory, so he immediately sought it. The second attack (vs. 22-25) was different from the first, and God led him in a new way. Life is not a series of &ldquo;carbon copies,&rdquo; so we constantly need direction.<br/>It was God&rsquo;s will that David reign over the entire nation, just as it is His will that Jesus Christ reign over all our lives. Any part that is left outside will rebel and cause trouble. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
