<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: I Shall Pray</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Mark 14:32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr 14:1 ¶ After two days was the feast of the passover, and
of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they
might take him by craft, and put him to death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an
uproar of the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr 14:32 ¶ And they came to a place which was named
Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a principle involved here. He not only said it, but
he did it. I SHALL PRAY. Are you looking in your bible and asking the Lord to
help you know what you need to do in the conflicts in your life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.1 death, today is the day we recognize his resurrection
from the dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The realm of the spirit, more and more people are not
understanding the battle getting caught up in the conflict, but Christ’s
example was I SHALL PRAY.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.1 in a time of feast and thanksgiving. A time of rejoicing
and thanksgiving for deliverance out of Egypt and at this time they are
thinking about this Jesus. A mind to destroy life.  Their minds aer turned to
crucifying the Lord, Though not wanting to do it on that day, their day and
cause an uproar with the people. Yet Christ died on the day of the Passover to
fulfill a type. (just as the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost in perfect
type) God is in perfect and complete control. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.26 Mr 14:26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out
into the mount of Olives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Singing hymns, worshipping God, glorifying Him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we see Christ going into gethsemene to pray. They that
sang and rejoiced, could not pray the prayer. Judas was in the temple selling
his own soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a lot of things that we do that we should not be
doing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eight disciples remained outside of the garden. Were not
allowed to enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter James and John were called to a deeply committed life.
A sign to us and to them that we can’t make it unless he calls and deals with
us. And his calling is not free trip. We must be COMMITTED to Him. </p>
