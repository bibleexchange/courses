The eastern gate pointed to Him. Every other possible way has been barred by the righteousness of God but because of the blood of Christ we have a way of approach. The tribe of Judah camped outside the eastern gate, the kingly tribe, and the tribe that means praise. Jesus sits as king with everything under Him. He is Malach Yahweh (The Lord our King). The worship of countless hosts will be unto Him for eternity. The beautiful gate reveals how beautiful Jesus is to behold. He is the altogether lovely One. In Him there are no flaws. He is perfect in character. If we could see His face we would see a look of love that would give us strength forever. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7D251887">John 14:6 Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.</span><span class="cs71C8385E"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7D251887">Rev 5:5 But one of the elders said to me, &quot;Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.&quot;</span><span class="cs71C8385E"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7D251887">Ps 22:28-29 For the kingdom is the LORD&#39;S, and He rules over the nations. All the prosperous of the earth shall eat and worship; all those who go down to the dust shall bow before Him, even he who cannot keep himself alive. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7D251887">Isa 44:6 &quot;Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: &#39;I am the First and I am the Last; besides Me there is no God.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7D251887">Rev 5:11-14 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice: &quot;Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honor and glory and blessing!&quot; And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: &quot;Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!&quot; Then the four living creatures said, &quot;Amen!&quot; And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever. </span></p></body>
