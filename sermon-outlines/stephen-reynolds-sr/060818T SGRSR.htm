God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TEXT: Isaiah 35:2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>John 11-Take ye away the stone, hindrances, they did
not know exactly what COULD be done at this time. If thou wouldest believe,
thou shouldest see the glory of God, then they took away the stone. The Word of
God broke up their unbelief and hesitance. Unbelief will choke out the Word you
do have. The bad apple will always cause the good to rot. The church has not be
challenged to excersise their faith. They pray that someday Good will pour out
and show His glory, but for them to actually wait on God and believe God to do
something at THIS TIME. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Isaiah 32 The hosts of heaven in
position and under His control and direction and authority. Where there is a
Believer no matter what resistance there is, they don’t change the Word any. If
we obey the Word, God will glorify Himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Isaiah 6 The cherubiums job is to
glorify God and magnify His name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>35:2,4 He’ll come with a vengeance
against sin and the wickedness of men. Against the things that hinder your
faith. He will cause brooks and streams to appear in the solitary and desert
places. Beccause of the glory of God and His presence and power. His glory
fills the earth. If we can BELIEVE HIM. Where men believe Him, He manifests His
glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Paul was beaten and his companions,
left with open sores and cast into a prison. They praised God in song at
midnight. They called for a light. Christ is the true light. He asked what must
I do to be saved? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>John 4 Leaving Cana and then
returning, Christ is met by a man requestion help for his son. THY SON LIVETH.
(the word given at the 7<sup>th</sup> hour.) It was believing the Word that
helped Him to believe to see the power of God manifested for his son. He can do
all things. V.53 Himself believed and his house also. He believed and stood
upon the Word. If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God.
This is the work of God that men might believe. John 6:29</p>
