Being so blessed, they began to feel as though they had achieved success by the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">arm of the flesh</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Prosperity flooded the land and the people became comfortable and self-sufficient.

The people would have to suffer the loss of all they had before they would ever realize their need for God&#39;s strength. All sense of self-sufficiency and pride would first have to be wiped out.</span></p><p class="csD71C56D4"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The people would then acknowledge their sin, that they had trusted in false gods and taken refuge in false rocks.

They would realize that they had been trusting in false protection, false shelter and refuge (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+32%3A36-38"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Deut. 32:36-38</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these calamities had come upon the people&mdash;once they had lost all sense of self-sufficiency and pride&mdash;they would then turn to the living and true God. They would see that the Lord (Jehovah, Yahweh) is truly the only living God. There is no god beside Him. It is He alone who holds the power of life and death, sickness and health, victory and deliverance.
