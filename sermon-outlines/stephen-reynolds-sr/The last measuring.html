The Word is compared to a lamp for its </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">illuminating </span><span class="csC05134DD">quality, Psalm 119:105, and to refined silver for its </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">enriching </span><span class="csC05134DD">quality, Psalm 12:6. Among other parts of sacred writ, this is not the least, &quot;If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">These words are dropped from the lips of Christ, the oracle of truth. In the preceding verse, our blessed Savior foretold His suffering, &quot;The Son of Man must suffer many things.&quot; And His suffering is set down in two expressions:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">1. He must be rejected. Thus He was the &quot;stone which the builders rejected,&quot; Psalm 118:22.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">2. He must be slain. This diamond must be </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">cut!</span><span class="csC05134DD"> He who gave life to others, must Himself die. And as Christ thus abased Himself for us&mdash;so we must deny ourselves for Him. &quot;And He said to them all, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF1BA8D25">Self-denial is the foundation of godliness, and if this is not well laid, all the building will fall</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Let me explain the words:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">1. &quot;And He said to them </span><span class="cs821257DA">all</span><span class="csC05134DD">.&quot; Self-denial is of universal extent. It concerns all; it respects both ministers and people. Christ spoke it as well to His apostles as to the rest of His hearers.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">2. &quot;If any man will come after Me.&quot; That is--if he will arrive at that place of glory where I am going--&quot;let him deny himself.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">3. &quot;Let him deny himself.&quot; Beza and Erasmus render it, &quot;Let him lay aside or reject himself.&quot; Self-denial is a kind of self-annihilation.

It carries in it the force of the command. It is as if a king should say, &quot;Let it be enacted.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The PROPOSITION I shall insist on, is that </span><span class="cs821257DA">a true Christian must be a self-denier. </span><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;Let him deny himself.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31A79322"><br/>2. Explanation of the Proposition</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">In what sense must a Christian NOT deny himself?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">1. He must not deny his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">promise</span><span class="csC05134DD">. A man&#39;s promise should be sacred. He is to keep it though it is to his loss, Psalm 15:1,4. He who makes no reckoning of his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">promise</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;God makes no reckoning of his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">profession</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">2. A Christian must not deny his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">grace</span><span class="csC05134DD">. He must not disown any good work wrought in him. He ought not to say that he is a dry tree&mdash;when the dew of heaven lies upon his branches. As it is a sin for a man to make himself better than he is&mdash;so it is to make himself worse. To say he has grace when he has none&mdash;is </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">presumption</span><span class="csC05134DD">. To say he has no grace when he has&mdash;is </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">ingratitude</span><span class="csC05134DD">. It is bearing false witness against the Spirit of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">In what sense MUST a Christian deny himself?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">In general, he must deny that carnal part which is as near to him as himself, that which is as the apple of his eye. But more particularly:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">1. A Christian must deny his REASON. </span><span class="csC05134DD">I do not say renounce it&mdash;but deny it. Some cry up </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">the Diana of reason</span><span class="csC05134DD">, making it the rule and standard of faith. Indeed, that there is a God and that this God is to be worshiped, is a law written in the heart of man and is consonant to reason. But </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">who </span><span class="csC05134DD">God is, and the right mode of worship, is such a sublime matter, that </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">reason </span><span class="csC05134DD">can no more find out&mdash;than the Philistines could Sampson&#39;s riddle. Job 11:7, &quot;Can you by searching find out God?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs93EF3B35">Reason must be denied in DOCTRINES proposed to be believed:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The doctrine of the </span><span class="cs821257DA">Trinity</span><span class="csC05134DD">. The well is deep, and who can</span><span class="csF1BA8D25"> </span><span class="csC05134DD">fathom it with the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">plumbline of reason</span><span class="csC05134DD">! The three persons in the Trinity are </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">distinguished </span><span class="csC05134DD">but not divided. They are three </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">subsistences </span><span class="csC05134DD">but one </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">essence</span><span class="csC05134DD">. The Trinity is purely an object of faith. There are some truths in true religion which are demonstrable by reason, such as that we should flee vice and do to others as we would have them do to us. But the Trinity of persons, in the unity of essence&mdash;is of divine revelation, and must be assented to by faith. Those illuminated philosophers who could wisely discourse of the magnitude and influence of the stars, the nature of plants and minerals&mdash;could not by their deepest investigation, find out the mystery of the Trinity. This is wholly supernatural and must be adored with humble believing!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The doctrine of the </span><span class="cs821257DA">Incarnation</span><span class="csC05134DD">. This doctrine teaches: that eternity&mdash;should be born, that He who rules the stars&mdash;should suck the breasts, that a virgin&mdash;should conceive, that the branch&mdash;should bear the root, that in Christ&mdash;there should be two natures, yet but one person, that the divine nature&mdash;should not be translated into the human, yet the human nature should be assumed into the person of the Son of God, the human nature is not God&mdash;yet one with God. Here frail human </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">reason </span><span class="csC05134DD">must be denied.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The doctrine of the </span><span class="cs821257DA">Resurrection</span><span class="csC05134DD">. That the body interred, nay, crumbled into a thousand pieces&mdash;and the ashes scattered over the earth&mdash;should rise again, is above frail human </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">reason </span><span class="csC05134DD">to imagine. The Epicureans and Stoics derided Paul, when he preached to them of the resurrection, Acts 17:22. Here reason must be taken captive, John 5:28, &quot;Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out!&quot; 1 Corinthians 15:42-43. The chemist can, out of several metals mingled together, extract the one from the other, the silver from the gold, the tin from the silver, and can reduce every metal to its own species. Just so, when the bodies of men are mixed with other substances, the wise God can make a sudden extraction and clothe every soul with its own body. Did not the same particular body rise, it would be rather a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">creation, </span><span class="csC05134DD">than a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">resurrection</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Acts 26:8, &quot;Why should it be thought incredible, that God should raise the dead?&quot; God </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">can </span><span class="csC05134DD">do it, because of His power, Matthew 22:29. And he </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">must </span><span class="csC05134DD">do it, because of His truth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The doctrines of faith do not </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">oppose </span><span class="csC05134DD">reason&mdash;but </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">transcend </span><span class="csC05134DD">it!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs93EF3B35">Reason must be denied in in DUTIES enjoined to be practiced. </span><span class="csC05134DD">There are many duties in piety, which carnal reason quarrels at. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">God says, &quot;It is the glory of a man to pass by an offense,&quot; Proverbs 19:11.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;No!&quot; says carnal reason, &quot;it is cowardice!&quot; The heathens thought it gallantry of spirit, to avenge injuries.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">God says that the paths of holiness are strewn with roses. Proverbs 3:17, &quot;Her ways are ways of pleasantness.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;No!&quot; says carnal reason, &quot;they are severe and cynical. I must crucify my delights and drown my mirth in tears!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">God says that piety is gainful. 1 Timothy 6:8, &quot;Godliness is great gain.&quot; It brings contentment arising from the favor of God. It brings temporal riches. Proverbs 3:16, &quot;In her left hand riches and honor.&quot; The way to be prosperous is to be pious.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;No!&quot; says carnal reason, If I follow the trade of piety I shall go bankrupt!&quot; In this case, carnal reason must be denied and fought against. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">He who will go no farther than </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">erring human reason</span><span class="csC05134DD"> will come many leagues short of heaven.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">2. A Christian must deny his WILL. </span><span class="csC05134DD">Brugensis said, &quot;The will is the great wheel in the soul&mdash;which moves all the affections.&quot; The will in the state of </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">innocence </span><span class="csC05134DD">was regular. It echoed God&#39;s will. But since the fall, though it retains its freedom in moral actions&mdash;yet spiritually it is depraved. &quot;If the will could cease from sinning,&quot; says Bernard, &quot;there would be no hell.&quot; The greatest wound is fallen upon the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">will</span><span class="csC05134DD">. The mariners compass, being stricken with thunder, causes the point of the needle to be wrong. Man&#39;s nature being corrupted, causes the will to point wrong; it points to evil. There is in the will, not only </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">impotence </span><span class="csC05134DD">but </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">obstinacy</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Acts 7:51, &quot;You have always resisted the Holy Spirit.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Here we must deny our will, and subject it to God&#39;s will. If a crooked stick is laid upon a level ground&mdash;we do not try to bring the ground even with the stick&mdash;but to make the stick even to the ground. So God&#39;s will is not to be brought to ours&mdash;but </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">our crooked will </span><span class="csC05134DD">must be brought to God&#39;s will. We pray, &quot;Your will be done.&quot; The way to have our will, is to deny it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">3. A Christian must deny his own RIGHTEOUSNESS</span><span class="csC05134DD">, his moralities, duties, and good works. Philippians 3:9, &quot;That I may be found in Him not having my own righteousness.&quot; The </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">spider </span><span class="csC05134DD">weaves a web out of her own body. A hypocrite would spin a web of salvation out of his own righteousness. But Paul, like the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">bee</span><span class="csC05134DD">, sucked salvation from the flower of Christ&#39;s righteousness. Isaiah 64:6, &quot;All our righteousness are as filthy rags.&quot; Our best duties are filled with sin. Put gold in the fire&mdash; and out comes the dross. Our most golden services are mixed with unbelief. The angel pouring sweet fragrances into the prayers of the saints, Revelation 8:3, shows that they are in themselves unsavory&mdash;and need Christ&#39;s sweet fragrances to perfume them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">We must never trust in our duties&mdash;but only in Christ&#39;s righteousness for salvation. Noah&#39;s dove made use of her wings to fly&mdash;but trusted the ark for safety.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">And, if we must deny our </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">holy things </span><span class="csC05134DD">in point of justification, then much more our civilities and moralities. A stake may be finely painted&mdash;but it has no root. A man may be painted with morality&mdash;and yet have no root of grace. A moral person is only externally washed&mdash;not internally changed. The life may be civil to men&mdash;when the heart is wicked against God; just as the sea may be calm&mdash;when the water is salty. The Pharisee could say he was no adulterer, Luke 18:11&mdash;but he could not say he was not proud.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The moral person may have a secret antipathy against godliness. He may hate grace&mdash;as much as vice. Morality is but a cracked title to heaven. A piece of brass may shine&mdash;but, lacking the King&#39;s image, it will not pass as currency. A man may shine with moral virtues&mdash;but lacking the image of God consisting in holiness&mdash;he will not pass as currency at the day of judgment. Morality is good&mdash;but God will say, &quot;You still lack one thing!&quot; Luke 18:22. Morality is a good </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Jacob&#39;s staff </span><span class="csC05134DD">to walk with among men&mdash;but it is a bad </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Jacob&#39;s ladder </span><span class="csC05134DD">to climb up to heaven!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">4. A Christian must deny all SELF-CONFIDENCE.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> How confident was Pendleton of himself, &quot;This </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">fat</span><span class="csC05134DD"> of mine shall melt in the fire, for Christ!&quot; But instead of that his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">courage</span><span class="csC05134DD"> melted. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The same Hebrew word signifies both </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">confidence </span><span class="csC05134DD">and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">folly</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Self-confidence betrays folly. Peter presumed too much on his own strength, &quot;Peter replied&mdash;Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.&quot; Matthew 26:33. But how soon was his confidence shaken and blown down with a breath of a young girl! Matthew 26:71-72, &quot;He denied it with an oath, saying, I don&#39;t know the man!&quot; Peter&#39;s denying of Christ, was the result of not denying his self-confidence. Self </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">jealousy </span><span class="csC05134DD">is good. Romans 11:20, &quot;Be not high-minded&mdash;but fear.&quot; The </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">trembling reed</span><span class="csC05134DD"> often stands when the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">confident cedar </span><span class="csC05134DD">falls. Who that knows the fierceness of a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">trial</span><span class="csC05134DD">, or the falseness of his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">heart</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;will not fear? How have some professors shined like stars in the church&#39;s hemisphere, yet have been </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">falling </span><span class="csC05134DD">stars? Porphyry, Julian, Cardinal Pool, Gardener, Judas. The Apostles have been called by some of the ancients, by such terms as &quot;the eyes of the world,&quot; &quot;Christ&#39;s feet,&quot; &quot;the church&#39;s breasts.&quot; Judas was one of these&mdash;yet a traitor.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Nay, some of the saints, through God&#39;s withdrawing the influence of His Spirit, have </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">relapsed </span><span class="csC05134DD">for a time, such as Cranmer and Origen, whose heart fainted under persecution, and he offered incense to the idol.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Deny self-confidence. 1 Corinthians 10:12, &quot;Let him who thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall.&quot; It is just with God, that he who </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">trusts </span><span class="csC05134DD">himself&mdash;should be </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">left </span><span class="csC05134DD">to himself! The vine being weak, twists around the oak to support it. A good Christian, being conscious of his own imbecility, twists by faith around Christ. Philippians 4:13, &quot;I can do all things through Christ&#39;s strengthening me.&quot; Sampson&#39;s strength lay in his hair. Ours lies in our head, Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">5. A Christian must deny pride and SELF-CONCEIT.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Job 11:12, &quot;</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Vain man</span><span class="csC05134DD"> would be wise.&quot; In the Hebrew it is </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">&quot;Empty man!&quot; </span><span class="csC05134DD">Man is a proud piece of flesh! He is apt to have a high opinion of himself. Acts 8:9, &quot;Simon had been a sorcerer there for many years, claiming to be </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">someone great.&quot; </span><span class="csC05134DD">Sapor calls himself </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">&quot;Brother of the Sun and Moon.&quot; </span><span class="csC05134DD">Commodus the Emperor called himself </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">&quot;The Golden Hercules.&quot; </span><span class="csC05134DD">The Persian kings made others worship their images. Such as view themselves in the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">flattering looking-glass of self-love, </span><span class="csC05134DD">appear bigger in their own eyes than they are. They think their </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">spark </span><span class="csC05134DD">is a</span><span class="csF1BA8D25"> sun! </span><span class="csC05134DD">They think their </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">drop is </span><span class="csC05134DD">a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">sea! </span><span class="csC05134DD">They are highly conceited of their acumen, their wit and abilities, and are ready to despise others. The Chinese think so highly of themselves, that they say that Europe has one eye and they have two, and the rest of the world is blind.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Deny self-conceit. Romans 12:3, &quot;I say to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think.&quot; Proverbs 23:4, &quot;Cease from your own wisdom.&quot; It does not say cease from being wise&mdash;but from thinking yourself wise, Proverbs 3:7 and Philippians 2:3.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">That you may deny all high, supercilious thoughts of yourselves, consider:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Self-conceit is a great sin. Chrysostom calls it &quot;the mother of hell.&quot; It is a kind of idolatry, a self-worshiping.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Whatever noble endowments you have, are </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">borrowed</span><span class="csC05134DD">. As the man said of the axe which fell in the water, 2 Kings 6:5, &quot;Oh, my master&mdash;it was </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">borrowed!&quot; </span><span class="csC05134DD">And what wise man would be proud of a jewel that was </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">lent </span><span class="csC05134DD">to him? &quot;What makes you better than anyone else? What do you have that God hasn&#39;t given you? And if all you have is from God, why </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">boast </span><span class="csC05134DD">as though you have accomplished something on your own?&quot; 1 Corinthians 4:7. The moon has no cause to be proud of her light&mdash;for which she is indebted to the sun.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Whatever acuteness of wit, or sageness of judgment you have&mdash;think how far short you come. How far short do you come of that knowledge which Adam had in innocence? He was the oracle of wisdom. He could unlock nature&#39;s dark cabinet and find out those secrets which bewilder us. Adam had a full inspection into the cause of things. He was a kind of earthly angel.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">But how far short do you come of him! Your knowledge is checkered with ignorance. There are many hard knots in nature which cannot be easily untied&mdash;like why the loadstone should draw </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">iron </span><span class="csC05134DD">and leave </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">gold </span><span class="csC05134DD">and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">pearl</span><span class="csC05134DD">; or why the Nile should overflow in the summer when waters are usually lowest. Job 38:24-25, &quot;Where is the path to the origin of light? Where is the home of the east wind? Who created a channel for the torrents of rain? Who laid out the path for the lightning?&quot; Why is the sea higher than the earth, and yet does not drown it? How do the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">bones </span><span class="csC05134DD">grow in the womb? Ecclesiastes 11:5. Who can explain exactly how the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">body </span><span class="csC05134DD">functions? He who sees </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">clearest</span><span class="csC05134DD">, has a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">mist</span><span class="csC05134DD"> before his eyes. By eating of the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">tree </span><span class="csC05134DD">of knowledge, we lost the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">key </span><span class="csC05134DD">of knowledge!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">How far short do you come of that knowledge Satan has? He is called &quot;demon&quot; from his knowledge. We read of the &quot;depths of Satan,&quot; Revelation 2:24, and his stratagems, 2 Corinthians 2:11. Satan is an intelligent spirit. Though he has lost his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">sanctity</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;yet not his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">knowledge</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Though he has lost his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">breastplate</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;yet not his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">headpiece</span><span class="csC05134DD">. He has wit enough to deceive the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">nations</span><span class="csC05134DD">, Revelation 20:3. His understanding is nimble, and, being compared with ours, is like the swift flight of an eagle, compared with the slow motion of a snail. Why, then, should any be puffed up with deceit of their knowledge, wherein the devil far outstrips them!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">How far short do you come of the knowledge they have who are perfected in glory? He who is higher than a dwarf&mdash;may be lower than a giant. Such as excel others in natural abilities&mdash;are of a lower stature than the glorified saints. 1 Corinthians 13:12, &quot;We see through a glass darkly.&quot; But the saints in bliss have a full-eyed vision of God. Their light which burned here like a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">smothered fire</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;is now blown up into a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">pure flame</span><span class="csC05134DD">. An glorified young Christian, knows more than the most profound theologians on earth. In heaven, all </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">shadows </span><span class="csC05134DD">fly away&mdash;the sun of righteousness having risen there with his illustrious beams! This may pull down the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">plumes of pride </span><span class="csC05134DD">and self-conceit.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Your dark side is broader than your light side. Your ignorance is more than your knowledge. Your </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">knowledge </span><span class="csC05134DD">is but candle-light; your </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">ignorance </span><span class="csC05134DD">as the Cimmerian darkness. Job 26:14 &quot;How little a portion is known of God?&quot; The Septuagint renders it, &quot;How little a drop!&quot; To imagine that we can </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">comprehend the Deity</span><span class="csC05134DD">, is as if we should think that we can </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">measure the skies</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Christians, the greatest part of your knowledge is not as much, as the least part of your ignorance. This may demolish all proud imaginations. You have no cause to be conceited of the knowledge you </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">have</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;but rather to be humbled for what you </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">lack!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Think of what a hell of sin you carry about you. Sin is the accursed thing, Joshua 5:13. It is the quintessence of evil. It is like a stain to beauty. It was typified by the menstrual cloth, which was the most unclean thing under the Law. Though you have knowledge, sin eclipses it. It is as if a woman should have a fair face&mdash;but a cancer in her breast! Your knowledge does not so much adorn you, as sin debases you.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Grace can never thrive where pride and self-conceit grow. As a body with cancer cannot thrive&mdash;so neither can the soul thrive which is cancered with pride and self-conceit. A proud </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">head</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;makes a barren </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">heart!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">A supercilious conceitedness is odious, and much lessens any worth in a person. It is like a great flaw in a diamond. The more one values himself, the less God and angels value him. Let a person be eminent&mdash;yet, if he is self-conceited, he is loved by none. He is like a physician who has the plague. Though he may be admired for his skill&mdash;yet none care to come near him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Such as have a high opinion of their own excellencies are on the fast track to eternal ruin! Either God infatuates them, Isaiah 29:14, or denies a blessing to their labors, or allows them to fall into some great sin. Peter, who was so well-conceited of himself, as if he had more grace than all the Apostles, the Lord let him fall very low! He denied Christ with an oath, nay, an imprecation, Matthew 26:74. Peter wished a curse on himself if he knew Christ; nay, some think he cursed Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The Lord sometimes lets vain, conceited people fall&mdash;not only foully, but finally. &quot;The doves,&quot; says Pliny, &quot;take pride in their feathers, and in their flying high at last, they soar so high that they are prey to the hawk!&quot; So, when men fly high in self-conceitedness, they become prey to the prince of the air!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Let all this, make us deny our pride; let it kill the worm of self-conceit. If we are proud of our knowledge&mdash;the devil does not care how much we know. Let Paul be our pattern. Though he was the chief of the Apostles, he says, </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">&quot;I am less than the least of all God&#39;s people.&quot;</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Ephesians 3:8.</span><span class="csF1BA8D25"> &quot;I am nothing.&quot; </span><span class="csC05134DD">2 Corinthians 12:11. This illustrious Apostle, a star of the first magnitude, shrank into nothing in his own eyes. It is excellent to be like Moses, whose face had a luster on it&mdash;but &quot;he was not aware that his face was radiant.&quot; Exodus 34:29.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">6. A Christian must deny his APPETITE.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> The gluttonous appetite cries, &quot;Give, give!&quot; Proverbs 30:15. Paul beat down his body, 1 Corinthians 9:27. Such a proportion only is to be taken for the recruiting of nature, as may help forward God&#39;s service. More are hurt by </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">excess in lawful things</span><span class="csC05134DD">--than by meddling with </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">sinful </span><span class="csC05134DD">things. More are killed by </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">wine</span><span class="csC05134DD">--than by </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">poison</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Many make their belly their god, Philippians 3:19. And to this god, they pour their </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">drink offerings!</span><span class="csC05134DD"> And to this god, they pour their </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">drink offerings</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Clemens Alexandrinus writes of a fish whose heart is in his belly. This is an emblem of epicures, whose heart is in their belly; they are devoted to their appetite! Excess in food or drink clouds the mind, chokes holy affections, and provokes lust. The </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">foulest weeds</span><span class="csC05134DD"> grow out of the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">fattest soil</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Intemperance shortens life&mdash;as too much oil extinguishes the lamp. </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Many dig their graves, with their teeth! </span><span class="csC05134DD">Christ cautioned His Apostles, Luke 21:34, &quot;Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">dissipation</span><span class="csC05134DD">.&quot; Seneca could say he was born to higher things, than to be a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">slave to his body</span><span class="csC05134DD">. What a shame is it&mdash;that the soul, that </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">princely </span><span class="csC05134DD">part, which sways the scepter of reason, and is akin to the angels, should be enslaved to the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">brutish </span><span class="csC05134DD">part! Deny the sinful cravings of the flesh. What has God given conscience for, but to be a golden bridle to check the inordinacy of the appetite!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">7. A Christian must deny his EASE.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Proverbs 1:32, &quot;Ease slays the simple.&quot; The flesh is prone to sloth and softness. It is loath to take pains for heaven. Proverbs 19:24, &quot;A slothful man hides his hand in his bosom.&quot; He is loath to pluck it out&mdash;though it is to lay hold on a crown! Weeds and vermin grow in untilled ground, and all vices grow in an idle, untilled heart. How can they expect to reap </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">a harvest of glory&mdash;</span><span class="csC05134DD">who never sowed any seed? Is Satan so busy in his diocese, 1 Peter 5:8, and are Christians idle? Are they like the lilies&mdash;which neither toil, nor spin? O deny your ease! Seneca, a heather, devoted himself to labor and spent part of the night in study. Hannibal forced his way over the Alps and craggy rocks. We must force our way to paradise. Let us shake off sloth&mdash;as Paul did the viper!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Never think to be brought to heaven as the passengers in a ship are brought to their ports&mdash;while </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">sleeping!</span><span class="csC05134DD"> 1 Chronicles 22:16, &quot;Arise and be doing.&quot; God puts no difference between the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">slothful</span><span class="csC05134DD"> servant and the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">wicked</span><span class="csC05134DD"> servant, &quot;You </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">wicked</span><span class="csC05134DD"> and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">lazy</span><span class="csC05134DD"> servant!&quot; Matthew 25:26. Those slothful people in Eturia, who like drones enter into the hive and consumed the honey, were expelled from others and condemned to exile. Such as idle away the day of grace and fold their hands to sleep when they should be working out salvation, God will condemn to a perpetual exile in hell.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">8. A Christian must deny CARNAL POLICY.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> This is </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">the wisdom of the flesh</span><span class="csC05134DD">, 2 Corinthians 1:12. Carnal policy is craft. The politician does not consult what is best for the country&mdash;but what is the safest policy for himself. The politician is made of willow; he can side with all parties; his religion is cut according to the fashion of the times; he can bow either to the east or to the west. Zeal for </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">truth, </span><span class="csC05134DD">is blotted out of the politician&#39;s creed. Sir Thomas More said that he would not follow truth too near the heels&mdash;lest it should dash out his brains. It is judged by some a piece of wise policy, not to declare against error for fear of losing a party.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Politician </span><span class="csC05134DD">is a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">latitudinarian</span><span class="csC05134DD">. He can go all ways. The ostrich&#39;s wings help her to outrun other creatures. Sinful policy makes men run further than they can, who are of purer consciences. In short, the politician is like a chameleon, who can change into all colors&mdash;and be of the same mind as his company is. He can be either </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">serious </span><span class="csC05134DD">or </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">feathery</span><span class="csC05134DD">. I grant that </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Christian prudence </span><span class="csC05134DD">is commendable&mdash;but </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">the serpent </span><span class="csC05134DD">(shrewdness) must not devour </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">the dove</span><span class="csC05134DD"> (inoffensiveness). That policy is unjustifiable, which teaches people to avoid duty. Deny carnal policy; dare to be honest. The best policy is to hold fast to honesty and integrity.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">9. A Christian must deny his inordinate ANGER.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> James 1:26, &quot;If any man among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, this man&#39;s religion is vain.&quot; Every member of the body is infected with sin, as every branch of wormwood is bitter; but the tongue is </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">full </span><span class="csC05134DD">of deadly poison, James 3:8. Augustine compares the tongue to a furnace, and too often sparks of anger fly out of it! The Holy Spirit once descended in cloven tongues of fire, Acts 2:3. But the Apostle James speaks of a tongue that is set on fire of hell, James 3:6. Some cannot rule their own spirit&mdash;but are carried away with their passions as a chariot with wild horses. &quot;Many,&quot; said Jerome, &quot;who will not be drunk with wine&mdash;will be drunk with rash anger.&quot; Ecclesiastes 7:9, &quot;Anger rests in the bosom of fools!&quot; Anger may </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">be </span><span class="csC05134DD">in a wise man&mdash;but it </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">rests </span><span class="csC05134DD">in a fool. There is, I know, a holy anger against sin&mdash;but the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">fury of anger </span><span class="csC05134DD">is the scum which boils off from an unsavory heart! Anger disturbs reason, and makes a person unfit for holy duties.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">O Christians, deny yourselves! Pray that God will set a watch before your lips, Psalm 141:4. Labor to quench the fire of wrath&mdash;with a flood of tears! It is recorded of Mr. John Bruen, in the county of Chester, that though he was naturally of a hasty, angry spirit&mdash;yet at length he got the victory over his passions, and grew so meek and calm that his very nature seemed to be quite altered. Grace does to the passions what Christ did to the sea when it was stormy. He said, &quot;Peace, be still.&quot; And there was a great calm. Grace turns the fierceness of the lion&mdash;into the meekness of the dove!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">10. A Christian must deny SINFUL FASHIONS.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Romans 12:2, &quot;Be not conformed to this world.&quot; That is&mdash;do not be conformed to the fashions and mode of it. If the old Christians were to rise out of their graves&mdash;our new fashions might frighten them into their graves again! Was there ever such excess in hair? 1 Corinthians 11:14, &quot;Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him.&quot; More money is sometimes laid out for a wig to cover one head&mdash;than would clothe twenty poor people. One asked Pastor Dod why he did not preach against </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">those ruffians who wore long hair. </span><span class="csC05134DD">He replied, &quot;If grace comes into their heart&mdash;it will make them cut off their hair.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Nor can the female gender be excused for their excess in apparel. &quot;The Lord will strip away their artful beauty&mdash;their ornaments, headbands, and crescent necklaces; their earrings, bracelets, and veils of shimmering gauze. Gone will be their scarves, ankle chains, sashes, perfumes, and charms; their rings, jewels, party clothes, gowns, capes, and purses; their mirrors, linen garments, head ornaments, and shawls.&quot; Isaiah 3:18-23. Seneca complained of those in his time who hung two or three </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">houses </span><span class="csC05134DD">on their ears! Some wear half their </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">incomes </span><span class="csC05134DD">upon their backs! Lysander would not allow his daughters to be too gorgeously attired, saying &quot;it would make them more </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">common</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;than </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">lovely</span><span class="csC05134DD">.&quot; What painted faces and bare shoulders appear in the congregations! That professors should conform and comply with others in their antic dresses, is a reproach of piety! A tear in the eye&mdash;would more adorn than a tower on the head. O deny yourselves! Pull down these </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">flags of vanity</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Have not God&#39;s judgments humbled you? 1 Timothy 2:9, &quot;I want women to be modest in their appearance. They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes.&quot; Let the hidden man of the heart, be beautified and bespangled with grace. Psalm 45:13, &quot;The king&#39;s daughter is all glorious </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">within</span><span class="csC05134DD">.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">11. A Christian must deny his own AIMS. </span><span class="csC05134DD">He must not look with one eye at piety&mdash;and aim at himself with the other eye. He must not aim at self-enriching and self-applause.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">He must not aim at </span><span class="cs821257DA">self-enriching</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Some espouse the gospel only for gain. They court this queen, not for her </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">beauty </span><span class="csC05134DD">but for her </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">jewels!</span><span class="csC05134DD"> It is not the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">fire </span><span class="csC05134DD">of the altar they regard&mdash;but the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">gold </span><span class="csC05134DD">of the altar! 1 Timothy 6:5, &quot;They think that godliness is a means to financial gain.&quot; Camero, a French divine of Bordeaux, relates a story of one Santangel, a lawyer, who turned Protestant only out of worldly respects&mdash;that he might grow rich. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Judas preached and wrought miracles&mdash;but his eye was chiefly on the money bag. How do many ministers heap benefice upon benefice, minding the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">fleece </span><span class="csC05134DD">more than the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">flock</span><span class="csC05134DD">! </span><span class="csEF62482">Dumb dogs </span><span class="csC05134DD">(that is, those who are afraid to speak the truth for fear that it will offend the rich) </span><span class="csEF62482">are greedy dogs</span><span class="csC05134DD">. &quot;For the leaders of my people&mdash;the Lord&#39;s watchmen, his shepherds&mdash;are blind to every danger. They are like </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">silent watchdogs </span><span class="csC05134DD">that give no warning when danger comes. They love to lie around, sleeping and dreaming. And they are as greedy as dogs, never satisfied. They are stupid shepherds, all following their own path, all of them intent on personal gain.&quot; Isaiah 56:10-11. These make use of the ministerial function, only as a net to catch filthy lucre. This is to be profane in sacred things. It is sordid and unworthy of a Christian, to make piety bow to secular interest.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">A Christian must not aim at </span><span class="cs821257DA">self-applause</span><span class="csC05134DD">. &quot;Be careful not to do your &#39;acts of righteousness&#39; before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.&quot; Matthew 6:1. They prayed and gave alms&mdash;that they might be seen by men. The </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">oil of vain-glory </span><span class="csC05134DD">fed their lamp! Verse 5, &quot;Truly they have their reward.&quot; They might write &quot;Received in full payment.&quot; It is a saying of Spanhemius, that there is in every man by nature</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">&mdash;a measure of Pharisaism</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;a seeking after the glory and applause of the world. &quot;Everything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Rabbi</span><span class="csC05134DD">.&quot; Matthew 23:5-7 </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Luther confessed that, although he was never tempted with covetousness&mdash;yet he was sometimes with vain-glory! The moth breeds in the finest cloth; and self-seeking is apt to breed in the best duties. Sinister aims corrupt piety. A good aim will not make a bad action good&mdash;but </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">a bad aim </span><span class="csC05134DD">will make a good action bad.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">To blame are they who, when they have done any glorious service in the church, take the praise themselves, like those heathens who sacrificed the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">wax </span><span class="csC05134DD">to their gods, but kept the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">honey </span><span class="csC05134DD">to themselves. Matthew Paris speaks of one who, having in several lectures proved strenuously that Christ was God, and being highly applauded for it, cried out saying, &quot;O Jesus, You are indebted to me for Your divinity this day.&quot; Whereupon this doctor was stricken suddenly with a stupidness and forgetfulness.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Let this cause trembling and humility in Christians. Some ships which have escaped the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">rocks, </span><span class="csC05134DD">have been wrecked upon the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">sands</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Many who have escaped the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">rocks of gross scandals </span><span class="csC05134DD">have been wrecked upon the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">sands of self-seeking</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Tacitus said he would not have Erasmus&#39;s fame and applause, for all the world. No&mdash;but to have esteem in God&#39;s church is a blessing. Hebrews 11:2 &quot;By faith the elders obtained a good report.&quot; Much of the honor of piety depends upon the credit of those who profess it. But the sin is when self-applause is the only thing hunted after. Popular applause is the golden arrow which glitters in the eye&mdash;but wounds the heart. How many have been blown to hell with the breath of popular applause.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">O let us deny, yes, abhor this vain-glorious temper. We have a holy example in John the Baptist, who sought to lift up Christ and beat down himself. John 1:15, &quot;Someone is coming who is far greater than I am.&quot; It is as if he had said &quot;I am but the herald, the voice of one crying. Christ, who comes after me, is the Prince. I am but the morning star; He is the sun. I baptize only with water, He with the Holy Spirit.&quot; Thus he sets the crown of honor upon Christ&#39;s head. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">When Joab had taken Rabbah, he did not usurp the praise to himself&mdash;but sent for King David that he might carry away the glory of the victory, 2 Samuel 12:27. So, when any eminent service in church has been done&mdash;the glory of all should be given to Christ and free grace! It is better that God should approve&mdash;than that the world should applaud! If we are faithful, we shall have honor enough in heaven. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Let this be our chief aim in duty that we may grow more in love with God and be made more like Him, have more communion with Him, and bring more revenues of honor to Him. 1 Peter 4:11, &quot;That in all things, God may be glorified.&quot; We should not only </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">advance</span><span class="csC05134DD"> God&#39;s glory, but </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">design </span><span class="csC05134DD">God&#39;s glory. It was a worthy speech of Philip de Mornay upon his deathbed, that he had, through the course of his life, made God&#39;s glory his end and aim. </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">As all the rivers run into the sea, so all our actions must run into God, the infinite Ocean!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">12. A Christian must deny all UNGODLINESS. </span><span class="csC05134DD">Titus 2:11-12, &quot;The grace of God has appeared to all men, teaching us that </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">denying ungodliness </span><span class="csC05134DD">and worldly lusts, we should live soberly.&quot; The Turks say in their Koran&mdash;that God did not give men lustful desires to be frustrated. The scripture gives no license for sin. It bids us to </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">deny ungodly lusts</span><span class="csC05134DD">. It is not likely he will sacrifice his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Isaac</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;his worldly profits&mdash;who will not sacrifice the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">ram</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;his vile lusts! A Christian must deny his malice, revenge, covetousness, uncleanness, superstition, and heterodoxy. A man may as well go to hell for a drunken opinion&mdash;as a drunken life. And let me especially instance two sins a Christian must deny:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs93EF3B35">A Christian must deny the sin of rash censuring.</span><span class="cs70790F90"> </span><span class="csC05134DD">James 4:11, &quot;Don&#39;t speak evil against each other.&quot; Some make it a part of their religion&mdash;to criticize others, and clip their credit to make it weigh lighter. You shall hear them say, &quot;Such a one is proud, factious, and hypocritical.&quot; James 4:12, &quot;Who are you to judge another?&quot; Augustine could not endure that any should detract from the good name of others.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">root </span><span class="csC05134DD">of censoriousness is </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">pride</span><span class="csC05134DD">. A person thinks that by taking away from another&#39;s reputation&mdash;he shall add something to his own. But let him who shall raise himself upon the ruin of another&#39;s fame, be warned. Do you think it is no sin to murder a man in his name? You who are such a critic, it is to be feared you can spy all faults but your own! O Christian, look inward. If you viewed your own spots more in the looking-glass of the Word, you would not be as ready to throw the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">stone of censure </span><span class="csC05134DD">at others. Deny this sin of </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">rash censuring </span><span class="csC05134DD">and</span><span class="csF1BA8D25"> smiting with the tongue</span><span class="csC05134DD">, Jeremiah 18:18. You who speak reproachfully of your brother without a cause, the time may come that he may be accepted&mdash;and you rejected! He may be found gold&mdash;and you reprobate silver!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs93EF3B35">A Christian must deny his besetting complexion sin. </span><span class="csC05134DD">Psalm 12:23, &quot;I have kept myself from </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">my </span><span class="csC05134DD">iniquity.&quot; As there is one master bee in the hive, so there is naturally one master sin in the heart. This must be denied. The devil can hold a man fast by one sin. A jailer can hold the prisoner fast by one fetter. One sin is enough to stop the current of mercy. One sin may damn as well as more, just as one millstone is enough to sink a man into the sea. If there is any lust which we cannot deny, it will be a bitter root either of scandal or apostasy.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">13. A Christian must deny his RELATIONS.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Luke 14:26, &quot;If any man comes to me and hates not father and mother and wife and children, he cannot be My disciple.&quot; The meaning is, when carnal relations come in </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">competition </span><span class="csC05134DD">with Christ, or stand in </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">opposition </span><span class="csC05134DD">to Christ&mdash;we must hate them. </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">When our friends would prove snares, and hinder us from our duty, we must either leap over them or tread upon them! </span><span class="csC05134DD">Here is faith in God. &quot;If my wife,&quot; said Jerome, &quot;should hang about my neck, and persuade me to deny Christ, I would break from her and fly to the cross!&quot; When </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Peter </span><span class="csC05134DD">would be a tempter, Christ said, &quot;Get behind Me, </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Satan</span><span class="csC05134DD">.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">14. A Christian must deny his ESTATE for Christ.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> A carnal heart will commend and profess Christ&mdash;but will part with nothing for Him. The young man in the gospel was Christ&#39;s </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">hearer</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;but not His </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">follower</span><span class="csC05134DD">. &quot;He had heavenly desires&mdash;but an earthly appetite,&quot; as one has said. When Christ said to him, &quot;Sell all and give to the poor,&quot; he went away sorrowful, Matthew 19:22. When riches are joined with a bad heart, they do much hurt. The world lay nearer the young man&#39;s heart than Christ. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Have some of the heathens denied the world? Epaminondes, a Grecian captain who obtained many glorious victories, was a great despiser of the world. He refused vast sums of money sent him from the King of Persia, so that when he died he left scarcely enough to defray the charges of his funeral. Did a heathen go thus far in denying the world, and shall not Christians do much more? Let the</span><span class="csF1BA8D25"> wedge of gold </span><span class="csC05134DD">be denied for the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">pearl of great price</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Matthew 19:27, &quot;We have forsaken all and followed You.&quot; A true saint esteems the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">gleanings of Christ </span><span class="csC05134DD">better than the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">world&#39;s vintage</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Philippians 3:8, &quot;For whom I have suffered the loss of all things.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Galeacius, marquess of Vico, parted with a fair estate to enjoy the pure ordinances of Christ at Geneva. When a Jesuit persuaded him to return to his popish religion in Italy, promising him a huge sum of money, he said, &quot;Let their money perish with them, who esteem all the gold in the world worth one hour&#39;s communion with Jesus Christ and His Holy Spirit.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">15. A Christian must deny his LIFE for Christ. </span><span class="csC05134DD">This is in the text, &quot;Let him take up his </span><span class="cs821257DA">cross</span><span class="csC05134DD">.&quot; Suffering for Christ must be voluntary and spontaneous. He who suffers against his will&mdash;</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">bears </span><span class="csC05134DD">the cross; he who suffers willingly&mdash;</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">takes up </span><span class="csC05134DD">the cross. A fair virgin fell in love with Crates for his learning. He showed her his staff and his scrip. &quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;is your i.&quot; Christ shows us His </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">cross</span><span class="csC05134DD">. If we will not have Him upon these terms, the match is not likely to go on. Sufferings are waiting for us, Acts 20:23. &quot;Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.&quot; 2 Timothy 3:12. </span><span class="cs821257DA">The devil has not grown kinder. </span><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour!&quot; 1 Peter 5:8.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Some think of </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">reigning </span><span class="csC05134DD">with Christ&mdash;but not of </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">suffering </span><span class="csC05134DD">with Christ.

Luke 14:26, &quot;If any man comes to Me and hates not father and mother and his own life, he cannot be My disciple.&quot; Love for Christ must outweigh life. Revelation 12:11, &quot;They loved not their lives to the death.&quot; Paul carried the image of Christ in his heart as a saint, and the message of Christ in his body as a martyr, Galatians 6:17. The primitive worthies snatched up torments as so many crowns, and were content to shed their blood for Christ, knowing they would exchange their bloody robes-for white ones. The prophet Isaiah was sawn in half. Jeremiah was killed by stoning. Amos was killed with an iron bar. Luke was hanged on an olive tree.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">I read that Irenaeus was carried to a place where a cross was set on one side and an idol on the other. He was given a choice either to bow to the idol&mdash;or suffer on the cross. He chose the latter.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Basil speaks of a virgin condemned to the fire. She was offered her life and estate if she would bow down to an image. She answered, &quot;Let life and money go; welcome Christ!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Though every Christian is not actually a martyr&mdash;yet he has a preparation of mind, and is ready to suffer&mdash;if God calls. Luther said he would rather be a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">martyr </span><span class="csC05134DD">than a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">monarch</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Let us then, take up the cross.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Can wicked men be content to suffer for their lusts, and shall we not suffer for Christ? We are to look upon our sufferings as a badge of honor. If we receive honor when we are </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">reproached </span><span class="csC05134DD">for Christ, much more shall we receive it when we </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">die </span><span class="csC05134DD">for Him. 1 Peter 4:14, &quot;If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.&quot; Our sufferings for Christ propagate piety. Paul&#39;s being imprisoned made the gospel to be more enlarged, Philippians 1:12. Justin Martyr was converted to the faith by beholding the heroic patience and courage of the Christians in their sufferings.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The </span><span class="cs821257DA">cross</span><span class="csC05134DD"> leads to the </span><span class="cs821257DA">crown</span><span class="csC05134DD">. 2 Timothy 2:12, &quot;If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.&quot; Who would not be willing to venture on the seas, though rough and tempestuous, if he were sure to be crowned as soon as he came ashore? Persecutors may take away from us our </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">goods</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;but not our </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">God</span><span class="csC05134DD">. They may take away our </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">liberty&mdash;</span><span class="csC05134DD">but not our freedom of conscience. They may take off our </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">head</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;but not our crown! Revelation 2:10.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">He who cannot deny his life for Christ, will deny Christ. And he who is ashamed of Christ, Christ will be ashamed of him. Mark 8:38, &quot;Whoever shall be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with His holy angels.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31A79322"><br/>3. The GROUND of the Proposition</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The grand reason why we must deny ourselves, is because we can be saved no other way. A town or castle may have several ways leading to it. But there is only one way leading to the celestial paradise, and that is self-denial. Without self-denial, we can never come up to Christ&#39;s terms. If the world cannot be denied&mdash;Christ cannot be trusted. If the will is not denied&mdash;Christ cannot be obeyed. Therefore, self-denial is absolute necessity to enter heaven.<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31A79322">4. An INFERENCE Drawn from the Proposition</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">From all that has been said, see how </span><span class="cs821257DA">hard</span><span class="csC05134DD"> a thing it is to be a Christian. Were it only to put on the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">mantle of profession</span><span class="csC05134DD">, it would be easy. Even Satan can transform himself into an angel of light, 2 Corinthians 11:14. But a man </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">must </span><span class="csC05134DD">deny himself. This self-emptying or self-annihilation is the strait gate through which a Christian must enter into the kingdom of God. He is not to deny only those things which are </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">outside </span><span class="csC05134DD">of him&mdash;his worldly profits; but those which are </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">within </span><span class="csC05134DD">him&mdash;his sins, nay, his righteousness. </span><span class="cs821257DA">Self is an idol, and it is hard to sacrifice this idol</span><span class="csC05134DD">; but this must be done. Either carnal self must be denied, or we cannot truly follow Christ.<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31A79322">5. A Check to Epicures and Sensualists</span><span class="csC05134DD"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">This justly indicts those who live in a contradiction to the text, who instead of denying themselves&mdash;they let loose the reins and give themselves up to all manner of pleasure and licentiousness. Ecclesiastes 7:4, &quot;The heart of fools is in the house of mirth.&quot; The prophet calls them fools&mdash;who do not </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">mortify</span><span class="csC05134DD"> the flesh&mdash;but </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">gratify </span><span class="csC05134DD">the flesh. &quot;You push away every thought of coming disaster, but your actions only bring the day of judgment closer. How terrible it will be for you who sprawl on ivory beds surrounded with luxury, eating the meat of tender lambs and choice calves. You sing idle songs to the sound of the harp.&quot; Amos 6:3-5. </span><span class="cs821257DA">Pleasure enchants men&#39;s minds, and transforms them into beasts!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">There is a place in Africa called Tombutium where the inhabitants spend all their time in singing and dancing. And have we not many who consume their hours in plays and brothels? As if God has made them like the leviathan&mdash;to play in the sea (Psalm 104:26). How will their countenances be changed when God shall say, &quot;Give an account of your stewardship!&quot; These frolicking sensualists live as if there were no world to come. </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">They pamper their bodies&mdash;but starve their souls! </span><span class="csC05134DD">As if one should feed his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">dog</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;but starve his </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">wife!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Do epicures deny themselves? Indeed, in one sense they do. Enjoying their lusts&mdash;</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">they deny themselves a part in heaven! </span><span class="csC05134DD">In the country of Sardinia there is an herb-like balm, that if a man eats of it, he shall die laughing. Such an herb is &#39;pleasure&#39;. If one feeds immoderately on it, he will go laughing to hell.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Esau lost the blessing while he was hunting. O! How many, while they are hunting after worldly pleasures, lose eternal blessedness? There is a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">&#39;sin cup&#39; </span><span class="csC05134DD">brewing which will spoil the sinner&#39;s mirth. Psalm 75:8, &quot;For the Lord holds a cup in his hand; it is full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours the wine out in judgment, and all the wicked must drink it, draining it to the dregs.&quot; This wine is the wrath of God, and it is mixed; the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">never-dying worm </span><span class="csC05134DD">and the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">eternal fire</span><span class="csC05134DD"> are mixed the cup! The Lord will proportion a sinner&#39;s torment to his pleasure. Revelation 18:7, &quot;She has lived in luxury and pleasure, so match it now with torments and sorrows!&quot;<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31A79322">6. The Lack of Self-Denial Lamented</span><span class="csC05134DD"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">In the next place, we may sadly lay to heart the lack of self-denial. O self-denial, where have you gone? We live in a knowing age&mdash;yet few know how to deny themselves! </span><span class="cs821257DA">Selfishness is the reigning sin of the world. </span><span class="csC05134DD">This makes the times have a bad aspect. 2 Timothy 3:1-2, &quot;Perilous times shall come&mdash;for men shall be lovers of themselves.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">SELF may have divers actions brought against it. It is an enemy to the public. James 4:1, &quot;Whence come wars?&quot; Whence is robbery and bribery? Whence is oppression and drunkenness, but from those selfish lusts which men cannot conquer? When Lentulus had declared Tiberius Caesar to be his heir in his will, so brutally selfish was Caesar, that he sent and killed Lentulus that he might have immediate possession of his goods.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Self-denial lodges but in a few hearts. It is a sacred, exotic herb which has grown very scarce. Luke 18:8, &quot;When the Son of Man comes, shall He find faith on the earth?&quot; May it not be said, &quot;Shall He find self-denial on the earth?&quot; Self-denial has gone on a long pilgrimage, and who can tell when it will return?<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31A79322">7. PERSUASIVES to Self-Denial</span><span class="csC05134DD"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">My next work is to persuade Christians to the practice of this momentous duty of self-denial. Man </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">lost </span><span class="csC05134DD">himself at first by self-exaltation, and he must </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">recover </span><span class="csC05134DD">himself by self-denial.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">1. Self-denial is just and equal.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> How much has Christ denied Himself for us? He eclipsed His glory, Philippians 2:7, &quot;He denied Himself.&quot; What a wonderful self-denial was it for Christ to leave His Father&#39;s bosom and be </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">incarnate!</span><span class="csC05134DD"> </span><span class="cs821257DA">For Christ to be made flesh, was more than for all the angels to be made worms! </span><span class="csC05134DD">Christ denied His </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">name </span><span class="csC05134DD">and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">reputation</span><span class="csC05134DD">, Hebrews 12:2, &quot;He endured the shame.&quot; He denied </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">worldly grandeurs </span><span class="csC05134DD">and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">riches</span><span class="csC05134DD">. 1 Corinthians 8:9, &quot;For our sakes He became poor.&quot; A feeding trough was His cradle, the cobwebs His curtains. He denied His </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">life</span><span class="csC05134DD">, Philippians 2:8, &quot;He became obedient to death.&quot; It is but equity&mdash;that we should deny ourselves for Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">2. Self-denial is the sign of a sincere Christian.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Hypocrites may have great knowledge and make fair pretenses&mdash;but it is only the sincere saint who can deny himself and lay his life at Christ&#39;s feet. This was a touchstone of Moses&#39; sincerity. He denied the pleasures of the court&mdash;and chose affliction rather than iniquity, Hebrews 11:25.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">I have read of a holy man who was once tempted by Satan. Satan said to him, &quot;Why do you take all these pains? What do you do, more than I? Are you no drunkard, no adulterer? Neither am I. Do you watch? I never sleep. Do you fast? I never eat. What do you do, more than I?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;Why,&quot; said the good man, &quot;I tell you, Satan, I give myself to prayer, nay, more, I </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">deny </span><span class="csC05134DD">myself.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&quot;Nay,&quot; said the devil, &quot;you go beyond me, for I </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">exalt </span><span class="csC05134DD">myself.&quot; And so he vanished.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">3. Self-denial is a rational thing.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> For if </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">self </span><span class="csC05134DD">is an enemy&mdash;then it is wisdom to discard it. There is a rationality in all God&#39;s commands. Why would He have us deny fleshly lusts&mdash;but because they wage war against our souls! 1 Peter 2:11. Why would He have us deny pride&mdash;but because of its harmful quality! Proverbs 16:18 &quot;Pride goes before destruction.&quot; Where pride leads the van, destruction brings up the rear! </span><span class="cs821257DA">God would have us deny nothing for him&mdash;but that which will damn us if we keep it!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">4. There is nothing lost by self-denial. </span><span class="csC05134DD">We shall be abundantly compensated. Matthew 19:29, &quot;Everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for my sake, will receive a hundred times as much in return and will have eternal life.&quot; If we deny our name and reputation for Christ, God will give us inward peace. There is &quot;a hundredfold&quot; in this life, and He will honor us before the angels. How many hundredfolds that amounts to, I am not able to tell. If we deny our estate to keep our conscience, God will give us a kingdom, Luke 12:32. What does he lose, who parts with a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">flower</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;and gets a</span><span class="csF1BA8D25"> precious jewel! </span><span class="csC05134DD">We may lose all we have for Christ&mdash;yet lose nothing by Him.<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31A79322">8. HELPS to Self-Denial</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">For the attaining of self-denial, let these rules be observed:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">1. Be convinced of the incomparable excellency of Christ.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> He is the quintessence of goodness. He is compared to a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">head of gold&mdash;</span><span class="csC05134DD">for riches, Song of Solomon 5:10; to the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Rose of Sharon</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;for perfume, Song of Solomon 2:1; to a </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">bright morning star</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;for beauty, Revelation 22:16. Jesus Christ is all that is good and lovely. He is all we can require for satisfaction, or that we can desire for salvation. He is fully commensurate to our needs. He has </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">eye salve </span><span class="csC05134DD">to anoint us, </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">white raiment </span><span class="csC05134DD">to cover us, and His </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">blood </span><span class="csC05134DD">to heal us. We shall never deny ourselves for Christ&mdash;until we see glory and a beauty in Him. Christ is all marrow and sweetness. He is better than life, estate, or heaven!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">2. Endeavor after a vital principle of grace.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Grace will do that which flesh and blood cannot do. A man may do that by </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">skill</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;which he cannot do by </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">strength</span><span class="csC05134DD">. A burden of great weight may be lifted up by pulleys, which cannot be lifted up by strength of arm. Grace will teach one the art of self-denial, which cannot be done by strength of nature. In particular, labor for three graces.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">Humility.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> A proud man </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">admires </span><span class="csC05134DD">himself; therefore he cannot </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">deny </span><span class="csC05134DD">himself. A humble man lays his mouth in the dust. He has lower thoughts of himself, than others can have of him. He renounces himself. He opens to God as the flower opens to the sun. He will </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">have</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;what God will have for him. He will </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">be</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;what God will have him be. He is like melting wax. God may set whatever stamp and impression He will, upon him. The humble man is the self-denier.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">Love. </span><span class="csC05134DD">Who will not deny himself for a friend whom he loves? He will part with anything he has. He will gratify him who he loves, though it is to his own loss. He whose heart is fired with love for Christ&mdash;will stop at nothing for His sake. Gregory Nazianzen said of his Athenian learning, that he was glad he had anything of worth, to esteem as nothing, for Christ. </span><span class="cs821257DA">Love for God will devour self-love.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs38252855">Faith.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Abraham was a great self-denier. He left his kindred and country and was willing to travel to any place where God would have him. Whence was this? It was from his faith. Hebrews 11:8, &quot;By faith Abraham obeyed and went out, not knowing where he went.&quot; He who believes that Christ and heaven are his&mdash;what will he not relinquish for Christ&#39;s sake? The stronger a Christian&#39;s faith is, the more eminent will his self-denial be.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF57FA319">3. Pray much for self-denial.</span><span class="csC05134DD"> Prayer sets God to work, Psalm 10:17. Let this be your grand request&mdash;a self-denying frame of heart. Self-denial does not grow in nature&#39;s soil. It is a fruit of the Spirit. Beg God that He will plant this heavenly flower in your soul. Say, &quot;Lord, whatever You deny me, do not deny me </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">self-denial. </span><span class="csC05134DD">Let me rather lack great abilities, nay, let me lack the comforts of the Spirit&mdash;rather than self-denial.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs821257DA">There may be going to heaven without comfort&mdash;but there is no going there without self-denial.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
