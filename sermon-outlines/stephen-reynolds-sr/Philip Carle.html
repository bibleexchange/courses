There is no punctuation in the original translations of the Bible. We have punctuated it and in this particular scripture it was punctuated wrong. They put in there I say unto you comma today you shall be in paradise with me. Making it appear that the minute Jesus died on the cross he went straight to paradise. No, no, no he did not. The way it should read is I say unto you today comma I am telling you this today. Today I am telling you that you are going to be in paradise with me.

That is what I were and if I still was then Jesus died in vain. I&#39;m going to tell you something folks. I didn&#39;t stop sinning until I finally got it through my thick head I wasn&#39;t a sinner anymore. And the religious world thinks that&#39;s heresy and they want to hang you for it.
