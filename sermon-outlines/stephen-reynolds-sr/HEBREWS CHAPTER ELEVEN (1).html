The Bible tells us that we must have faith&mdash;we must believe God&mdash;and it tells us the great things that happen to those who do believe God. The Bible also gives example after example of men and women who have and have not believed God and shows in clear terms what happened to them because of their unbelief. It is important that we clearly see just what faith means. The Biblical definition is this; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Hebrews 11:1&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Now faith is the </span><span class="cs54A12280">substance</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> of things hoped for, the </span><span class="cs54A12280">evidence</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> of things not seen.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Romans 4:19&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara&#39;s womb:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;20</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> &ndash;He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;21</span><span class="csC382D2BB">&mdash;And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

The word &quot;evidence&quot; (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">elegchos</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) means conviction.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC9D7C422"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now faith is the </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">assurance</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of things hoped for, the </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">conviction</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of things not seen.</span></p><p class="csC9D7C422"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Look closely at what is being said and note that faith is being described as an act, an act of the mind and heart. That is, our heart and mind believe something and we have assurance and conviction that it is true. This is certainly true; faith is an act of the mind and heart. But many of the earlier interpreters understood &quot;substance&quot; (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">hupostasis</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) to mean </span><span class="csC382D2BB">real being, substantial nature, the real nature of a thing</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is more than an act. Scripture seems to be saying that faith is the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">actual possession</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of reality. Is this not what the definition &quot;title-deed&quot; is saying? The person who holds the title-deed to property actually </span><span class="csC382D2BB">possesses</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the property. It is his already. Certainly from God&#39;s perspective, we already possess His promises; He has already seated us in the heavenlies, and we already possess eternal life. It is not that we are going to possess it; we already possess it. The point is this: holding the title-deed to property and possessing something is more than assurance and conviction. It is possessing reality, actually holding something that is substantial and real. It is possessing the land, the promises of God. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is possessing the substance of the promises of God, the evidence of things not seen. If I possess them, the substance is there; the evidence is there. The substance and evidence, the fact that I already possess them, are my assurance and conviction. This is important to note and bears repeating: the substance and evidence, the fact that I already possess eternal life, is the basis of my assurance and conviction, of never tasting and experiencing death.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is the </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">substance, the actual possession</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, of things hoped for, the </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">evidence and reality</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of things not seen. It is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">both an act and a possession</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of the thing believed. It is believing and trusting in that which actually exists&mdash;in that which we can possess. We may not be able to see it, but it is real and existing, and we can possess it by believing and having faith in it. We can possess it now&mdash;we cannot see it, but we can actually possess the very substance of it by believing and entrusting our lives to it.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">trusting and possessing</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> all that God is and says.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">believing and possessing</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> all that God is and says.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">having confidence in and possessing</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> all that God is and says.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Faith is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">hoping for something and possessing it</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> because God is (exists) and has promised it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Note what Biblical faith is not.

		</ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God is pleased, very pleased, when we believe Him and His promises. This is the point of this verse. The elders, great men of God who lived in the past, believed God and followed God. They turned away from the world and its possessions and pleasures and followed God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They believed God, that He had much more to offer&mdash;that His promises of an eternal land and of eternal life were true. Therefore they staked their lives, all they were and had, upon that hope. And their faith in God pleased God to no end. Therefore, God accepted their faith and has honored them because of it. He has, of course, honored them by recording their faith in His Word and using their example as a challenge to believers of every generation. But God has also honored them by fulfilling their faith; God has taken them on home to be with Him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The reward of faith is God&#39;s approval, and when God approves us, He accepts us into His eternal presence. This simply means that God looks after and cares for us, giving us victory over all the enemies of this world&mdash;including death&mdash;and He does it for eternity. The approval of God means that God fulfills all His promises to us. The promises of God become a living reality in our experiences, both daily and eternally.</span></p><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
