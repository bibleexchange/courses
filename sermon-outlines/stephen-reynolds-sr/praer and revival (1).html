The spirit of the prayer chamber must control our lives, or the hour in the prayer closet will be dull and sapless. Always praying in our spirits, always acting in the spirit of praying-these make our praying strong. The spirit of every moment is that which imparts strength to the communion of the prayer closet. It is what we are outside of the prayer closet that gives victory or brings defeat to the prayer closet. If the spirit of the world prevails in our non-closet hours, the spirit of the world will prevail in our closet hours, and that will be a vain and idle farce. - E.M. Bounds</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs71C8385E">We must live for God out of the prayer closet if we want to meet God in the prayer closet. We must bless God with praying lives if we want to have God&#39;s blessing in the prayer closet. We must do God&#39;s will in our lives if we want to have God&#39;s ear in the prayer closet. We must listen to God&#39;s voice in public if we want God to listen to our voice in private. God must have our hearts out of the prayer closet if we want to have God&#39;s presence in the prayer closet. If we want to have God in the prayer closet, God must have us out of the prayer closet. There is no way of praying to God, except by living to God. The prayer closet is not a confessional, simply, but the hour of holy communion, of high and sweet communication, and of intense intercession. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs71C8385E">It makes much difference whether we come to God as a criminal or a child; to be pardoned or to be approved; to settle scores or to be embraced; for punishment or for favor. Our praying, to be strong, must be buttressed by holy living. The name of Christ must be honored by our lives before it will honor our intercessions. The life of faith perfects the prayer of faith. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs71C8385E">Our lives not only give color to our praying, but they give body to it as well. Bad living leads inevitably to bad praying, and we pray feebly because we live feebly. The stream of praying cannot rise higher than the fountain of living. The force of the prayer closet is made up of the energy that flows from the confluent streams of living. Therefore, any feebleness of living will throw its faintness into our prayer chambers. We cannot talk to God strongly when we have not lived for God strongly. The prayer closet cannot be made holy to God when the life has not been holy to God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs71C8385E">&quot;We give ourselves to prayer.

We must patiently, believingly continue in prayer until we obtain an answer. Further, we have not only to continue in prayer until the end, but we have also to believe that God does hear us and will answer our prayers. Most frequently we fail in not continuing in prayer until the blessing is obtained, and in not expecting the blessing. Those who are disciples of the Lord Jesus should labor with all their might in the work of God as if everything depended upon their own endeavors. Yet, having done so, they should not in the least trust in their labor and efforts, nor in the means that they use for the spread of the truth, but in God alone; and they should with all earnestness seek the blessing of God in persevering, patient, and believing prayer. Here is the great secret of success, my Christian reader. Work with all your might, but never trust in your work. Pray with all your might for the blessing in God, but work at the same time with all diligence, with all patience, with all perseverance. Pray, then, and work. Work and pray. And still again pray, and then work. And so on, all the days of your life. The result will surely be abundant blessing. Whether you see much fruit or little fruit, such kind of service will be blessed.&quot; &ndash; George Muller</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs71C8385E">pray with authority, so that they might know how to take their stand in faith before the throne and rebuke the forces of evil, holding steady and firm, and gain the victory over them.
