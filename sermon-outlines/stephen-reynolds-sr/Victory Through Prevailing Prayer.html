			<li class="csE8AA8FF7"><span class="csC05134DD">The Amalekites attacked Israel while they were camped at Rephidim. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Why would the Amalekites attack Israel? No doubt, because they felt threatened. They were a desert people who lived just south of the promised land of Canaan. They had obviously heard about Israel being freed from Egypt and of their march to Canaan, somewhere between two to three million of them. To reach Canaan, this large mass of Israelites would have to march either through or close by the land of the Amalekites. The leaders of the Amalekites had no idea what Israel&#39;s intentions would be, to pass by their land in peace or to attack them. Consequently, the Amalekites launched a surprise attack against Israel. The attack was sudden, totally unexpected. facts need to be pointed out about the attack of the Amalekites.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">De 25:17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">18 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs821257DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">a.&nbsp;The attack was a surprise attack launched against a mass of civilians, not against an army, totally unprovoked and uncalled for. </span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">b.&nbsp;The Amalekites were set on annihilation of the Israelites, totally exterminating and erasing them from the face of the earth. They were driven by prejudice and bitter hatred against the Israelites, the same bitter prejudice held by many nations against the Jews down through the generations.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance...Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre (</span><span class="csD04A7434">Psalm 83:4</span><span class="csC05134DD">, <a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+83%3A7"><span class="csD04A7434">7</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">c.&nbsp;The Amalekites should have known that God had promised the land of Canaan to Israel. They should have known just as people today know that the Jews look upon the land of Palestine (Canaan) as the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">promised land</span><span class="csC05134DD"> given to them by God. But the Amalekites should have been aware of the fact far more than we are today. Why?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Because the Amalekites were the descendants of Esau, the twin brother of Jacob. And God had given the promise of the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">promised land </span><span class="csC05134DD">to Jacob and his descendants. Esau knew all about the promise. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Amalek was the grandson of Esau. His father, Eliphaz, was the oldest son of Esau. Esau would certainly have shared the great promises of God with both his son Eliphaz and his grandson Amalek (cp. </span><span class="csD04A7434">Genesis 36:15</span><span class="csC05134DD">).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Amalekites-distant cousins of the Israelites. They most likely knew about Israel&#39;s being promised the promised land of Canaan. </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csE8AA8FF7"><span class="csC05134DD">Moses appointed a commander to mobilize an army to defend Israel, the young man Joshua (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ex+17%3A9"><span class="csD04A7434">Exodus 17:9</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). </span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Remember, the attack was a surprise attack against those who lagged behind: the handicapped, sick, weary, and aged.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Where did Israel&#39;s armed forces get their weapons? they requested wages&mdash;back pay&mdash;for their slave labor. One of the requests would have been for weapons for protection and hunting purposes out in the wilderness of the desert, weapons such as swords and bows and arrows. This would have been a natural and understandable request. There is also a possibility that they were able to recover some weapons from the Egyptians when the army was drowned in the Red Sea. In addition, they would have been making what weapons they could as they marched along from place to place in their wilderness wanderings, weapons such as long spears, slingshots, bows and arrows, and shields.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;Note that Moses promised to seek God, to intercede for Joshua and the soldiers (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ex+17%3A9"><span class="csD04A7434">Exodus 17:9</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). Joshua was to fight; Moses was to pray. Moses promised to go to the top of the highest hill surrounding the battle field, to lift up the rod of God, appealing and calling out to God in prayer. The rod of God was looked upon as the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Banner</span><span class="csC05134DD"> of Israel. Consequently, when they saw the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">rod of God</span><span class="csC05134DD">&mdash;their banner&mdash;lifted high, they knew that God&#39;s servant was crying out to God. They were encouraged and motivated to fight beyond their strength. They knew that God would give them the victory over their enemy. The point is this: Moses promised the warriors of Israel that he would be their intercessor, their prayer-warrior.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">When enemies attack us, our only hope is the Lord, going before Him and crying out for help.
