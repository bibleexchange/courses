Ray Stedman once said, &quot;God has many intimates, but no favorites.&quot; The Shulamite represents the ordinary believer in Christ who desires a more intimate walk with God. In order to achieve this, one first draws near to God in prayer, giving up the other loves (such as the love of the world) in the process.<br/><br/>An old acrostic for Faith is Forsaking All I Take Him. We can not claim the close fellowship symbolized by the royal courts and inner chamber of the king if we cling to the idolatrous lusts of the world. Spiritual adultery and worldliness are the bane of our generation. &quot;Do not love the world or the things in the world. If any one loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world passes away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.&quot; (I John 2:15-17) James, the brother of Jesus is even stronger in his rebuke, &quot;You adulteresses!

Catching a glimpse of the Bridegroom in His magnificence causes us to be immediately aware of our own plainness and lowly background. How can this ordinary Bedouin girl hope to attain to the stature worthy of the royal palace of the King?<br/><br/>Hannah---and later Mary the Mother of Jesus, (see Luke 1:46-55)---would give special praise to the God who raises the poor from obscurity, and reduces the self-important to nothingness: &quot;My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in thy salvation. There is none holy like the LORD, there is none besides thee; there is no rock like our God. Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength. Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn. The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up. The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts. He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD&#39;S, and on them he has set the world. He will guard the feet of his faithful ones; but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might shall a man prevail. The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed.&quot; (1 Samuel 2:1-10)</span></h4>

Boaz is a type of Christ who takes a gentile bride, covering her with his protection, &quot;And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she [Ruth] came softly, and uncovered his feet, and lay down. At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet!

Her own &quot;brothers&quot; (another picture of fellow-believers in the family of God) have arbitrarily assigned her to tending their vineyards, however as yet she has no sense of her own ministry or her own special vineyard. This is often the situation of a new believer who must be assigned, sometimes arbitrarily, to ministries in the church until he and she begins to long for a call from God and the assignment of a life-work.

			<span class="cs16E84F30">After offering the compliment, &quot;O fairest among women&quot; Solomon tactfully proceeds to introduce two negative references. The first is to horses and the second to Pharaoh&#39;s chariots. Horses were not native to Israel, but came from Egypt and Moses had warned the people against going to war in the style and manner of the nations round about them, &quot;When you come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and you possess it and dwell in it, and then say, `I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me&#39;; you may indeed set as king over you him whom the LORD your God will choose. One from among your brethren you shall set as king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother. Only he must not multiply horses for himself, or cause the people to return to Egypt in order to multiply horses, since the LORD has said to you, `You shall never return that way again.&#39; And he shall not multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away; nor shall he greatly multiply for himself silver and gold. And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law, from that which is in the charge of the Levitical priests; and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes, and doing them; that his heart may not be lifted up above his brethren, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, either to the right hand or to the left; so that he may continue long in his kingdom, he and his children, in Israel.&quot; (Deut. 17:14-20) <br/><br/>It seems as if this warning was intended to apply to a specific situation---400 years ahead in time---because Solomon is the very king who multiplied horses greatly, and took 300 wives and 700 concubines. &quot;Solomon also had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.&quot; (I Kings 4:26) Horses symbolize the strength and energy of the flesh, and the Jews were not to reply on Egyptian chariots in waging war. In observing the maiden, the King perceives that Shulamite has not yet to fight spiritual warfare with the divine and superior weaponry of Ephesians 6.</span></h4>

The groom is merely an accessory nervously appearing late in the show in an ordinary black and white rented penguin suit from the local tuxedo store. Eastern weddings feature the Groom more prominently. However no wedding would be a good match if the Groom brought all the assets and the poor Bride had none. <br/><br/>Yet this is the situation of the church as the elected Bride of Christ. All the resources are His to begin with. The Holy Spirit must win her from her previous fallen state of being lost in sin, cleanse her life, and equip her with a wedding dowry. (See the illustration of this principle in Ezekiel Chapter 16---referring to Israel as the wife of Yahweh and her lowly origins and lack of pedigree). On the wedding date the Bride of Christ will in fact be presented whole and complete. &quot;...Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.&quot; (Eph. 5:25-27) This is made even more clear by the Apostle John at the end of the book of the Revelation: &quot;Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready; it was granted her to be clothed with fine linen, bright and pure&quot;--for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. And the angel said to me, &quot;Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.&quot; (Rev. 19:7-9)<br/>An Interlude of unknown duration now follows.

There they made him a supper; Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at table with him. Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said, &#39;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii [a year&#39;s wages] and given to the poor?&#39; This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it.

Not only did Jesus suffer beyond our comprehension in order to redeem us, all of his followers are called to suffer also. &quot;Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ&#39;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church...&quot; (Col. 1:24) &quot;Do not be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel in the power of God...&quot; (2 Tim. 1:8) &quot;...if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God.&quot; (1 Peter 4:16)</span></h4>

He leads me beside still waters; he restores my soul...&quot; (Psalm 23:1-3) <br/><br/>It should not be necessary to mention the implicit holiness and purity of the lovers&#39; relationship in Canticles. There is no hint of lust or covetousness or of spiritual uncleanness of defilement in their relationship. &quot;Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous.&quot; (Hebrews 13:4). Does the Song of Solomon apply, then, only to married couples and not to single men and women? Certainly not, for the analogy of normal, monogamous, heterosexual marriage is applied to the nature of the relationship of Christ with His church in Ephesians 4, and the church is made up of boys and girls, single as well as married, widowed and divorced, young and old. Neither is it necessary to be married to be a complete person. Colossians 2:10 says clearly, &quot;you are complete in Him, who is the head of all rule and authority.&quot; In <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/YinYang.shtml"><span class="csCE466166">Yin, Yang, the Tao, and Wholeness</span></a></span><span class="cs16E84F30"> I have attempted to discuss the inner wholeness of each individual in Christ which is the goal of the process of sanctification in every individual believer. <br/><br/>The issue of sexual purity whether single or married is of paramount importance in our generation.

Strong cedar beams form the supports and beams, softer pine (probably Phoenician Juniper) is used for the paneling and lesser structural members. The cedar referred to is the well-known cedar of Lebanon used in the Temple. &quot;Wood&quot; in the Bible typifies &quot;humanity.&quot; A marriage relationship consists of two human beings (one man and one woman) being joined to each other so as to become &quot;one flesh.&quot; A new house, a new relationship, in which both contribute in equal measure is the result. The word &quot;house&quot; is plural, but used in a singular sense. An extended dwelling---gardens, orchards and other dwelling places are all &quot;home&quot; for the lovers. &quot;In my Father&#39;s house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.&quot; (John 14:2-3)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">No chapter break should have been inserted here. The old hymn which says, &quot;He&#39;s the lily of the valleys, the bright and morning star,&quot; referring to Christ, is probably taken from this verse. However it is Shulamite who is speaking. The rose here is probably the sea daffodil, or &quot;lily of the coast,&quot; and the lily in the next phrase a variety of narcissus.</span></h4>

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Yet a third variety of narcissus seems to be mentioned here. Shulamite&#39;s beauty---because of her pursuit of spirituality and intimacy with her Lord---stands out from the other maidens as a lily in a patch of thorns. The term &quot;my love&quot; is plural in Hebrew. Our Lord Jesus does not have only one believer in all the world with whom he enjoys this intimate relationship. All believers are welcome to enter into that class of intimacy that the Shulamite typifies. In the eyes of the world, God&#39;s intimate friends are obscure, unknown, unimportant. To God they are all exquisite flowers in the midst of the brier patch of the world. &quot;...Others suffered mocking and scourging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated---</span><span class="cs22E53A08">of whom the world was not worthy</span><span class="cs16E84F30">---wandering over deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not receive what was promised, since God had foreseen something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.&quot; (Hebrews 11:36-40)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">The fruit here is probably the citron, not our common apple. The leaves do not fall off in winter, and the fruit looks like a pomegranate but tastes like a lemony tangerine. Shulamite notes that her Beloved stands out as unique among all the trees of the forest, and among all the sons of Adam. Trees in the Bible are pictures of manhood, as for example in Psalm 1, &quot;Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff which the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.&quot;</span></h4>

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">

The banqueting house is &quot;the house of wine,&quot; i.e., the house of joy and gladness. &quot;Having, therefore, experienced an initial dedication and having been taken through a deeper experience of the Cross, there is a fuller realization of all that the Lord has wrought for her and made available to her...&quot; (Nee) A great feast accompanies the gathering of all believers in heaven, (see <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/Msup.html"><span class="csCE466166">The Coming Marriage Feast of Jesus Christ),</span></a></span><span class="cs16E84F30"> &quot;I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.&quot; (Matthew 8:11, 12) &quot;Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father&#39;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide yourselves with purses that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast, so that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes; truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them sit at table, and he will come and serve them. If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those servants!&quot; (Luke 12:32-38)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Incidentally, Proverbs 7 gives us a description of the counterfeit to this picture of the banqueting house of a godly marriage and/or a pure love relationship between the believer and the Lord, uncompromised by spiritual or physical adultery. In Proverbs Lady Wisdom pictures redeemed femininity. The father then warns his son in Proverbs (a book also attributed largely by Solomon)---of the seductive snares of the harlot. There are two symbolic women in the Bible---antithetical to one another---the harlot and the bride. There are two cities in the Bible which represent the same contrasts of the true and false church, Mystery Babylon the Great, and the New Jerusalem.</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Intense emotional experiences with the Lord, &quot;mountain-top&quot; awareness of the splendor and majesty of God such as one experiences at a retreat or conference usually are followed by a return to the reality of the valley of shadows below. The result is often &quot;lovesickness.&quot; Emotions have perhaps been overwhelmed, the mind, imagination and world-view stretched to the limits. The return to the reality of daily living &quot;in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation&quot; leaves us in need of special sustenance, of grace, and the undergirding of God&#39;s watchful care. Recovery from &quot;lovesickness&quot; requires rest as well as the strengthening spiritual foods represented by raisins and apples.</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">O that his left hand were under my head, <br/>and that his right hand embraced me! <br/><br/>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, <br/>by the gazelles or the hinds of the field, <br/>that you stir not up nor awaken love<br/>until it please. </span></h4>
		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Hinds and gazelle are swift footed animals and indicate that love, (and also sexual desire), when awakened, intensify and easily push us further than we intended to go. Two extremes exist in the spiritual life. One is the extreme of legalism, traditionalism, mindless ritual and dead orthodoxy. The other danger is excessive emotionalism and the seeking-after of religious experience as an end in itself. The latter leads to deceptive and even false spiritual realities. Unless the believer stays grounded in the Word and in the mundane world, he or she can easily be side-tracked from a balanced walk of faith. Shulamite warns her companions to not stir up nor awaken love until the proper time and place. The advice of this verse is repeated in 3:5 and 8:4. <br/><br/>&quot;Falling in love&quot; as an experience of young lovers has a certain innocence and beauty about it, but seldom do the lovers see one another clearly. Time and further interaction are necessary for them to withdraw their projections on each other and to discover what they really have in common. When an unaware person, who does not know himself or herself very well, first discovers the opposite sex, or first experiences a real dose of the grace of God, the resulting awakening in the unconscious can be accompanied by powerful projections onto others. Carl Jung&#39;s goal in his approach to psychology was what he called &quot;Individuation.&quot; My close friend Kenny Ammann has compared Jung&#39;s concept with Biblical wholeness in a paper prepared for a Stanford psychology class <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/individ.html"><span class="csCE466166">Individuation and the Biblical Concept of Wholeness.</span></a></span><span class="cs16E84F30"> <br/><br/>&quot;...the aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith.&quot; (I Timothy 1:5)<br/><br/>It is now a season of rest in the story of Solomon and Shulamite. An interlude of time of unknown duration follows before the narrative continues. &quot;The summary of the first part of the Song is this: First in the opening section she sees the value of the cross, but not the full reality of the life of resurrection nor the power of it. Second, the peril of the first phase is that of being over-indulgent in a form of inward communion which leaves her exhausted. Third, submission to the cross and the true meaning of dedication with its proper application to life is still unknown to her. Since there has been no real proving of her, she has not yet actually taken up the cross. She still has not walked far enough in that way which brings the testing of the cross. Fourth, still another peril is that she only realizes as yet how precious the Lord has been to her. In other words, she has only been on the receiving end of the fruits of the Lord&#39;s labor on her behalf, but has not allowed the Lord to claim the fruits of His labor in her. That is, she has the Lord, but the Lord has not yet gained all of her.&quot; (Nee, p40)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Our natural tendency is self-centeredness, maintaining the status quo and living life out of a sense of merely following duty and obligation. We need to hear the call of our Lord to venture forth so that we can be stretched by the exercise of faith once again. Ray Stedman says, &quot;resurrection power...is different; it is not like any other power. It isn&#39;t the power of a strong personality nor of an educated mind. It isn&#39;t the power of a good family background nor of money nor numbers nor leadership ability. It is the power that raised Christ from the dead, that is able to bring life out of death. What does that mean in practical terms? Well, it means, as I have often said, that it works best in a cemetery. If you are living in a cemetery, if everything is dead and dull and lifeless around you---try resurrection power. That is what it is for. It means that this power takes no notice at all of obstacles, just as Jesus rose from the dead, paying no attention to the stone, to the decrees of Caesar, to the fulminations of the Jewish priests, nor to the guard in front of the tomb. Resurrection power doesn&#39;t pay any attention to obstacles. It just surges on ahead, leaves the problems up to God, and goes on. It means that resurrection power requires no outside support. It doesn&#39;t rely upon someone else, nor upon something else. It doesn&#39;t need a vote of confidence. It doesn&#39;t require any kind of undergirding expressions of support from anybody. It can operate alone, completely alone, if necessary. And it means that it makes no noise or display. It doesn&#39;t try to arrest attention by some publicity stunt. It just works quietly and, without any noise, effects its transformation, brings life out of death.&quot; (Ray C. Stedman, Messages on Ephesians)</span></h4>

I will accept no bull from your house, nor he-goat from your folds. For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the birds of the air, and all that moves in the field is mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world and all that is in it is mine. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High; and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me...&#39; &#39;Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I rend, and there be none to deliver!

			<span class="cs16E84F30">The words &quot;window&quot; and &quot;lattice&quot; are plural in Hebrew. The wall stands for the believer&#39;s separation from the world. &quot;Do not be mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, &#39;I will live in them and move among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Therefore come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.&#39;&quot; (2 Cor. 6:14-18) It is springtime, spiritually speaking. In Christian life we all experiences dry and fallow times, and we all endure barren winters. &quot;Times of refreshing&quot; (Acts 3:19) and renewal are however sent to us from the Lord.<br/><br/>We are creatures of habit, falling easily into comfortable routines. Shulamite speaks of &quot;our wall&quot; indicating she wants to have her safe, protected, sheltered private relationship with God. The wall of separation from the world has also become a wall insulating her from the hurts and pains of the world. God is very much involved in the world, and He does so in fresh new ways. Either we respond to his call and venture forth with Him, or we shall be left out altogether.</span></h4>

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">When Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the Law He asked God if he, Moses, could see the face of God. &quot;Moses said, &#39;I pray thee, show me thy glory.&#39; And he said, &#39;I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you my name &quot;The LORD&quot;; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,&#39; he said, &#39;you cannot see my face; for man shall not see me and live.&#39; And the LORD said, &quot;Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand upon the rock; and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.&quot; (Exodus 33:18-23)<br/><br/>&quot;For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.&quot; (John 1:18-19) In the New Testament Paul tells us how it is that by faith we look into the face of Jesus and are transformed into His likeness, &quot;Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.&quot; (2 Cor. 3:16-18)<br/><br/>Here in the Song of Solomon, the roles are reversed. It is the Bridegroom who longs to see the face and hear the voice of His Bride while they sojourn in the mountains. In the course of the story, the Bride becomes more like the Bridegroom---she is transformed by her times with him. That is exactly how it is with us as believers. We are destined to be conformed to his likeness. However, in the Song, Solomon is also changed by his relationship with the maiden. He acquires many of the Bride&#39;s fine qualities and becomes like her. An evenly balanced marriage is one in which each partner contributes towards the emerging wholeness of the other. One-sided marriages, though common today, are sad.<br/>The &quot;cleft in the rock,&quot; or the &quot;rock which was cleft&quot; speaks of the cross. We are hidden in the rock while judgment passes over the world, as Noah and his family were hidden in the Ark. There are approximately 100 references to God as our rock, a verse by verse study is very profitable. &quot;The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.&quot; (Psalm 18:2)---is one example. To be &quot;in the rock&quot; is to be identified with Christ in his death, burial and resurrection. In our early Christian experience we focus on what Christ has done and can do for us. We think little about His own interests in the world. Further dying to self is required of us to see this. &quot;But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith; that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that if possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.&quot; (Philippians 3:7-12)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">At the beginning of their relationship Shulamite had no unique ministry and calling of her own. She had asked the Chief Shepherd where He could be found tending his flocks, (1:7) at noontime. He directed her at that time to &quot;follow in the footsteps of the flock,&quot; that is to place herself and her converts (&quot;her kids&quot;) under the care of an undershepherd in a local assembly. AS Shulamite&#39;s spiritual experience deepens she now reveals to us that she knows full well how to find the Chief Shepherd and where it is He may be found tending his flocks. As a result of her venturing-forth from her self-centered routines, she has been able to take part in the work of God in the world. The experience of Christians who volunteer for missions projects around the world always return with new excitement about what God is doing in the world. God&#39;s work is not reported in the daily newspapers, nor are God&#39;s special servants noticed or recognized by the world. &quot;We [apostles] are fools for Christ&#39;s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things.&quot; (1 Cor. 4:10-13)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">&quot;Night&quot; refers to the time when Jesus the Lord, the &quot;Sun of Righteousness&quot; is visible absent from the earth. He rules over the universe now from heaven, but He does not yet reign on the earth. Thus it is that we pray, &quot;Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven...&quot; The approaching of Dawn signifies the coming of the Lord Jesus in power and splendor. &quot;And we have the prophetic word made more sure. You will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.&quot; (2 Peter 1:19). Until Christ returns His presence and power are with us by the enablements of the indwelling Holy Spirit. &quot;Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the age.&quot; <br/><br/>An interlude of unknown duration now follows. The next visit of the King will challenge the Shulamite to become involved in a self-giving way in the chief interests of His, out in the world. God&#39;s heart of love and compassion is ever on the lost but few are willing to join him in his main concerns. &quot;Jesus said to them, &#39;My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. Do you not say, &quot;There are yet four months, then comes the harvest&quot;? I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see how the fields are already white for harvest. He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.&#39;&quot; (John 4:34-36)</span></h4>

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">It is night. (The Hebrew is plural, &quot;nights,&quot; indicating many nights.) The king is absent from the royal palace. The darkness, fears, troubles, anxieties and cares of the world press in upon the Shulamite. She longs for the visible comfort and personal presence of her Beloved. All Christians at times have seasons when they feel abandoned by God, alone and forsaken. This is not the actual reality for Jesus has said, &quot;I will never [ever] fail your nor forsake you.&quot; Yet when we feel emotionally unsupported, or when our fears mount we usually panic and begin to act upon our doubts and fears. Shulamite does that now. Her calls for her Beloved go unheeded. <br/><br/>Our Lord understands even more completely than we can the feeling of abandonment by God. As Psalm 22 and the gospels reveal, Jesus was actually forsaken by God because He had been made sin for us. The Father turned His face from Him so that He died utterly alone. No one who knows Jesus as Lord will ever suffer this degree of estrangement from God! <br/><br/>&quot;What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, will he not also give us all things with him? Who shall bring any charge against God&#39;s elect? It is God who justifies; who is to condemn? Is it Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us? Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, &#39;For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.&#39; No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot; (Rom. 8:31-39)</span></h4>

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Rising from one&#39;s place of rest in fear and panic means reverting to the flesh, to self-effort. It is a departure from a life of &quot;resting in Christ&quot; which marks the walk of those who have entered Canaan land and who know what is called God&#39;s <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/Rest.html"><span class="csCE466166">&quot;rest.&quot; </span></a></span></h4>

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">It is inappropriate for the experienced, more mature believer who has known the Lord deeply for sometime to rush out into the public streets asking where the Lord may be found. She of all people should know better than anyone! The &quot;watchman&quot; on the walls are the soldiers and guards of the king who protect the city and palace by night. Ezekiel (3:17) and Hosea (9:8) are specifically named as watchmen over Israel for the Lord. The Lord, however is the true protector of his people, &quot;Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.&quot; (Psalm 127:1) In Christian experience we do have watchmen in the church who look out for us, &quot;Obey [be persuaded by] your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account. Let them do this joyfully, and not sadly, for that would be of no advantage to you.&quot; (Heb. 13:7)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Fortunately this test of Shulamite&#39;s faith is short-lived. The same test, more severe next time, begins in 5:2. Though slightly delayed, this time the answer to her prayers comes promptly. (For delays in answers to prayers, Daniel 10 offers some insights). </span></h3>
		<h3 class="cs44694EDE">
			<span class="cs16E84F30"><br/><br/>Scarcely had I passed them, <br/>when I found him whom my soul loves. <br/>I held him, and would not let him go<br/>until I had brought him into my mother&#39;s house, <br/>and into the chamber of her that conceived me. </span></h3>
		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">In ordinary human relationships it is easy to become dependent upon a friend or our spouse to the point where we cling or seek to manipulate, possess, or control the other. This easily becomes idolatry because we put another person ahead of God in our desires to have a tangible person meeting all our needs and helping us every step of the way. It is also selfish for us to violate the freedom and integrity of the other person by demanding of them what we should be seeking from God.<br/><br/>Having found again her Beloved, Shulamite determines that He shall not leave her again. Her more complete surrender to him is symbolized by the phrase, &quot;until I had brought him into my mother&#39;s house and into the chamber of her that conceived her.&quot; Women know more about motherhood and femininity than men do. They are emotionally deeper than men. For a man, masculinity is born out of an underlying sea of femininity. This is true of the embryo in a mother&#39;s womb since all fetuses begin as female. Male hormones override female hormones in males producing sexual differentiation. In childhood, boys must reach out and bond with the same sex: with fathers, brothers, uncles, etc. Girls do not need to break their identity bonds with their mothers to such a degree. In marriage, men can rediscover again the lost secrets of femininity, though it is risky to do so. For a woman to own, possess, manipulate, and control a man places his fragile male ego at risk. We say that such men are still &quot;tied to their mother&#39;s apron strings&quot; or that they &quot;need to cut the umbilical cord.&quot; Though Freud&#39;s concept of the Oedipal Complex is secular, there is truth in the archetypal model of the missing father and the son who never grows up. I have attempted to discuss this complex theme in <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/Aberrant.html"><span class="csCE466166">Aberrant Sexuality in the Bible</span></a></span></h4>

Neither can we put a Sovereign God in a box of our own making. He will not be so contained. &quot;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.&quot; (Isaiah 55:8, 9) See <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/quotes.shtml"><span class="csCE466166">A Prayer to The Ordinary God</span></a></span><span class="cs16E84F30"> on my &quot;Favorite Quotations page.<br/><br/>Another interlude follows.

The Lord, we see, is still in a passive state in relation to her. A period of time must now elapse while she is at this stage of development in her spiritual affections...In Part 3 we immediately perceive an unprecedented progress.

The Daughters of Jerusalem take note of a great wedding procession of the king returning to Jerusalem. Exodus 13:21-22 says, &quot;And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night; the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.&quot;</span></h4>

Myrrh again depicts suffering love. <br/><br/>&quot;...another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God.

We have a foreview in these select military men, Jesus the Captain of the Armies of the Lord and a company of men and women of faith in every generation who serve at his side. They are experienced veterans of spiritual warfare. &quot;The LORD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him, my father&#39;s God, and I will exalt him.

However Moses says, &quot;Therefore (for the cause of marriage) a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.&quot; (Gen. 2:24). A man&#39;s deeper ties are to his own mother and must be renounced. No marriage will succeed if mothers-in-law attempt to control, manipulate of dominate. Solomon&#39;s mother here relinquishes her natural rights to her son.

		<h4 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The symbolic use of &quot;mother&quot; as a type is brought out in one of the few allegories in the Bible. &quot;Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written, &#39;Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout, you who are not in travail; for the children of the desolate one are many more than the children of her that is married.&#39; Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise. But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now. But what does the scripture say? &#39;Cast out the slave and her son; for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.&#39; So, brethren, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.&quot; (Gal. 4:24-31). Jerusalem above, &quot;the mother of us all,&quot; like the woman &quot;Wisdom&quot; in Proverbs, represents nurturing grace. She stands in opposition to the bondage of the world and the law which leads the unwary to Sheol as does the &quot;seductive woman&quot; of Proverbs.<br/><br/>The Daughters of Zion are all invited to the wedding feast. The Parable of the Wise and Foolish virgins (Matthew 25) comes to mind.

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The eyes reveal much about a person. The eyes symbolize spiritual discernment as well, &quot;He who has eyes to see, let him see...&quot; The dove is of course a well-know symbol of (1) the Holy Spirit and (2) peace, and (3) purity in the Bible. The veil symbolizes the fact that the beauty of the Bride is reserved for the eyes of the Bridegroom only, not for the world. &quot;Likewise you wives, be submissive to your husbands, so that some, though they do not obey the word, may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, when they see your reverent and chaste behavior. Let not yours be the outward adorning with braiding of hair, decoration of gold, and wearing of fine clothing, but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God&#39;s sight is very precious. So once the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves and were submissive to their husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.&quot; (1 Peter 3:3-6)<br/><br/>&quot;...for the LORD sees not as man sees; man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.&quot; (I Sam. 16:7)<br/><br/>Spiritual perceptions and deeper truth are not for the world, nor can such truths be comprehended by the carnal and immature. &quot;Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you.&quot; (Matthew 7:6)</span></h4>

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">

New Christians are able only to assimilate &quot;the milk of the word,&quot; mature believers can handle the &quot;strong meat of the word.&quot; &quot;I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready...(1 Cor. 3:2); &quot;For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need some one to teach you again the first principles of God&#39;s word.

		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The lips are the channel of our speech, expressing what is in our hearts (53 references to the lips may be found in Psalms and Proverbs alone). The scarlet thread speaks of redeemed speech. Pure speech is, of course, a mark of spiritual maturity. The contrast between the unrighteous and the righteous is clear in this regard. Of the unrighteous, &quot;Their throat is an open grave, they use their tongues to deceive.&quot; &quot;The venom of asps is under their lips.&quot; (Romans 3:13) For believers, &quot;Through him [Jesus] then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.&quot; (Hebrews 13:15) &quot;He that would love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking guile.&quot; (1 Peter 3:10)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">The neck in scripture represents the will. When we repeatedly make the wrong choices in life we become weak-willed, and we also come into bondage to sin and lose our discernment.

Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us conduct ourselves becomingly as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.&quot; (Romans 13:11-14) &quot;I Jesus have sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star.&quot; (Rev. 22:16)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Sanctification is a life-long process. For the Lord to look at the believer and find &quot;no flaw&quot; is amazing. The biographies of such godly saints as John Calvin or Martin Luther reveal that individuals whom God has greatly used may sometimes exhibit great faults even to the end of their lives. The visible church usually looks pathetic, weak and beggarly in comparison with the woman described in Song of Solomon. Yet it is the guarantee of the Lord Jesus that His Bride the true church will appear before him on His wedding, &quot;without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.&quot; (Ephesians 5:27) Jude&#39;s benediction (v 24, 25) affirms this, &quot;Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you without blemish before the presence of his glory with rejoicing, to the only God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.&quot;</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">It makes more sense for the Bridegroom to call his Bride to journey with him &quot;to&quot; the mountains rather than &quot;from&quot; the mountains. The preposition &quot;min&quot; is usually translated &quot;from&quot; but several commentators (Ref. 2 and 4 for example) agree that these verse make the best sense if the calling is into or to these distant mountain places. Lebanon is to the North of Israel and on the border are the tall peaks of Hermon and Senir. Journeying into the mountains is dangerous because leopards and lions dwell there. &quot;Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experience of suffering is required of your brotherhood throughout the world. And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you.&quot; (I Peter 4:8-10) In the New Testament spiritual warfare is fought in the heavenly places: &quot;For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.&quot; (Ephesians 6:12) The fresh mountain air and fragrances of pine and flowers is exhilarating, but there is now also the added danger of spiritual pride and aloofness setting in, perhaps even a disdain for one&#39;s fellow believers who seem always to prefer living in the valley below.<br/><br/>&quot;Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false, and does not swear deceitfully.

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Amazingly the King finds his companion a match for him. She has power with once glance of her eyes to ravish (greatly stir up) his heart. In the course of the Song of Solomon the man and the woman seem to mature together. Attributes that Shulamite once assigned to Solomon are now hers. Their individual lives remain evenly balanced and they are seen as growing in maturity together. In our individual relationship with Jesus with bring nothing of our own when we pledge ourselves to Him. But immediately the Holy Spirit begins to endow us with a capacity to respond to Him. To our amazement we find that God seeks for and enjoys our companionship. Once again we need to think of the Bride of the Lamb as being endowed day by day with the resources that will make her a fitting Bride for the King of kings. While the first Adam had a single wife, namely Eve, the Bride of the Last Adam is not one woman, but a great company of millions of the redeemed, male and female, &quot;of every tribe and nation&quot; who collectively make up what is called in Scripture &quot;the Bride of Christ.&quot;</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">The term &quot;sister&quot; speaks of deeper intimacy. Lovers in a marriage are also friends and also members of the same family. At the beginning of the story it was Solomon&#39;s love that was better than wine. His fragrance was superior to the finest oil and spices. Now it is Solomon who says these things about Shulamite&#39;s love. From whence did she acquire these characteristics? Obviously this is the working of the same Holy Spirit who has filled the Bridegroom from the beginning. Hebrews 2:11, speaking of the union of the Lord Jesus with His people says, &quot;For he who sanctifies [makes whole] and those who are sanctified [made whole] have all one origin [body]. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren.&quot;</span></h4>

Natural sweetness in a believer is a starting place to build upon. &quot;Milk&quot; represents the elementary truth of the Bible, the food for the newborn which quickly establishes them in their faith. &quot;I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready.&quot; (1 Cor. 3:2); &quot;For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need some one to teach you again the first principles of God&#39;s word. You need milk, not solid food; for every one who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a child.&quot; (Heb. 13:12-13) &quot;Like newborn babes, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up to salvation; for you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. Come to him, to that living stone, rejected by men but in God&#39;s sight chosen and precious; and like living stones be yourselves built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&quot; (1 Peter 2:2-3)</span></h4>

There shall no more be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him; they shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads. And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign forever and ever.&quot; (Rev. 22:1-5) <br/><br/>The garden is locked---it is an oriental walled garden not open to the public, but for the private pleasure and use of the owner. The sealed fountain speaks not only of the pure spring of the water of the Holy Spirit, but of the protected sanctity of the marriage covenant. &quot;Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous.&quot; (Hebrews 13:4)</span></h4>

Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol; 6 she does not take heed to the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it. And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth. Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house; lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless; lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of an alien; and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed, and you say, &#39;How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!

Why should you be infatuated, my son, with a loose woman and embrace the bosom of an adventuress? For a man&#39;s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he watches all his paths.

Let us have no self-conceit, no provoking of one another, no envy of one another.&quot; (Galatians 5:23-26) <br/><br/>Shulamite demonstrates that she has now moved beyond a quest for what God can do for her, to an understanding that God wishes to produce fruit in her life. &quot;As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.&quot; (Matthew 13:23) The stern warning which opens the 6th Chapter of Hebrews reflects the concern of the Holy Spirit for a group of Christians to move from mere profession of faith into bearing fruit.

One class of non-believers is drawn by the attractiveness and beauty of Christ within us.

In Christian experience God never leaves us, but He often withdraws a sense of His presence to test us. Will we walk by faith, acting upon what He has declared to be true, or will be panic and fall back on emotions or the reasoning of the flesh? New Christians experience lots of feedback from the Lord--He holds our hand as it were while we learn to walk. Later He provides us with less immediate feedback. Severe tests of our faith are often accompanied by a sense that God has completely forsaken us. To a test of this magnitude Job replied, &quot;Though He slay me, yet will I trust him.&quot; Habakkuk&#39;s severe test of faith brought finally his confession, &quot;Though the fig tree do not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

Then he said to them, &#39;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&#39; And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, &#39;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.&#39; And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, &#39;So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&#39; Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, &#39;My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done.&#39; And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, &#39;Are you still sleeping and taking your rest?

Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.&#39;&quot; (Matthew 26:36-46)<br/><br/>&quot;In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for his godly fear.&quot; (Hebrews 5:7)</span></h4>

They want to be taken out of the harmful, painful effects of their selfish ways and then allowed to go right back to being selfish. Nobody is concerned about God&#39;s glory and about being taught by God and learning at his hand and at his feet. Rather, they are simply crying out for deliverance, they want to use God, and to that kind of an appeal God is silent. I think this is why our prayers are often unanswered. Our selfishness has produced agony in our life and all we want is to escape the penalty; we are not at all concerned about God himself. And that is one reason for God&#39;s silence.&quot; (Ray C.

But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O LORD. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of thy steadfast love answer me. With thy faithful help rescue me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters. Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me. Answer me, O LORD, for thy steadfast love is good; according to thy abundant mercy, turn to me. Hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in distress, make haste to answer me. Draw near to me, redeem me, set me free because of my enemies! Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to thee. Insults have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&quot; (Psalm 69:12-21)<br/><br/>In this case her lapse of faith and emotional panic was not and could not be understood by the &quot;watchmen&quot; of the city. Her actions were inconsistent with what they had previously known her to be as a pillar of faith in the community. It is common for fellow believers to misunderstand some of the major trials that come to the more mature. We may not receive from others help and compassion, but rather ill-treatment.

The maiden quickly recovers her composure and her faith is restored. Though she has not yet &quot;found&quot; her Beloved, by faith she speaks of her past experience of His grace and presence. &quot;Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.&quot; Her description of the King is now filled with superlatives. Her description reveals His perfect manhood and maturity. A different set of metaphors and symbols is employed by the Holy Spirit when the wholeness and maturity of Shulamite is described poetically in Chapter 7.</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">In Revelation 1, Jesus in His present state of glory has &quot;hair as white as snow&quot;---&quot;and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden girdle round his breast; his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters; in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth issued a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.&quot; (Rev. 1:13-16) <br/><br/>Gold symbols His Deity, hair pictures strength. Godly, righteous men in the church are known as &quot;pillars&quot; in the New Testament, (Galatians 2:9). <br/><br/>The voice of the Lord is sweet, yet like the sound of many waters. &quot;And those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the LORD; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.&quot; (Zechariah 6:15). There are many references to the &quot;voice of the Lord&quot; in the Bible. For example, Psalm 29, &quot;Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. Ascribe to the LORD the glory of his name; worship the LORD in holy array. The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD, upon many waters. The voice of the LORD is powerful, the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars, the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon. He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox. The voice of the LORD flashes forth flames of fire. The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness, the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. The voice of the LORD makes the oaks to whirl, and strips the forests bare; and in his temple all cry, &#39;Glory!&#39; The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD sits enthroned as king forever.

May the LORD bless his people with peace!&quot;<br/><br/>One appearance of <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/AngelL.html"><span class="csCE466166">The Angel of the Lord</span></a></span><span class="cs16E84F30"> is given us in the New Testament. This unique angel, clearly the Son of God appearing in human form, is the Captain of the Hosts of the Lord. &quot;Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire. He had a little scroll open in his hand.

You are my friends if you do what I command you.

And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, `Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.&#39; Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.&quot; (Luke 15:4-7)</span></h4>
		<h4 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">I am my beloved&#39;s and my beloved is mine; <br/>he pastures his flock among the lilies. <br/><br/>Solomon:<br/><br/>You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, comely as Jerusalem, <br/>terrible as an army with banners. <br/>Turn away your eyes from me, for they disturb me. <br/>Your hair is like a flock of goats, moving down the slopes of Gilead. <br/>Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, that have come up from the washing, <br/>all of them bear twins, not one among them is bereaved. <br/>Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. <br/>There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, <br/>and maidens without number. </span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Shulamite has not only attended to the gardens, vineyards, and orchards, but 60 from the Daughters of Jerusalem have chosen to pursue her same path of intimacy with the King, and 80 more young maidens have joined the company of the redeemed. These developments among her fellow pilgrims may be attributed to the willingness of Shulamite to be used of the Lord in drawing others around her into a deeper walk with Him. <br/><br/>Since we know in real life that Solomon departed from a monogamous marriage, and not only had many wives and many concubines, many of which were by no means believers, it is tempting to read back into the Song of Solomon Solomon&#39;s subsequent biography. I think this should be avoided. The Song seems to reflect Solomon&#39;s&#39; better early years before his spiritual decline began.</span></h4>

Every one of God&#39;s children receives personally attention. He has only sons and daughters in his household, no grandchildren and no step-children.<br/><br/>If God is the Father of all believers then who is the mother of the believer? Evidently this must be the church which nourishes the believer from new birth throughout life. Adam is the father of his race, while Eve is called &quot;the mother of all living.&quot; Abraham is &quot;the father of all who believe,&quot; and Sarah is &quot;a mother of nations.&quot;</span></h4>

The church of Christ---feminine in her receptive role as a vessel for the Lord to fill with Himself---is &quot;terrible as an army with banners.&quot; As Jesus said, &quot;I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it, [i.e. the gates of hell shall not withstand the aggressive assaults of the church].&quot; (Mt. 16:18). The sun and the moon are ancient symbols of Christ and His church. The moon shines only by reflecting the light of the sun, and &quot;rules&quot; the earth during the nighttime of the sun&#39;s visible absence. <br/>Israel is the woman clothed with the sun in Revelation 12.

As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before fire, let the wicked perish before God...With mighty chariotry, twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands, the Lord came from Sinai into the holy place. Thou didst ascend the high mount, leading captives in thy train, and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.

Jesus said, &quot;He who keeps my word will never know what it is to die (John 8:51). Christians who seek to maintain a close walk with God learn how to continue in fruitfulness.

The references here indicate inner fruitfulness and fecundity. Inner creativity (&quot;beingness&quot;) is the specialty of the fairer sex.

There is nothing impure or inappropriate by such eloquent, delicate metaphors for physical, sexual love in marriage. <br/><br/>Women today often find men cold, up-tight, remote, detached and insensitive. Many men in our culture are out of touch with their emotions and ill at ease in expressing their desires and their love. Carl Jung would explain this in his model of individuation by saying that men need to get in touch with their inner feminine heritage symbolized by the archetype of the &quot;anima.&quot; Even today&#39;s popular men&#39;s movement is an attempt to loosen up the frozen American male in regard to a healthier sense of camaraderie and brotherly affection and freedom from what the gay community labels &quot;homophobia.&quot;<br/><br/>Date palms are prodigious in the numbers of dates they yield in great clusters.

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Earlier we saw that it was Solomon who came to Shulamite to draw her out of her natural reclusiveness into the gardens at springtime. Now it is Shulamite who takes the initiative in inviting Solomon to inspect the gardens, vineyards, and orchards with her.<br/><br/>Our generation is preoccupied with what God can do for us, our careers, or happiness, our health and well-being. Few seem to ask the question, &quot;What can we do for God?&quot; Shulamite has learned to be fruitful on behalf of her Lord, &quot;The point is this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must do as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you may always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every good work. As it is written, &#39;He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.&#39; He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your resources and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God...&quot; (2 Cor. 9:6-11)<br/><br/>The fruitfulness and bounty of the gardens has progressively expanded as the story develops. The first hint of a garden outside the house was the call of the Shepherd to tend the vineyards because of the &quot;lithe foxes&quot; (Chapter 2, verse 15). Ephesians 2 says we are &quot;God&#39;s handiwork created in Christ Jesus for creative, artistic works, which God has prepared before hand for us to discover,&quot; (paraphrasing the Greek a bit). This means every Christian&#39;s &quot;good works&quot; can be as diverse and varied as the array of flowers, fruits, nuts and spices Shulamite is cultivating in her beautiful gardens. These are all for the king&#39;s enjoyment.<br/><br/>It is also foreign to us for us at first to grasp the interplay of the Three Persons of the godhead in all that God does and is. The Persons of the godhead always express self-giving love the One to the Other outside of time and space. This is true whether or not there exists a created order! In the creation God has drawn us to Himself that we might enter into His divine activity, and as Peter says (2 Peter 1:4) so that we might &quot;become partakers of the divine nature.&quot; Thus a given Person of the godhead is able to take delight in what the another Person is doing. It is the Holy Spirit who works in the Bride to present her beautiful and lovely to the Son. It is the Father who has given the Bride as a love-gift to His beloved Son. The Father has sent the Spirit to call out and prepare the Bride. As stated in the Introduction, &quot;God is love,&quot; and love requires at least two persons: a lover and a beloved. The challenge of mature love is for the two lovers to be evenly matched. <br/><br/>Whether or not the king&#39;s presence is with her, Shulamite maintains her fruitful life, &quot;in season and out of season,&quot; unhindered by her emotions or by circumstances. This is what mature faith is all about.</span></h4>

So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. For those who sleep sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. But, since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us so that whether we wake or sleep we might live with him.

The inner man is renewed daily, but the outer man decays day by day. The corruptible body of flesh is kept for its allotted period by the revivings and refreshments of the Holy Spirit, but it must needs die. The power of God is often displayed through its weakness, yet the body of flesh remains very much as a thorn in the side of the spirit.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We know that the whole creation has been groaning in travail together until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.&quot; (Romans 8:22-27)</span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">The mature love of the believer is identified with &quot;the fellowship of Christ&#39;s sufferings. &quot;Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ&#39;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church...&quot; (Col. 1:24); &quot;But rejoice in so far as you share Christ&#39;s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.&quot; (1 Peter 4:13); &quot;So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ as well as a partaker in the glory that is to be revealed.&quot; (1 Peter 5:1)<br/><br/>&quot;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus&#39; sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you. Since we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, &#39;I believed, and so I spoke,&#39; we too believe, and so we speak, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God. So we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.&quot; (2 Cor. 4:7-18)</span></h4>

They seem (to me at least) to suggest the forming of Adam/Eve from the dust of the earth, and the mysteries of the new birth as well. &quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and to an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God&#39;s power are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time...You have been born anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; for &#39;All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord abides forever.&#39; That word is the good news which was preached to you.&quot; (1 Peter 1)</span></h4>
		<h4 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Shulamite:<br/><br/>Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; <br/>for love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave. <br/>Its flashes are flashes of fire, a most vehement flame. <br/>Many waters can not quench love, neither can floods down it. <br/>If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, <br/>it would be utterly scorned. </span></h4>
		<h4 class="csCDDC8C82">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">It would be more logical perhaps to attribute these verses to the King, but it is the Shulamite who speaks of holy covenants and of fidelity. The seal on the heart stands for guarded and protected emotions and the seal on the arm for guarded, sanctified actions. Lover and Beloved are united in death, burial and resurrection. This relationship between Christ and his church is frequently emphasized in the New Testament. &quot;Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For he who has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.&quot; (Rom 6:3-9) </span></h4>

Among these we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of body and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&quot; (Ephesians 2:1-7).<br/><br/>The language is apocalyptic. We are lifted beyond time and space to eternal things. The coming judgment of the world will be by fire (2 Peter 3), as the last terrible judgment of mankind was by the great flood of Noah. Only loyal love [hesed] can overcome such judgments and conquer death, and sustain us through the trials of this life into the next. True love can not be bought at any price and all attempts to buy this love are rejected at once as falling far short. &quot;You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was destined before the foundation of the world but was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake. Through him you have confidence in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart. You have been born anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; for &#39;All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord abides forever.&#39; That word is the good news which was preached to you.&quot; (1 Peter 1:18-25)</span></h4>

Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love.&quot; (Ephesians 4:13-16)</span></h4>

The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel; the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice.&quot; (Philippians 1:15-18) &quot;In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has wrought through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ, thus making it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man&#39;s foundation, but as it is written, &#39;They shall see who have never been told of him, and they shall understand who have never heard of him.&#39;&quot; (Romans 15:17-21)<br/><br/>&quot;Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.&quot; (James 1:27)</span></h4>

But thou art a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and didst not forsake them. <br/><br/>Neh. 9:29 And thou didst warn them in order to turn them back to thy law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey thy commandments, but sinned against thy ordinances, by the observance of which a man shall live, and turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey. <br/><br/>Job 16:12 I was at ease, and he broke me asunder; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target, (a broken of self-will)<br/><br/>Job 39:19 &quot;Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with strength?<br/><br/>Job 41:22 In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him. (Strength of will and intent)<br/><br/>Ps. 69:1 Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck. <br/><br/>Ps. 75:5 do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with insolent neck.&quot; (Stubborn and self-willed, rebellious)<br/><br/>Ps. 105:18 His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron; (bondage of the will)<br/><br/>Prov. 1:9 for they are a fair garland for your head, and pendants for your neck. <br/><br/>Prov. 3:3 Let not loyalty and faithfulness forsake you; bind them about your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. (Making many wise choices of the will repeatedly)<br/><br/>Prov. 3:22 and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck. <br/><br/>Prov. 6:21 Bind them upon your heart always; tie them about your neck. <br/><br/>Prov. 29:1 He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck will suddenly be broken beyond healing. (self-will)<br/><br/>Song 1:10 Your cheeks are comely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. (A contrite spirit and will response to the Spirit.)<br/><br/>Song 4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David, built for an arsenal, whereon hang a thousand bucklers, all of them shields of warriors. (A strong will set resolutely to do the will of God) <br/><br/>Song 7:4 Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, overlooking Damascus. <br/><br/>Isa. 8:8 and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck; and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.&quot; <br/><br/>Isa. 10:27 And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke will be destroyed from your neck.&quot; He has gone up from Rimmon, <br/><br/>Isa. 30:28 his breath is like an overflowing stream that reaches up to the neck; to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction, and to place on the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads astray. <br/><br/>Isa. 48:4 Because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead brass, <br/><br/>Isa. 52:2 Shake yourself from the dust, arise, O captive Jerusalem; loose the bonds from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion. (A liberating of the will and human spirit from the bondage of sin)<br/><br/>Isa. 66:3 &quot;He who slaughters an ox is like him who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like him who breaks a dog&#39;s neck; he who presents a cereal offering, like him who offers swine&#39;s blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like him who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations; <br/><br/>Jer. 7:26 yet they did not listen to me, or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers. <br/><br/>Jer. 17:23 Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, that they might not hear and receive instruction. <br/><br/>Jer. 19:15 &quot;Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their neck, refusing to hear my words.&quot; <br/><br/>Jer. 27:2 Thus the LORD said to me: &quot;Make yourself thongs and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck. <br/><br/>Jer. 27:8 &quot;`&quot;But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, says the LORD, until I have consumed it by his hand. <br/><br/>Jer. 27:11 But any nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to till it and dwell there, says the LORD.&quot;&#39;&quot; (Bondage or enslavement by a foreign power, in this case Babylon).<br/><br/>Jer. 28:10 Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and broke them. <br/><br/>Jer. 28:11 And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, &quot;Thus says the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years.&quot; But Jeremiah the prophet went his way. <br/><br/>Jer. 28:12 Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <br/><br/>Jer. 28:14 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke of servitude to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.&#39;&quot; <br/><br/>Jer. 30:8 &quot;And it shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD of hosts, that I will break the yoke from off their neck, and I will burst their bonds, and strangers shall no more make servants of them. <br/><br/>Lam. 1:14 &quot;My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his hand they were fastened together; they were set upon my neck; he caused my strength to fail; the Lord gave me into the hands of those whom I cannot withstand. <br/><br/>Ezek. 16:11 And I decked you with ornaments, and put bracelets on your arms, and a chain on your neck. <br/><br/>Dan. 5:7 The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king said to the wise men of Babylon, &quot;Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.&quot; <br/><br/>Dan. 5:16 But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. <br/><br/>Dan. 5:29 Then Belshazzar commanded, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put about his neck, and proclamation was made concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. <br/><br/>Hosea 10:11 Ephraim was a trained heifer that loved to thresh, and I spared her fair neck; but I will put Ephraim to the yoke, Judah must plow, Jacob must harrow for himself. <br/><br/>Hab. 3:13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, for the salvation of thy anointed. Thou didst crush the head of the wicked, laying him bare from thigh to neck. Selah.<br/><br/>Matt. 18:6 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. <br/><br/>Mark 9:42 &quot;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea. <br/><br/>Luke 17:2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. <br/><br/>Acts 15:10 Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? </span></h4>

			<span class="cs16E84F30">Guide to the Use of Numbers and Symbols in the Bible</span></h3>
		<h4 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The following information is extracted from a larger reference, <a class="cs7746F224" href="http://ldolphin.org/App.html"><span class="csCE466166">Miscellaneous References Concerning the Bible</span></a></span><span class="cs16E84F30"><br/><br/>In reading the Bible, it soon becomes apparent that certain numbers (such as 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 40, 70, etc.) occur more frequently than we would expect. From the context it is soon apparent that some of these numbers have symbolic as well as literal meaning. (This symbolic meaning of numbers is not the same thing as assigning numerical values to the Greek and Hebrew letters that comprise the text. The latter approach does allow useful computer analysis of the structure of the Bible from which authorship of various books can be confirmed and certain obscure passages or manuscript errors clarified).<br/><br/>The number ONE stands for unity. &quot;There is ONE God, and ONE mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for many.&quot; A second example is the S&#39;hma, &quot;Hear O Israel the LORD your God is ONE God...&quot;<br/><br/>TWO stands for union. &quot;For this cause (marriage) a man shall leave his father and his mother and the TWO shall become one flesh.&quot; Man, created as Adam/Eve, was separated into Adam and Eve so the two could complement one another in a new kind of unity. Two is the basis of the BINARY system of counting. <br/><br/>THREE is the number of God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The THIRD Day is the day of resurrection in scripture.<br/><br/>FOUR is the number of the world system (cosmos). Thus, we have the FOUR winds, the FOUR seasons, the FOUR corners of the earth, and the FOUR living creatures (cherubim, i. e. angels) around the throne of God.<br/><br/>FIVE is the number of division. Thus, there were FIVE wise and FIVE foolish virgins invited to the marriage feast.<br/><br/>SIX is the number of man because man was created on the SIXTH day. The number 666 is the number of the antichrist, the man who proclaims himself to be God. SIX days are appointed for man to work. The seventh day (the Sabbath) is to be devoted to rest.<br/><br/>SEVEN is the number of completeness in the old created order, (4+3=7). There are seven days of creation and in Revelation this number occurs 54 times. The number seven occurs repeatedly in the Book of the Revelation. <br/><br/>EIGHT is the number of new beginnings. Jesus rose from the dead on the Eighth Day of the week, a Sunday. Eight is the basis of the OCTAL system of counting.<br/><br/>TEN is the number of worldly completion (4+6=10). Ten virgins total. Ten toes on the image in Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s dream, ten horns on the beast of Revelation 17:2. Ten is the basis of the DECIMAL System. <br/><br/>TWELVE is the number of eternal perfection as in the TWELVE Tribes of Israel and the TWELVE apostles of the church (12+12=24 elders). There are TWELVE gates to New Jerusalem, its walls measure 12 X 12 cubits high and the sides are 12,000 furlongs in length.<br/><br/>FORTY is the number of testing. Jesus was tempted in the wilderness FORTY days and nights. Israel wandered in the wilderness FORTY years. During the flood of Noah the rain fell FORTY days and nights.<br/><br/>FIFTY is the number of the Jubilee Year in Israel. The land was to rest every seventh year and after 7X7+1=50 years to revert to original owners with debts being forgiven. The Day of Pentecost, when the church was born, occurred seven sabbaths plus one day after the death of Jesus, on a Sunday morning.<br/><br/>SEVENTY is the number of years the Jews spent out of the land during the Babylonian captivity. SEVENTY heptads, or &quot;weeks of years,&quot; were given to Israel (see Daniel) for the completion of their national destiny.<br/><br/>METALS: Various metals are mentioned in the Bible - including gold, silver, brass, iron, lead, and tin. GOLD is a symbol of deity prominent in the Tabernacle of Moses and the First and Second Temples. SILVER stands for redemption and was used in quantity in the tabernacle. BRASS stands for judgment, as in the altar of sacrifice, or Moses&#39; Serpent of Brass. LEAD and TIN are baser metals removed by refining as dross to yield silver and gold. IRON stands for military (or industrial strength), and IRON mingled with CLAY (Daniel) represents the weakness of modern Western democracies which combine rule by the common people with military and industrial strength. WOOD represents humanity, as in Psalm 1:3, etc.<br/><br/>COLORS: SCARLET represents natural life in man since &quot;the life is in the blood.&quot; This is the color of &quot;life poured out&quot; to ransom us. WHITE stands for purity; BLUE, for the heavens; BLACK, for death; GREEN, for new life in nature; PURPLE, for royalty and PALE GREEN, for famine. GARMENTS stand for righteousness. Imputed faith is represented by white garments and filthy rags represent self-righteousness, or defilement by the world. <br/><br/>HONEY represents natural sweetness (a characteristic of the flesh; hence, not a positive symbol). LEAVEN (yeast) is a universal symbol of sin in scripture. <br/><br/>ANIMALS: HORSES are always &quot;war horses&quot; (imported from Egypt) and represent reliance on the world&#39;s resources rather than on God in spiritual warfare. The kings of Israel were not to multiply horses for themselves. DOGS are unclean animals and refer to the lowest forms of behavior by men. WOLVES are false teachers who prey upon the SHEEP. The latter represent believers who are helpless, dumb, prone to wander, and always in need of a shepherd. BULLS and RAMS represent masculine strength. LIONS and LEOPARDS can represent spiritual enemies in the heavenly places (&quot;...your adversary the devil goes around like a prowling lion...&quot;). On the other hand, Jesus is the &quot;Lion of the Tribe of Judah.&quot; GAZELLES, HINDS and DEER represent youthful energy and vitality as seen in the Song of Solomon. The BEASTS in Revelation (and Daniel) are men (world leaders) as seen by God, except that the &quot;four living creatures&quot; in Revelation are mighty angels known as cherubim. <br/><br/>BIRDS: The DOVE is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. The EAGLE pictures the serene sovereignty of God. God took Israel out of Egypt &quot;on eagles&#39; wings&quot;. BIRDS of PREY represent forces of destructiveness. Animal HORNS picture power in a human ruler. <br/><br/>The SEA stands for the masses of mankind. The &quot;great sea&quot; is the Mediterranean and the &quot;eastern sea&quot; or &quot;salt sea&quot; is the Dead Sea. MOUNTAINS are symbols of human government. The STARS frequently represent the angels. The SUN is a symbol for Christ who rules the earth by day; and the MOON, the church who rules the earth by night&quot;, and has no light of its own. <br/><br/>The NECK symbolizes the will (as in &quot;stubborn and stiff-necked&quot;). The LOINS represent masculine virility and strength. The FEET indicate activity: &quot;How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who preach the gospel...&quot; or, &quot;Their feet are swift to shed blood.&quot; The EYES represent spiritual insight and inner beauty. A KISS is a symbol for intimacy. <br/><br/>INCENSE symbolizes prayer; and MYRRH, suffering. FAT stands for the natural richness of life; hence, the fat of the sacrifices belongs to God alone.<br/><br/>GRASS represents the ephemeral life of man. Good FRUIT is the result of living in dependence on Christ, and bad fruit, the natural result of self-life. THORNS and THISTLES stand for the works of the flesh. <br/><br/>MILK is spiritual food for new-born babes in Christ; BREAD for growing young men, and the MEAT of the Word, deeper truth for the maturing believer. <br/><br/>A WOMAN typifies every believer in such passages as Romans 7:1-4. A HARLOT symbolizes fallen mankind (men as well as women), and the GREAT HARLOT, the apostate church and the final state of the world system under the dominion of evil. The true church and the false church are both symbolized by the figures of a woman and by a city. <br/><br/>The VINE represents Israel&#39;s national influence among the nations. The FIG TREE stands for Israel&#39;s religious history; and the OLIVE TREE, Israel&#39;s true spiritual history apart from outward religious appearances. <br/><br/>The HOLY SPIRIT is symbolized in Scripture by (a) a dove, (b) water, (c) oil, (d) fire, (e) wind or breath, (f) light. <br/><br/>Without denying the historical validity of the Old Testament in any way, CROSSING THE RED SEA is a picture of leaving the world (Egypt) under the domain of the god of the age (Pharaoh) to be baptized into Christ at the Red Sea crossing. <br/><br/>The WILDERNESS stands for Christian living under the law in the power of the flesh. <br/><br/>CROSSING THE JORDAN stands for the truth of Galatians 2:20, entering the land, (the Spirit-filled life); by renouncing self and living thereafter in the power of the Spirit. <br/><br/>The ENEMIES in the LAND: CanaanITES, HivITES, JebusITES, EdomITES, MoabITES are pictures of the flesh. JACOB represents the average believer, deceiving and deceived. <br/><br/>ISRAEL is the man who wrestled with God (the Angel of the LORD), and becomes changed as a result, a picture for us of sanctification. <br/><br/>ESAU, the brother of JACOB is the father of the EDOMITES, hence a picture of the flesh. Agag, Haman, and Herod are notable among the descendants of Esau. <br/><br/>ASSYRIA represents lawlessness, BABYLON, religious confusion and error. <br/><br/>The Old Testament pictures every believer as a king over the kingdom of his (or her) life. Power to rule in righteousness is given only as we subject ourselves to the King of kings, Jesus.</span></h4>
