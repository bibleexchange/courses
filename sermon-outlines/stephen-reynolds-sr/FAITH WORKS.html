James writes to share that an</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">authentic faith confession results in readily observable commitments.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">The primary aim of James&rsquo; writings in this epistle was not to write new truths, but to awaken Christians to the truths they already knew &ndash; but had forgotten - or chosen NOT to follow.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">The followers of Jesus had allowed their faith expression to become idle. They</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">were no longer an inspiration, providing illumination for others to see the Christ live in them. They had heard the great teachers and prophets of the Old Testament explain the relationship between doctrine and its application to everyday life and behavior, but they&rsquo;d gotten lazy.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">James knew what truth faith was, but his emphasis was on what true faith does.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Martin Luther, struggled with the Book of James for a long time because he</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">thought it supported a work righteousness salvation, wrote, &ldquo;Good works do not make a good man &ndash; but a good man does good works.&rdquo; James states the same thing in verse 26 &ndash; &ldquo;Faith without works is dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">There&rsquo;s no major difference between Paul&rsquo;s teaching and the teaching of James. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We are not talking about a faith vs. works controversy.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">The key issue for Paul is how one gains right standing before God &ndash; while for James, the issue is how one demonstrates to others the claim to have such right standing. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul&rsquo;s focus is inward.

Now he reminds us what it is to live it out. You know electricity when you touch it. It has power and a charge. That is what James says is to</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">be said of a follower of Christ. You know the source of their power.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">OUR FAITH NEVER EXISTS IN ISOLATION &ndash; IT IS complete</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Our faith commitment to Jesus Christ, while deeply personal, is never private. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">G. K.

We are reminded that our &ldquo;bread&rdquo; must</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">never come at the expense of any other human being on the face of the earth.

Last week at our Administrative Board meeting I shared how important our</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Pastor&rsquo;s Discretionary Fund has been to our church family.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Genuine faith is never indifferent, but always looking for a place to be involved.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We put our love into action! As Dwight Moody once said, &ldquo;We put the gospel message</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">into shoe leather or boots!&rdquo; This is why we take the &ldquo;One Great Hour of Sharing&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">offering &ndash; which is in your church envelope box for today.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">BELIEF IS CONFIRMED BY BEHAVIOR.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">In verses 18-20, James says, &ldquo;Yes, you believe &ndash; but even the demons believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">What are the results of your beliefs? There is a BIG difference in believing there is a</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">God &ndash; and placing faith and trust IN God. You see demons can recite scriptures and</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">be awestruck, but demons are not saved. There is no partnership or relationship</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">between their godly beliefs and their behavior. They know ABOUT being transformed,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">but they are not transformed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">As the evangelist, Luis Palau, writes, &ldquo;Just reading the Bible doesn&rsquo;t mean you</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">are a Christian. When Karl Marx was seventeen years old, he wrote a fantastic</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">explanation of part of John&rsquo;s gospel. Great theologians agree with much of what he</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">said, but Karl Marx eventually rejected the Bible&rsquo;s authority and during his adult life,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">called himself an atheist, a communist &ndash; anything but a Christian.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&ldquo;And Nikita Khrushchev, the former premier of the USSR, read the Bible when he</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">was a boy. Yet later, he made it his ambition to bury the church in the Soviet Union by</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">1965. Instead, he is buried and the Russian Church continues to grow!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&ldquo;Read the bible all you can . . . Since it is God&rsquo;s word, we can trust it completely.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">But remember, just reading the Bible won&rsquo;t make you a Christian.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">It is when we put our faith into practice that we show exactly what kind of faith it</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">is. Is it saving faith or a self-centered faith? Since we believe in God, we must watch</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">our tongues and help the poor.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">WORKS ARE AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Can you imagine Moses saying, &ldquo;Lord, I believe what you say about the Egyptian</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">treatment of the Jews, but surely you don&rsquo;t expect me to go, do you?&rdquo; God is more than</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">a mental image and asset. He empowers us to act in human history. There is a</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">correlation between our confession and our conviction.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Anthony DeMello, whose inspirational stories have been ready by millions, has</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">written this incisive first-person story:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">On the street, I saw a small girl, cold and shivering in a thin</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">dress, with little hope for a decent meal. I became ANGRY and</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">said to God, &ldquo;Why did you PERMIT this?&rdquo; For a while, God</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">said nothing. That night, He replied quite suddenly, &ldquo;I certainly</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">DID something about it. I made YOU!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">This is exactly what James is sharing in this lesson.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">In verses 20-26, James demonstrates how ridiculous it would have been for</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Abraham and Rahab to have faith &ndash; but never to act upon that faith.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">A Salvation Army preacher was greeting parishioners at the door of his meeting</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">house on Easter Sunday. He said to one man, &ldquo;I want you in the army of the Lord!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&ldquo;I am in the army of the Lord,&rdquo; came the reply.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&ldquo;Then why do I only see you at Christmas and Easter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">With a twinkle in his eye, the man said, &ldquo;Because I am in the secret service!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">James knew the Christian faith was not a call to be in the secret service but to be</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">in the everyday world of God&rsquo;s service. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">He heard Jesus challenging the people of faith to be salt and light not leaven.
