The word for &quot;grudge&quot; refers to an inward and unexpressed feeling of sorrow. It is used of the Lord Jesus on the occasion when He healed a man who had a speech impediment. The man seems to have become deaf and, as a result, had developed a speech problem. The Lord dealt with him in a somewhat unusual way in the process of which He looked up to heaven and &quot;sighed.&quot; This is one of two miracles that only Mark recorded &nbsp;</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">7:31-37; 8:22-26</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Mr 7:34 And looking up to heaven, he </span><span class="csF42C4B08">sighed</span><span class="csA521DC07">, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Deaf)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">They are both unusual because, in each case, the Lord healed by a process. When Mark says, &quot;he sighed,&quot; the word that he uses can be translated &quot;groaned.&quot; It suggests how deeply Jesus felt for the ills of men.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The apostle Paul uses the same word in describing the threefold groaning of the creation, the Christian and the Comforter. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;The whole creation </span><span class="csD3860DFD">groaneth</span><span class="csA521DC07">,&quot; he says </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Rom. 8:22</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">We ourselves &quot;</span><span class="csD3860DFD">groan</span><span class="csA521DC07"> within ouselves,&quot; he adds </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">8:23</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&quot;the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with </span><span class="csD3860DFD">groanings</span><span class="csA521DC07"> which cannot be uttered&quot; </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">8:26</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Some of this groaning is natural, understandable, and perfectly legitimate. The sufferings that some people are called upon to undergo generate these inward groans. God Himself groans with us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;But James uses the word somewhat differently. He uses the word in the sense of murmuring or holding a grudge. We never see the Lord doing that. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">We are to beware of complaining.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">We are to </span><span class="csD3860DFD">beware of condemnation:</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;Lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door&quot; </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">5:9</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">James implies that possibly the one who is doing the murmuring is the one at fault. Our reactions to wrongs can be as bad as the wrongs inflicted on us. In any case, the judge Himself is at the door. That should put a swift stop to our murmurings.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Mt 16:19 And </span><span class="csF42C4B08">I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven</span><span class="csA521DC07">: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
