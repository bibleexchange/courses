Saturday was the regular Jewish sabbath, the 17th day of Nisan.

			<span class="cs75A07D5F">The Voice of God </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The visit of the Greeks, followed by the voice of God. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csD3860DFD">the Lord&#39;s distress</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:27): &quot;Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.&quot; The Lord&#39;s thoughts go to Calvary. The way to the cross would be no easy road for him to travel. It would be a deadly reality for him: the agony in the garden, the mocking trials, the physical abuse, the scourging, the crown of thorns, the heavy cross, the agony of crucifixion, the anguish of being made sin for us, the horror of the darkness, the bitter taste of death. These things made up that &quot;lone, mysterious hour&quot; toward which he had been wending his way from a past eternity.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">That hour had come much closer the hour he was born. It had come closer still the hour he was baptized by John, and identified with the race he had come to redeem. It had come closer when he descended from the mount after meeting with Moses and Elijah to talk of his decease. It had come closer when he had performed those miracles in Jerusalem on the sabbath to challenge the shibboleths of the rabbis. It had come closer when he had declared himself to be God. It had come closer when he had ridden into Jerusalem in triumph to proclaim himself messiah in spite of the opposition of the Sanhedrin. It had come closer now that he resolutely refused to pray that his Father in heaven would keep him from that hour.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csD3860DFD">the Lord&#39;s desire</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:28-30). The Lord burst suddenly into prayer&mdash;not a prayer that he might be kept from the hour, but that his Father might be glorified. &quot;Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">This is the third time God had now spoken audibly from heaven. The first time was at his baptism, at the commencement of his ministry (Matthew 3:17); the second time was on the mount of transfiguration, at the climax of his ministry (Matthew 17:5); the third time is here, at the crisis of his ministry. The first time was when he went down into the waters of Jordan; the second time was when he was about to come down from the mount; the third time was when he prepared himself to go down into death.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The people standing around heard something loud but they were mystified as to how to explain it. Some thought it was a natural phenomenon, a thunderclap. Others thought it was a supernatural phenomenon, the voice of an angel. Neither group was able to discern what was said. The Lord instantly recognized his Father&#39;s voice. He explained to the crowds that it was indeed a voice. But he himself did not need audible confirmation that he was in the Father&#39;s will.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">God declared that he had already glorified his name in the ministry of Jesus and he would glorify it again. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The Father&#39;s name had been glorified in the wilderness by the Lord&#39;s victory over Satan and would be glorified again by the victory over Satan at Calvary and in the end. Satan is the one great moral blot in the universe. His character, career, and crimes constitute an abiding insult to the holiness and goodness of God. The Lord&#39;s victories over Satan bring glory to God.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csD3860DFD">the Lord&#39;s declaration</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:31): &quot;Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&quot; The prince of this world is Satan. The word used for &quot;prince&quot; is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">archon</span><span class="csA521DC07">. The title is applied to Satan three times (14:30; 16:11). He is the prince of demons (Matthew 12:24) and the prince of the power of the air (Ephesians 2:2).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">So Jesus could say, &quot;Now is the judgment of this world: Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&quot; The same word for expulsion is used in connection with the Sanhedrin, when they took the blind man whom Jesus had healed and cast him out of the synagogue (9:34-35). The word was used by Jesus in his parable of the vineyard: &quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Mt 21:38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD3860DFD">The Lord&#39;s death</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:32-34) is God&#39;s means of tearing down Satan&#39;s world system. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">His death is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">described</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:32-33): &quot;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This he said, signifying what death he should die.&quot; </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">The cross is the great divide of humanity. </span></p><p class="cs41FA1D71"><span class="csA521DC07">On the one side of the cross we see a dying thief, a man who died blaspheming and went out into a lost eternity. </span></p><p class="cs41FA1D71"><span class="csA521DC07">On the other side of the cross we see a dying thief, a man who died believing and went out to be with Christ in paradise. </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csA521DC07">The cross divides the world. </span></p><p class="cs41FA1D71"><span class="csA521DC07">Everyone is drawn to the cross. </span></p><p class="cs41FA1D71"><span class="csA521DC07">Everyone has to decide on which side of the cross to stand&mdash;Jew and gentile, rich and poor, good and bad, religious and irreligious, spiritual or non-spiritual, Greeks and barbarians.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">This was the Lord&#39;s answer to the Greeks.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Joh 12:23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">This was the Lord&#39;s answer to all the people</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Joh 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;In his death, Jesus would deal decisively with the prince of this world; he would set the stage for the judgment of this world; he would act in judgment on the people of the world and provide salvation for all, regardless of country, culture, or creed.</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">his death </span><span class="csD3860DFD">discussed</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:34): &quot;The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?&quot; </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csD3860DFD">the Lord&#39;s discernment</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:35-36): </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Joh 12:35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">That was his answer to their unbelief. Although he was the light, they refused to see it. He knew where he was going, and how, and why.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">His earthly ministry was nearly over. How urgent was their need to take advantage of the light while it still shone on their nation. There was still a chance to walk in the light, even to become children of light, to become partakers of his nature. But the light would soon be withdrawn. Then they would walk in darkness, stumbling along, not knowing where they went.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">They rejected the Savior; they reject-ed the Spirit. They stumbled into the disaster of war with Rome. They went on to the even worse disaster of the Bar Kochba rebellion. They saw no light in Christ. They plunged into the ever expanding darkness of the Talmud. They have persisted in unbelief to this day, and will go on doing so until they stumble into the arms of the antichrist.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Foreshadowing this, the Lord withdrew from their presence and went and hid himself. This seems to have been his last public appeal to the Jewish people. He went away, in all probability, to Bethany, and they saw no more of him until they saw him in the hands of his foes and responded to the incitement of the Sanhedrin to shout for his death. So the segment ends with </span><span class="csD3860DFD">the Lord&#39;s departure</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (12:36).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
