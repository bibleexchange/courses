heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
hands have handled, of the Word of life; 2 (For the life was manifested, and we
have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was
with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 3 That which we have seen and
heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly
our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these
things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. 5 This then is the message
