The variety of senses that logos possesses may suggest the difficulties to be encountered in characterizing the nature and scope of logic. Among the partial translations of logos, there are &ldquo;sentence,&rdquo; &ldquo;discourse,&rdquo; &ldquo;reason,&rdquo; &ldquo;rule,&rdquo; &ldquo;ratio,&rdquo; &ldquo;account&rdquo; (especially the account of the meaning of an expression), &ldquo;rational principle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">definition</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&rdquo; Not unlike this proliferation of meanings, the subject matter of logic has been said to be the &ldquo;laws of thought,&rdquo; &ldquo;the rules of right reasoning,&rdquo; &ldquo;the principles of valid argumentation,&rdquo; &ldquo;the use of certain words labeled &lsquo;logical constants&#39;,&rdquo; &ldquo;truths (true propositions) based solely on the meanings of the terms they contain,&rdquo; and so on.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is relatively easy to discern some order in the above embarrassment of explanations. Some of the characterizations are in fact closely related to each other. When logic is said, for instance, to be the study of the laws of thought, these laws cannot be the empirical (or observable) regularities of actual human thinking as studied in psychology; they must be laws of correct reasoning, which are independent of the psychological idiosyncrasies of the thinker. Moreover, there is a parallelism between correct thinking and valid argumentation: valid argumentation may be thought of as an expression of correct thinking, and the latter as an internalization of the former. In the sense of this parallelism, laws of correct thought will match those of correct argumentation. The characteristic mark of the latter is, in turn, that they do not depend on any particular matters of fact. Whenever an argument that takes a reasoner from p to q is valid, it must hold independently of what he happens to know or believe about the subject matter of p and q.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Scriptures for good examples</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Joh 13:15 For I have given you an </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">example</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, that ye should do as I have done to you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;1Ti 4:12 Let no man despise thy youth; but </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">be thou an example</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Heb 8:5 Who serve unto the </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">example and shadow</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Jas 5:10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">example of suffering affliction, and of patience</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;1Pe 2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">example,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> that ye should </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">follow his steps:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Bad examples </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Jude 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Good and bad examples in one verse.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Heb 4:11 &para; Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">example of unbelief </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Finishing the course</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Ac 13:25 </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">And as John</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> fulfilled his course</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, he said, Whom think ye that I am?
