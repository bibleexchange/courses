So I requested that, if there was any boy present, who had wandered away from mother&rsquo;s teaching, he would come to the platform at the conclusion of the service. A young man of eighteen came forward and said, &ldquo;Did you mean me? I have promised my mother to meet her in heaven; but as I am now living that will be impossible.&rdquo; We prayed for him; he finally arose with a new light in his eyes; and exclaimed triumphantly, &ldquo;Now, I can meet mother in heaven; for I have found her God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csA521DC07">A few days before, Mr. Doane had sent me the subject &ldquo;Rescue the Perishing,&rdquo; and while I sat there that evening the line came to me, &ldquo;Rescue the perishing, care for the dying.&rdquo; I could think of nothing else that night. When I arrived it my home I went to work on it at once; and before I retired the entire hymn was ready for a melody. The next day my words were written and forwarded to Mr. Doane, who wrote the beautiful and touching music as it now stands.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csA521DC07">In November, 1903, I went to Lynn, Massachusetts, to speak before the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association. I told them the incident that led me to write &ldquo;Rescue the Perishing,&quot; as I have just related it. After the meeting a large number of men shook hands with me, and among them was a man, who seemed to be deeply moved. You may imagine my surprise when he said, &ldquo;Miss Crosby, I was the boy, who told you more than thirty-five years ago that I had wandered from my mother&rsquo;s God. The evening that you spoke at the mission I sought and found peace, and I have tried to live a consistent Christian life ever since. If we never meet again on earth, we will meet up yonder.&rdquo; As he said this, he raised my hand to his lips; and before I had recovered from my surprise he had gone; and remains to this day a nameless friend, who touched a deep chord of sympathy in my heart. It is these notes of sympathy that vibrate when a voice calls them forth from the dim memories of the past, and the music is celestial.</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs75A07D5F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,<br/>Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;<br/>Weep o&rsquo;er the erring one, lift up the fallen,<br/>Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD3860DFD">Refrain</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD3860DFD">Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,<br/>Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,<br/>Waiting the penitent child to receive;<br/>Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;<br/>He will forgive if they only believe.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD3860DFD">Refrain</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,<br/>Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;<br/>Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,<br/>Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD3860DFD">Refrain</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;<br/>Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;<br/>Back to the narrow way patiently win them;<br/>Tell the poor wand&rsquo;rer a Savior has died.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs75A07D5F">True Humility</span></p><h1 class="csA2081E9A">
