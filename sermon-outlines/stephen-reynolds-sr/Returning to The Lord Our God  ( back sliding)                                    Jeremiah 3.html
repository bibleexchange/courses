		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">&lsquo;Backslider&rsquo; is not a New Testament word, but the concept is found in many N.T. verses, as well, as O.T. verses. What is meant by the term &lsquo;backslider&rsquo;? Backslider refers to someone that at one time was advancing toward God, but now is headed away or &lsquo;sliding back&rsquo; from God into the old carnal life. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ga 4:9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ps 12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Depending on his attitude, the backslider can be the easiest or the hardest kind of person to reach.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">No one back slides over one experience. For a Believer to backslide many decisions have been made that have led up to such a sinful condition. A person does not just one day up and backslide, but little by little and by letting important things slip does a person slide back from God. A backslider has allowed their love to get cold and something or things to get between them and God. It is not easy for the righteous to backslide. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">John 17:9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">A person does not backslide overnight.
