<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Joshua 18:1-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every single one of us have a place and a part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And you must fight and be brave against all evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many whose hearts and minds are set to protect
these 21 men being set out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is wanting to set some boundaries in our life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is time to get direction from God, and receive the
experience from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boundaries, memorable experiences. There is no experience
better to remember than that which God gives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They wnted to possess the land, but were not sure what just
was theres, what the boundaries were. They didn’t really know what was theirs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel had to pass through a physical lands by God’s design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham receive an inheritance not by the Law but by
PROMISE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every experience in our life is given to us by God. No
lasting experience unless God gives it to us. He gives us the experience of
life, victory, joy, faith. These things don’t just happen because you hang
around church people, they are only the results of Christ’s giving and grace
and anointing. We must keep these experiences and not keep the lightly. How
long are ye slack to go to possess the Land. </p>
