<p class=MsoNormal>There’s a conflict going on over hidden treasures. Some have
understood truth more than others having received it by revelation, but only to
enter a conflict ‘men having beguiled them’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What we need to help us in a conflict. Hidden treasure that
God reveals to us and in us. You will be enticed if left to own knowledge and
understanding, Must maintain that order of faith resting in him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judah was a leader of the people of God. By divine
providence and ordiance Judah was first into battle. </p>
