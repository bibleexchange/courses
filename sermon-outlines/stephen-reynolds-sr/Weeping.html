The survivors of the Israelites were gathered by their conquerors as captives at Ramah. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">There the voice of lamentation was heard from the mothers bereft of their offspring. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The prophet describes Rachel, the mother of two great tribes, as weeping and refusing to be comforted. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">It was still more appropriate to the bereaved mothers of Bethlehem. Within half a mile of that city was the tomb of Rachel, and hence the pathetic language of the prophet is again applied to the inconsolable mothers of Bethlehem, as though the Rachel that slept in the tomb were a mourner over her slain offspring.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Originally spoken concerning the captivity of the ten tribes; but are here elegantly applied to the murder of the innocents at Bethlehem. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">As if he had said, Bethlehem at this time resembled Rama; for as Rachel might be said to weep over her children, which were slaughtered or gone into captivity; so in Bethlehem, the mothers lamented bitterly their children, because they were slain.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The original design of this prophecy was to describe the sorrowful departure of the people into captivity, after the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuzaradan. The captives were assembled at Rama, Jeremiah himself being in chains, and there the fate of those who had escaped in the destruction of the city was decided at the will of the conqueror, Jer 40:1. The nobles had been slain, and the eyes of their king put out after the murder of his sons before his sight, and the people were then gathered at Rama in chains, whence they were to start on their mournful journey, slaves to a cruel monarch, leaving behind them all that was dear in life. The sadness of such a scene is well expressed in the language of the prophet, and no less beautifully and fitly applies to the melancholy event which the evangelist records; and there could be no impropriety in his using it as a quotation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Rama was a small town in the tribe of Benjamin, not far from Bethlehem. Rachel was the mother of Benjamin, and was buried near to Bethlehem, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 35:16-19. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Rama was about six miles north-west of Jerusalem, near Bethel. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The name Rama signifies an eminence, and was given to the town because it was situated on a hill. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Rama is commonly supposed to be the same as the Arimathea of the New Testament--the place where Joseph lived who begged the body of Jesus. See Mt 27:57. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">This is also the same place in which Samuel was born, where he resided, died, and was buried, and where he anointed Saul as king, 1Sa 1:1; 2:11; 8:4; 19:18 1Sa 25:1.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Thus did our Lord narrowly escape a cruel death. &nbsp;He had poor welcome among men, who he came to redeem. &nbsp;Angels celebrated his birth with songs, but among men the malice of the wicked greeted him with the blood of infants and the wailings of bereaved mothers. &nbsp;O dear Redeemer, how sorrowfully did thy life for us begin! &nbsp;Alas! how sorrowfully did it end!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">In Ramah. This word means &quot;highland&quot; or &quot;hill.&quot; The town lies six miles north of Jerusalem. It was the birthplace and burial-place of the prophet Samuel. It is also supposed to be the Arimathea of the New Testament. See Mt 27:57. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp; Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children. Why these tearful mothers in Bethlehem? Because that which Christ escaped remained for his brethren, their children, to suffer. If he would escape death, all his brethren must die. But he died that all his brethren might live. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp; And she would not be comforted, because they are not. The words here quoted were originally written concerning the Babylonian captivity (Jer 31:15). Ramah was a town of Benjamin (Jos 18:25). Jeremiah was carried thither in chains with the other captives, but was there released by the order of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer 40:1; 39:11,12). Here he saw the captives depart for Babylon, and heard the weeping of the poor who were left in the land (Jer 39:10); hence the mention of Ramah as the place of lamentation. He represents Rachel weeping, because the Benjamites were descendants of Rachel, and, perhaps, because the tomb of Rachel was &quot;in the border of Benjamin,&quot; and not far away (1Sa 10:2). The image of the ancient mother of the tribe, rising from her tomb to weep, and refusing to be comforted because her children were not around her, is inimitably beautiful; and this image so strikingly portrayed the weeping in Bethlehem that Matthew adopts the words of the prophet, and says that they were here fulfilled. It was the fulfillment, not of a prediction, properly speaking, but of certain words spoken by the prophet.</span></p></body>
