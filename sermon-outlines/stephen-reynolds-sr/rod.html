		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">regarding how God uses men - God used what Moses had in his </span><span class="cs821257DA">hand</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Moses&#39; years of tending sheep were not useless. Those years had put into Moses </span><span class="cs821257DA">hand</span><span class="csC05134DD"> things he could use for God&#39;s glory. God didn&#39;t use the scepter that was in Moses&#39; royal hand when he lived in Egypt, but He did use the simple shepherd&#39;s rod.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Ex 4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand?

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">We see the faith of Moses when he reached to grab the serpent at God&rsquo;s command.

Something good and useful (a rod or a hand) is converted to something evil (a serpent or a leprous hand), and significantly, they are then converted back again.</span></p><p class="csE71256D6"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Mt 8:32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;Mr 5:13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;Lu 8:33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csD7A2FB39"><span class="cs821257DA">The water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry land</span><span class="csC05134DD">: The third sign is simply a sign of judgment. Good, pure waters were made foul and bloody by the work of God and they did not turn back again. This showed that if the miracles of conversion did not turn the hearts of the people, then perhaps the sign of judgment will.</span></li><li class="csD7A2FB39"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs821257DA">If they do not believe even these two signs, or listen to your voice</span><span class="csC05134DD"> shows that the sign of judgment is only given when unbelief persists in the face of the miracles of conversion right before them.</span></li></ol>

Clearly 40 years before this Moses was not </span><span class="cs821257DA">slow of speech and slow of tongue</span><span class="csC05134DD">. Acts 7:22 says </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="csE71256D6"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs29D68468"><span class="csC05134DD">i. In 40 years of silence - preaching only to sheep - Moses had to deal with all discouragement, sense of failure and condemnation that accumulated over 40 years.

Instead of Moses &quot;regressing&quot; in speaking ability during those years in the desert, it is far more reasonable to believe that he has simply lost confidence in himself - something that can be good, but not if it makes him lose confidence in what God can do in him.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csC05134DD">5.

Some wonder why Moses&#39; wife seems so bitter here. Perhaps for the first time she recognizes the serious nature of her husband&#39;s call and how important it is for their whole family to walk in the ways of the </span><span class="cs9EABB1A9">Lord</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csC05134DD">4.
