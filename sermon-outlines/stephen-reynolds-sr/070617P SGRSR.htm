<p class=MsoNormal>Title: Awaking Out of Sleep</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Text: Ephesians 5:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to follow the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.15, in light of verse 1, followers of God, v. 15 see then
that ye walk circumspectly, he told Abraham to walk before him perfectly. This
is not measuring out like the Pharisees measuring out every inch, every
fraction of each inch, but we are measuring ourselves by the Word. It is by His
help and my following Him as He directs his light upon the ‘inch’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a deception going on and people do not understand
the measurement. God has something great, right here, right now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.14 Wherefore he saith, awake thou that sleepest and arise
from the dead and Christ shall give thee light. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heard before, water off a ducks back</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is something known in the word of God as ‘the great awakening’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Acts 12:4</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and
delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after
Easter to bring him forth to the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be careful what you read and interpret Scripture with Scripture.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must pray in faith, knowing His will and knowing His
Word. It is going to be by much prayer (Revival). The word by the Spirit is
absolutely necessary to have that Great Awakening. </p>
