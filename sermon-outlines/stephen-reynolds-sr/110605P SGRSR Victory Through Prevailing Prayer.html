		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Why would the Amalekites attack Israel? No doubt, because they felt threatened. They were a desert people who lived just south of the promised land of Canaan. They had obviously heard about Israel being freed from Egypt and of their march to Canaan, somewhere between two to three million of them. To reach Canaan, this large mass of Israelites would have to march either through or close by the land of the Amalekites. The leaders of the Amalekites had no idea what Israel&#39;s intentions would be, to pass by their land in peace or to attack them. Consequently, the Amalekites launched a surprise attack against Israel. The attack was sudden, totally unexpected. facts need to be pointed out about the attack of the Amalekites.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">De 25:17-19&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;18 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs4C25F46B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The attack was a surprise attack launched against a mass of civilians, not against an army, totally unprovoked and uncalled for. </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Be on guard, when you are weak, satan will still attack!</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">b.&nbsp;The Amalekites were set on annihilation of the Israelites, totally exterminating and erasing them from the face of the earth. They were driven by prejudice and bitter hatred against the Israelites, the same bitter prejudice held by many nations against the Jews down through the generations. (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Psalm 83:4</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+83%3A7"><span class="csE2DF19C1">7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">c.&nbsp;The Amalekites should have known </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">that God had promised the land of Canaan to Israel</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. They should have known just as people today know that the Jews look upon the land of Palestine (Canaan) as the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">promised land</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> given to them by God. But the Amalekites should have been aware of the fact far more than we are today. Why? Because the Amalekites were the descendants of Esau, the twin brother of Jacob. And God had given the promise of the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">promised land </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">to Jacob and his descendants. Esau knew all about the promise. Amalek was the grandson of Esau. His father, Eliphaz, was the oldest son of Esau. Esau would certainly have shared the great promises of God with both his son Eliphaz and his grandson Amalek (cp. </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Genesis 36:15</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).

Moses promised to go to the top of the highest hill surrounding the battle field, to lift up the rod of God, appealing and calling out to God in prayer. The rod of God was looked upon as the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Banner</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of Israel. Consequently, when they saw the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">rod of God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;their banner&mdash;lifted high, they knew that God&#39;s servant was crying out to God.
