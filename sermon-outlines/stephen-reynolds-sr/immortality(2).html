And the calling and justification in verse 30 are both past tense: we can also easily see and understand how this is so for every saved person. But that glorification is also past tense is hard for us to receive, and we are prone to try to reason this away. &quot;Surely,&quot; we reason, &quot;the Lord has not yet returned. Surely the resurrection has not yet come about. Surely I have not yet received my new body. How then can the past tense be used here?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">II. THE GROUND OF GLORIFICATION.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Anything that doesn&rsquo;t have an adequate ground is a vain hope. The believer is not randomly and groundlessly glorified, but he is assured of glorification on the basis of association with the glorified Christ. There is no such thing as glory apart from Christ, but one is predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Lord.</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">In the work of the Spirit, the resurrection of the body is included, and the fashioning of it like the glorious body of Christ. Having been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s dear Son, the proposed work of grace is not completed until our bodies are like the glorious body of the Redeemer. &quot;Then shall I be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness&quot; (Ps. 17:15). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Colossians 3:4 emphasizes this unity with the life of Christ when it says, &quot;When Christ, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">who is our life</span><span class="csA521DC07">, shall appear, then shall ye also appear </span><span class="csD3860DFD">with Him in glory</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; Our being glorified is dependent upon our being possessed of that Divine life that is imparted to us in regeneration (2 Pet. 1:1-4). This is clearly stated in Colossians 1:27: &quot;...Christ in you, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">the hope of glory</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; &quot;Hope&quot; in Scripture is a stronger word than our Modern English word which generally means little more than a mere wish without any assurance of receiving the object of that hope. Biblical hope, on the other hand, is the well-grounded expectation of good to come, because it is based upon a Divine promise. Thus, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith is the evidence of the new birth, and is the ground of our expectation of glory to come.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">We noted under the preceding division that our glorification is as certain as our justification, for Romans 8:30 shows that glorification is grounded in justification. God has an order in everything and man cannot disannul that order. God&rsquo;s order </span><span class="csD3860DFD">in time</span><span class="csA521DC07"> is (1) Calling. (2) Justification, and (3) Glorification. &quot;...whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.&quot; Glorification is a result of justification, and cannot exist apart from it, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The same persons&mdash;the elect of God&mdash;are in the foreknown and predestinated stage as are in the glorification stage, and vice versa. The same ones who are called are to be glorified, for they have been justified, which is an incidental proof of the security of the saints.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">But someone will doubtless object that &quot;How can this be so, for most people who hear the Gospel do not respond to God&rsquo;s invitation?&quot; True, but this objection is based upon a misconception of the meaning of &quot;call&quot; here. It is assumed that &quot;called&quot; refers only to the general invitation to salvation. &quot;Called&quot; is used in two senses in the Bible doctrine of salvation: (1) The </span><span class="csD3860DFD">general call</span><span class="csA521DC07"> of the Gospel, which is universally rejected by men until the Holy Spirit works in their hearts to quicken them so as to enable them to hear, heed and respond to it. (2) The </span><span class="csD3860DFD">effectual</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">call</span><span class="csA521DC07"> of the Holy Spirit by which men are born again and enabled thereby to repent, believe and respond to God&rsquo;s invitation in the fullness of the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">1Co 16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2Co 1:6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. {is effectual: or, is wrought} </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Eph 3:7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Eph 4:16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Phm 1:6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Jas 5:16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.

The concurrence of the human will is no part of this (Rom. 9:15-16), for being spiritually dead it is not capable of any right spiritual action until it is made alive by the Spirit of God. Thus </span><span class="csD3860DFD">no</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">one</span><span class="csA521DC07"> is ever saved just by the general call of the Gospel, but </span><span class="csD3860DFD">all are saved</span><span class="csA521DC07"> to whom the effectual call comes. It is to this second &quot;call&quot; that is made effectual by the almighty power of God that reference is made in Romans 8:30, and other texts where &quot;call&quot; is used in this special sense. This &quot;call&quot; is &quot;unto the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">obtaining of the glory</span><span class="csA521DC07"> of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (2 Thess. 2:14). And it is to be noticed in the preceding verse that this is based upon God&rsquo;s sovereign choice, as in Romans 8:29-30. The believer in Christ receives the glory of Christ </span><span class="csD3860DFD">prospectively</span><span class="csA521DC07"> in salvation, for glorification is grounded in salvation, being actually a part of it.</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">To inform us who shall possess it, and on what ground, it is called an inheritance. Plainly denoting, that none but the children of God shall enjoy it: for a servant, considered as such, cannot inherit. We must, therefore, be the sons of the Highest, by adoption and regeneration, before we can justly hope to enjoy the heavenly patrimony. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Glorification is also grounded in our position as believers, for we are predestinated to be accepted in the beloved Son of God, as in Ephesians 1:5-6. &quot;Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.&quot; The beauty of glorification lies not in us and in our efforts, but wholly in Christ and in His spiritual beauty that is put upon us, as beautifully prefigured in Ezekiel 16:14. &quot;And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.&quot; Israel generally, as well as the Gentiles, missed this truth completely.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">It is as much by Christ&rsquo;s risen and glorified life, as by His sacrificial death, that we find acceptance with the Father, for His righteousness is imputed to us as Romans 4 so abundantly testifies. And Romans 5:10 clearly says, &quot;For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">we shall be saved by his life</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; This is why those who deny the resurrection of Christ have no hope of eternal life and glory, for they deny that which is an integral part of the salvation and glorification of the saint. In the life of Christ alone is life and light for men (John 1:4), and it is to these who have received this life and light that the promise is given of sharing in the glory of Christ. The imputed righteousness of Christ is that alone which fits men for acceptance before God and entry into His kingdom. Human righteousness is never sufficient, for the Pharisees and scribes were the most legally righteous people on earth, yet our Lord warned His disciples in Matthew 5:20 that they needed more than this for acceptance into God&rsquo;s kingdom. &quot;Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The coming of our Lord in glorious majestyto</span><span class="csD3860DFD"> </span><span class="csA521DC07">the earth is set forth in Revelation 19:11-13, and in verse 14 we are shown His companions. &quot;And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">clothed in fine linen</span><span class="csA521DC07">, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">white and clean</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; This symbolism is explained in the immediate context, for verse 8 says: &quot;And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">fine linen is the righteousness</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">of</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">saints</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; On the basis of verse 7 &quot;his wife hath made herself ready,&quot; some believe that the righteousness in verse 8 is a personal, not an imputed, righteousness, but one word in verse 8 refutes this. &quot;Granted&quot; is the common Greek word for &quot;given,&quot; so that clearly this that characterizes the saints is an imputed righteousness&mdash;the only kind any person can have.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Thus, whether they are considered as individuals, or corporately as the Lamb&rsquo;s wife (vv. 7-8), or militantly as an army (v. 14), their glory is a result of the imputed righteousness of Christ. But not just by this alone, for as we&rsquo;ve noted under the first division, the believer&rsquo;s glorification is grounded in God&rsquo;s omnipotent power, in His omniscience, and indeed in all of His glorious attributes. Abraham Booth observes:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Their felicity, therefore, is permanent as the Divine perfections they adore and enjoy; and made certain to their own comprehensive minds beyond the possibility of a doubt. This makes their state supremely glorious. This constitutes heaven indeed. Nay, what if the limits of their capacities should be forever enlarging, and forever receiving greater measures of glory? For the Deity is an infinite source of blessedness; and finite vessels may be forever expanding, and forever filling, in that ocean of All-sufficiency. </span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The glorification of the saints rests upon the grace of God as is implied in Ephesians 1:3, 10. &quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ...That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in Him.&quot; These two verses are tied together by the intervening verses that detail how grace works to bring these spiritual blessing to us. Glorification, like calling and justification, must be grounded in God&rsquo;s grace, since none of us can claim to deserve even the least part of these spiritual blessings.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">III. THE TIME OF GLORIFICATION.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">When may we expect this wonderful experience to come about? And where is it to take place? Many people think that it takes place immediately upon our death, when we pass into heaven. This is incorrect, although it is correct to say that one who has died has &quot;entered into glory,&quot; for this phrase describes the presence of God, where we go at death (Eccl. 12:7; 2 Cor. 5:8). It does not, however, describe the condition of the saints in heaven while they are awaiting the final episode in their redemption. There is a sense in which those that have died in Christ have been made perfect. </span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Besides this final perfection, to which the saints are taught to aspire, there are stages in their progress to which the name perfection is, in a subordinate sense, applied in the Holy Scriptures. The disembodied saints, now in the presence of God, though they have not attained to the resurrection of the body, are nevertheless called &quot;just men made perfect.&quot; </span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">They are free from the body of death, free from sin, free from all the tribulations and sorrows of this world, and are present with the Lord, and in the enjoyment of his love. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Hebrews 12:23. &quot;perfection&quot; we have only to notice the prior disclaimer of absolute perfection in those that have not yet attained to the resurrection. After having listed many that had triumphed by faith in the Lord, Hebrews 11:39-40 says of all these that they had not yet been made perfect. &quot;And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">received not the promise</span><span class="csA521DC07">: God having provided some better thing for us, that </span><span class="csD3860DFD">thatthey</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">without</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">us</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">should not be made perfect</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; The final and absolute perfecting, or completing, as the Greek word often means, of the saints, will take place all at one time when all saints from all ages will be glorified together. And we make this statement with this exception: we are fully aware that there were some Old Testament saints that, along with Christ, constituted the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">firstfruits of the resurrection</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (Matthew 27:51-53). We have no explanation for this, but accept it as a true revelation of the facts. It is God&rsquo;s business as to what is involved.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Our gracious Lord has made known &quot;the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had </span><span class="csD3860DFD">afore prepared unto glory</span><span class="csA521DC07">&quot; (Rom. 9:23). And it is the fact that He has before prepared them unto glory, and glory for them, that glorification is placed in the past tense in Romans 8:30. But the believer cannot be physically glorified until the judgment seat of Christ, for it is there and at that time that the degree of his glory will be determined, as 2 Corinthians 5:9-10 shows. &quot;Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.&quot; But this judgment takes place at the return of Christ to earth, after the Great Tribulation, as says Matthew 16:27: &quot;For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and </span><span class="csD3860DFD">then he shall reward every man according to his works</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; His coming then will be with power and </span><span class="csD3860DFD">great</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">glory</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (Luke 21:27), and He shall sit upon the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">throne of his glory</span><span class="csA521DC07">&quot; (Matthew 19:28). Glory will be the chief characteristic of that great event.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The degree of one&rsquo;s glory will be contingent upon the faithfulness of his service, and so, rewards enter into the matter, and these are to be passed out at the coming of Christ. But consider: both good and bad actions by Christians have consequences that go on and on, like the ripples in a lake left by the tossing in of a single stone, and the full consequences of an act may not be fully known for several generations. Hence, only at the judgment seat of Christ, when all human actions are reckoned up, will the full consequences of any given act, good or bad, be known to men, and so the degree of reward due be discerned.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The Divine order of all this is presented in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. &quot;For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.&quot; Here we see: (1) The coming of Christ from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God. (2) The redemption of the body (Rom. 8:23), for the bodies of the dead saints are raised (Isa. 26:19), then the bodies of the living saints are changed by being instantly renovated (1 Cor. 15:51). (3) This shall be our gathering together unto Him (Ps. 50:3-5; 2 Thess. 2:1), the blessed hope of all believers (Titus 2:13). (4) The rewarding will take place after this (Matthew 16:27; Rev. 22:12). (5) This rewarding will include ruling over all the earth as kings and priests (Ps. 149:5-9; Rev. 5:9-10; 11:15-18).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Clearly the time of the glorification of the saints will be at the time of Christ&rsquo;s own enthronement over all the earth. This is borne out in the parable that Jesus taught in Luke 19:12,15. &quot;He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return...And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.&quot; Here is (1) The Return. (2) The Reigning. (3) The Rewarding. Nor can this be made out to be a present &quot;reigning of the church&quot; </span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Here we learn that Christ&rsquo;s return and His reception of the &quot;Kingdom&quot; are inseparably connected together. Not only do the Scriptures plainly refute the assertion that Christ is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">now reigning, </span><span class="csA521DC07">but existing conditions cannot be made to square with this belief. How absurd it is to say that Christ is now reigning over the earth when His authority is despised and rejected by the whole of the unbelieving world. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">On the basis of this fact, believers are taught in the model prayer to pray &quot;Thy kingdom come&quot; (Matthew 6:10), for the coming of the Kingdom of Christ will be the fruition of all the saints&rsquo;hopes and desires as well, for it will mark their entrance into the glory of Christ in all its fullness. But this very duty to pray this makes evident that the Kingdom has not yet come upon the earth, else the duty to pray this would be abrogated.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">We know not what prophecies yet remain to be fulfilled before the return of the Lord, and our consequent glorification. Perhaps there are none yet to be fulfilled, but only the sovereign will of God withholds this great event because His time is not yet. Though God has called us already to share in this glory, yet He has declared that this shall only come about </span><span class="csD3860DFD">after we have</span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;</span><span class="csD3860DFD">suffered</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">a</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">while</span><span class="csA521DC07">&quot; (1 Pet. 5:10), for our suffering will increase our appreciation of that glory when it dawns. Indeed, it is shown that there is a correlation between our suffering with Christ, and our being glorified together with Him (Rom. 8:17): &quot;...if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.&quot; And 2 Timothy 2:11-12 says: &quot;It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with him...&quot; Willingness to suffer for Christ&rsquo;s sake is a test of one&rsquo;s fidelity and love to Him, as well as teaching us to appreciate the glory when it comes. </span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">That repeated strain in the parable which follows that of the ten virgins &mdash;&quot;Well done, good and faithful servant: thou has been faithful over a few things, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">I will make thee ruler over many things</span><span class="csA521DC07">&quot; &mdash;seems to indicate the nature of the saints&rsquo; inheritance. Reigning with Christ over the earth throughout the millennium, their rank in His manifested kingdom will be according to their fidelity during the time of His absence. In the judgment of the nations which now follows, they will be associated with their Lord, &mdash;&quot;Know ye not that the saints shall judge the world?&quot; (1 Cor. 6:2) &mdash;and in their nearness to Him in honor and authority will consist the greatness of their reward. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Thus, it becomes a question of great importance to ask ourselves, as to how much we are willing to suffer for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, in the light of His promise to reward everyone who suffers for His sake. An important point is, that He has determined to allow us to suffer a while for His glory, which is itself a gift of His grace, as Philippians 1:29 shows. &quot;For unto you it is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">given in the behalf of Christ</span><span class="csA521DC07">, not only to believe on him, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">but</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">also to suffer for his sake</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; Thus, those who are unwilling to suffer for Christ, attempt to frustrate the very reason for the seeming delay of His return to glorify them, and the very means of the enhancement of their glorification.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">When shall the coming of Christ take place, and the saints&rsquo; glorification? No definite time is set, and it is foolish to attempt to set up dates. What is important is to watch for the fulfillment of events that mark the approach of the great event, and to be careful that we are always prepared to unashamedly meet Him at His coming.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">We want to get rid of the idea that there is a date fixed by our Lord for His coming. Without doubt God knows the exact time when it will happen. But the thing for us to mark is that it will not occur because a certain fixed date has arrived. That is the way we adjust all our human affairs, fixing dates, and then doing the things on those dates, unless it prove impossible. This is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">not</span><span class="csA521DC07"> the way here. And the more clearly this is fixed in our minds the better we shall understand God&rsquo;s plannings. The time of the Coming is fixed as </span><span class="csD3860DFD">the harvest is fixed, </span><span class="csA521DC07">that is, it will come when things are ripe for it. This is the principle determining the time. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">In harmony with this is the word that our Lord Himself has spoken in Matthew 25:13: &quot;Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.&quot; We are to watch for the signs of the times (Matthew 24:32-34) and these will give us a general idea of the time of the coming of our Lord again to earth, and of our glorification with Him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">IV. THE ASSOCIATION IN GLORIFICATION.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The text in Colossians 3:4 shows this in the words &quot;then shall </span><span class="csD3860DFD">ye also appear with Him</span><span class="csA521DC07"> in glory.&quot; Romans 8:17 likewise says: &quot;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and </span><span class="csD3860DFD">joint-heirs with Christ</span><span class="csA521DC07">; if so be that we suffer with him, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">that we may be also glorified together</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; This association in glorification is based upon the happy fact that God&rsquo;s plan and purpose has always been to conform every true believer to the image of Jesus Christ, as Romans 8:29 shows. &quot;For whom he did foreknow, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son</span><span class="csA521DC07">, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.&quot; This is involved in Jesus &quot;bringing many son unto glory,&quot; by so sanctifying them that they are all one with Christ through God&rsquo;s workings (Heb. 2:10-11).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;The resurrection of Christ is both the example and proof of ours (1 Cor. 15:20; 1 Pet. 1:3). First, it demonstrates that the work is feasible for God. Second, it demonstrates the sufficiency and acceptance of Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction for His people&rsquo;s guilt: but bodily death is a part of our penalty therefore: and must be repaired when we are fully invested with the avails of that purchase. Third, Scripture shows such a union between Christ, the Head, and His members; that our glorification must result as His does (1 Cor. 6:15). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Several of the terms used of glorification suggest or intimate this association with Christ in this grand event. Glorification is called &quot;the glorious liberty of the children of God,&quot; in Romans 8:21, suggesting thereby that as Christ, the preeminent Son of God, is free of all weakness, and the restraints of mortal flesh, so shall His brethren be also. It is called &quot;the adoption&quot; in Romans 8:23, suggesting our position as adult sons of God with Jesus Christ: we share His inheritance with Him. It is also called &quot;the redemption of the body,&quot; in this same text. This not only shows what adoption is in the Bible&mdash;the placing of the adult sons of God over their inheritance&mdash;but also shows that our physical bodies shall be redeemed from mortality and made like unto His glorious, immortal body (Phil. 3:21). It is exaltation with Christ, for just as He was highly exalted after having humbled Himself to do the will of the Father in the incarnation (Phil. 2:5-11), so every true believer is to humble himself so that he may be exalted in due time. See 1 Peter 5:6, where this exaltation is certainly coming &quot;in due time.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Just prior to this statement, Peter had spoken of being a partaker of the glory to come. In verse 1 he said: &quot;The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a </span><span class="csD3860DFD">partaker of the glory that shall be revealed</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; He spoke of this as certain because it is certain to all believers, for they cannot lose their salvation, and consequently cannot fail to be glorified. The degree of it may vary because of unfaithfulness, but not the fact of it. We are certain to be glorified because of Christ in us, as Colossians 1:27 declares: &quot;...Christ in you, the hope&mdash;expectation&mdash;of glory.&quot; The resurrection of the body, which is glorification, is an integral part of salvation, and so, glorification of the body is made absolutely certain by the salvation of the soul. B. H. Carroll rightly observes in his notes on Romans 8:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The fullness of the salvation in us is the regeneration of the soul, its ultimate sanctification, and the resurrection and glorification of the body. It has ever been impossible to satisfy the cravings of a human heart with the hope of soul salvation only. It is ingrained in the very constitution of our being that we long for the revivification of the body...Hence the resurrection of the dead is made in the Christian system, a pivotal doctrine, as we learn from the letter to the Corinthians: that our faith is vain, our preaching is vain, we are yet in our sins, our fathers have perished and God&rsquo;s apostles are false witnesses, if the dead rise not. That is the conclusion of the doctrine of salvation in us.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Paul is also inspired to show this same thing in 2 Timothy 2:10: &quot;Therefore I endure all things for the elect&rsquo;s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus </span><span class="csD3860DFD">with eternal glory</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; Thus, whether Jew or Gentile, all the vessels of mercy&mdash;that is, all whom God has mercifully determined to save&mdash;He has also prepared unto glory. Romans 9:23-24 says: &quot;And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Just as God the Father and God the Son, being one, share the things that are common to each, so the true saint, being associated with Christ, shares His glory which the Father has given to Him. John 17:21-22 reveals: &quot;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.&quot; Our glorification then rests upon being associated with Christ through the new birth, and is guaranteed by the omnipotent power of God. Unbelief may ask, &quot;How may these things be?&quot; (See 1 Cor. 15:35). But Scripture answers &quot;By the power of God, which is absolute.&quot; Philippians 3:21 says in no uncertain terms: &quot;Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself</span><span class="csA521DC07">.&quot; There is no room for doubt in this matter if God be God, and if we are associated with Him through saving faith in His Son, Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Furthermore, the believer&rsquo;s association with Christ in glorification is to be seen in such texts as 2 Timothy 2:12; Revelation 1:6; 5:10; 2:26-27, and Psalms 149, which speak of the saints&rsquo;joint rule with Christ over all the earth in the Millennial Kingdom. Glorification will also involve our being placed as kings and priests over all the earth. For during Christ&rsquo;s Millennial rule every civil governmental post, and every religious position will be occupied by those that are not only born again, but who also possess new bodies and minds which are incapable of mistakes in judgment or justice. This is why it will be a reign of perfect peace and righteousness (Ps. 85:9-11; Isa. 32:17-18). Then will the saints&rsquo; trust in Christ be vindicated before all the world, and no more will Satan give worldly honors and riches to wicked men to make it appear that evil is profitable. By this aspect of glorification will it be shown that God blesses those that trust and obey Him, and that no one loses permanently by serving God. And likewise, that to follow Satan, though it may be temporarily profitable and pleasing in this present evil age, will yet involve the loss of the glories of the coming age, and after that, eternal loss.</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Who can picture the blessed accomplishment of this promise! For two thousand years the saints have (more or less) lived as strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Many of them have been maligned, ostracized, persecuted and martyred. They went forth unto Christ &quot;without the camp, bearing His reproach&quot; (Heb. 13:13). But now shall they be richly rewarded. They suffered &quot;with Him&quot; and now shall they be also &quot;glorified together&quot; (Rom. 8:17). And then will it be fully manifested that &quot;the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us&quot; (Rom. 8:18). &mdash;A. W. Pink, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">The Redeemer&rsquo;s Return</span><span class="csA521DC07">, p. 299. Calvary Baptist Church Book Store, Ashland, KY., No date.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">One of Satan&rsquo;s subtle lies with which he sidetracks many sincere souls, is the lie that it is too costly to be a Christian. There has been instilled in the carnal minds of millions that one must grab what he can now, for the future is uncertain. But by this lie men are beguiled out of this glorious hope that is held out as absolutely certain for all the true saints of God, and they exchange an eternal glory for the gaudy glitter of a few moments of earth&rsquo;s false and failing glory. They find Satan&rsquo;s lies easier to believe than God&rsquo;s promises because they are unbelievers in heart, and they are only doing what comes naturally to them. And people do not realize that, since they belong to God by right of creation if not by right of redemption, it is an act of spiritual adultery to love the world (1 John 2:15).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Man&rsquo;s time on earth is so pitifully short&mdash;even when he lives beyond his appointed three score years and ten (Ps. 90:10), &mdash;and so Satan convinces man that he must grab all that he can, while he can. But the truth is, the present life is the time of testing and preparation for the world to come&mdash;a glorious world for all that are fitted for it by justification, sanctification and glorification. But who can even imagine the glory of the world to come, for it will not only involves inconceivable glory, but even growth in the ability to enjoy and appreciate it. In a description of heaven, A. H. Strong says:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Heaven will involve deliverance from defective physical organization and surroundings, as well as from the remains of evil in our hearts. Rest, in heaven, will be consistent with service, an activity without weariness, a service which is perfect freedom. We shall be perfect when we enter heaven, in the sense of being free from sin; but we shall grow to greater perfection thereafter, in the sense of a larger and completer being. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csA521DC07">But tragically, many fail the test of what is most important to them, and through selfishness, which is always self-defeating, they lose the ultimate good. The principle test that comes to men during this present life is, &quot;What will you do with Jesus Christ, the Son of God? Will you repent of sin against God, and joyfully trust His Son to be your sovereign Lord and Saviour? Or will you try to make it on you own?&quot; Millions daily trust in their own ability, and so, put themselves under the curse of God because of their inability to perfectly measure up to the requirements (Gal. 3:10), but the attempt of which is an act of self-worship, which is idolatry, and so, brings down God&rsquo;s curse (Jer. 17:5). What will your eternal state be? Will it be eternal glory with Christ or eternal shame with Satan and all other rebels? It all depends upon whether you are associated with Christ through faith in His redeeming work.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Col 3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Isa 46:9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The Divine attributes of omniscience, omnipotence and immutability are against all suppositions.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The Gk word &lt;apekdechomai&gt;is used in the same basic sense in all seven appearances </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Waiteth, waiting, wait for it, waiting for, wait for, we look for, and unto them that look </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ro 8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">1Co 1:7 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{coming: Gr.

But it is a great mistake to attempt to apply &quot;no respect of persons&quot; to God in every situation, and it manifests ignorance of Scripture, for in several areas He does show respect of persons, as a number of Scriptures declare. This is especially so in every area where election, salvation or any of God&rsquo;s covenant dealings are concerned (See Gen. 4:4; Ex. 2:25; Lev. 26:9; 2 Kings 13:23; Ps. 74:20; 138:6, and others). And, inasmuch as God is the source of all good and perfect gifts (Jam. 1:17), and is the One that distinguishes one person from another (1 Cor. 4:7), this respect of persons is commonly seen in life. For example, men do not all have the same advantages in life either physically, mentally, morally, psychologically or spiritually, for all are not gifted with the same abilities and talents, and opportunities vary from person to person. Examination of every text that declares that &quot;God is no respecter of persons&quot; will reveal that this is stated </span><span class="csD3860DFD">only in regard to judgment</span><span class="csA521DC07">, and in the final judgment no grace will be seen, but only pure damning justice that exacts everything that is due from sinners.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">In election and salvation God shows respect to some over others, for the very word &quot;elect&quot; implies the choice of some and the leaving of others. A universal election is a contradiction in terms. The very first appearance of &quot;respect&quot; in the Bible (and first appearances are almost always significant, and are often the most definitive) in Genesis 4:4-5 shows that God had respect both unto Abel and to his worship, but not to Cain and to his worship. This text and the others cited above in this regard clearly show that God does respect one person over another in matters of His grace. This is because grace is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">always unconditional else it is not grace</span><span class="csA521DC07">. The wisest of men recognized this truth, and prayed to enjoy it (1 Kings 8:28). Only in judgment and in rewards, we repeat, must God deal impartially with men; all His dealings in grace, because they do not take notice of any merit or worth in the creature, must show respect of persons.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">God has pledged Himself to give glory to every saved soul because he is saved. This involves grace, in which there is respect of persons in every instance. But God has also pledged Himself to reward every rightly motivated service done unto Him by enhancing that initial glory. And because this involves service and rewards God shows no respect of persons, but bases it upon faithfulness in well doing (Rom. 2:7,10). This is a point where we must &quot;rightly divide the Word of truth,&quot; and not just parrot some misapplied Biblical phrase that fits our prejudices. Scripture has spoken clearly in this matter. What will our response be?</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
