<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Every Degree of Movement, God is Watching</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every degree of movement, God is watching and trying. His
countenance doth behold the upright.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.2 privily, lurking in some dark places shooting at the
upright in heart. There eyes are set on the upright to destroy them, but God
has His eyes set to deliver. Keep your eyes on the Lord, and allow the Lord to
establish hope and strength and courage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People are in and they are out, but the Lord says that ought
not to be. When we hear His and Word and Know His will, there should be
hesitance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will never be without trial in this life. </p>
