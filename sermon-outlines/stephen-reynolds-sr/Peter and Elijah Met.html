After the corn has been a short time above the earth, the blades begin to separate, and the stalk to spring out of the center. The side leaves turn back to make way for the protruding stalk; and fall bending down to the earth, assuming a withered appearance, though still attached to the plant. To look at the corn in this state, no one, unacquainted with the circumstance, could hope of a harvest. In a short time other leaves spring out; the former freshen, and begin to stand erect; and the whole seems to revive from death. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">This is the circumstance to which the prophet refers &quot;they shall revive as the corn.&quot; Of this a prudent and profitable use may be made. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">1.

But when the Spirit of judgment brings to the light of conscience the hidden things of iniquity, and repentance is deepened into contrition, the broken and the contrite heart groans, and thinks that all is lost; deep distress takes place, and discouragement succeeds discouragement.
