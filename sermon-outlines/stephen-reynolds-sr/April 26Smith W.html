		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">To Rev. A.A. Boddy, </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">All Saints&rsquo; Vicarage, </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Sunderland, England. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our dear Brother Wigglesworth arrived in Melbourne last Thursday, February 16th, and he had a meeting that night, when many came to hear his blessed message, and&mdash;Glory to God!&mdash;many dear sick ones were delivered in answer to the prayer of faith. Some of those who attended the meeting had come many hundreds of miles for the purpose, and were addressed by the evangelist from the words of the Lord Jesus Christ: &ldquo;Ye are my witnesses.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;There is nothing so real as God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and God wants men to be as real as He is; sons of God with power. God has never made us to be imitations, never made any of us to be ordinary creatures. He wants specialities, and wants every one of us to be specialities, with souls fixed in God, and working the works of God. When God is upon the smallest person in the place, He can make us mighty, and when we are simple enough to believe Him, the whole of our lives are changed, and the things which we have merely heard about begin to be realities in our own experiences. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">Realities.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;My theme tonight is that Jesus would not have us to be less than realities. My message is to Y-O-U, not to somebody else. It was hard for the disciples to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead, and there was something of remarkable order that took place to bring these men into the knowledge of this living fact. It is the power of this risen Christ that I am here tonight.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Although Mr. Wigglesworth made it quite plain and clear to his hearers that be wouid rather see one sinner saved than 10,000 people healed of bodily ailments, he invited any who were in pain to come forward for prayer in the Name of Jesus, Who said, &ldquo;All power is given onto Me in heaven and on earth,&rdquo; at the same time taking much trouble to impress upon them the thought that by no power of his would any receive deliverance, but only through the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, Who healed all who came unto Him. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Amongst those who came forward for prayer were several who declared that they had received remarkable and instantaneous healings. A few of those were as follows: One little girl, six years of age, was seen, after prayer by the evangelist, walking out of the front door of the building with her mother, who was delightedly exclaiming to all and sundry, &ldquo;Look at her! She has never walked in her life before!&rdquo; A man who had not walked for over four years owing to rheumatoid arthritis, was instantly healed, and after triumphantly passing his stick and crutch up to the platform, gave an impromptu exhibition of the power that had come into his legs by jumping and leaping and praising God. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Others suffering from weak spine, nerve and heart trouble, weak eyesight, asthma, kidney trouble, loss of voice, etc., claimed to have been wonderfully helped. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Since the first night there have been many other wonderful healings. Last night a dear woman who had been unable to walk for 6&frac12; years was brought to be prayed for, and&mdash;glory be to God!&mdash;she got out of her chair and walked, and her husband pushed her chair along, with her walking behind. Praise our covenant-keeping God! Truly He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">There have also been many conversions&mdash;at one meeting alone 40 dear ones accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior&mdash;and we are believing for still greater things. The revival showers are falling and God </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">is working</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. Bless His holy Name! </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">We also have some precious times of biessing in the morning meetings conducted by our dear Brother Wigglesworth, and many go away praising God for the feast they have had. Truly &ldquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Am enclosing newspaper cuttings, so you will see how the press are taking it up. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Just this morning a mother brought her little girl along, who had fallen on a pair of scissors, and cut her mouth so that she couid not close it. After the evangelist had laid his hands upon it and prayed, she was able to close her mouth and was quite well. Glory to God! </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">I must now close, praying that God will abundantly bless you in your labors of love for Him, and asking your prayers of behalf of Australia. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">With Christian greetings, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Yours in Christ&rsquo;s happy service, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">SISTER WINNIE ANDREWS, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Secretary. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">104 Queensberry Street, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">North Melbourne, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Victoria, Australia </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Feb. 23rd. 1922. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=1875262584891428900&amp;postID=3796885197009204130" title="&quot;Edit Post&quot;"></a></span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs39141F69">

			<span class="cs12506F1C">Subtitled, &ldquo;Ministration and operation of the gifts.&rdquo;<br/>Preached in Bradford, England.<br/>Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Latter Rain Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, February 1923.</span></h4>
		<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to talk from the twelfth chapter of 1st Corinthians. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These are the last days; the days of the falling away. These are days when Satan is having a great deal of power. But we must keep in mind that Satan has no power only as he is allowed. And we must never think that Satan has power over the believer. If I could get only the establishment of that fact in your hearts it would be something living all the time. Satan has no power over the believer. &ldquo;The wicked one toucheth him not.&rdquo; So we must understand that all things that fall to our lot are according to the mind and will of God. &ldquo;All things work together for good to them that love God.&rdquo; We may be chastised by God but it is only because He wants us to have His holiness. We may have any amount of correction, but it will only be the touch of the Lord to bring us nearer to Him, that we may be at all times more than conquerors. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want you to clearly see that the day will come when the evil one will have great power. And you can imagine that just as that day draws near the believer is more greatly insulated with divine revelation and more power. You will find the saints will become more holy and will have more liberty and more power. As Satan is having power, the saints will have greater power. And just as the day comes for the saints to be caught away we shall have mighty power on all lines, and the last great power will take us out of the world. Know this fact that God is always revealing Himself on every line and thought to keep the believer at such a standard of victory that he is in the place where he never need be defeated. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is nothing helping me so much in these days as the fact that God is loosing me. It is a great thing to know that God is loosing you from the world, loosing you from a thousand things. You have to have the mind of God on all things. If you don&rsquo;t you will stop His working. I had to learn that as I was on the water enroute to Australia. We stopped at a place called Aden, where they were selling all kinds of ware. Amongst other things were some beautiful rugs and feathers, ostrich feathers in great quantities. They were very lovely for those who wanted feathers but I had no room for them at all. However, there was a gentleman in &ldquo;first class&rdquo; who wanted feathers and it appears that he had bought one lot and the next lot put up was too big; he did not want so many. He said to me, &ldquo;Will you join me?&rdquo; I knew I did not want feathers for I had no room or use for them and wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with them if I got them. However, he pleaded with me to join him. I perceived it was the Spirit as clearly as anything and I said, &ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo; So the feathers were knocked down for three pounds. Then I found the man had no money with him. He had plenty but of course it was on the boat. I perceived it !was the Spirit again so it fell to my lot to pay for the feathers. He said to me, &ldquo;I will bring the money and give it to one of the stewards.&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;No, that is not business. I am known all over the ship. You seek me out.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The man came and brought the money. I said, &ldquo;God wants me to talk to you. Now sit down.&rdquo; So he sat down and in ten minutes&rsquo; time the whole of his life was unhinged, unravelled, broken up, so broken that like a great big baby he wept and cried for sa!vation. It was &ldquo;feathers&rdquo; that did it. But you know brothers, it seems to me we will never know the mind of God till we know the voice of God. The striking thing about Moses is that it took him forty years to learn human wisdom, forty years to know his helplessness, and forty years to live in the power of God. One hundred and twenty years it took to teach that man and sometimes it seems to me it will take many years to bring us just where we can tell the voice of God, the leadings of God, and the lines of God and all His will concerning us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But I am speaking to people this morning who ought to know the mind of the Lord because God wants us thoroughly furnished unto all good works and always ready to give a good account of the hope that is within us. We must always be ready as the man in the counting-house is ready on the order lines, so we must be ready with all the mind of God, for the day is at hand and we must clearly see that nothing shall come against us but that which shall be on the line of profit. Everything we touch shall be definitely for the operation of God&rsquo;s thought for a world&rsquo;s need. It will be so. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, every one of us ought to know the mind of God on the gifts. I notice in particular that the manifestation of the Spirit of God is given &ldquo;to profit withal.&rdquo; I want you to know that my addresses from time to time cannot be in any way less than on the Baptism of the Spirit because I see in that all revelation, all illumination, everything that God in Christ was to be brought forth into perfect light that we might be able to see right into that holiness of His which was filled with all the fulness of God, and that we may he able to understand that He was the first fruits on every line in order that we may live the same, produce the same, and be in every activity a son of God with power. It must be so. We must not limit the Holy One. And we must clearly see that God brought us forth on natural lines to make us supernatural that we might be changed all the time on the line of supernatural basis, that we may every day live so in the Spirit, that all of the revelations of God are just like a great big canvas thrown hefore our eyes, and we see clearly step by step into all the divine will of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are three things in particular that we must understand concerning the baptism of the Spirit. Any Assembly, I don&rsquo;t care what it is, that puts its hand upon the working of the Spirit will surely bring trouble to that Assembly. The Assembly must be as free in the Spirit as possible, and you must allow a certain amount of extravagance when people are getting through to God. I notice that unless we are very wise, we can easily interfere and quench the power of God which is upon us. It is an evident fact that one man in a meeting, filled with unbelief, can make a place for the devil to have a seat. And it is very true to fact, that if we are not careful we may quench the Spirit of some person who is innocent and is incapable on the line of innocence to help himself. &ldquo;And ye that are strong must bear the infirmities of the weak.&rdquo; You must be careful in that. If you want an Assembly full of life you must have an Assembly in which the Spirit of God is manifested. And in order to keep at the boiling pitch of molted heat, of that blessed incarnation of the Spirit, you must be as simple as babies; you must be as harmless as doves and as wise as serpents. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In this I always ask God for a Ieading of grace. It takes grace to be in a meeting because it is so easy if you are not careful, to get on the natural side. The man who is a preacher, if he has lost the unction, will be well repaid if he will carefully, inwardly repent and get right with God and get the unction back. It never pays us to be less than always spiritual, and we must have a divine language always on the line, and the language must be of God. Beloved, if you come into real perfect line of the grace of God, one thing will certainly take place in your life. You will change from that old position of the world&rsquo;s line where you were judging everybody, and where you were not trusting anyone, and come into a place where you will have a heart that will believe all things; where you will have a heart that under no circumstances reviles again when you are reviled. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I know many of you present this morning think many times before you speak once. Here is a great word: &ldquo;For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf; but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.&rdquo; Innocent. No inward corruption or defilement, that is full of distrusts, but just a holy, divine likeness of Jesus that dares believe that God Almighty will surely watch over all. Hallelujah! &ldquo;There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall give His angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.&rdquo; The child of God who is rocked in the bosom of the Father has the sweetest touch of heaven, and the honey of the word is always in it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh if the saints only knew how precious they are in the sight of God they would be scarcely able to sleep for thought of His watchful, loving care. Oh He is a precious Jesus! He is a lovely Savior! He is divine in all His attitude toward us, and makes our hearts to burn. There is nothing like it. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said on the road to Emmaus, &ldquo;did not our hearts burn within us as He walked with us and talked with us?&rdquo; Oh beloved, it must be so today. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It will greatly help you to see three things: First, the ministration. The Holy Ghost is full of ministration. Then again, don&rsquo;t forget about the operation of the Holy Ghost. And always keep in your mind the fact that the Holy Ghost must bring manifestation. Let us take the first thought now which is bearing on this great plan. We must understand that the Holy Ghost is breath, the Holy Ghost is Person, and it is the most marvelous thing to me to know that this Holy Ghost power can be in every part of your body. You can feel it from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. Oh, it is lovely to be burning all over with the Holy Ghost! And when that takes place there is nothing but the operation of the tongue that must give forth the glory and the praise. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You must be in the place of magnifying the Lord. The Holy Ghost is the great Magnifier of Jesus, the great Illuminator of Jesus. And so after the Holy Ghost comes in it is impossible to keep your tongue still. Why, you would burst if you didn&rsquo;t give Him utterance. Talk about a dumb baptized soul? Such a person is not to be found in the Scriptures. When the Holy Ghost comes He must be a power of ministry. That is His office. The power of ministry through the revelation of the great ideal of Jesus! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When the Holy Ghost becomes a ministry in the life, what will happen? Why, beloved, if we can get lost in God only once in a year, to be divinely imbued with this power, it will be worth a world to us. Talk about preaching! I would like to know how it will be possible for all the people filled with the Holy Ghost to stop preaching. Even the sons and daughters must prophesy. After the Holy Ghost comes in, after that operation by the Spirit, a man is in a new order in God. And you will find it so real that you cannot help it, you will want to sing, talk, laugh and shout. We are in a strange place when the Holy Ghost comes in. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If the incoming of the Spirit is lovely, what must be the onflow? The incoming is only to be an onflow. I am very interested in scenery. When I was in Switzerland I wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied till I went to the top of the mountain, though I like the valleys also. On the summit of the mountain the sun beats on the snow and sends the water trickling down the mountains right through to the meadows. Go there and see if you can stop it. Just so in the spiritual. God begins with the divine flow of His eternal power which is the Holy Ghost, and you cannot stop it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We must always clearly see that the Baptism of the Spirit must make us ministering spirits. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next thought then is that it must be on the line of operation. You will find that if you really get full of the Holy Ghost, two things must happen: ministry and operation. I want you to notice Peter and John had been baptized only a short time. Did they know what they had? No. I defy you to know what you have. No one knows what he has in the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. He has no conception of it. You cannot measure it by any measuring line of human standards. It is greater than any man has any idea of, and consequently those two disciples had no idea what they had. For the first time after they were baptized in the Holy Ghost with this order of the Spirit, they came down to the Gate Beautiful. There they saw the man sitting who for forty years had been lame. What was the first thing after they saw him? Ministration. What was the second? Operation. What was the third? Manifestation, of course. It could not be otherwise. You will always find that this order in the Scripture will be carried out in everybody. In these meetings we are having you must have one set purpose. I believe that God has me here for this purpose, to make you all actors. There are so few actors; therefore so little is done. I want you to notice that there is a great deal of difference between your acting and the acting upon the stage. On the stage in the theater they tell me that they take fiction and act it so it produces a fact before the people. We have a fact, let us not work as if it were fiction. If we do it will be very serious, but we must work out facts in the name of Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here I am on the platform this morning. I had no idea what God had given me till I began to act. As I began to act then God began. You cannot have results, manifestations, operations, the truths of the Spirit, the working of the ministry and the gifts of the Holy Ghost, without you begin to act. I clearly see that we ought to have spiritual giants in the earth, mighty in apprehension, wonderful in activity, always having a wonderful report because of their activity in faith. I find out instead of that there are so many people who have perhaps better discernment than you, better knowledge of the Word than you, but they have failed to put it into practice, so these gifts lie dormant. I am here to help you begin on the sea of life with mighty acts in the power of God through the gifts of the Spirit. You will find that this which I am speaking on is out of knowledge, I can truly say, of a wonderful experience in many lands, having seen so many things that have wakened me up. The man who is filled with the Holy Ghost is always in an acting place. Jesus was always in the act. You read the first verse of the Acts of the Apostles, &ldquo;Jesus began both to do and teach.&rdquo; He began to do first, and so must we. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, we must see that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is an activity with an outward manifestation. When I was in Norway God was mightily moving there, though I had to talk by interpretation. However, God always worked in a wonderful way. One day as we were going up a hill we met a man coming down who stopped the three men I was with, one being the interpreter. I was walking on but I saw he was in a dilemma so I turned back, and said to the interpreter, &ldquo;What is up?&rdquo; &ldquo;This man.&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is so full of neuralgia that he is almost blind and he is in a terrible state. He is asking us if we know the nearest help.&rdquo; As soon as ever they finished the conversation I said to the spirit that was afflicting him, &ldquo;Come out of him in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; And the man said, &ldquo;It is all gone! It is all gone! I am free.&rdquo; Ah, brothers, we have no conception of what God has for us in the world! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will tell you what happened in Sydney, Australia the other day. A man with a stick passed a friend and me. He had to get down and then twist over, and the tortures of his face made a deep impression on my soul. I asked myself, &ldquo;Is it right to pass this man?&rdquo; So I said to my friend, &ldquo;There is a man in a terrible state, he is in awful distress and I cannot go further, I must speak to him.&rdquo; I went over to this man and said to him, &ldquo;You seem to be in great trouble.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am no good and never will be.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You see that hotel. Be in front of that door in five minutes and I will pray for you, and you shall be as straight as any man in this place.&rdquo; This is on the line of activity in the faith of Jesus. I came back after paving a bill, and he was there. It wasn&rsquo;t a stick but an umbrella that he had. I will never forget him, wondering if he was going to be trapped, or what was up that a man should stop him in the street and tell him he should be made straight. I had said it, so it must be. If you say anything you must stand with God to make it so. Never say anything for bravado, without you have the right to say it. Always be sure of your ground, and that you are honoring God. If there is anything about it to make you anything, it will bring you sorrow. Your whole ministry will have to be on such a line of grace and blessing it will turn the whole thing. We helped him up the two steps, passed him through to the hoist and took him upstairs. It seemed difficult to get him from the hoist to my bedroom, as though Satan was making the last stroke for his life, but we got him there. Then in five minutes&rsquo; time this man walked out of that bedroom as straight as any man in this place. He walked perfectly and declared he hadn&rsquo;t a pain in his body. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Olh brother, it is ministration, it is operation, it is manifestation! Those are three of the greatest leading principles of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. And we must see to it that God is producing through us these three. Beloved, I want you to notice this, that except you stand with God it is impossible for God to manifest His power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Bible is the Word of God, it has the truths and whatever people may say of them they stand stationary, unmoveable. Not one jot or tittle shall fail of all His good promises. His word will come forth. In heaven it is settled, on earth it must be made manifest that He is the God of an everlasting power. God wants manifestation and He wants His glory to be seen. And He wants us all to be filled with that line of thought that He can look upon us and delight in us in the world subduing the world unto Him. And so you are going to miss a great deal if you don&rsquo;t begin to act. But once you begin to act in the order of God. you will find that God establishes your faith and from that day starts you on the line of the promises. When will you begin? In a place in England I was dealing on the lines of faith and what would take place if we believed God. Many things happened. But when I got away it appeared one man who worked in the colliery had heard me. He was in trouble with a stiff knee. It was the first time he had heard me, I think. He said to his wife, &ldquo;I cannot help but think every day that that message of Wigglesworth&rsquo;s was to stir us to do something. I cannot get away from it. All the men in the pit know how I walk with a stiff knee, and you know how you have wrapped it around with yards of flannel. Well, I am going to act. You have to be the congregation.&rdquo; He got his wife in front of him, &ldquo;I am going to act and do just like Wigglesworth did.&rdquo; He got hold of his leg unmercifully saying, &ldquo;Come out, you devils, come out! In the name of Jesus. Now Jesus help me. Come out you devils, come out.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Wife, they are gone! Wife, they are gone. This to too good. I am going to act now.&quot; So he went to his place of worship and all the collier boys were there. It was a prayer meeting. As he told them this story these men became delighted. They said, &ldquo;Jack, come over here and help me.&rdquo; And Jack went. As soon as he was through in one home he was invited to another, loosing these people of the pains they had gotten in the colliery. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Ah brothers and sisters, we have no idea what God has for us if we will only begin! But oh, the grace we need! We may make a mishap. If you do it outside of Him, if you do it for yourself, and if you want to be someone, it will be a failure. We shall only be able to do well as we do it in the name of Jesus. Oh the love and expression that God&rsquo;s Son can put into us if we are only humble enough, weak enough, and helpless enough to know that except He does it, it will not be done! &ldquo;What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive and ye shall have them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The first of the nine gifts which has to be made manifest is the gift of wisdom. I am positive this morning that there isn&rsquo;t anything that an Assembly needs so much as wisdom, the possession of which will save us from many foolish things. When we are in a straight where two ways meet, and don&rsquo;t know which way to go, concerning buildings or alterations, or otherwise, a word of wisdom for your Assembly would be such a manifestation of God&rsquo;s love that you would never forget it. But you will always find that wisdom never comes on any lines but the lines of love. That is the first grace of the Spirit. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And perfect fear is joined up with that divine love. I want you to see clearly that if you are where the love of God is the very nature of your life, you have no place to live as it were, only in God. You can trust God to give you the &ldquo;word of wisdom&rdquo; because it is a needed word for us through our Pentecostal order. If we were not balanced by other qualities, we should jump over the traces, the Spirit of the life of Christ is so mighty within us. And so we need wisdom. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The word of wisdom from the Lord would save us from a lot of trouble. We all have to pay a big price for our learning; I have paid some big prices. I remember one time I was in great difficulty and needed help. I was walking on the road one day and met a man who lived opposite me who said, &ldquo;Smith, I have been thinking about selling my house. I cannot think about anyone buying it but you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Strange thing,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have no money. But how much do you want for it?&rdquo; He mentioned the price. &ldquo;I will buy that house,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you will just turn it over to me for the money without having to bother with the lawyers.&ldquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; I had given my word without thought. That was a mistake. There were a thousand mistakes on this job, the thing I needed at that time was just one word of wisdom from God. It didn&rsquo;t come because I was so active. You can be too active and if you act outside of God you will aways be in trouble. If we are not well balanced, and deep down in God, we make a thousand mistakes because we are too much in a hurry. I told my wife what I had promised. &ldquo;How will you manage it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I have always managed it so far,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know how to get through this.&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;Can I take it out of the business?&rdquo; No, I couldn&rsquo;t. So I set on a human plan; I wasn&rsquo;t in the divine plan on this. I was in God&rsquo;s service but you can be in God&rsquo;s service and can have a lot of God about you, and still get out of his plan. That is where we make a mistake, getting outside the plan of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Well, I had some rich relatives and thought I would tie them up but none of them seemed to have anything to spare; everybody was in difficulties. I had made a foolish go of it so after I had tried them all, I said to my wife, &ldquo;It is strange, I have tried everybody about this business but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to come off.&rdquo; Then she said, &ldquo;You have not been to God yet. When you go to God you will get it all.&rdquo; I went to God, saying, &ldquo;Father, I have been very foolish and I have gotten into a hole. If You will help me out I will never ask You on the same line again.&rdquo; Here comes the word of wisdom. Oh that word of wisdom! God gave it. In two minutes the whole thing was settled on God&rsquo;s side but not on mine. How could it be? So I came down to my wife saying, &ldquo;What do you think He told me! &lsquo;Go to Brother Webster.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Brother Webster was about the poorest man I knew and yet he was about the richest man I knew for he knew God. Off I went early the next morning. &ldquo;What brings you this morning?&rdquo; Brother Webster asked. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I was talking to the Lord last night and so I came to see you the first chance I had.&rdquo; &ldquo;If it is a matter like that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will go down to the house and speak about it.&rdquo; We went down to the house. &ldquo;I promised to buy a house of a man,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;three weeks ago and I am short 100 pounds. I have tried to get this money, I believe not in the Lord&rsquo;s plan, and I have been tried about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you have only come to me now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I only went to the Lord about it last night.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a strange thing. Three weeks ago I had a hundred pounds. I put it between the mattresses, I have put it in all sorts of places in the house. I could not have any rest so I took it to the bank. If it will be as great a blessing to you as a trouble to me, you shall have it.&rdquo; So we went to the bank and he got the money and said, &ldquo;Take it and be off.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh to know God! Oh to go in the way that God would have us! Oh to cease from our own planning and our own arranging! Oh to have the word of God! The Word of wisdom! Oh to believe the Word and to enter into this treasury and hear Him say, &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; and do it! When we get there God will surely, as divinely as we are human, have a divine plan for us and bring us right into line where there will be no trouble, no trial, and sorrows will be at an end when we get to know God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, I pray that as we go forth into these gifts of the Spirit that God will show us there is a way for us, and that it is His way. If we turn to our way we shall surely make great mistakes and shall be filled with trouble. I desire to impress this thought upon you. Live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit, walk in the communion of the Spirit, talk with God. Apart from this there is no security for you, but on these lines all else is for you. All leadings of the divine order are for you. I pray that if there are any who have turned to their own way and have made God second as I did in that matter, they will come to repentance on all lines. Separate yourself from every earthly touch and touch ideals. And God will bring you to an end of every order of yourself. Begin with God this moment. </span></p><h3 class="cs39141F69">

			<span class="cs12506F1C">Subtitled, &ldquo;An Easter message by Smith Wigglesworth.&rdquo;<br/>Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April 24, 1943.</span></h4>
		<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul writes: &ldquo;Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is what the Lord does for us when we come to Him; He takes out the heart of stone and gives us a heart of flesh. The Spirit of God will write in both our hearts and minds the law of Christ. He cleanses us from all iniquity, takes away the old order and brings in the new, and He gives us His blessed Holy Spirit who causes us to walk in a way that is pleasing to Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The old life is brought to the cross of Calvary. Our old nature is crucified there and we are brought into the position that Paul speaks of when he says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, God would have us see that no man is perfected on any line only as Christ the living Word abides in him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In this new life we must have the Word of God dwelling richly in us. This Word is living and powerful and effective. It is the sword of the Spirit that will prove an effective weapon in the hands of the Spirit-filled warrior. By it we get complete victory over all the power of the enemy. But we need the power of the Spirit within to enable us to wield the sword of the Spirit effectively. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When Christ dwells in us, our life will be like that life which is described of Him in the Gospels, a life of constant communion with the Father. Ours will be a life of dependence on the Spirit of God, for we do not know how to pray as we ought. It is only as the Spirit prays through us that things will be accomplished for God. But as we yield ourselves wholly to God and ask for the Spirit, He will graciously give the Spirit so that we can pray in the Holy Ghost. And as we pray in the Holy Ghost we shall see signs and wonders wrought in the name of the holy child Jesus. We can have a ministry of the miraculous even as the early apostles had, if we give ourselves to prayer, for in response to prayer God will send the Pentecostal power as at the beginning. Nothing is so sweet as to have our hearts yearning with compassion, moved with compassion for the poor and needy. As the Lord fills your heart with love and compassion, you will find the inward cry from the depths of your need is met by the depth of God&rsquo;s love. When God gets into the depths of our hearts He purifies every intention and He fills us with His own joy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When Moses received the tables of stone and he returned to the people, God made his face to shine. There was a glory in the giving of the law. But there is a more wonderful glory in the giving of the Spirit. Much more wonderful than the shine on Moses&rsquo; face is the moving of the Spirit to write His commandments on our hearts, the deep movings of the God of eternity as He writes His law of love and compassion into our inner beings. O beloved, let us let the Holy Spirit have His way in our lives to unfold to us the grandeur of Christ&rsquo;s glory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord will bring us into a life of humility where we have no confidence in ourselves, but our whole trust rests upon the authority of the mighty God who has promised to be with us at all times. He has made us able ministers of the New Testament, ministers of the Spirit that giveth life. Rivers of living water will flow from us as our confidence rests in Him. As we constantly partake of the living Christ within, He will give us a message direct from heaven, hot, burning, living. Just as the old prophets said, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord,&rdquo; speaking as the Spirit gave them utterance, so we shall go forth in the power of the Holy Spirit, our whole minds illuminated by the blessed Holy Spirit. He will elevate our minds until we have heavenly minds. We will be able to bring the vision of heavenly things to the people until they will want more of God and more of the Spirit, till they long to be filled with Spirit that they may be fruitful on every line. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I have found that the Baptism in the Holy Ghost infuses into us an intensity of zeal. You will remember it is written of Him, &ldquo;The zeal of Thine house hath eaten Me up,&rdquo; and we too, like our Lord, will be eaten up of holy zeal. He will fill us with a passion for the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. The Spirit of God will bring us to the place called Calvary, to the place where we are dead unto sin; but alive unto God, and filled with the resurrection life and power of the living Christ. Oh, beloved, we must live in the Spirit. We must grow into the likeness of our Master. We must be continually changed from glory to glory as we behold His face, until we are changed into the same image by the Spirit of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Have you failed God? He has mercy for you. Out of the depth of your sins and failures you can cry to God for all unrighteousness to be cast out and for His righteousness to be revealed within. Christ was made sin for you and took your sin, that you might become the righteousness of God in Him, that you might receive His righteousness. But it means a constant going to the cross of Calvary for the bringing to death of the old natural order, that you may come into the supernatural plan of God which He has for you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants each one of us to be indeed an epistle of Christ, an epistle that recommends Christ to men. We can only be this as the Spirit of God writes into our hearts and minds the Word. He will make the Word of God life within. Now out of the abundance of a heart steeped in the Word of God there will come forth that which will bring blessing to all those with whom you come in contact. Let your heart cry go up to Him, &ldquo;O God, lead me step by step in this divine life, for Jesus&rsquo; sake. Amen.&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="cs39141F69">

			<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, May 27, 1944.</span></h4>
		<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have a remarkable word in Matthew 3:11, &ldquo;I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.&rdquo; This was the word of one who was filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother&rsquo;s womb, who was so filled with the power of the Spirit of God that they came from east and west and from north and south to the banks of the Jordan to hear him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You have seen water baptism, and you know what it means. This later baptism taught by this wilderness preacher means that we shall be so immersed, covered and flooded with the blessed Holy Ghost, that He fills our whole body. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now turn to John 7:37-39: &ldquo;In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus saw that the people who had come to the feast, expecting blessing, were going back dissatisfied. He had come to help the needy, to bring satisfaction to the unsatisfied. He does not want any of us to be thirsty, famished, naked, full of discord, full of disorder, full of evil, full of carnality, full of sensuality. And so He sends out in His own blessed way the old prophetic cry: &ldquo;Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Master can give you that which will satisfy. He has in Himself just what you need at this hour. He knows your greatest need. You need the blessed Holy Ghost, not merely to satisfy your thirst, but to satisfy the needs of thirsty ones everywhere; for as the blessed Holy Spirit flows through you like rivers of living water, these floods will break what needs to be broken, they will bring to death that which should be brought to death, but they will bring life and fruitage where there is none. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What do you have? A well of water? That is good as far at it goes. But Christ wants to see a plentiful supply of the river of the Holy Ghost flowing through you. Here, on this last day of the feast, we find Him preparing them for the Pentecostal fullness that was to come, the fullness that He should shed forth from the glory after His ascension. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Note the condition necessary&mdash;&ldquo;He that </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believeth on Me</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; This is the root of the matter. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Believe on Him.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Believing on Him will bring forth this river of blessedness. Abraham believed God, and we are all blessed through faithful Abraham. As we believe God, many will be blessed through our faith. Abraham was an extraordinary man of faith. He believed God in the face of everything. God wants to bring us to the place of believing, where, despite all contradictions around, we are strong in faith, giving God glory. As we </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">fully believe God</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, He will be glorified, and we will prove a blessing to the whole world as was our father Abraham. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Turn to John 14. Here we see the promise that ignorant and unlearned fishermen were to be clothed with the Spirit, anointed with power from on high, and endued with the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge. As He imparts divine wisdom, you will not act foolishly. The Spirit of God will give you a sound mind, and He will impart to you the divine nature. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How could these weak and helpless fishermen, poor and needy, ignorant and unlearned, do the works of Christ and greater works than He had done? They were incapable. None of us is able. But our emptiness has to be clothed with divine fullness, and our helplessness has to be filled with the power of His helpfulness. Paul knew this when he gloried in all that brought him down in weakness, for flowing into his weakness came a mighty deluge of divine power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ knew that His going away would leave His disciples like a family of orphans. But He told them it was expedient, it was best, for after His return to the Father He would send the Comforter, and He Himself would come to indwell them. &ldquo;Ye in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ said, &ldquo;And I will pray the Father, and He shall send you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth.&rdquo; What a fitting name for the One who was coming to them at the time they were bereft&mdash;</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Comforter</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. After Christ had left them there was a great need, but that need was met on the day of Pentecost when the Comforter came. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You will always find that in the moment of need the Holy Spirit is a comforter. When my dear wife was lying dead, the doctors could do nothing. They said to me, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone; we cannot help you.&rdquo; My heart was so moved that I said, &ldquo;O God, I cannot spare her!&rdquo; I went up to her and said, &ldquo;Oh, come back, come back, and speak to me! Come back, come back!&rdquo; The Spirit of the Lord moved, and she came back and smiled again. But then the Holy Ghost said to me, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s mine. Her work is done. She is mine.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, that comforting word! No one else could have spoken it. The Comforter came. From that moment my dear wife passed out. And in this day the Comforter has a word for every bereaved one. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ further said, &ldquo;But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.&rdquo; How true this is. From time to time He takes of the words of Christ and makes them life to us. And, empowered with this blessed Comforter, the words that we spake under the anointing are spirit and life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are some who come to our meetings who, when you ask them whether they are seekers, reply, &ldquo;Oh, I am ready for anything.&rdquo; I tell them, &ldquo;You will never get anything.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s necessary to have the purpose that the Psalmist had when he said, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When the Lord reveals to you that you must be filled with the Holy Ghost, seek that one thing until God gives you that gift. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I spoke to two young men in a meeting one day. They were preachers. They had received their degrees. I said to them, &ldquo;Young men, what about it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we do not believe in receiving the Holy Ghost in the same way as you people do.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to them, &ldquo;You are dressed up like preachers, and it is a pity having to have the dress without the Presence.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Well, we do not believe it the way you do,&rdquo; they said. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;But look,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the apostles believed it that way. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be like the apostles? You have read how they received at the beginning, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Always remember this, that the Baptism will always be as at the beginning. It has not changed. If you want a real Baptism, expect it just the same way as they had it at the beginning. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These preachers asked, &ldquo;What had they at the beginning?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I quoted from the tenth chapter of Acts where it says, &ldquo;On the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.&rdquo; The Jews knew that these Gentiles had the same kind of experience as they themselves had at the beginning on the day of Pentecost. The experience has not changed, it is stiIl the same as at the beginning. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When these two young men realized that Peter and John and the rest of the disciples had received the mighty enduement at the beginning, and that it was for them, they walked up to the front where folk were tarrying. They were finely dressed, but in about half an hour they looked different. They had been prostrated. I had not caused them to do it. But they had been so lost and so controlled by the power of God, and were so filled with the glory of God, that they just rolled over, and their fine clothes were soiled&mdash;but their faces wete radiant. What caused the change? They had received what the hundred and twenty received at the beginning. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These young preachers had been ordained by men. Now they received an ordination that was better. The Lord had ordained them that they should go and bring forth much fruit. The person that receives this ordination goes forth with fresh feet&mdash;his feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; he goes forth with a fresh voice&mdash;it speaks as the Spirit gives utterance; he goes forth with a fresh mind&mdash;a mind illuminated by the power of God; he goes forth with a fresh vision, and sees all things new. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in Switzerland, a woman came to me and said, &ldquo;Now that I am healed and have been delivered from that terrible carnal oppression that bound and fettered me, I feel that I have a new mind. I should like to receive the Holy Ghost; but when I hear these people at the altar making so much noise, I feel like running away.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Shortly after this we were in another place in Switzerland where there was a great hotel joined to the building where we were ministering. At the close of one of the morning services, the power of God fell. That is the only way I can describe it&mdash;the power of God </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">fell</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. This poor, timid creature, who could not bear to hear any noise, screamed so loud that all the waiters in this big hotel came out, with their aprons on and their trays, to see what was up. Nothing especially was &ldquo;up,&rdquo; something had come down, and it so altered the situation that this woman could stand anythIng after that. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When you receive the Baptism, remember the words in 1 John 2:20, &ldquo;Ye have an unction from the Holy One.&rdquo; God grant that we may not forget that. Many people, instead of standing on the rock of faith to believe that they have received this unction, say, &ldquo;Oh, if I could only feel the unction!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Brother, your feeling robs you of your greatest unction. Your feelings are often on the line of discouragement. You have to get away from the walk by sense, for God has said, &ldquo;The just shall live by his faith.&rdquo; Believe what God says, &ldquo;Ye have an unction from the Holy One,&rdquo; an unction from above. All thoughts of holiness, all thoughts of purity, all thoughts of power are from above. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Frequently I see a condition of emergency. Here is a woman, dying; here is a man who has lost all the powers of his faculties; here is a person apparently in death. God does not want me to be filled with anxiety. What does He want me to do? To </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> only. After you have received, only believe. Dare to believe the One who has declared, &ldquo;I will do it.&rdquo; Christ says, &ldquo;Verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">he shall have whatsoever he saith</span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&rdquo; God declares, &ldquo;Ye have an unction.&rdquo; Believe God, and you will see this happen. What you say will come to pass. Speak the word, and the bound shall be free, the sick shall be healed. &ldquo;He shall have whatsoever he saith.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye have an unction.&rdquo; The unction has come, the unction abides, the unction is with us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But what about it, if you have not lived in the place where the unction can be increased? What is the matter? There is something between you and the Holy One&mdash;some uncleanness, some impurity, some desire that is not of Him; something that has come in the way? Then the Spirit is grieved. Has the unction left? No. When He comes in, He comes to abide. Make confession of your sin, of your failure, and once more the precious blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse, and the grieved Spirit will once more manifest Himself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">John further says, &ldquo;The anointing which ye have received of Him abideth in you.&rdquo; We have an anointing, the same anointing which Jesus Christ Himself received. For &ldquo;God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power; who went about doing good.&rdquo; The same anointing is for us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It means much to have a continuous faith for tho manifestation of the anointing. At the death of Lazarus, when it seemed that Mary and Martha and all around them had lost faith, Jesus turned to the Father and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. And I knew that Thou hearest Me always.&rdquo; Before that supreme faith that counted on God, that counted on His anointing, death had to give up Lazarus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Through a constant felIowship with the Father, through bold faith in the Son, through a mighty unction of the blessed Holy Spirit, there will come a right of way for God to be enthroned in our hearts, purifying us so thoroughly that there is no room for anything but the divine Presence within. And through the manifestation of this Presence, the works of Christ and greater works shall be accomplished for the glory of our Triune God. </span></p><h3 class="csE609553F">

		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">Good results in Switzerland.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Miss Nell Ruff writes of a meeting held recently by Brother Smith Wigglesworth in Zurich. &ldquo;Mr. Wigglesworth was full of the Spirit in declaring the full gospel. After the meetings, people would crowd into a vestry to be prayed for. It was heart breaking to see them throng around us, some halting, others bearing on their pale, weary faces the cruel marks of sin and suffering&mdash;all eager to hear how they could approach God and claim deliverance. Oh, the expressions of their eyes! how they changed! Scores of those sick ones went away praising God that He had healed them and saved their souls from destruction. Hallelujah! Zurich has been stirred up during this two weeks. My father is keeping the hall for Sunday afternoons for gospel meetings.&rdquo; In a later letter she writes, &ldquo;Our meeting has greatly increased. Thank God the tide is rising. We have not had a meeting since Mr. Wigglesworth&rsquo;s visit in which there has been no healing nor decision for the Lord. We have also reports from people who have used handkerchiefs that have been prayed over. Prayer is being answered.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Since writing the above, a long distance call has come from Eureka Springs from Brother E.J. Burton, who tells us that he has received a letter from Brother Wigglesworth, sent from Jerusalem, agreeing to accept the invitation of the brethren to be a speaker at the Interstate Camp Meeting to be held in Eureka Springs, Ark., from August 29 to September 12. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The campaign began March 5th in a hall capable of holding a thousand people. From the first night it was a great success, hundreds being saved. Not a night passed without many standing up and reaching out their hands to heaven, calling out, &ldquo;Jesus save me! Jesus deliver me!&rdquo; Each night the evangelist would single out people in the audience who were in pain, and would pray for them. Immediately after prayer was offered the suffering ones would testify that they were free from pain. If it was a case of stiff limbs, they were made to exercise them by walking up and down, running, stamping their feet, or waving their arms about in order to test whether the pain had actually gone. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">One night a woman came up the aisle, walking in pain, her body all doubled up, and she finally fell on the floor in front of the platform, the pain was so great. Brother Wigglesworth jumped off the platform and put his hands upon her, and said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus I bind this pain and loose this woman.&rdquo; Immediately she ran up and down the aisle, free from pain, and then went and sat down to listen to the message. She was perfectly whole. This demonstration had a great effect upon the crowd. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some nights the evangelist prayed for over five hundred people, many of them coming hundreds of miles bringing their sick with them&mdash;the blind, deaf, dumb, lame, palsied, consumptive, eaten up with cancer, tumors, epilepsy, weak-minded, deranged, crippled. God worked mighty miracles: blind eyes were opened, deaf ears unstopped. stammering tongues spoke, men on crutches put them over their shoulder and went away, stiff joints were made supple, headaches and fevers vanished, asthma was treated as an evil power and cast out in the name of Jesus. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Handkerchiefs were brought in an ever increasing number and piled high upon the platform. So many were brought (quite 500 some nights) that a fairly large suitcase was neccesary to hold them all. One night, while our attention was diverted, a boy stole six new handkerchiefs that had been brought. Two nights later he came back with them, confessing that he had not been able to sleep since he had taken them. Many wonderful cures were wrought through this means. One was taken to a sanatorium and placed on a consumptive boy. The boy is wonderfully better, is putting on flesh and looking healthy. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many people were helped by rising from their seats in faith and saying, &ldquo;Jesus heal me,&rdquo; without the prayers of the evangelist at all. One woman, who had eruptions on her arms and burning sensations caused by these eruptions, was healed as she sat in her seat. Truly these were wonderful days. God&rsquo;s Spirit was poured out and Jesus was glorified. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Brother Wigglesworth has been with us in Colombo, ministering for two weeks. He came very late in the season and found the heat very trying, and in consequence did not visit India. In Madras we had one meeting as we passed through Bombay to Colombo. I went to Bombay to meet him. The meetings were wonderfully attended here. There were over a thousand listening to the Word nearly every night. It was a joy to see hundreds of people standing up with hands outstretched to heaven, asking Jesus to save them. Hundreds were healed of all kinds of diseases. Owing to the heat and the strenuous night meetings (some nights praying for 500 people), he was unable to have meetings for believers as we should have liked. However, the visit was a great success and has brought blessing to nlany homes. He has left us now for Palestine, where he expects to stay about a month, reaching England in time for the Whitsuntide Convention in London. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The follow-on meetings have been wonderfully blessed. One woman in the Sunday morning meeting, after Brother Wigglesworth had left, was healed of three diseases. She came on the following Wednesday bringing fifteen friends with her, eleven of whom were saved that night as we gave the altar call. I had the joy of immersing eight in water while Brother Wigglesworth was here, the youngest being a Singhalese girl seven years old. She had a wonderful testimony, and on the morning of her baptism, she had a vision of Jesus. It was a joy to my soul to take her in my arms and bury her with Christ in the water. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord has given us another little son, born on Feb. 9. This makes us four children now. All is well, for which we praise the Lord. Brother May from Travancore is here helping me for a little while and I am very grateful for his help. We have had strenuous times since Christmas with two conventions and nine meetings a week in between. Oh, for some men to come and stand in the gap. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

Writing of his first visit eighteen months ago, Mr. E.E. Pennington, Chairman of the New Zealand Evangelical Mission of Wellington writes, &ldquo;In June 1922, Brother Smith Wigglesworth came to Wellington little known to any of us. There was no flourishing of trumpets to herald his advent&mdash;a few small advertisements in the local press announced his meetings. About one thousand attended his first meeting on a Sunday evening, and the night following this number was increased by about five hundred to six hundred. From then on it was impossible to secure buildings large enough to accommodate the crowds, and the large Town Hall, seating three thousand, was packed every evening. On some occasions the crowd waited for hours about the doors before the commencement of the meetings rather than be denied the opportunity of hearing the man and his message. Never had the writer witnessed such scenes as followed the presentation of the Word of God by this Spirit-filled man, although being associated with such mighty evangelists as Drs. Torrey, Henry, Chapman and others in part of their New Zealand campaigns. On every occasion when an appeal was made for the unconverted to decide for Christ, the response was immediate and great, sometimes as many as four hundred to five hundred responding in a meeting&mdash;over two thousand made the great decision during the mission in Wellington&mdash;in some cases whole families entered the kingdom of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">Many healed.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We have received a few testimonies of those healed in this meeting. Mrs. E. Curtis of Christchurch, New Zealand, was suffering with septic poisoning. She had become only a skeleton and the doctors could do nothing for her. She had agonizing pains all day and all night. She was healed immediately [after] prayer was made for her. She states that for the past sixteen years she has been a martyr to pain but is now wonderfully well. Another testified to healing of deafness, goiter, adenoids and bad eyesight. Another testified to healing of double curvature of the spine from infancy, hip disease, weak heart, leg lengthened three inches, which grew normal like the other leg. It was also three inches less in circumference. She wore a large boot but now walks on even feet, the large boot having been discarded. Another was healed from goiter through handkerchief. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">Blessing in Melbourne, Australia.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Mr. W. Buchanan, a leading Christian worker of Melbourne, writes of the Wigglesworth campaign in that city. &ldquo;We had three glorious weeks of triumphant victory in the Melbourne meetings. Fully one thousand souls were converted to the Lord Jesus Christ, and many scores were healed: in fact, the testimonies of those healed are still continuing to come in.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

			<span class="cs12506F1C">Subtitled, &ldquo;The ministry of Bro. Wigglesworth and his future movements.&rdquo;<br/>Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, September 16, 1922.</span></h4>
		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A number of letters have come to this office asking if Bro. Smith Wlgglesworth can hold meetings at different assemblies. He is waiting on the Lord about these calls and is praying about his future movements. He writes us that he expects to hold meetings in San Jose and Oakland, Cal., during the latter part of September and the early part of October, and he hopes that he will be able to start a campaign in Springfield, Mo., on October 15th. We hope to insert fuller announcement concerning this last meeting in the next Evangel. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A correspondent. Mrs. F.E. Braithwaite, sends us a large number of testimonies of healing from Australia, where Bro. Wigglesworth has lately been ministering. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Kathleen Gay, 107 Browe St., North Fitzroy, testifies, &ldquo;I feel I must express my deep gratitude for blessing received. Only those who have been in the furnace of affliction can realize the joy of deliverance. It seems even now too wonderful after 14 years of anguish, sleeplessness, and spiritual depression caused by the bondage of the adversary that these are things of the past. As you say, consumption is of the devil and only the Lion of Judah could have delivered me from this scourge which has made my body a mass of corruption. Now I am free. Hallelujah!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Mrs. J. Simcock, of Horshom, Victoria, writes, &ldquo;I was prayed for in Melbourne and the evil spirit commanded to come out. I had a polypous growth in my nose. It had been there 18 years. When I came home from Melbourne the growth all broke up and came away, for which I praise God. I had also a pain under my left breast which had troubled me 12 years. I think it was leakage of the heart, as sorrow had caused it in the first place. At times I used to vomit blood. I have deliverance from that also. All praise to our wonder-working Jesus.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Catherine Rutherford, of 32 Emerald St., Collingwood, writes, &ldquo;I have had liver complaint all my life. When quite a young girl I was treated by the best doctors, but it always returned. At times I was unable to turn over in bed without help. The last 12 months my kidneys were bad and my legs swollen with much cramp. I had varicose veins with lumps larger than an egg. Now, glory to God, all has gone&mdash;disappeared as soon as hands were laid on me in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">L.M. Buchanan writes of the meetings held in Sydney: </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;A woman who was to have undergone an operation yesterday went to the doctor, who said that there was neither misplacement nor inflammation. When she told him the reason he said that she would soon be worse. Another who was to have undergone several operations because the work could not be done in one, testifies that she was free, and that the Lord had lengthened her leg two inches and that instead of limping she is now walking perfectly. Another mother brought her little boy who had fits all day long. He was prayed for at the meeting and after the evangelist had gone he had a fit worse than before. The unbelievers&rsquo; sarcasm was to be heard all over the building. Two days later the mother returned to say that the child had not had another fit. A little girl aged five years old, who had been stone deaf three years, received her healing at once. The healings have been too numerous to mention and the preaching of the Word was wonderful.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">At the meeting at Geelong, one testified, &ldquo;I had a withered hand for 14 years. When Mr. Wigglesworth was here a month ago it was cured.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">At Parkes a quarter of the population tried to get into the theater. The preaching was wonderful and also the healings. A little girl, deaf for six years, ear drums burst and bleeding, was instantly healed. Her brother, blind in one eye, received his sight immediately [after] he was prayed for. The daily papers say that no meetings on a religious line equal to these had ever been experienced in Parkes. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A teacher at Bunibank Methodist Sunday School testifies to healing of rheumatoid arthritis. &ldquo;A doctor examined me in the beginning of December, 1911. and told me I would need new joints to walk. He said he would defy anyone to cure me, and although I improved in health I dld not walk better. On April 4th I went to be prayed with, and believed God would heal me. As hands were placed on my head in the name of Jesus, I felt the power of God go right through me. After the meeting I walked down three flights of stairs without a stick for the first time for sixteen years, and I have no use for a stick since. I have always tried to impress upon the juniors the power of prayer, but I had not realized I would have to demonstrate it in my own life. After testifying in the Sunday School, I asked all who were Christians or who would became so to stand. Every teacher and every scholar stood, and so we sang the Doxology. Men of the world have told me &lsquo;It has set them thinking.&rsquo; There is no evidence now that I had ever rheumatoid arthritis. Praise God!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bro. Wigglesworth writes of his meeting in Wellington, New Zealand. &ldquo;The New Zealand visit as been the best I have had on the lines of moving a city toward holiness and godly fear. Thirty of the principal men pleaded with me that I would stay longer. There has been a harvest of souls and over 2,000 were prayed for for healing. About 2,000 came down to the quay, singing and testifying and I spoke to them. A dally paper quotes the following healings, saying that any one can secure the names and addresses at the Dominion offices.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A dairyman had for 3 years suffered with chronic gastritis and paralysis of both legs from the hips downward and could only drag along with crutches. He testifies, &ldquo;On June 4th I attended the Town Hall. I was anointed, hands were laid upon me, and Mr. Wigglesworth told me to walk. I handed him my crutches and walked home. For 14 years I have had a cyst on the back of my neck. It increased in size to the size of an egg. The next morning I found it had completely disappeared.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A lady testifies, &ldquo;Over 3 years ago varicose veins in my legs broke. I was twice in hospital, but when I used the legs the veins burst open. The last time they were cut and an ulcer formed. I had to walk with a stick and could only limp. I went to the Town Hall. I had faith that Jesus would heal me. The pain ceased and I was able to leave my stick and walk to the car. My leg is sound and the ulcer is daily healing. I am now able to wash and do my housework.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Another Wellington lady says that her son (age 11) 6 years ago broke his arm. It was badly set and he could not bend it properly. It was massaged for 12 months without any benefit. It is healed. Also her daughter, who suffered from adenoids, was healed. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A lady from Ngaio, aged 20, has suffered from double curvature of the spine from infancy. She could not walk until 4 years of age and could only rise from the floor by pulling herself up with both hands. One leg was 3 inches shorter and less in circumference. She went to many hospitals and was sent home incurable. She states, &ldquo;As soon as hands were laid upon me I was healed, my spine was straightened; in a few days my leg lengthened, and my hip, which was diseased, was healed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The following testimonies appeared in the &ldquo;Good News&rdquo; of Melbourne: </span></p><p class="cs60975F0A"><span class="cs78AB3212">For many years I suffered from bronchitis and asthma. I had pains in my chest and was very short of breath. I went to the meetings at the Olympia and Mr. Wigglesworth laid hands on me, and rebuked the evil spirit. I felt the power of God go right through me. I was immediately healed, and have not had a pain since. I was on Feb. 4th, 1922, dressing my little girls when Thelma, aged 4, fell. I picked her up and found her bleeding at the mouth. The scissors were in her hand, and she ran the point through her lips. Her mouth began to swell, and I said. &ldquo;Dear Jesus, don&rsquo;t let her go any further.&rdquo; I hurried to the Good News Hall and the secretary carried her to Mr. Wigglesworth, who was at breakfast. In a few minutes the lady brought her hack, with her mouth closed, and perfectly healed. The child told me that the gentleman had laid his hands on her lips and prayed, and that Jesus had made her better &mdash;J.M. Henderson. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was born with a weak, crooked ankle. I was anointed at the Olympia and it was immediately straightened and made strong. I had to wear a specially formed boot and straps, these are no use to me now, I have bought ordinary boots. Medical men had attended me and could do nothing. &mdash;Lily Ward. </span></p><h3 class="csE609553F">

			<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April 26, 1941.</span></h4>
		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read 1 John 3:1-10. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">God does not dwell in temples made by hands but in poor and contrite hearts. God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. The Church is the body of Christ, its worship is a heart worship, a longing to come into the Presence of God. He wants us to come to a place of undisturbed rest and peace; only simplicity will bring us there. Jesus said, when He uplifted the baby, &ldquo;Except you become as little children, you shall in no wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; It is not to have the child&rsquo;s mind, but the child&rsquo;s spirit&mdash;meekness, gentleness; it is the only place to meet God. He will give us that place of worship. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">How my heart cries out for a deep vision of God. The world cannot produce it. A place where we see the Lord&mdash;that when we pray, we know God hears. Asking God and believing for the answer, having no fear but a living faith to come into the Presence of God. &ldquo;In His Presence is fullness of joy, and at His right hand are pleasures for evermore.&rdquo; God is looking for a people in whom He can reveal Himself. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">I used to have a tremendous temper, going white with passion. My whole nature was outside God that way. God knew His child could never be of service to the world unless he was wholly sanctified. I was difficult to please at the table. My wife was a good cook, but there was always something wrong. After God sanctified me, however, I heard her testify in a meeting that from that time I was pleased with everything. I had men working for me. I wanted to be a good testimony to them. One day they waited after work was over and said, &ldquo;We would like that spirit you have.&rdquo; It is our human spirit that has to be controlled by the Holy Spirit. There is a place where Christ reigns in the body, then all is well. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">This word is full of stimulation&mdash;brought by faith into a place of grace where all may see us made anew. If you believe, you can be sons of God&mdash;in likeness, character, spirit, longings, acts, until all will know you are a son of God. The Spirit of God can change our nature. God is Creator. His Word is creative, and as you believe, a creative power is changing your whole nature. You can reach this altitude only by faith. No man can keep himself. The God of almightiness spreads His covering over you, saying, &ldquo;I am able to do all things; and all things are possible to him that believeth.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The old nature is so difficult to manage. You have been ashamed of it many a time, but the Lord Himself will come. He says, &ldquo;Come unto Me, and I will give thee rest, peace, strength. I will change you, I will operate upon you by My power making you a new creation, if you will believe.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there. &ldquo;Learn of Me for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&rdquo; The world has no rest, it is full of trouble; but in Him is peace which passeth understanding, with an inward flow of divine power changing your nature until you can live, move and act in the power of God. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;Therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew Him not.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What does it mean? I have lived in one house over fifty years. I have preached from my own doorstep, and all around know me. They know. me when they need someone to pray, when there is trouble, when they need help. But at Christmas time, when they call their friends, would they call me? No! Why? They would say, &ldquo;He is sure to want a prayer meeting, but we want to finish up with a dance.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Wherever Jesus came sin was revealed and men don&rsquo;t like sin revealed. Sin, separates from God for ever. You are in a good place when you weep before God, repenting over the least thing. If you have spoken unkindly, you realize it was not like the Lord. Your keen conscience has taken you to prayer. It is a wonderful thing to have a keen conscience. It is when we are close to God that our hearts are revealed. God intends us to live in purity&mdash;seeing Him all the time. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when He shall appear we shall be like Him for we shall see Him as He is; and everyone that hath this hope purifieth himself even as He is pure.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is the hope of the Church, the Bridegroom coming for the bride. He has suffered for us, been buried for us, risen for us, is jealous for us. How we should love Him! He is coming again and He wants us to be ready. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I am leaving anywhere by train or ship, people come to see me off, and I preach to them. The Captain hears, the stewards hear. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;another on board!&rdquo; The world thinks there is something wrong with you if you are full of zeal for God. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A young man came and asked me to take part in a sweepstake. I said, &ldquo;I am preaching on Sunday&mdash;would you come if I did?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Later, there was an entertainment. I said I would take a part. It was the strangest thing for me. I said I would sing. I saw men dressed as clergy entertaining the people with foolishness. I was troubled. I cried to God. Then came my turn just before the dance. A young woman came to take my book&mdash;she was half dressed. She said, &ldquo;I cannot play that.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Never worry.&rdquo; I sang, &ldquo;Oh, if I could only tell you how I love Him, I am sure that you would make Him yours today.&rdquo; There was no dance! They began weeping, and six young men gave their hearts to God in my cabin. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The world does not know us, but </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">we are sons of God with power.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> No man that sins has power. Sin makes a man weak. Remember this&mdash;sin dethrones, but purity strengthens. Temptation is not sin; but the devil is a liar and tries to take away our peace. You must live in the Word of God. There is now no condemnation. Who is he that can condemn you? Christ has died. He won&rsquo;t condemn you. He died to save you. Don&rsquo;t condemn yourself. If there is anything wrong, come to the Blood. &ldquo;If we walk in the light as He is in the Light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus, God&rsquo;s Son, cleanseth us from all sin.&rdquo;&nbsp;Jesus was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. You can come into a new experience of God where God creates in our hearts such a love for Jesus that we are living in a new realm&mdash;Sons of God with power, filled with all the fullness of God. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Before leaving home I received a wire&mdash;would I go to Liverpool. There was a woman with cancer and gall stones. If I know God is sending me, my faith rises. The woman said, &ldquo;I have no hope.&rdquo; God said to me, &ldquo;Establish her in the fact of the New Birth.&rdquo; When she had the assurance that her sin was gone and she was born again, she said, &ldquo;That is everything to me. Cancer is nothing now I have Jesus.&rdquo; The battle was won. God delivered her and she was free and soon up and dressed, and happy in Jesus. Life and immortality are ours in the Gospel. This is our inheritance through the blood of Jesus&mdash;life for evermore. Believe and the Lord will transmit life through you, that you may be waiting for His coming and witnessing unto Him. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

			<span class="cs12506F1C">By Anna Lewini, of Stoke Newington, London. Subtitled, &ldquo;Divine healing in Scandinavia, etc.&rdquo; Published in </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Confidence</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April-June 1922.</span></h4>
		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;That, which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you.&rdquo; 1 John 1:3. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Writer (whose personal testimony was in the last issue of &ldquo;Confidence&rdquo;) had the privilege for three months last year to be in the center of Mr. Smith Wigglesworth&rsquo;s meetings in both Sweden and Denmark. It was a time of visitation from on high: I dare to say that hundreds of people received Jesus as their Savior, thousands were healed from all kinds of diseases, also thousands of believers awoke to a new life, and many, many received the Baptism of the Holy Ghost as on the day of Pentecost. For all this we give glory to Jesus. Here are a few examples of miracles my eyes have seen. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will begin with the first meeting I attended. It was in </span><span class="cs12506F1C">Orebro</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> (Sweden) where at that time there was held a Pentecostal Convention. I came to seek help myself, being worn out with long unbroken service in the Lord&rsquo;s work. I had not heard of Mr. Wigglesworth before, but I knew that Pastor Barratt, my spiritual father, was there. The next day there was a meeting for healing. After the preaching service I went forward into the other hall and I was surprised to find in a few minutes a crowd following. The hall was full with a queue of hundreds of men and women patiently waiting for a touch of God through His servant, and, glory to God, we we were not disappointed. As hands were laid upon me, the power of God went through me in a mighty way. I was immediately well. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was wonderful to notice, as the ministry continued, the effect upon the people as the power of the Lord came over them. Some lifted their hands, crying, &ldquo;I am healed! I am healed!&rdquo; Some fell on the the platform overpowered by the power of the Spirit, having to be helped down. Others walked away as in a dream; others as drunk with new wine, lost to everything but God; but all had faces as transfigured with the glory of the Lord and magnifying Jesus. A young biind girl, as she was ministered to, cried out, &ldquo;Oh, how many windows there are in this hall!&rdquo; &lsquo;During the three weeks the meetings continued the great chapel was crowded daily, multitudes being healed and many saved. The testimony meetings were wonderful. One said, &ldquo;I was deaf, they prayed, and Jesus heaied me.&rdquo; Another, &ldquo;I had consumption, and I am free,&rdquo; and so on. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">At Skofde.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> In the smaiier hall, set apart for those seeking the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, I shall never forget the sight, how the people with eyes closed and hearts uplifted to God waited. Did the Holy Spirit fall upon them? Of course He did. Here also many were healed. At another place there was a young man whose body was spoiled because of sin, but the Lord is merciful with sinners. He was anointed, and when hands were laid on, the power of God went mightily over him. He said, &ldquo;I am healed,&rdquo; but being broken down, he cried as a little child confessing his sin; at the same moment the Lord saved him. Glory to God! He went into the large hall and testified to salvation and healing. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">Stockholm.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Here long queues waited for hours to get in. The hall held 1,800 people. At nearly every meeting crowds were unable to enter the building, but they waited on often hours and hours for the chance, if any left the building, to step into the place. Here a man with two crutches, his whole body shaking with palsy, is lifted on to the platform. (Behind him five or six hundred more are waiting for help.) This man is anointed and hands laid upon him in the Name of Jesus. He is still shaking. Then he drops one crutch, and after a short time the other one. His body is still shaking, but he takes the first step out </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">in faith!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Will it be? He lifts oue foot and then the other, walks round the platform. The onlookers rejoice with him. Now he walks around the auditorium. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">During this meeting a woman began to shout and shout. The preacher told her to be quiet, but instead she jumped up on a chair, flourishing her arms about, and crying, &ldquo;I am healed! I am healed! I had cancer in my mouth, and I was unsaved; but during the meeting, as I listened to the word of God, the Lord has saved me and healed me of cancer in my mouth.&rdquo; She shouts again, &ldquo;I am saved! I am saved! I am healed of cancer!&rdquo; She was quite beside herself. The people laughed and cried together. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here was another woman unable to walk, sitting on a chair as she was ministered to. Her experience was the same as hundreds of the others. She rose up, looking around, wondering if after all it was a dream. Suddenly she laughed and said, &ldquo;My leg is healed.&rdquo; Afterwards she said, &ldquo;I am not saved,&rdquo; and streams of tears ran down her face. They prayed for her, and later she left the meeting healed and saved and full of joy. We have a wonderful Savior; glory to His Holy Name! </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">Miracles in Norway.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Out of many, many, I quote two taken from Pastor Barratt&rsquo;s paper, &ldquo;Korsets Seir&rdquo; (the Victory of the Cross). A man and his son came in a taxi to a meeting. Both had crutches. The father had been in bed two years and was unable to put his leg to the ground. He was ministered to. He dropped both crutches, walking and praising God. When the son saw this he cried out, &ldquo;Help me too,&rdquo; and after a little while father and son, without crutches and without taxi, walked away from the hall together. That word again is manifested; the same Jesus, the wonder-working Jesus is just the same today. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs12506F1C">Now Copenhagen,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> my homeland! During three weeks thousands daily attended the meetings. Each morning, two or three hundred were ministered to for healing. Each evening the platform was surrounded. Again and again, as each throng retired another company came forward seeking salvation. Here many were baptized in the Holy Ghost. The testimony meetings were wonderful. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now I will close with a vision a brother had who attended these meetings. He was lost in intercession for the hundreds of sick waiting to be ministered to for healing. He saw an opening from the platform, where the sick were, right into the glory. He saw wonderful beings in the form of men resting who, with interest, looked on. Again he looked at the platform and saw a heavenly Being clothed in white, who all the time was more active than any other in helping the sick, and when </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">He</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> touched them the effect was wonderful. Bent forms were made straight, their eyes shone, they began to glorify and praise the Lord. A Voice said: &ldquo;Healings are the smallest of all gifts; it is but a drop in the bucket in view of what God has in store for His children. Ye shall do greater works than these.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">I pray that the Lord may be magnified by this attestation to signs, wonders, and mighty deeds, and that there may be a multiplication in every land that shall redound to the glory of God. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

			<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, June 15, 1935.</span></h4>
		<p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Romans 4:16 we read, &ldquo;It is of faith, that it might be by grace,&rdquo; meaning that we can open the door and God will come in. What will happen if we really open the door by faith? God is greater than our thoughts. He puts it to us, &ldquo;Exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.&rdquo; When we ask a lot, God says &ldquo;more.&rdquo; Are we ready for the &ldquo;more&rdquo;? And then the &ldquo;much more&rdquo;? We may be, or we may miss it. We may be so endued by the Spirit of the Lord in the morning that it shall be a tonic for the whole day. God can so thrill us with new life that nothing ordinary or small will satisfy us after that. There is a great place for us in God where we won&rsquo;t be satisfied with small things. We won&rsquo;t have any satisfaction unless the fire falls, and whenever we pray we will have the assurance that what we have prayed for is going to follow the moment we open our mouth. Oh this praying in the Spirit! This great plan of God for us! In a moment we can go right in. In where? Into His will. Then all things will be well. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">You can&rsquo;t get anything asleep these days. The world is always awake, and we should always be awake to what God has for us. Awake to take! Awake to hold it after we get it! How much can you take? We know that God is more willing to give than we are to receive. How shall we dare to be asleep when the Spirit commands us to take everything on the table. It is the greatest banquet that ever was and ever will be&mdash;the table where all you take only leaves more behind. A fullness that cannot be exhausted! How many are prepared for a lot? </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry: and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. And Jesus answered and said, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.&rdquo; Mark 11:11-14. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus was sent from God to meet the world&rsquo;s need. Jesus lived to minister life by the words He spoke. He said to Philip, &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father&hellip; the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me.&rdquo; I am persuaded that if we are filled with His words of life and the Holy Ghost, and Christ is made manifest in our mortal flesh, then the Holy Ghost can really move us with His life, His words, till as He was, so are we in the world. We are receiving our life from God, and it is always kept in tremendous activity, working in our whole nature as we live in perfect contact with God. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus spoke, and everything He said must come to pass. That is the great plan. When we are filled only with the Holy Spirit, and we won&rsquo;t allow the Word of God to be detracted by what we hear or by what we read, then comes the inspiration, then the life, then the activity, then the glory! Oh to live in it! To live in it is to be moved by it. To live in it is to be moved so that we will have God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s personality in the human body. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">By the grace of God I want to impart the Word, and bring you into a place where you will dare to act upon the plan of the Word, to so breathe life by the power of the Word that it is impossible for you to go on under any circumstances without His provision. The most difficult things that come to us are to our advantage from God&rsquo;s side. When we come to the place of impossibilities it is the grandest place for us to see the possibilities of God. Put this right in your mind and never forget it. You will never be of any importance to God till you venture in the impossible. God wants people on the daring line. I do not mean foolish daring. &ldquo;Be filled with the Spirit,&rdquo; and when we are filled with the Spirit we are not so much concerned about the secondary thing. It is the first with God. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Everything of evil, everything unclean, everything Satanic in any way is an objectionable thing to God, and we are to live above it, destroy it, not to allow it to have any place. Jesus didn&rsquo;t let the devil answer back. We must reach the place where we will not allow anything to interfere with the plan of God. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus and His disciples came to the tree. It looked beautiful. It had the appearance of fruit, but when He came to it He found nothing but leaves. He was very disappointed. Looking at the tree, He spoke to it: Here is shown forth His destructive power, &ldquo;No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.&rdquo; The next day they were passing by the same way and the disciples saw the tree &ldquo;dried up from the roots.&rdquo; They said to Jesus, &ldquo;Behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.&rdquo; And Jesus said, &ldquo;Have faith in God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">There isn&rsquo;t a person that has ever seen a tree dried from the root. Trees always show the first signs of death right at the top. But the Master had spoken. The Master dealt with a natural thing to reveal to these disciples a supernatural plan. If He spoke it would have to obey. And, God, the Holy Ghost, wants us to understand clearly that we are the mouthpiece of God and are here for His divine plan. We may allow the natural mind to dethrone that, but in the measure we do, we won&rsquo;t come into the treasure which God has for us. The Word of God must have first place. It must not have a second place. In any measure that we doubt the Word of God, from that moment we have ceased to thrive spiritually and actively. The Word of God is not only to be looked at and read, but received as the Word of God to become life right within our life. &ldquo;Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;I give unto you power&hellip; over all the power of the enemy.&rdquo; Luke 10:19. There it is. We can accept or reject it. I accept and believe it. It is a word beyond all human calculation: &ldquo;Have faith in God.&rdquo; These disciples were in the Master&rsquo;s schooL They were the men who were to turn the world upside down. As we receive the Word we will never be the same; if we dare to act as the Word goes forth and not be afraid, then God will honor us. &ldquo;The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.&rdquo; Jacob was the weakest of all, in any way you like to take it. He is the God of Jacob, and He is our God. So we may likewise have our names changed to Israel. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">As the Lord Jesus injected this wonderful word, &ldquo;Have faith in God,&rdquo; into the disciples, He began to show how it was to be. Looking around about Him He saw the mountains, and He began to bring a practical application. A truth means nothing unless it moves us. We can have our minds filled a thousand times, but it must get into our hearts if there are to be any results. All inspiration is in the heart. All compassion is in the heart. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Looking at the mountains He said, &ldquo;Shall not doubt in his heart.&rdquo; That is the barometer. You know exactly where you are. The man knows when he prays. If his heart is right how it leaps. No man is any good for God and never makes progress in God who does not hate sin. You are never safe. But there is a place in God where you can love righteousness and where you can hate iniquity till the Word of God is a light in your bosom, quickening every fiber of your body, thrilling your whole nature. The pure in heart see God. Believe in the heart! What a word! If I believe in my heart God says I can begin to speak, and &ldquo;whatsoever&rdquo; I say shall come to pass. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here is an act of believing in the heart. I was called to Halifax, England, to pray for a lady missionary. I found it an urgent call. I could see there was an absence of faith, and I could see there was death: Death is a terrible thing, and God wants to keep us alive. I know it is appointed unto man once to die, but I believe in a rapturous death. I said to the woman, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I have faith,&rdquo; in a very weak tone of voice. &ldquo;Faith? Why you are dying? Brother Walshaw, is she dying?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nurse, is she dying?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; To a friend standing by, &ldquo;Is she dying?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now I believe there is something in a heart that is against defeat, and this is the faith which God hath given to us. I said to her, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus, now believe and you&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; and God sent life from her head to her feet. They dressed her and she lived. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Have faith.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">saying</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> you have faith. It is he that </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believeth in his heart.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is a grasping of the eternal God. Faith is God in the human vessel. &ldquo;This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.&rdquo; 1 John 5:4. He that </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believeth</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> overcomes the world. &ldquo;Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.&rdquo; He that believeth in his heart! Can you imagine anything easier than that? He that believeth in his heart! What is the process? Death! No one can live who believes in his heart. He dies to everything worldly. He that loves the world is not of God. You can measure the whole thing up, and examine yourself to see if you have faith. Faith is a life. Faith enables you to lay hold of that which is and get it out of the way for God to bring in something that is not. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Just before I left home I was in Norway. A woman wrote to me from England saying she had been operated on for cancer three years before, but that it was now coming back. She was living in constant dread of the whole thing as the operation was so painful. Would it be possible to see me when I returned to England? I wrote that I would be passing through London on the 20th of June last year. If she would like to meet me at the hotel I would pray for her. She replied that she would be going to London to be there to meet me. When I met this woman I saw she was in great pain, and I have great sympathy for people who have tried to get relief and have failed. If you preachers lose your compassion you can stop preaching, fof it won&rsquo;t be any good. You will only be successful as a preacher as you let your heart become filled with the compassion of Jesus. As soon as I saw her I entered into the state of her mind. I saw how distressed she was. She came to me in a mournful spirit, and her whole face was downcast. I said to her, &ldquo;There are two things going to happen today. One is that you are to know that you are sayed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, if I could only know I was saved,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is another thing. You have to go out of this hotel without a pain, without a trace of the cancer.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then I began with the Word. Oh this wonderful Word! We do not have to go up to bring Him down; neither do we have to go down to bring Him up. &ldquo;The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.&rdquo; Romans 10:8. I said, &ldquo;Believe that He took your sins when He died at the cross. Believe that when He was buried, it was for you. Believe that when He arose, it was for you. And now at God&rsquo;s right hand He is sitting for you. If you can believe in your heart and confess with your mouth, you shall be saved.&rdquo; She looked at me saying, &ldquo;Oh, it is going all through my body. I know I am saved now. If He comes today, I&rsquo;ll go. How I have dreaded, the thought of His coming all my life! But if He comes today, I know I shall be ready.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The first thing was finished. Now for the second. I laid my hands upon her in the name of Jesus, believing in my heart that I could say what I wanted and it should be done. I said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus, I cast this out.&rdquo; She jumped up. &ldquo;Two things have happened,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am saved and now the cancer is gone.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs60975F0A"><span class="cs78AB3212">Faith will stand amid the wrecks of time, </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Faith unto eternal glories climb; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Only count the promise true, </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">And the Lord will stand by you&mdash; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">Faith will win the victory </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">every time!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">So many people have nervous trouble. I&rsquo;ll tell you how to get rid of your nervous trouble. I have something in my bag, one dose of which will cure you. &ldquo;I am the Lord that healeth thee.&rdquo; How this wonderful Word of God changes the situation. &ldquo;Perfect love casteth out fear.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no fear in love.&rdquo; I have tested that so often, casting out the whole condition of fear and the whole situation has been changed. We have a big God, only He has to be absolutely and only trusted. The people who really do believe God are strong, and &ldquo;he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">At the close of a certain meeting a man said to me, &ldquo;You have helped everybody but me. I wish you would help me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot sleep because of nervous trouble. My wife says she has not known me to have a full night&rsquo;s sleep for three years. I am just shattered.&rdquo; Anybody could tell he was. I put my hands upon him and said, &ldquo;Brother I believe in my heart. Go home and sleep in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go home and sleep in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; The lights were being put out, and I took the man by the coat collar and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me any more.&rdquo; That was sufficient. He went after that, When he got home his mother and wife said to him, &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing. He helped everybody but me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely he said something to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;He told me to come home and sleep in the name of Jesus, but you know I can&rsquo;t sleep in anything.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">His wife urged him to do what I had said, and he had scarcely got his head on the pillow before the Lord put him to sleep. The next morning he was still asleep. The </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">next</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> morning he was still asleep. She began to make a noise in the bedroom to awaken him, but he did not waken. Sunday morning he was still asleep. She did what every good wife would do. She decided to make a good Sunday dinner, and then awaken him. After the dinner was prepared she went up to him and put her hand on his shoulder and shook him, saying, &ldquo;Are you never going to wake up?&rdquo; From that night that man never had any more nervousness. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man came to me for whom I prayed. Then I asked, &ldquo;Are you sure you are perfectly healed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is just a little pain in my shoulder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know what that is?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;That is unbelief. Were you saved before you believed or after?&rdquo; &ldquo;After.&rdquo; &ldquo;You will be healed after.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is all right now,&rdquo; he said, It was all right before, but he hadn&rsquo;t believed. </span></p><p class="csE609553F"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Word of God is for us. It is by faith that it might be by grace. </span></p><h3 class="cs39141F69">

		<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable unto His death&hellip; I count not myself to have apprehended; but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Philippians 3:10-14. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What a wonderful word! This surely means to press on to be filled with all the fullness of God. If we leak out here we shall surely miss God, and shall fail in fulfilling the ministry He would give us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord would have us preach by life, and by deed, always abounding in service; living epistles, bringing forth to men the knowledge of God. If we went all the way with God, what would happen? What should we see if we would only seek to bring honor to the name of our God? Here we see Paul pressing in for this. There is no standing still. We must move on to a fuller power of the Spirit, never satisfied that we have apprehended all, but filled with the assurance that God will take us on to the goal we desire to reach, as we press on for the prize ahead. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Abraham came out from Ur of the Chaldees. We never get into a new place until we come out from the old one. There is a place where we leave the old life behind, and where the life in Christ fills us and we are filled with His glorious personality. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">On the road to Damascus, Saul of Tarsus was apprehended by Christ. From the first he sent up a cry, &ldquo;Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?&rdquo; He desired always to do the will of God, but here he realized a place of closer intimacy, a place of fuller power, of deeper crucifixion. He sees a prize ahead and every fiber of his being is intent on securing that prize. Jesus Christ came to be the firstfruits; the firstfruits of a great harvest of like fruit, like unto Himself. How zealous is the farmer as he watches his crops and sees the first shoots and blades. They are the earnest of the great harvest that is coming. Paul here is longing that the Father&rsquo;s heart shall be satisfied, for in that first resurrection the Heavenly Husbandman will see a firstfruits harvest, firstfruits like unto Christ, sons of God made conformable to the only begotten Son of God </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You say, &ldquo;I am in a needy place.&rdquo; It is in needy places that God delights to work. For three days the people that were with Christ were without food, and He asked Philip, &ldquo;From whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?&rdquo; That was a hard place for Philip, but not for Jesus, for He knew perfectly what He would do. The hard place is where He delights to show forth His miraculous power. And haw fully was the need provided for. Bread enough and to spare! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Two troubled, baffled travelers are on the road to Emmaus. As they communed together and reasoned, Jesus Himself drew near, and He opened up the Word to them in such a way that they saw light in His light. Their eyes were holden that they could not recognize who it was talking with them. But, o how their hearts burned within as He opened up the Scripture to them. And at the breaking of bread He was made known to them. Always seek to be found in the place where He manifests His presence and power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The resurrected Christ appeared to Peter and a few more of them early one morning on the shore of the lake. He prepared a meal for the tired, tried disciples. That is just like Him. Count on His presence. Count on His power. Count on His provision. He is always there just where you need Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Have you received </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Him?</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Are you to be found </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;in Him&rdquo;?</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Have you received </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">His righteousness</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, which is by faith? Abraham got to this place, for God gave this righteousness to him because he believed, and as you believe God He puts HIs righteousness to your account. He will put His righteousness right within you. He will keep you in perfect peace as you stay your mind upon Him and trust in Him. He will bring you to a rest of faith, to a place of blessed assurance that all that happens is working for your eternal good. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here is the widow&rsquo;s son on the road to burial. Jesus meets that unhappy procession. He has compassion on that poor woman who is taking her only son to the cemetery. His great heart had such compassion that death had no power&mdash;it could no longer hold its prey. Compassion is greater than suffering. Compassion is greater than death. O God, give us this compassion! In His infinite compassion Jesus stopped that funeral procession and cried to that widow&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.&rdquo; And he who was dead sat up, and Jesus delivered him to his mother. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul got a vision and revelation of the resurrection power of Christ, and so he was saying, &ldquo;I will not stop until I have laid hold of what God has laid hold of me for.&rdquo; For what purpose has God laid hold of us? To be channels for His power. He wants to manifest the power of the Son of God through you and me. God help us to manifest the faith of Christ, the compassion of Christ, the resurrection power of Christ. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One morning about eleven o&rsquo;clock I saw a woman who was suffering with tumor. She could not live through the day. A little blind girl led me to the bedside. Compassion broke me up and I wanted that woman to live for the child&rsquo;s sake. I said to the woman, &ldquo;Do you want to live?&rdquo; She could not speak. She just moved her finger. I anointed her with oil and said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus.&rdquo; There was a stillness of death that followed; and the pastor, looking at the woman, said to me, &ldquo;She is gone.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When God pours in His compassion it has resurrection power in it. I carried that woman across the room, put her against a wardrobe and held her there. I said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus, death come out.&rdquo; And soon her body began to tremble like a leaf. &ldquo;In Jesus&rsquo; name, walk,&rdquo; I said. She did and went back to bed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I told this story in the assembly. There was a doctor there and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove that.&rdquo; He went to the woman and she told him it was perfectly true. She said, &ldquo;I was in heaven, and I saw countless numbers all like Jesus. Then I heard a voice saying, &lsquo;Walk, in the name of Jesus.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is power in the name of Jesus. Let us apprehend it, the power of His resurrection, the power of His compassion, the power of His love. Love will break the hardest thing&mdash;there is nothing it will not break. </span></p><p class="cs13159BA7"><span class="cs72B5A8C2">&nbsp;</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At the time I received the Baptism in the Spirit, a meeting was going on in the large vestry of the All Saints&rsquo; Clurch, and I went straight to it. The vicar of the church, Pastor Boddy, had charge and he was speaking. I knew that as yet he had not received the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, and I interrupted him by saying, &ldquo;Oh, please let me speak, Mr. Boddy; I have just received the Baptism in the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The place was full of people. I can&rsquo;t remember what I said, but I know I made all those people extremely dissatisfied and discontented with their position. They said, &ldquo;We have been rebuking this man because he was so intensely hungry, but he has come in for a few days and has received the Baptism and some of us have been waiting here for months and have not yet received.&rdquo; A great hunger came upon them all. From that day God began to pour out His Spirit until in a very short while fifty had received the Baptism. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The first thing I did was to telegraph to my home saying &ldquo;I have received the Baptism in the Holy Ghost and have spoken in tongues.&rdquo; On the train to my home town, the Devil began questioning, &ldquo;Are you going to take this to Bradford?&rdquo; As regards my feelings at the moment, I had nothing to take, but the just do not live by feelings but by faith. So I shouted out on the railroad coach to everybody&rsquo;s amazement, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m taking it!&rdquo; A great joy filled me as I made this declaration, but somehow I knew that from that moment it would be a great fight all the time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I arrived home one of my sons said to me, &ldquo;Father, have you been speaking in tongues?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Yes, George.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s hear you,&rdquo; he said. But I could say nothing, for although I had received the Baptism in the Holy Ghost, I had not received the distinct gift of tongues. That did not come until nine months later. My son did not understand that the speaking with tongues which accompanies the receiving of the Baptism in the Spirit is not the &ldquo;gift of tongues&rdquo; spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12. The former is given as evidence that the Spirit has come in Pentecostal fullness; but there may not be any further utterance in tongues unless there is a special anointing of the Spirit. The &ldquo;gift of tongues,&rdquo; however, is such that the receiver may use it for payer or praise at any time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My wife said to me, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been speaking with tongues, have you?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want you to understand that I am as much baptized as you are and I don&rsquo;t speak in tongues.&rdquo; I saw that the contest was beginning right at home. &ldquo;I have been preaching for twenty years,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and you have sat beside me on the platform, but on Sunday you will preach yourself, and I&rsquo;ll see what there is in it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She kept her word. On Sunday she took a seat at the back of the building. We had always sat together on the platform until that day. So the contest had begun right in the church. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There were three steps up to the platform and as I went up those three steps the Lord gave me the scripture in Isaiah 61:1-3, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.&rdquo; I was no preacher, but hearing the voice of my Lord speaking those words to me, I began. I cannot now remember what I said but my wife was terribly disturbed. The bench on which she sat would seat nine people and she moved about on it until she had sat on every part of it. Then she said in a voice that all around her could hear, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my Smith, Lord, that&rsquo;s not my Smith!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was giving out the last hymn when the secretary of the mission stood up and said, &ldquo;I want what our leader has received.&rdquo; The strange thing was that when he was about to sit down he missed his seat and went right down on the floor. Then my eldest son arose and said he wanted what his father had and he, too, took his seat right down on the floor. In a short while there were eleven people right on the floor of that mission. The strangest thing was that they were all laughing in the Spirit and laughing at one another. The Lord had really turned again the captivity of Zion and the mouth of His children was being filled wIth laughter according to the word of the Lord in Psalm 126:1-2. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That was the beginning of a great outpouring of the Spirit where hundreds received the Baptism in the Holy Ghost and every one of them spoke in tongues as the Spirit of God gave utterance. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God knew that I should have to go all over the world and proclaim this glorious truth, that all could receive the Baptism in the Holy Ghost in exactly the same way as they received on the Day of Pentecost with the speaking in other tongues as the Spirit of God gives utterance. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The first call that I received after I had been baptized in the Holy Spirit was from a man who had a factory in Lancashire, and who employed more than 1,000 people. He wrote to say that he had heard that I had received the Holy Spirit as at the beginning, and he would like to meet a man who had had this experience. His letter said, &ldquo;If you will come, I&rsquo;ll close down the factory each afternoon and give you five meetings between 1:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.&rdquo; I wrote back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like a great big barrel that feels like bursting if it doesn&rsquo;t have a vent, so I&rsquo;m coming to you for the meetings.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Up to that time I had had no preaching abilities, but then I felt that I had a prophetic utterance which was flowing like a river by the power of the Holy Spirit. So I went to Lancashire; and that manufacturer closed down his factory, and from 1:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., with short intervals, I was preaching. Surely Christ fulfilled His promise, &ldquo;He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Quite a large number in that factory were gloriously saved. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Soon after this my dear wife received the Baptism in the Spirit and then we went forth together in response to the many calls that came from different parts of the country. Wherever we went the Lord baptized people with the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We went together to a small place in Shropshire where we held a meeting in a Primitive Methodist Chapel. As my wife preached, the fire fell and people were baptized in the Holy Spirit all over that chapel. There was a good deal of opposition and plenty of persecution. It was a small country village and everyone round about seemed to be greatly moved. They all knew about that revival in that church. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next morning after the &ldquo;fire had fallen,&rdquo; I went walking around the village and entered a grocery shop. A deep conviction fell on three people who were in that shop and before I left that grocery store all three were saved. After I came out I went up the road a little and saw two women in a field who were carrying buckets. I shouted out to them, &ldquo;Are you saved?&rdquo; Here again a tremendous conviction seized them. They dropped their pails and began to pray; and right in that field the Lord saved those two women. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Wherever I went conviction seemed to be upon people. I went into a stone quarry where a whole lot of men were employed and I preached to them as they were dressing the big stones, and again conviction fell and many were saved. As I was returning from this quarry, I passed a large hotel. Just as I was nearing it two men drove by in a two-wheel vehicle, and I never have seen men with such evil faces. They looked the very picture of the Devil. I did not know who they were but as they came near they cursed me and tried to slash their whip at me. It seemed like a whiff from the pit. They shouted so loudly that the landlord and landlady at the hotel and five people came out of that hotel and dashed at me like mad dogs, cursing and swearing, though I had not spoken a word to them. But I did not fear their assault. I cried out instantly, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus, in the power of the blood of Jesus, I drive you back into your den.&rdquo; They rushed back into the hotel and I went in and preached Jesus to them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There were many people healed and baptized at that time and the glory of the Lord constantly fell. Twenty years later I visited that same village and the people recounted the story of that wonderful visitation from God. Many people from different parts of the country would come to our mission and on almost every occasion they would express the wish that I would visit their place and do something for them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I had many telegrams to go to a place near Grantham to a young man who was very dangerously ill. After I arrived at Grantham I had nine miles to go by bicycle. When I came to that farmhouse that afternoon a woman at the door asked, &ldquo;Are you Wigglesworth?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I am sorry to say that you are too late. My son is beyond anything being done for him now.&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;God has never sent me anywhere too late.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I asked if I could see the young man. He lay in his bed with his face toward the wall and whispered that if he was turned over he would die, for his heart was so weak. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pray for the Lord to strengthen you.&rdquo; In most of my work in those early days I used to pray much and fast. I knew that this case was beyond all human hopes and so I lay awake most of the night praying. I got up very early the next morning and went out to an adjoining field to pray, for I was very much burdened about this case. There in that field God gave me a revelation that this had to be something new in my life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I went into the house and asked them to put their son&rsquo;s clothes to air because the Lord would raise him up. In that part of England the climate is very damp, so I knew it would be necessary for them to put his clothes before a fire before he could wear them. But they did not believe and so did not do anything about his clothes. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That was Sunday morning and I knew that there was a service at the Primitive Methodist Chapel. I went to the service and was invited to take charge. Through the word of the Lord, faith was planted in the hearts of all those people, and then something happened. They all knew that young man by name and they all said, &ldquo;Matthew will be raised up!&rdquo; That led me to see that faith could be created in others just as it had been created in me, and I went back to that house and said, &ldquo;Have you put his clothes to air?&rdquo; I think they were a little ashamed that they had done nothing, so they got out his clothes and put them before the fire. Then I went into the room and told the young man the vision I had, and said that something would happen different from anything that I had experienced before. I said, &ldquo;When I place my hands on you the glory of the Lord will fill the place till I shall not be able to stand. I shall be helpless on the floor.&rdquo; I went out and got his clothes, and said to one of the household, &ldquo;All I want you to do is, put his stockings on him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Why I had asked them to put his stockings on is a mystery. His legs were like those of a skeleton and I saw his helplessness, and knew that a miracle would have to be performed. After this member of the household had put the stockings on the young man I said, &ldquo;Now you can leave the room.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They shut the door. I think it is a very important thing to have the door shut when you have a case like this to deal with, for then you know that you are just shut in with God. I prayed for the vision to be made good, and instantly, the moment I touched the young man, the power of God filled the room and was so powerful that I fell to the floor. My nose and my mouth were touching the floor and I lay there in the glory for a quarter of an hour. All that while Matthew in the bed was shouting, &ldquo;Lord, this is for Thy glory! This is for Thy glory!&rdquo; The bed simply shook, as did everything in the room, by the power of God. Matthew&rsquo;s strength, his life, and his heart (which was considered the weakest thing about him) were all renewed. I was still on the floor in the glory when he arose from his bed and began to dress. After he was dressed he began to walk up and down the room shouting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m raised up for Thy glory! I&rsquo;m raised up for Thy glory!&rdquo; Opening the door he shouted, &ldquo;Dad, God has healed me. I&rsquo;m healed!&rdquo; The same glory filled the kitchen; the father and mother fell down; and the daughter who had been brought from the asylum and whose mind was still affected was made perfectly whole that day. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That whole village was moved and a revival began that day. I went into that village unnoticed and unknown, but when I left all the village turned out and shouted, &ldquo;Please come back, please come back, and stop with us longer next time.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I made the nine miles back to Grantham and paid a visit to one of our converts who had moved to this city. The moment I got to the door she said, &ldquo;My brother is going to take you to a man who has cancer on the bladder.&rdquo; I went with her brother to the house of a sick man and before I reached the house I could hear a voice crying out, &ldquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!&rdquo; It was so loud I could hear it at least fifty yards before I got to the home. When I got into his room he was still shouting, &ldquo;Oh dear! Oh dear!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Instantly God revealed to me that neither this man nor his wife were saved, so I said to the man, &ldquo;This great affliction is as much mental trouble as cancer. Are you saved?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if I were saved I could die comfortably. If I were saved I would not mind this cancer or anything.&rdquo; I pointed out the way of salvation and God saved the man and his wife. That man had such a revelation of salvation that joy overflowed and I could hear him shouting &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; for fifty yards after I left that home. The transformation was beyond all description. He had no more trouble with that cancer. I hurried to the station and just caught my train back to Bradford. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I soon saw that my business would have to give place to the ministry that God was giving me. I had supported my family with my plumbing business; but I was called out of town so often, and people could not wait&mdash;they had to seek help from other sources. Each time I returned to Bradford I had less business. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There came a period of very severe frost. I went around to my various customers and helped them to cover up their water pipes so they could get water during the frosty weather, but I knew that when the thaw came I should be wanted at many places to repair broken pipes. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was invited to a convention at Preston in Lancashire. During those convention days the frost broke and telegrams began coming in asking me to return immediately to Bradford to do repair work. At that time the leader of the convention said to me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve helped us much and have been a very great blessing, and we would very much like you to stop until the end of the convention; but if you feel you want to go home we will relieve you.&rdquo; I went home but I found out that most of my customers who had had broken pipes had been compelled to seek other plumbers. There was only one woman, a widow, who had not been able to get a plumber. I went to her house and found that it was flooded with water and that one of the ceilings was down. I was so sorry for her that I repaired her pipes and her roof. She was grateful, for she had waited many days for help. When she said. &ldquo;Tell me how much I owe you now,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t receive any pay from you. I&rsquo;ll make this an offering to the Lord as my last plumbing job.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A friend once remarked: &ldquo;All the people who say they live by faith seem to have their heels worn out, and their clothes are old and green.&rdquo; I believed that God would abundantly provide if I served him faithfully. I promised Him at that time that I would obey Him implicitly, but I laid down the condition that my shoe heels must never be a disgrace, and I must never have to wear trousers with the knees out. I said to the Lord, &ldquo;If either of these things take place, I&rsquo;ll go back to plumbing.&rdquo; He has never failed to supply all my needs. He increased my vision and faith and gave me calls all over England. I was a pioneer with the Pentecostal message to a great many assemblies throughout Great Britain. Soon calls began to pour in from other countries also. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I had a lot of money on my books that I was not able to collect without court action, but I preferred losing it to going to law. All the debts that I owed at that time were met by a young friend whose heart the Lord opened to make me a gift of some fifty pounds. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My wife and I continued our ministry at Bowland Street, Bradford, even though I had to be frequently absent because I was ministering elsewhere. I believed in house-to-house visitation, and I prayed in every house I entered. Everywhere I went souls were saved and people were healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was not ashamed of the Gospel so I purchased the largest flagpole that could be obtained and placed it outside the mission. I had a flag waving on that pole three yards long and one and one-half yards wide. One side of the flag was red and the other side was blue with white letters. On one side I had the scripture, &ldquo;I am the Lord that healeth thee.&rdquo; On the other side, &ldquo;Christ died for our sins.&rdquo; That flag had great effect on the people who saw it when passing by. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God moved me on to a place of increasing faith, causing me to see that the Word of God was written to show us how to </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">act</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> on the principles of faith. I saw that Christ had said, &ldquo;When thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.&rdquo; So I engaged two people to go out and find all the needy, the sick, and the afflicted and I gave them tickets inviting them to a banquet and entertainment at the Bowland Street mission. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After the two people had gone round the neighborhood they gathered together a great company of needy people. That sight was beyond all description. There were the blind and the haIt and the withered. All around the mission there were wheelchairs and people on crutches and the blind were being led. This was the best day in my life up to that point. I wept and wept and wept. One reason I wept was because of the great need; I was weeping also for joy at the opportunity, and with expectation of seeing things that I had never seen before. And so it was. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The first thing we did was to supply everybody with a first-dass meal and there was plenty to spare of the very best we could provide. After they were filled we gave them entertainment, not in a worldly sense, but the whole program was surely very entertaining. The first man on the program was one who had been wheeled up and down in a chair for a very long time, who told how he had been healed by the power of God. The next one on the program was a woman who had been healed of an issue of blood. She told how she was healed by prayer and by the anointing of oil the day before she was to go on the operating table. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then we had a man who had been going about trailing his foot and his arm because he had had a paralytic stroke. He told how he was healed after the doctors had given him up. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For an hour and a half we kept those poor helpless people deeply moved and weeping by the stories they heard of how Jesus could heal the sick. I said to them, &ldquo;Now we have been entertaining you today, but we are going to have another meeting next Saturday and you people who are today bound and who have come in wheelchairs, and some of you folks who have come like the woman in the Gospel who had spent her all on doctors and was no better, are going to entertain us on Saturday night by the stories of the freedom that you have received today by the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; So we prayed for those people and God mightily met us. We surely had a great time the following Saturday night as one after another told of how God had healed them of their different infirmities. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I shall never forget that day. I cried out, &ldquo;Who wants to be healed?&rdquo; Of course, everyone wanted to be. I remember one particular case. I had gone to fetch a woman in her wheelchair. The wheel was broken, but I managed to fix it up. I helped her from her home but that wheelchair gave way in the road. I said to her, &ldquo;Well, you will never want it again anyhow.&rdquo; I fixed it again and ultimately we arrived at the mission. God so marvelously healed her that she walked home, and I am a witness to the fact that she went up all the steps into her house and into her bedroom, praising the Lord as she went. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There was one young man who had been having epileptic fits for eighteen years, who was instantly healed. He had never gone out without having someone to accompany him. His mother brought him to that meeting, and God so wonderfully undertook for him that within two weeks he was working in a factory and bringing home wages. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Another case was that of a young man who was all doubled up like the woman in the Bible. The Lord Jesus called it the spirit of infirmity, indicating that she was bound by an evil spirit. That day that young man was loosed and set free just as the woman was loosed in the synagogue. Christ in His healing ministry said He was working the works of God, and He said that if we believed, we also could do the works of God. He had cast out the spirit of infirmity; so I cast out the spirit of infirmity in the name of Jesus Christ, and immediately the young man was made straight, and everyone was blessing the Lord for the miracle they saw. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Another remarkable case was that of a boy who, from his head to his feet, was encased in thin iron. The building was very crowded but the father lifted up the boy in the iron case and passed him over to the man who was sitting in the seat in front of him. He was then passed on to the next seat and others passed him on until ultimately he was placed before me on the platform. I anointed him with oil and laid hands on him in the name of the Lord Jesus, and immediately he cried out, &ldquo;Papa, Papa, Papa. It&rsquo;s going all over me! It&rsquo;s going all over me! It&rsquo;s going all over me!&rdquo; And he was loosened that day and made absolutely free. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Can you wonder that faith was quickened in the hearts of many as they saw these miracles wrought? A week after, these people were going around as witnesses telling what Christ had done for them. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs92EAF8D3">Smith Wigglesworth: Apostle of Faith</span><span class="cs12506F1C"> by Stanley Howard Frodsham, chapter 4.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We continue the story in our Greatheart&rsquo;s own words: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My wife was a great preacher, and although I had no ability to preach, she made up her mind to train me for the ministry. So she would continually make an announcement that I would be the speaker the next Sunday. She said she was sure I could preach if I only tried. When she announced me to speak, this would give me a week of labor and a good deal of sweating. I used to go into the pulpit on Sunday with great boldness, give out my text, say a few words, and then say to the congregation, &ldquo;If any of you can preach you can have a chance now, for I am finished.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She would have me try again, but it always ended the same way. She was the preacher and I encouraged her to do it all. But I found out that when you have a burden for lost souls, and the vision of their need is ever before you, the Lord, as you look to Him, will give you expression to your heart&rsquo;s compassion and make a preacher out of you. We held open-air services for twenty years in one part of the city of Bradford. It was as I ministered in the open air week by week that the Lord began to give me more liberty. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My wife and I always believed in scriptural holiness but I was conscious of much carnality in myself. A really holy man once came to preach for us and he spoke of what it meant to be entirely sanctified. He called it a very definite work of grace subsequent to the new birth. As I waited on the Lord for ten days in prayer, handing my body over to Him as a living sacrifice according to Romans 12:1-2, God surely did something for me, for from that time I began to have real liberty in preaching. We counted that as the Baptism in the Spirit. And so, at our Mission on Bowland Street we stood for both Healing and Holiness. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We never believed it was right for us to do all the preaching. And so we gave two or three of our young men and women a chance every week. These young workers developed and the result was that many of them became wonderful preachers. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We thought that we had got all that was coming to us on spiritual lines, but one day we heard that people were being baptized in the Spirit and were speaking in other tongues, and that the gifts of the Spirit were being manifested. I confess that I was much moved by this news. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day, I saw a man coming to the house, and noticed that he had very great difficulty in getting up the steps to our front door. But he managed to pull himself up some way or other by the railing, and when he had taken a seat he said: &ldquo;If my people knew that I was coming to your house, they never would have let me come. You have a worse name than any man I ever heard of.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If that is your opinion of me you had better clear out of my house, for I do not want anyone here that does not believe in me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe in you. Please do not put me out. If you knew my terrible condition, you would not send me away. Put your hand on my leg, will you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I did, and found it was like a board, not like a leg. I said, &ldquo;It feels strange. What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;It is a cancer. All the leg, from top to bottom, is cancerous. Oh, you will not send me away, will you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I replied, &ldquo;I will not send you away. I will go and see what God says about this.&rdquo; As I waited before the Lord these words came to me: &ldquo;Go, tell that man to fast seven days and seven nights, and his flesh shall become like a little child&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I told him what the Lord had given me for him, and he said, &ldquo;I believe all that God has said to you, and I will go home and do all that God has told me to do.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Four days later I was looking through the window and here was this same man; but instead of having to take hold of the railing and pull himself up like a sick man, he jumped up those steps and came running around the house like a boy, crying out, &ldquo;I am perfectly healed!&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I am going back to fast a further three days and three nights, but I thought I would let you know what God has already wrought.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next time he came to our house he saw my daughter Alice and heard her say that she was going to Angola in Africa. &ldquo;I would like to have a share in this,&rdquo; he told her as he pulled out a handful of gold coins, saying: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my gift towards your going to Africa.&rdquo; Then he turned to me and remarked, &ldquo;Have you heard the latest? They are receiving the Holy Spirit at Sunderland and speaking in other tongues. I have decided to go up to Sunderland to see this thing for myself. Would you like to come with me?&rdquo; I declared that I would be delighted to go. He said, &ldquo;All right, you come along with me and all expenses will be paid out of my purse.&rdquo; He was so happy at having been healed, and he surely was glorifying God for the miracle that had been wrought in his life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I wrote ahead to Sunderland to two people who had been saved in the work in Bradford and who had gone to live in that town. The report had come to them that what was happening was a very dangerous error and that speaking in other tongues was from an evil power. In order to save me from this terrible error they arranged for a very wonderful woman to be on hand to warn me. And so the first things I heard were false reports. When they had said all they had to say, I suggested, &ldquo;Let us pray.&rdquo; The Lord gave me real liberty in prayer and after I had prayed they said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any notice of what we have said. Obey your own leadings.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was a Saturday night when I went to the meeting, which was held in the vestry of the parish church at Monkwearmouth, Sunderland. What I could not understand was this: I had just come from Bradford, where the Spirit of God was working mightily. Many had been prostrated, slain by the power of God the night before. I left for Sunderland. It seemed to me that there was not the power in this meeting that we had in our own assembly in Bradford. I was disappointed. But I was very hungry for God, and He knew my hunger even though nobody seemed to understand me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I can remember a man giving his testimony that after waiting on the Lord for three weeks, the Lord had baptized him in the Holy Spirit and caused him to speak in other tongues. I cried out, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear these tongues. That&rsquo;s what I came for. Let&rsquo;s hear it!&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;When you are baptized you will speak in tongues.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">According to my own opinion I had been baptized in the Spirit. Thinking back to my ten days of waiting on God and the blessing I had received as a result, I had called that the Baptism in the Spirit. So I said to them, &ldquo;I remember when I was baptized, my tongue was loosed. My testimony was different.&rdquo; But they answered, &ldquo;No, that is not it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But I was seeking with all my heart after God. On Sunday morning I went to a Salvation Army prayer meeting at seven o&rsquo;clock. Three times in that prayer meeting I was smitten to the floor by the mighty power of God. Somewhat ashamed of my position, lest I should be misunderstood, I tried to control myself by getting up again and kneeling and praying. At the close of the service the captain said to me, &ldquo;Where are you from, Brother?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I am from Bradford. I came to Sunderland to receive these tongues that people are getting here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the Devil they are getting up there.&rdquo; But anyhow, he invited me to preach for him that afternoon, and we had a very wonderful time. But they were all persuading me not to go near the Pentecostal people and not to seek the speaking in other tongues. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Pastor Boddy, who was vicar of the Episcopal Church where those first Pentecostal meetings were held, gave out a notice that there would be a waiting meeting all night on Tuesday. It was a very precious time and the presence of the Lord was very wonderful, but I did not hear anyone speak in tongues. At 2:30 in the morning Brother Boddy said, &ldquo;We had better close the meeting.&rdquo; I was disappointed, for I would have liked to stay there all night. I found I had changed my clothes and left the key to my hotel room in the clothes I had taken off, so a missionary brother from India said to me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come and sleep with me.&rdquo; But I did not go to bed; we spent the night in prayer and received great blessing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For four days I wanted nothing but God. But after that, I felt I should leave for my home, and I went to the Episcopal vicarage to say good-bye. I said to Mrs. Boddy, the vicar&rsquo;s wife: &ldquo;I am going away, but I have not received the tongues yet.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;It is not tongues you need, but the Baptism.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have received the Baptism, Sister,&rdquo; I protested, &ldquo;but I would like to have you lay hands on me before I leave.&rdquo; She laid her hands on me and then had to go out of the room. The fire fell. It was a wonderful time as I was there with God alone. He bathed me in power. I was conscious of the cleansing of the precious Blood, and I cried out: &ldquo;Clean! Clean! Clean!&rdquo; I was filled with the joy of the consciousness of the cleansing. I was given a vision in which I saw the Lord Jesus Christ. I beheld the empty cross, and I saw Him exalted at the right hand of God the Father. I could speak no longer in English but I began to praise Him in other tongues as the Spirit of God gave me utterance. I knew then, although I might have received anointings previously, that now, at last, I had received the real Baptism in the Holy Spirit as they received on the day of Pentecost. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs92EAF8D3">Smith Wigglesworth: Apostle of Faith</span><span class="cs12506F1C"> by Stanley Howard Frodsham, chapter 3.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;My soul followeth hard after Thee&rdquo; (Psalm 63:8) is the intense expression of the man after God&rsquo;s own heart. This was ever the attitude of Smith Wigglesworth from the early days of his Christian experience. No wonder the enemy of souls sought so hard to cause the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches to choke the Word in the two years mentioned in the last chapter. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bunyan&rsquo;s pilgrim learned many lessons in the house of the Interpreter. He saw a fire burning against the wall, and one standing by it to cast water on it to quench it, but yet the fire burned fiercer than ever. The interpreter told him the meaning: &ldquo;This fire is the work of grace that is wrought in the heart. He that casts water upon it to extinguish and put it out is the Devil; but in that thou seest the fire notwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou shalt see the reason of that.&rdquo; So he took Christian to the other side of the wall, and there was Christ continually pouring in the oil of His grace. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So it was with our Greatheart. Though the Devil had succeeded in quenching his zeal for a short while, the Lord&rsquo;s oil was poured on the neady quenched flame, in response to his wife&rsquo;s prayers, so that he came forth from the trial a flame of fire that for the next sixty years became brighter and more intense every day. But we will let him continue his own story: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God gave me a great zeal in soul-winning. Every day I sought to bring someone to Christ. I was willing to wait an hour any day to have an interview with anyone about his soul&rsquo;s salvation. At one place I waited an bour and a half, asking God to direct me to the one of His choice. The road was filled with people but I kept saying to the Lord, &ldquo;I want the right man.&rdquo; After awhile I was somewhat impatient in my spirit and I said, &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t have much time to waste.&rdquo; But God did not call it wasted time. After an hour and a half a man came along with a horae and cart, aDd the Lord spoke to me just as He spoke to Philip when He told him to join himself to the chariot of the Ethiopian. I got up in the cart beside the man and was soon talking with him about his need of salvation. He growled, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go about your own business? Why should you pick me out and talk to me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I wondered whether I had made a mistake. I looked up to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Is this the right man, Lord?&rdquo; He said to me, &ldquo;Yes, this is the right man.&rdquo; And so I continued to talk to him and plead with him to yield his life to Christ. By and by I saw that he was shedding tears, and I knew that God had softened his heart and the seed of the Word was entering. After I was sure a true work of grace had been wrought, I jumped down from his cart, and he went on his way. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Three weeks later my mother said to me, &ldquo;Smith, have you been talking to someone about salvation?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am always doing that, Mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I visited a man last night. He was dying; he has been in bed for three weeks. I asked whether he would like someone to come and pray with him. He said, &lsquo;The last time I was out, a young man got into my cart and spoke to me. I was very rough with him but he was very persistent. Anyhow, God convicted me of my sins, and saved me.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; My mother continued, &ldquo;That was the last time that man was out. He passed away in the night. He described the young man who talked with him and I could tell from his description that you were the one.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I walked along, I would be always looking for someone to whom I could talk about the Lord. One time I went with a brother on a bicycle tour. Every day for ten days we had, on an average, three good cases of salvation. My experience in business life led me to a great many people whom I would not have contacted had I been a professional preacher. My whole business life was spent in communion with God. I sought to be His witness everywhere I went. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man came to reside in Bradford and asked a businessman: &ldquo;Can you introduce me to a good plumber?&rdquo; The businessman replied, &ldquo;Yes, I can, if you can stand his religion. If you have him as plumber, you have to have his religion as well. He never goes out on a job but what he is preaching all the while he is doing his plumbing work.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; this man said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it.&rdquo; He told me afterwards that he was pleased that he had me as a plumber because of my talks to him about the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was very successful in my plumbing work, but I was very poor in collecting the debts on my books. But every Saturday I had to pay my men. One day I was in need of money. I have always believed it was God&rsquo;s plan for me to be in need, because in the needy hour .God opened the door to me and that strengthened my faith. At that particular time I went to the Lord and prayed, &ldquo;Lord, I have not time to go out and seek money. Please tell me where I can get some.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Go to Bishop.&rdquo; I had heard that he was a very bad payer and that everyone had to take him to the courts in order to get their money. But because the Lord had told me to go, I knew He could deal with him, so I went in faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I went into the lodge gate, I met Mrs. Bishop coming out with another lady. I had been somewhat in hopes that I might see her and that she would pay me. So I said to myself, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one hope and that is to see Bishop.&rdquo; But I hesitated for a moment because I knew that he paid nobody. Should I go? Well, I knew God had spoken to me, and so I went to the back door. The servant answered and I asked, &ldquo;Is Mr. Bishop in?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, and he will not be home for three weeks.&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot understand that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you understand? You seem disturbed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am very disturbed. I have to have money to pay my men tomorrow, and as I have been praying the Lord directed me to come here; it is quite disturbing to know that Mr. Bishop is away and will not be back for three weeks.&rdquo; The servant asked, &ldquo;How much is it that he owes you?&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;Just about twenty pounds.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; She went upstairs, brought the money down, and settled the account. I said to her, &ldquo;Do you do this kind of thing often?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Well, I knew the Lord had told me to go to that house at nine o&rsquo;clock the night previous. She told me that at that very time the mistress had given her her wages and that she felt impressed to pay this account out of her wages. I said, &ldquo;What makes you do it?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I dare not let you go away without it. That is all I can say.&rdquo; God showed me how he could make a human impossibility possible. Incidents like that helped in the creation of a living faith in my heart. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One morning the children were all gathered around the breakfast table and my wife said, &ldquo;Harold and Ernest are very sick this morning. Before we have breakfast we will pray for them.&rdquo; Immediately the power of God fell upon my wife and me, and as we laid our hands on these children they were both instantly healed. As we saw the miraculous healing wrought before our eyes, we were both filled with intense joy. The Lord was always so good in proving Himself our family Physician. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That day I went out to work at a house where a great many servants were employed, and I took an apprentice boy to work with me. I could see that the lady of the house was very restless. She came into the room where I was working, looked at me, and then walked out. Soon she came back and said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you send your apprentice to your shop for something?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I was just going to send him to the shop because I am short of one piece of pipe.&rdquo; As soon as the boy was out of the door she said, &ldquo;Tell me, oh, please tell me, what is the cause of your face showing such a wonderful expression of joy?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Well, this morning two of my children came to the breakfast table very sick. My wife and I prayed for them and God instantly healed them. I was filled with joy as I saw what He had wrought, and that joy is with me now.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Please tell me how to get this joy. My house is full of trouble. My husband left me this morning after a big disturbance. Please tell me how I can get this peace and rest and joy that you have.&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;The Lord has saved my wife and me, and we know what it is to have the power of God in our home, and for Him to meet all our needs and to fill us with His peace and joy.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Oh, please, can you help me?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can help you now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She seemed afraid of the servants coming in, so she locked the door and kept her hand on the key, as if she was afraid she might be disturbed any moment; and while she had her hand on the key, the Lord saved her. She was filled with the joy of the assurance that all her sins were washed away. She said, &ldquo;Oh, how can I keep this?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;Do you have an &lsquo;at home&rsquo; day when the ladies come to visit you?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I have one next Thursday.&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;Tell all the ladies how the Lord has saved you and ask if you can pray with them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That was the ministry that the Lord gave me all through the years that I was in the plumbing business. I had the joy of leading so many men and women, and so many servant girls, to Christ as I worked at my trade and witnessed for my Christ. The Lord had a purpose in keeping me tied up financially. In some respects I had a flourishing business but I was always short of ready money. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I can remember one day I went to prayer as usual and asked the Lord, &ldquo;Where shall I go for money this weekend?&rdquo; He said to me: &ldquo;Go and see the architect and ask him for a certificate.&rdquo; I was working on a job under a certain architect, and so in obedience to the word of the Lord I went to see him. As soon as I got to the office he said, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; I explained I needed a certificate. &ldquo;On what job?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The job you gave me to fix the furnaces in Osletgate.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have only just got to work.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;That makes no difference, the work is done.&rdquo; The work was on a row of new houses. He said, &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have finished the work; I only gave it to you a week ago.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;When you gave it to me, you did so because you knew I would do it quickly.&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;How could you do it?&rdquo; &ldquo;I brought all my men from other work and got down to business.&rdquo; He doubted my word. He picked up his hat and said, &ldquo;I will go and see.&rdquo; We went together and when he saw the work he was well satisfied. He said, &ldquo;This is wonderful; it is just what we wanted.&rdquo; And so he wrote out a certificate for the money. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was one thing to get the certificate and another thing to get the money. I started to the office of the mill master to whom the property belonged, and as I went I noticed on a shop window a scripture text, &ldquo;Trust in the Lord at all times.&rdquo; I went forward, believing that since I had my trust in the Lord, everything would be all right. When I got to the office of the mill I handed the cashier the certificate. It was Saturday morning and he shouted louder than I could shout, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get no money here! You&rsquo;ll get no money here! You&rsquo;ll get no money here! We never pay out money except on certain days in the month; and I tell you, you&rsquo;ll get no money here!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He shouted so loudly that I thought there was something wrong with his mind. Behind him the door opened. The master appeared at the door and demanded, &ldquo;Whatever is wrong?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir, I have given this man a certificate for payment and I don&rsquo;t know why he is shouting so.&rdquo; I gathered that the Lord made the clerk shout so as to bring the master down from another building. The mill master read the certificate and said to the cashier, &ldquo;Pay this man his money. And if I hear of anything like this again, I&rsquo;ll fire you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I came out of the office with the money and went down the street praising the Lord. When I came to the shop where I had seen that scripture text I went in and said, &ldquo;How much do you want for that text?&rdquo; I was told a shilling, so I bought it and it was a great blessing to me to remind me continually to &ldquo;trust in the Lord at all times.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Being in business for myself, I was able to devote much of my time to the sick and needy. I used to go to Leeds every week to a place where Divine Healing was taught. But I was very critical in my spirit and would judge people so harshly. I did not know why so many people who taught Divine Healing wore glasses. I questioned, &ldquo;Why do you wear glasses if you believe in Divine Healing?&rdquo; This stumbled me somewhat. Later I had to wear glasses to read my Bible, and I was often criticized for this. However, I was very full of compassion towards the sick and needy folk, and being able to pay the expenses of the needy ones, I used to collect a number of them and take them to Leeds every Tuesday to the service. One day I had nine with me. The leaders of the Leeds Healing Home looked through the window and said, &ldquo;Here is Wigglesworth coming again and bringing a lot more. If he only knew, he could get these people healed at Bradford just as easily as to get them healed in Leeds.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These leaders knew that I had a compassion for the sick and needy, and one day they said to me: &ldquo;We want to go to the Keswick convention and we have been thinking whom we should leave to do the work. We can only think of you.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t conduct a healing service.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We have no one else. We trust you to take care of the work while we are away.&rdquo; A flash came into my mind: &ldquo;Well, any number of people can talk. All I have to do is to take charge.&rdquo; The following week when I got there the place was full of people. Of course, the first thing I did was to look for someone who would do the speaking; but all whom I asked said, &ldquo;No, you have been chosen and you must do it.&rdquo; And so I had to begin. I do not remember what I said but I do know that when I had finished speaking fifteen people came out for healing. One of these was a man from Scotland who hobbled on a pair of crutches. I prayed for him and he was instantly healed. There was no one so surprised as I was. He was jumping all over the place without his crutches. This encouraged the others to believe God for their healing and all the people were healed. I am sure it was not my faith, but it was God in His compassion coming to help me in that hour of need. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After this the Lord opened the door of faith for me more and more. I announced that I would have a Divine Healing meeting in Bradford on a certain evening. I can remember that there were twelve people who came that night and all of those twelve were miraculously healed. One had a tongue badly bitten in the center through a fall. This one was perfectly healed. Another was a woman with an ulcer on her ankle joint and a large sore that was constantly discharging. She was healed and there was only a scar the next day. The others were healed the same way. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day a man asked me, &ldquo;Does Divine Healing embrace seasickness?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Yes. It is a spirit of fear that causes your seasickness, and I command that spirit to go out of you in Jesus&rsquo; name.&rdquo; He was never seasick again though he had to travel much. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day a man came to the house. He was a very devoted brother. I said to him, &ldquo;Mr. Clark, you seem downcast today. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I left my wife dying. Two doctors have been with her right through the night and they say she cannot live long.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you believe God for your wife?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Brother Wigglesworth, I cannot believe for her.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He went out of the house broken-hearted. I went to see a fellow named Howe who was opening a small mission in Bradford. I thought he was the right man to go with me, to assist me. When I said, &ldquo;Will you go with me?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;No, indeed I won&rsquo;t. Please do not ask me again. But I believe if you will go, God will heal.&rdquo; I realize now that the Lord put those words in his mouth to encourage me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Well I knew a man named Nichols who, if he got the opportunity to pray, would pray all around the world three times and then come back. So I went to him and said, &ldquo;Will you come with me to pray for Sister Clark?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes, I will be very glad.&rdquo; We had a mile and a half to walk to that house. I told him when he began to pray not to stop until he was finished. When we got to the house we saw that Mrs. Clark was nearly gone. I said to the one I had brought with me, &ldquo;You see the dangerous condition of Sister Clark. Now don&rsquo;t waste time but begin to pray.&rdquo; Seeing he had an opportunity, he began. I had never suffered so much as I did when he was praying, and I cried to the Lord, &ldquo;Stop him! Please, Lord, stop this man&rsquo;s praying.&rdquo; Why? Because he prayed for the dear husband who was going to be bereaved and for the children who were going to be motherless. He piled it on so thick that I had to cry out, &ldquo;Stop him, Lord; I cannot stand this.&rdquo; And thank God, he stopped. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Though I knew that neither Clark nor Nichols believed in Divine Healing, I had concealed a small bottle in my hip pocket that would hold about half a pint of oil. I put a long cork in it so that I could open the bottle easily. I took the bottle out of my pocket and held it behind me, and said: &ldquo;Now you pray, Mr. Clark.&rdquo; Brother Clark, being encouraged by Brother Nichols&rsquo; prayer, prayed also that he might be sustained in his great bereavement. I could not stand it all, and I cried, &ldquo;Lord, stop him.&rdquo; I was so earnest and so broken that they could hear me outside the house. Thank God, he stopped. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As soon as he stopped, I pulled the cork out of the bottle, and went over to the dying woman who was laid out on the bed. I was a novice at this time and did not know any better, so I poured all the contents of that bottle of oil over Mrs. Clark&rsquo;s body in the name of Jesus! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was standing beside her at the top of the bed and looking towards the foot, when suddenly the Lord Jesus appeared. I had my eyes open gazing at Him. There He was at the foot of the bed. He gave me one of those gentle smiles. I see Him just now as I tell this story to you. I have never lost that vision, the vision of that beautiful smile. After a few moments He vanished but something happened that day that changed my whole life. Mrs. Clark was raised up and filled with life, and lived to bring up a number of children; she outlived her husband many years. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Everybody has to have testings. If you believe in Divine Healing you will surely be tested on the faith line. God cannot bring anyone into blessing and into full cooperation with Him except through testings and trials. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My wife and I saw that we could not go just half-measures with God. If we believed in Divine Healing we would have to be wholeheartedly in it; so we pledged ourselves to God and then to each other. This consecration to trust God seemed to bring a new order in our lives. We looked into each other&rsquo;s faces and said, &ldquo;From henceforth no medicine, no doctors, no drugs of any kind shall come into our house.&rdquo; It is very easy when in health and strength to make pledges and utter vows, but it is being faithful when the time of testing comes that counts. Little did we know that shortly we were going to have such a test. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We were both very zealous for the Lord and spent a good deal of time in open-air meetings. One Sunday a violent pain gripped me and brought me down to earth. Two men supported me and brought me home. The same thing had happened before but the pain had not been so severe in previous times. We prayed all night. The next morning I said to my wife, &ldquo;It seems to me that this is my home-call. We have been praying all night, and nothing has happened; I am worse. It does not seem as though anything can be done. You know our arrangement is that when we know we have received a home-call, only then to save each other the embarrassment of having an inquest and the condemnation of outsiders, would we call a physician. To protect yourself you should now call a physician. I leave it with you to do what you think should be done.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Poor thing, she was in a sad plight, with all the little children around her and there seemed no hope whatever. She broke down and left me and went to see a physician&mdash;not for him to help me, for she did not think he could help me, but believing that the end had come. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When the doctor came he examined me, shook his head, and said, &ldquo;There is no hope whatever. He has had appendicitis for the past six months and the organs are in such shape that he is beyond hope.&rdquo; He turned to my wife and said, &ldquo;I have a few calls to make, Mrs. Wigglesworth. I will come and see you again later. The only hope is for him to have an immediate operation, but I am somewhat afraid your husband is too weak for that.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When he got out of the room, an elderly lady and a young man came in. She was a great woman to pray, and she believed that everything that was not health was of the Devil. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">While she prayed, the young man laid his hands on me and cried, &ldquo;Come out, Devil, in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">To my surprise I felt as well as I had ever been in my life. I was absolutely free from pain. As soon as they had prayed for me they went downstairs, and I got up, believing that no one had a right to remain in bed when healed. When I got downstairs, my wife cried, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am healed.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I hope it is true.&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;Any work in?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, there is a woman who is in a great hurry to get some plumbing done; if we could not take care of it, she would have to go somewhere else.&rdquo; She gave me the address and I went out to do this work. While I was working, the doctor returned. He put his silk hat on the table, went upstairs, got as far as the landing, when my wife shouted, &ldquo;Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Are you calling me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Doctor, he&rsquo;s out. He has gone out to work.&rdquo; The doctor answered, &ldquo;They will bring him back a corpse, as sure as you live.&rdquo; Well, the &ldquo;corpse&rdquo; has been going up and down the world preaching the Gospel these many years since that time! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I have laid hands on people with appendicitis in almost every part of the world and never knew of a case not instantly healed, even when doctors were on the premises. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs92EAF8D3">Smith Wigglesworth: Apostle of Faith</span><span class="cs12506F1C"> by Stanley Howard Frodsham, chapter 2.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the second part of the </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, Bunyan introduces us to one Mr. Greatheart, who guided and guarded Christiana and her sons on their way to the Celestial City. The one whose story we are telling was a Mr. Greatheart. He surely had a great heart of love and loyalty to his Master, for so often we have heard him say, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t He a lovely Jesus!&rdquo; And he also had a great heart of love for all his fellow pilgrims, especially the poor and needy, the sick and the suffering. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He once said to us, &ldquo;All that I am today I owe, under God, to my precious wife. Oh, she was lovely!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Mary Jane Featherstone, whom God chose to be &ldquo;an helpmeet for him,&rdquo; came from a good Methodist family. Her father was a temperance lecturer. He was heir to a large inheritance that had been made through liquor selling, but he had a conviction that filthy lucre secured through the damnation of souls would do him no good, and so he refused to touch a penny of this tainted money. His daughter followed her father&rsquo;s principles of righteousness and holiness, and was always fearless in speaking her inner convictions. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When about 17 years of age, Mary Jane, or Polly as she was often called, was placed in a milliner&rsquo;s store to learn the art of trimming hats and bonnets. This kind of work seemed too petty for her, so after a month of it she decided to run away from her native town and all the restraints of home, to seek fame and fortune in Bradford. But the Lord was watching over this handmaid to preserve her from evil. She secured a place to live in Bradford, but it &ldquo;hapt&rdquo; that a traveling man whom she knew was just at the door of this house at the moment she was moving in. He exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, Miss Featherstone, you must not live in this house. Let me take you to a place that is beyond reproach.&rdquo; He then took her in a cab to a very desirable home. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Polly accepted service in a large family in one of the big homes in Bradford. One night she was in the center of the city, and was attracted, by the sound of trumpets and the beating of drums, to a meeting held in the open air. The Salvation Army was an entirely new thing in those days, and she looked at these people with great interest. When their open-air meeting was over, they marched down the streets of Bradford, and she thought to herself, &ldquo;Where are these silly people, who play as they march, going?&rdquo; She followed them to a dilapidated theater building. Dare she go into a theater? At home she had been taught that such a place was unspeakably evil. But she was inquisitive. Looking this way and that way to see if anybody who knew her was watching, she slipped into this terrible place and found a seat at the top of the gallery. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The service began and her interest deepened as she listened to the bright singing and the lively witnessing of recent converts. The evangelist that night was Gipsy Tillie Smith, a sister of the famous <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_%22Gipsy%22_Smith"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Gipsy Rodney Smith</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, who also was a Salvation Army evangelist in those early days. The evangelist preached Christ with great power. The young girl in the gallery yearned to know Him and the power of His cleansing blood to wash away her sins. When the call was made for sinners to come and seek the Savior, Polly made her way from the top gallery to the &ldquo;penitent form.&rdquo; At first she asked to be left alone, as she called to the Lord to forgive her sins. Later, Tillie Smith knelt by her side and led her to a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. When the assurance came that she was forgiven of all her sins, she jumped to her feet, threw her gloves up in the air, and shouted, &ldquo;Hallelujah, it is done!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our Greatheart, then a young man, was in the audience. He watched that young woman pray through to God and he heard her shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; Later he declared, &ldquo;It seemed as if the inspiration of God was upon her from the very first.&rdquo; She was a beautiful girl, and as he looked at her in her simple dress and her shapely early Victorian bonnet, he thought she was lovely. He felt the first time he heard her give her testimony that she belonged to him, and soon there began an intimate friendship between Polly Featherstone and this young man. The new convert was very vivacious and soon began to make large and rapid spiritual strides. Her association with Tillie Smith, and her brother Rodney, and Brother Lawley&mdash;who later became a commissioner in the Salvation Army&mdash;brought her into contact with <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Booth"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">General Booth</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, who gave her a commission in his organization without her having to undergo the usual period of training. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our young Greatheart had been greatly attracted to the Army because of their splendid soul-saving ministry; so he threw himself wholeheartedly into the work of the Salvationists. In it he found an outlet for the consuming passion for the unsaved, and he had a joyous satisfaction in watching the lives of many men and women change by the power of the Gospel. And then Polly&rsquo;s presence in the meetings was a great attraction to him! Her alertness and ability in the indoor services as well as in the open-air meetings appealed to him. The officers of the Salvation Army soon recognized that there was coming a &ldquo;something&rdquo; between these two. It was contrary to Army rules that an officer, for they had made her such, should associate with just an ordinary &ldquo;soldier,&rdquo; as they accounted our Greatheart (although he never actually became a member of the Salvation Army). </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day a major in the Army drove to the home where she was working and asked if she would go with her to Leith in Scotland to help start a new work. She agreed, packed her suitcase, went off to the railway station with the major, and in a few hours she was in Scotland. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In those early days of the Salvation Army the public was very generous in contributions of over-ripe eggs and stale vegetables, and the Salvation Army lassies had to be alert to dodge these missiles. One day Polly received a black eye from an orange that was donated somewhat suddenly. But none of these things moved her. She had a lovely voice and would sing and testify in the open air. Many a window and door in the nearby flats would be flung open to hear the songs and the messages of these fearless young Salvationists. And their labors were not in vain; they were greatly blessed of God in spiritual and social service. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">While in Leith, Polly took a special interest in the well-being of a recent convert who lived on the sixth floor of a tenement house, and whose husband, who was somewhat of a brute, opposed her attendance at the meetings. Finding Polly praying with his wife one day when he returned from his work, he threatened, if she did not stop praying, to forcibly eject her. She continued to pray, and so he picked her up in his arms and carried her down five flights of steps. Every step he took, she prayed, &ldquo;Lord, save this man; save his soul, Lord.&rdquo; The man swore wildly and fumed terribly, but she had the joy of hearing him cry for mercy when he got to the last flight. Together they knelt, and made a &ldquo;penitent form&rdquo; of the bottom step, where she pointed him to the Lamb of God whose blood cleanses from all sin. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day in Leith, she was brought before her superior officers who put to her certain leading questions relative to her attitude about the opposite sex, they assuming that she had an interest in a local &ldquo;soldier.&rdquo; When they could obtain no satisfaction from her they suggested that they all kneel and she should lead in a word of prayer. She began her prayer, &ldquo;Lord, you know that these men think that I am interested in a Scotchman! Lord, you know that I am not; for if what these Scotch folk say about each other is true, they are all so stingy that they would nip a currant in two to save the other half. You know I don&rsquo;t believe that, Lord, about these Scotch folks, for I have found them to be very kind; but you know, Lord, that I do not intend to marry anyone away up here in Scotland.&rdquo; She continued in this vein and by the time she got through, her examiners were ready to close the interview. Polly knew that there was a young man in Bradford who was desperately in love with her, and she loved him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She returned to her work, severing her connection with the Salvation Army and associating with a new and, in the estimation of some people, more spiritual group, who were called the Blue Ribbon Army. Mrs. Elizabeth Baxter, a very spiritual woman, was at the head of it. But she remained a true friend of the Salvation Army, often entertaining their officers. At that time evangelistic calls came from many Methodist churches. The Spirit of God moved mightily on her ministry and many souls were won for Christ. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When Polly was 22 years of age she was married to our Greatheart who was then 23. In later years he paid her this tribute: &ldquo;She became a great help to me in my spiritual life. She was always such an inspiration to holiness. She saw how ignorant I was, and immediately began to teach me to read properly and to write; unfortunately she never succeeded in teaching me to spell.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Speaking concerning his wife, our Greatheart testified: &ldquo;She was a great soul-winner. I encouraged her to continue her ministry of evangelizing, and I continued my business as a plumber. I had a burden for the parts of Bradford that had no church, and we opened up a work in a small building that I rented. As the children came we always prayed through for them before they were born, that they would belong to God. I used to carry the children to meeting and look after them while she preached. I was no preacher myself, but I was always down at the &lsquo;penitent form&rsquo; to lead souls to Christ. Her work was to put down the net, mine to land the fish. The latter is just as important as the former.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have read some biographies, the writers of which have embalmed their heroes very deeply in honey. We read in Proverbs 25:16: &ldquo;Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.&rdquo; We have been so nauseated by this kind of biography that after reading a few chapters we have had no inclination to finish the book. We will endeavor not to serve up too much honey in this book, for the one of whom we write was just as human as the rest of us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There came to Bradford a very severe winter and plumbers were in great demand. It was not only through the winter period but for the two years that followed that they were having to repair fallen spouts and other damage done by the storms. WIgglesworth and the two men who were helping him were kept busy from morning till night. In those days of overmuch business and overmuch prosperity, his attendance at religious services declined, and his heart began to grow cold toward God; but the colder he became, the hotter his wife became for God. Her evangelistic zeal never abated, nor her prayer life. Her quiet, consistent Christian life and witness made his laxity all the more apparent, and it irritated him. One night a climax came. She was a little later than usual in getting home from the service and when she entered the house he remarked: &ldquo;I am the master of this house, and I am not going to have you coming home at so late an hour as this!&rdquo; Polly quietly replied, &ldquo;I know that you are my husband, but Christ is my Master.&rdquo; This annoyed him and he put her out of the back door. But there was one thing he had forgotten to do&mdash;to lock the front door. She went around the house and came in at the front door laughing. She laughed so much that he had to laugh with her; and so that episode was finished. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When some husbands backslide, their wives get sour and nag at them from morning till night, but that was not the way of Polly Wigglesworth. She had a merry heart, and while she was on fire for the Lord, she made every mealtime a season of fun and humor. And she wooed her husband back to the Lord and to his old time love and zeal for God. Her fidelity was severely tested during those months when he was spiritually unsettled, but it was her gracious stability that guided him through the dangerous penod, savmg him from a terrible spiritual shipwreck. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Polly Wigglesworth&rsquo;s reputation as a winner of souls went far and wide, and not infrequently she would be sent to restore a work that was failing and to follow on in evangelistic services where others had failed. She was a popular preacher for women&rsquo;s services and quite a favorite with men&rsquo;s Bible classes. Untiring In zeal, she literally ate up work of all kinds, including the care of a large house. She and her husband were always given to hospitality, and she never complained no matter whom he brought home suddenly for a meal or invited to stay for a few days in their home. At convention times there were always large numbers entertained in her home, but never once did she murmur. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Wigglesworth had to go into Leeds one day each week to purchase plumbing supplies. !n this town he found a place where there was a Divine Healing meeting. There was such a note of reality in those Divine Healing meetings and the Lord was so graciously healing people, that he began to hunt up sIck people in Bradford and he would pay their fare to Leeds, where the prayer of faith was offered for them. At first he said nothing to Mrs. Wigglesworth about this, for he was not sure of her reaction to this &ldquo;fanaticism,&rdquo; as most people dubbed Divine Healing in those days. But she found out what he was doing and since she herself had need of healing she accompanied him one day to Leeds. There the prayer of faith was offered for her and she was healed by the Lord. From that time forward she was as ardent for the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s healing as he was. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The work in Bradford grew, and so they had to move to larger and yet larger premises, until they settled In quite a large building in Bowland Street. In this Bowland Street Mission they had a huge text painted as a scroll on the wall back of the pulpit that everyone could see, &ldquo;I am the Lord that healeth thee.&rdquo; In the course of years many testified to beIng healed through the inspiration of that word of scripture. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There came to this mission a brother who had a gracious ministry of healing. When the Sunday afternoon service was over he was invited to the Wigglesworth home for tea. During the simple meal, Mrs. Wigglesworth put the question to this minister: &ldquo;What would you think of a man who preaches Divine Healing to others, yet he himself uses medical means every day in his life?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;I should say that that man did not fully trust the Lord,&rdquo; was the answer. After the meal Wigglesworth said to this minister: &ldquo;What my wife was talking about one who preached Divine Healing to others and yet used other means himself, she was referring to me. From childhood I have suffered from hemorrhoids or piles and so I deem it necessary to use salts every day. I have looked upon them as harmless, natural means; for I knew that if I did not have something of this kind, I should have bleeding every day, and infection might result. But if you will stand with me in faith, I am willing to trust God in this matter and give up the salts. Since I have taken them every day for years, my system is so used to them that there will be no natural function from now until Wednesday. Will you stand with me in faith on that day? for in the natural I shall have great pain and much bleeding through not having used the salts.&rdquo; The brother agreed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After that Sunday Wigglesworth did not take his daily dose of salts. On Wednesday the crisis came. At a certain hour he went into his bathroom. He anointed himself with oil according to James 5. We have often heard him testify in public, for he was a man of no unwholesome modesty when it came to speaking about perfectly natural things: &ldquo;God undertook. My bowels functioned that day like a baby&rsquo;s. God had perfectly healed me. From that day forward my bowels have functioned perfectly without the use of any means whatsoever. I have proved the God who is enough.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Polly Wigglesworth loved her husband enough to reprove him when he was wrong&mdash;and this was very often. Most husbands bitterly resent any criticism from their wives, but Wigglesworth always took her rebukes with a smile. His attitude was that of David who said, &ldquo;Let the righteous smIte me in kindness and correct me; oil so choice let not my head refuse&rdquo; (Psalm 141:5, Masoretic Rendering). Even though at times he did not take full heed of her correction, yet there is no doubt that as a whole her admonitions had a great effect in the training of her husband&rsquo;s character. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In his plumbing work, Wigglesworth obtained a good deal of profitable business from saloon-keepers, who sent for him to repair the pumps by which they drew up the beer from their cellars. This was an abomination to Polly who in those days kept the books. She knew that the workmen would be given free drinks in the saloons, and she knew it would have a demoralizing effect on them. She prevailed in her protests, and after awhile her husband, to protect the men who were laboring for him, refused all work from saloon-keepers. ThIs meant heavy financial losses to him, but he gave it up as a matter of principle. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read in Psalm 127: &ldquo;Children are a heritage of the Lord.&rdquo; The Lord gave to the Wigglesworth home five children; one girl, Alice; and four boys, Seth, Harold, Ernest, and George. George went to be with the Lord in 1915 and how greatly his loving father missed him. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, March 1, 1941.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Acts 1.8 we read: &ldquo;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, the power of the Holy Ghost! the power that quickens, that reveals, and prevails! I love to think that Jesus wanted all His people to have power, that He wanted all men to be overcomers. Nothing but this power will do it. Power over sin, power over sickness, power over the devil, power over all the powers of the devil! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In order to understand what it means to have power there are two things necessary; one is to have ears to hear and the other is to have hearts to receive. Every born-again saint of God, filled with the Spirit has a real revelation of that truth, &ldquo;Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.&rdquo; I say this with as much audacity as I please. I know evil spirits are in abundance and in multitudes; Jesus cast them out as legion. The believer because of the Spirit that is in him has the power to cast out the evil spirit. It </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">must</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> be so; God wants us to have this power in us; we must be able to destroy Satan&rsquo;s power wherever we go. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day as I came into the house my wife said, &ldquo;Which way did you come?&rdquo; I answered that I had come in by the back way. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you had come in by the front you would have seen a man there in a terrible state. There is a crowd of people around him and he is in terrible straits.&rdquo; Then the door bell rang and she said, &ldquo;There he is again. What shall we do?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Just be still.&rdquo; I rushed to the door and just as I was opening it the Spirit said, &ldquo;This is what I baptized you for.&rdquo; I was very careful then in opening the door, and then I heard the man crying outside, &ldquo;Oh I have committed the unpardonable sin, I am lost, I am lost.&rdquo; I asked him to come in and when he got inside he said again in awful distress, &ldquo;I am lost, I am lost.&rdquo; Then the Spirit came upon me and I commanded the lying spirit to come out of the man in the name of Jesus. Suddenly he lifted up his arms and said, &ldquo;I never did it.&rdquo; The moment the lying spirit was out he was able to speak the truth. I then realized the power in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. It was the Spirit that said, &ldquo;This is what I baptized you for,&rdquo; and I believe we ought to be in the place where we shall always be able to understand the mind of the Spirit amid all the other voices in the world. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After the Holy Ghost has come upon you, you have power. I believe a great mistake is made in these days by people tarrying and tarrying after they have received. After you have received it is, &ldquo;Go ye.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;sit still,&rdquo; but &ldquo;go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel.&rdquo; We shall make serious havoc of the whole thing if we turn back again and crawl into a corner seeking something we already have. I want you to see that God depends on us in these last days. There is no room for anyone to boast and the man who goes about saying, &ldquo;Look at me for I am somebody,&rdquo; is of no value whatever. God is done with that man altogether, He will have a people to glorify </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Him</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. He is doing what He can with what He has, but we are so unwilling to move in the plan of God that He has to grind us many times to get us where He can use us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus was so filled with the Holy Ghost that He stood in the place where He was always ready. He was always in the attitude where He brought victory out of every opportunity. The power of the Holy Spirit is within us but it can be manifested only as we go in obedience to the opportunity before us. I believe if you wait until you think you have power after you have received the Holy Ghost you will never know you have it. Don&rsquo;t you know that the child of God who has the Baptism is inhabited by the Spirit? You will remember one time when they tried to throw Jesus from the brow of the hill, that He pressed through the midst of them and as soon as He got through He healed the man with the blind eyes. Pressing through the crowd which was trying to kill Him, He showed forth His power. Some people might think that Jesus should have run away altogether but He stopped to heal. This thought has comforted me over and over again. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day as I was waiting for a car I stepped into a shoemaker&rsquo;s shop. I had not been there long when I saw a man with a green shade over his eyes, crying pitifully and in great agony. It was heart-rending and the shoemaker told me that the inflammation was burning out his eyes. I jumped up and went to the man and said, &ldquo;You devil, come out of this man in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; Instantly the man said, &ldquo;It is all gone, I can see now.&rdquo; That is the only Scriptural way, to begin to work at once, and preach afterwards. You will find as the days go by that the miracles and healings will be manifested. Because the Master was touched with the feeling of the infirmities of the multitudes they instantly gathered around Him to hear what He had to say concerning the Word of God. However, I would rather see one man saved than ten thousand people healed. If you ask me why, I call to your attention the Word which says, &ldquo;There was a rich man and he fared sumptuously every day.&rdquo; Now we don&rsquo;t hear of this man having any diseases but it says, &ldquo;</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">In hell he</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> lifted up his eyes.&rdquo; We also read that there was a poor man, full of sores and &ldquo;he lifted up his eyes in heaven,&rdquo; so we see that a man can die practically in good health but be lost, and a man can die in disease and be saved; so it is more important to be saved than anything else. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But Jesus was sent to bear the infirmities and the afflictions of the people and to destroy the works of the devil. He said that the thief (which is the devil) cometh to steal and to kill and to destroy, &ldquo;but I am come that ye might have life and have it more abundantly.&rdquo; I maintain that God wishes all His people to have the life more abundant. We have the remedy for all sickness in the Word of God! Jesus paid the full price and the full redemption for every need and where sin abounds, grace can come in and much more abound, and dispel all the sickness. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was traveling from England to Australia I witnessed for Jesus, and it was not long before I had plenty of room to myself. If you want a whole seat to yourself just begin to preach Jesus. However, some people listened and began to be much affected. One of the young men said to me, &ldquo;I have never heard these truths before. You have so moved me that I must have a good conversation with you.&rdquo; The young man told me that his wife was a great believer in Christian Science but was very sick now and although she had tried everything she had been unable to get relief, so was having a doctor. But the doctor gave her no hope whatever and in her dilemma and facing the realities of death she asked that she might have an appointment with me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I got to her I felt it would be unwise to say anything about Christian Science so I said, &ldquo;You are in bad shape.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Yes, they give me no hope.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will not speak to you about anything but will just lay my hands upon you in the Name of Jesus and when I do you will be healed.&rdquo; That woke her up and she began to think seriously. For three days she was lamenting over the things she might have to give up. &ldquo;Will I have to give up the cigarettes?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Will I have to give up the dance?&rdquo; and again I replied &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, we have a little drinking sometimes and then we play cards also. Will I have to give&mdash;?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you will not have to give up anything. Only let us see Jesus.&rdquo; And right then she got such a vision of her crucified Saviour and Jesus was made so real to her that she at once told her friends that she could not play cards any more, could not drink or dance any more, and she said she would have to go back to England to preach against this awful thing, Christian Science. Oh, what a revelation Jesus gave her! Now if I had refused to go when called for, saying that I first had to go to my cabin and pray about it, the Lord might have let that opportunity slip by. After you have received the Holy Ghost you have power; you don&rsquo;t have to wait. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The other day we were going through a very thickly populated part of San Francisco when we noticed a large crowd gathered. I saw it from the window of the car and said I had to get out, which I did. There in the midst was a boy in the agonies of death. As I threw my arms around the boy I asked what the trouble was and he answered that he had cramps. In the name of Jesus I commanded the devils to come out of him and at once he jumped up and not even taking time to thank me, ran off perfectly healed. We are God&rsquo;s own children, quickened by His Spirit and He has given us power over all the powers of darkness; Christ in us the open evidence of eternal glory, Christ in us the Life, the Truth, and the Way. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have a wonderful salvation that fits everybody. I believe that a baptized person has no conception of the power God has given him until he uses what he has. I maintain that Peter and John had no idea of the greatness of the power they had but they began to speculate. They said, &ldquo;Well, as far as money goes, we have none of that, but we do have something; we don&rsquo;t exactly know what it is, but we shall try it on you, In the Name of Jesus of Nazareth, rise up and walk,&rdquo; and it worked. In order to make yourself realize what you have in your possession you will have to try it and I can assure you it will work all right. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said one time to a man that the Acts of the Apostles would never have been written if the Apostles had not acted, and the Holy Spirit is still continuing His acts through us. May God help us to have some acts. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is nothing like Pentecost, and if you have never been baptized you are making a big mistake by waiting. Don&rsquo;t you know that the only purpose for which God saved you was that you might be a saviour of others? and for you to think that you have to remain stationary and just get to heaven is a great mistake. The Baptism is to make you a witness for Jesus. The hardest way is the best way; you never hear anything about the person who is always having an easy time. The preachers always tell of how Moses crossed the Red Sea when he was at wits&rsquo; end. I cannot find the record of anyone in the Scriptures whom God used who was not first tried. So if you never have any trials it is because you are not worth them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants us to have power. When I was traveling in Sweden at a certain station early in the morning a little lady and her daughter got into the train. I saw at once that the lady was in dreadful agony and asked my interpreter to inquire as to the trouble. With tears running down her face she told how her daughter was taking her to the hospital to have her leg amputated. Everything that was possible had been done for her. I told her Jesus could heal. Just then the train stopped and a crowd of people entered until there was hardly standing room, but friends, we never get into a place that is too awkward for God, though it seemed to me that the devil had sent these people in at that time to hinder. However, when the train began to move along I got down, although it was terribly crowded, and putting my hands upon the woman&rsquo;s leg I prayed for her in the name of Jesus. At once she said to her daughter, &ldquo;I am healed. It is all different now; I felt the power go down my leg,&rdquo; and she began to walk about. Then the train stopped at the next station and this woman got out and walked up and down the platform, saying, &ldquo;I am healed. I am healed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus was the </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">first fruits</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and God has chosen us in Christ and has revealed His Son in us that we might manifest Him in power. God gives us power over the devil and when we say the devil we mean everything that is not of God. Some people say we can afford to do without the Baptism with the Spirit but I say we cannot. I believe any person who thinks there is a stop between Calvary and the glory has made a big mistake. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is a great beginning. I think the best word we can say is, &ldquo;Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?&rdquo; The greatest difficulty today with us is to be held in the place where it shall be God only&mdash;it is so easy to get our own mind to work. The working of the Holy Ghost is so different. I believe there is a mind of Christ, and we may be so immersed in the Spirit that we are all the day asking, &ldquo;What wilt Thou have me to do?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This has been a day in the Holy Ghost. The last three months have been the greatest days of my life. I used to think if I could see such and such things worked I should be satisfied; but I have seen greater things than I ever expected to see, and I am more hungry to see greater things yet. The great thing at conventions is to get us so immersed in God that we may see signs and wonders in the name of the Lord Jesus; a place where death has taken place and we are not, for God has taken us. If God has taken hold of us we will be changed by His power and might. You can depend on it. The Ethiopian will be changed. I find God has a plan to turn the world upside down, when we are not. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I have been at my wits&rsquo; end, and have seen God open the door, I have felt I should never doubt God again. I have been taken to another place that is worse still. There is no p!ace for us, and yet a place where God is, where the Holy Ghost is just showing forth and displaying His graces; a place where we will never come out, where we are always immersed in the Spirit, the glory of God being seen upon us. It is wonderful! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a power behind the scenes that moves things. God can work in such a marvelous way. Our Brother Poiman was held up by a strike and couldn&rsquo;t get to Switzerland. Then they sent to Brother Wigglesworth, and I couldn&rsquo;t go; and then they sent again, and that time I couldn&rsquo;t go, but I could say I would go in two months. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe we have yet to learn what it would be with a Pentecostal Church in England that understood truly the work of intercession. I believe God the Holy Ghost wants to teach us that it is not only the people on the p!alform who can move things by prayer. You people, the Lord can move things through you. We have to learn the power of the breath of the Holy Ghost. If I am filled with the Holy Ghost, He will formulate the word that will come into your hearts. The sound of my voice is only by the breath that goes through it. When I was in a little room at Bern waiting for my passport, I found a lot of people, but I couldn&rsquo;t speak to them, so I got hold of three men and pulled them unto me. They stared, but I got them on their knees. Then we prayed, and the revival began. I couldn&rsquo;t talk to them, but I could show them the way to talk to </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Someone</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> else. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God will move upon the people to make them see the glory of God just as it was when Jesus walked in this world, and I believe the Holy Ghost will do special wonders and miracles in these last days. I was taken to see a young woman who was very ill. The young man who showed me the way said, &ldquo;I am afraid we shall not be able to do much here, because of her mother, and the doctors are coming.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;This is what God has brought me here for,&rdquo; and when I prayed the young woman was instantly healed by the power of God. God the Holy Ghost says in our hearts today that it is only He who can do it. After that we got crowds, and I ministered to the sick among them for two hours. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The secret for the future is living and moving in the power of the Holy Ghost. One thing I rejoice in is that there need not be an hour or a moment when I do not know the Holy Ghost is upon me. Oh, this glorious life in God is beyond expression; it is God manifest in the flesh. Oh, this glorious unction of the Holy Ghost&mdash;that we move by the Spirit. He should be our continual life. The Holy Ghost has the last thoughts of anything that God wants to give. Glory to God for the Holy Ghost! We must see that we live in the place where we say, &ldquo;What wilt Thou have me to do?&rdquo; and are in the place where He can work in us to will and to do of His good pleasure. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you; He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also: and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto My Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in My name, I will do it.&rdquo; John 14:12-14. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus is speaking here, and the Spirit of God can take these words of His and make them real to us. &ldquo;He that believeth on Me&hellip; greater works than these shall he do.&rdquo; What a word! Is it true? If you want the truth, where will you get it? &ldquo;Thy word is truth,&rdquo; Christ said to the Father. When you take up God&rsquo;s Word you get the truth. God is not the author of confusion or error, but He sends forth His light and truth to lead us into His holy habitation, where we receive a revelation of the truth like unto the noon day in all its clearness. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Word of God works effectually in us as we believe it. It changes us and brings us into new fellowship with the Father, with the Son, and with the Holy Spirit, into a holy communion, into an unwavering faith, into a mighty assurance, and it will make us partakers of the very nature and likeness of God as we receive His great and exceeding precious promises and believe them. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. Faith is the operative power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read that Christ opened the understanding of His disciples, and He will open up our understanding and our hearts and will show us wonderful things that we should never know but for the mighty revelation and enlightenment of the Spirit that He gives to us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I do not know of any greater words than those found in Romans 4:16, &ldquo;Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace.&rdquo; Grace is God&rsquo;s benediction coming right down to you, and when you open the door to Him&mdash;that is an act of faith&mdash;He does all you want and will fulfill all your desires. &ldquo;It is of faith, that it might be by grace.&rdquo; You open the way for God to work as you believe His Word, and God will come in and supply your every need all along the way. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our Lord Jesus said to His disciples and He says to us in this passage in the 14th of John, &ldquo;You have seen Me work and you know how I work. You shall do the very same things that I am doing, and greater things shall you do, because I am going to the Father, and as you make petition in My name I will work. I will do what you ask, and by this the Father shall be glorified.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Did any one ever work as He did? I do not mean His carpentering. I refer to His work in the hearts of the people. He drew them to Him. They came with their needs, with their sicknesses, with their oppression, and He relieved them all. This royal Visitor, who came from the Father to express His love, talked to men, spent time with them in their homes, found out their every need. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed of the devil, and He said to them and He says to us, &ldquo;You see what I have been doing, healing the sick, relieving the oppressed, casting out demons. The works that I do shall ye do also.&rdquo; Dare you believe? Will you take up the work that He left and carry it on? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;He that believeth on Me!&rdquo; What is this? What does it mean? How can just believing bring these things to pass? What virtue is there in it? There is virtue in these words because He declares them. If we will receive this word and declare it, the greater works shall be accomplished. This is a positive declaration of His, &ldquo;He that believeth on Me, greater works than these shall he do,&rdquo; but unbelief has hindered our progress in the realm of the spiritual. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Put away unbelief. Open your heart to God&rsquo;s grace. Then God will come in and place in you a definite faith. He wants to remove every obstruction that is in the world before you. By His grace He will enable you to be so established in His truth, so strong in the Lord and in the power of His might, that whatever comes across your path to obstruct you, you can arise in divine power and rebuke and destroy it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is a matter of definite and clear understanding between us and God. To recognize that Christ has a life force to put into us, changes everything that we dare to </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> it will change. He that believes that Jesus is the Christ overcomes the world. Because we believe that Jesus is the Christ, the essence of divine life is in us by faith and causes a perfect separation between us and the world. We have no room for sin. It is a joyful thing for us to be doing that which is right. He will cause that abundance of grace to so flow into our hearts that sin shall not have dominion over us. Sin shall not have dominion; nor sickness, nor affliction. &ldquo;He that believeth&rdquo;&mdash;he that dares to believe&mdash;he that dares to trust&mdash;will see victory over every oppression of the enemy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A needy creature came to me in a meeting, all withered and wasted. He had no hope. There was absolute death in his eyes. He was so helpless he had to have some one on each side to bear him up. He came to me and said in a whisper, &ldquo;Can you help me?&rdquo; Will Jesus answer? &ldquo;He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these&hellip;. Behold, I give you power&hellip; over all the power of the enemy.&rdquo; These are the words of our Lord Jesus. It is not our word but the word of the Lord, and as this word is in us He can make it like a burning passion in us. We make the Word of God as we believe it our own. We receive the Word and we have the very life of Christ in us. We become supernatural by the power of God. We find this power working through every part of our being. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now Christ gives us something besides faith. He gives us something to make faith effectual. Whatsoever you desire, if you believe in your heart you shall have. Christ said, &ldquo;Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">he shall have whatsoever he saith.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&rdquo; Mark 11:22-24. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Whatsoever he saith!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Dare to say in faith and it shall be done. These things have been promised by Christ and He does not lie. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This afflicted man stood before me helpless and withered. He had had cancer in his stomach. The physicians had operated upon him to take away the cancer from the stomach, but complications had arisen with the result that no food could enter the man&rsquo;s stomach. He could not swallow anything. So in order to keep him alive they made a hole in his stomach and put in a tube about nine inches long with a cup at the top, and he was fed with liquid through this tube. For three months he had been just kept alive but was like a skeleton. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What was I to say to him? &ldquo;If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here was the word of Christ, &ldquo;He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto My Father.&rdquo; The Word of God is truth. Christ is with the Father and grants us our requests, and makes these things manifest, if we believe. What should I do in the presence of a case like this? </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;Believe the Word.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> So I believed the Word which says, &ldquo;He shall have whatsoever he saith.&rdquo; Mark 11:23. I said, &ldquo;Go home, and have a good supper.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I cannot swallow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go home, and have a good supper,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;On the authority of the Word of God I say it. Christ says that he that believes that these things which he says shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he says. So I say, Go home in the name of Jesus, and have a good supper.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He went home. Supper was prepared. Many times he had had food in his mouth but had always been forced to spit it out again. But I dared to believe that he would be able to swallow that night. So that man filled his mouth full as he had done before, and because some one dared to believe God&rsquo;s Word and said to him, &ldquo;You shall have a good supper in the name of Jesus,&rdquo; when he chewed his food it went down in the normal way into his stomach, and he ate until he was quite satisfied. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He and his family went to bed filled with joy. The next morning when they arose they were filled with the same joy. Life had begun again. Naturally he looked down to see the hole that had been made in his stomach by the physicians. But God knew that he did not want two holes, and so when God opened the normal passage He closed the other hole in his stomach. This is the kind of God we have all ihe time, a God who knows, a God who acts, and brings things to pass when we believe. Dare to believe, and then dare to speak, and you shall have whatsoever you say if you doubt not. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A woman came to me one night and inquired, &ldquo;Can I hear again? Is it possible for me to hear again? I have had several operations and the drums of my ears have been taken away.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If God has not forgotten how to make drums for ears you can hear again.&rdquo; Do you think God has forgotten? What does God forget? He forgets our sins, when we are forgiven, but He has not forgotten how to make drums for ears. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Not long ago the power of God was very much upon a meeting that I was holding. I was telling the people that they could be healed without my going to them. If they would rise up I would pray and the Lord would heal. There was a man who put up his hand. I said, &ldquo;Cannot that man rise?&rdquo; The folks near him said he could not, and lifted him hp. The Lord healed him, the ribs that were broken were knit together again and were healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There was such faith in the place that a little girl cried out, &ldquo;Please, gentleman, come to me.&rdquo; You could not see her, she was so small. The mother said, &ldquo;My little girl wants you to come.&rdquo; So I went down there to this child, who although fourteen years of age was very small. She said with tears streaming down her face, &ldquo;Will you pray for me?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Dare you believe?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;O yes.&rdquo; I prayed and placed my hands on her head in the name of Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am being healed. Take these things off&mdash;take them all off.&rdquo; The mother loosed straps and bands and then the child said, &ldquo;Mother, I am sure I am healed. Take these off.&rdquo; She had straps on her legs and an iron on her foot about 3&frac12; inches deep:, She asked her mother to unstrap her. Her mother took off the straps. There were not many people with dry eyes as they saw that girl walk about with legs just as normal as when she was born. God healed her right away. What did it? She had cried, &ldquo;Please, gentleman, come to me,&rdquo; and her longing was coupled with faith. May the Lord help us to be just like a simple child. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has hidden these things from the wise and prudent, but He reveals them to babes. There is something in childlike faith in God that makes us dare to believe, and then to act. Whatever there is in your life that is bound, the name of Jesus and the power of that name will break it if you will only believe. Christ says, &ldquo;If ye shall ask any thing in My name, I will do it.&rdquo; God will be glorified in Christ when you receive the overflowing life that comes from Christ in response to your faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Dare to believe.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Do you think that truth is put into the Word to mock you? Don&rsquo;t you see that God really means that you should live in the world to relieve the oppression of the world? God answers us that we shall be quickened, be molded afresh, that the Word of God shall change everything that needs to be changed, both in us and in others, as we dare to believe and as we command things to be done. &ldquo;Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">he shall have whatsoever he saith.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Luke 10:19-22. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is more important our unity with Jesus than anything else. When our hearts are in perfect tune then we can have confidence before God. It is more important than casting out evil spirits, but it brings the casting-out of evil spirits. Greater is He that is in you than the power of Satan. Jesus said, &ldquo;I will give you power,&rdquo; etc. That is the fact we have to deal with this afternoon. Only in the authority of the Name of Jesus. The authority of the name of Jesus is in fellowship and co-operation with Him. &ldquo;If we know that He heareth us,&rdquo; etc. God would have us in the place continually, where we know He heareth us. &ldquo;I will give you power to cast out the evil spirits.&rdquo; I was asked to visit a man in an asylum, a slave to intemperance and nicotine. The evil power would not allow an introduction to this man. God gave authority over the power of evil, a broken spirit was given, and he was crying out for salvation. In three days he was out of that place. In the Name: of Jesus we dealt with the two evil powers&mdash;the hardest thing in life was to do without tobacco&mdash;the mighty power of God came over him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Praying Yorkshire folk.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We have people in Bradford that can carry you right through into heaven. and it is due to their prayers that before I got to Switzerland the Revival was on the spring. Oh, the preciousness of my Lord and the adaptability the Holy Spirit gives to a child of God. I saw hundreds healed by the power of God, and I give testimony in the face of Jesus. We go away from these meetings to act in the power of the Holy Ghost. A woman in Paris suffered from epileptic fits for 23 years and could not go out alone. She was healed and can now go out alone. The mother, too, was healed because of the testimony of her daughter. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Romans 10:5. We know the Baptism in the Holy Ghost gives all we need. A young man, 27 years of age, was dumb. He came to a meeting sneering and laughing, and got so near to see what was going on. I thought he was seeking, and put my hands on him. The power of God went through him. I said to him, &ldquo;Shout, shout, shout!&rdquo; and the people called out to him in his language, &ldquo;Shout!&rdquo; and for the first time in his life he began to shout. God gave him his speech. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Police in Switzerland.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There were more people night after night seeking healing than there are attending this Convention. We were working until midnight. So many people were healed that two policemen were sent to apprehend me. They said I was doing it without credentials. The police wanted to see a wicked woman who had been healed of a rupture, and was the means of bringing others to be healed. When they heard this they said they wished all preachers did the same. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Scores of awful sinners were healed. A whole family (all wicked) was saved through being healed. Jesus is glorious. Surely He is the most lovely of all. Truly He was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. That Name manifests life as truly as ever it did. There was a woman with an awful face (nose). I felt an awful sensation, as I do when I see cancer. I rebuked the disease in the Name of Jesus. The next night I forgot about the woman. She came to the meeting and when I saw her I said, &ldquo;Oh, God! Oh, God!&rdquo; The same nose shone like glass, and all the skin was new. Our God is a God of love. Who can describe His majesty and glory. Well might the poet say, &ldquo;Crown Him with many crowns.&rdquo; We must do it. We must do it. There was a man with an incurable disease. The moment hands were laid on him he was perfectly healed, after 34 years of suffering from the work of Satan. When Peter&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother was sick with the fever, Jesus rebuked the fever. The fever could hear. All fevers are evil spirits. Jesus was manifested to destroy them. Where is Jesus? When we are born again we are born of the Word of God&mdash;Christ in you. Resist the devil and he will flee. Rebuke him in the Name of Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Healed and saved.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The presence of God was so manifested there. A man on the railway was healed of a disease of 22 years standing. There was a wicked man healed. He was so broken in spirit that we had to break up the meeting till he got saved. He was going to tell everybody how he was saved. I tell you, there is something in healing. Like the man at the beautiful gate, when the people saw him leaping and praising God 5,000 were saved. God forbid we shouid glory in anything less than putting Him before anyone. I was taken to a place to see a girl whose bowels, the doctor said,. were completely done. No one couid do anything for her. She felt an inward power. Immediately hands were laid upon her. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one meeting there were 1,000 people so anxious to hear the Word of God and of healing. God only knows how I have longed to see people saved, and God showed me in spirit He would save. People put up their hands all over the place, as they wanted to be saved. Oh, to see how they flocked out. God is the same God. When the love of God came they were neither Swiss nor English. When I toid tbem about the needs of China they asked if they couldn&rsquo;t give money. At the first collection they gave &pound;100. This is what the German-Swiss did for England to send our missionaries. The work is enlarging. I brought &pound;300 to England for foreign missions&mdash;&pound;200 given to the P.M.U., and &pound;100 to the Congo. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A woman came to be healed of a cancer. How it did smell&mdash;but God healed. The husband got saved and the whole family. I believe there is a crown, but it will have to be fought for. There was a young woman vomiting blood. God awakened me in the middle of the night, and in the Name of Jesus commanded the demon power to come out, and she was immediately healed. It is the precious name of Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">At Zurich.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> At Zurich it was just the same. God worked special miracles and wonders. The Holy Ghost is different to everyone else. &ldquo;The anointing ye have received abideth.&rdquo; There was a man with a disease you could not look at. I praise God for what Jesus does. In ten minutes he was made whole. The man sat up in bed and said, &ldquo;I know I am healed.&rdquo; The doctor was announced. He was amazed, and said to the man&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Your husband is whole. Whatever has happened? I shall come no more.&rdquo; He had been attending his patient three times a day. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A little boy four years of age was very ill. The doctor who had been attending him for several days said there was something amiss with his brain. The Lord showed me the mischief was in the stomach, so I laid hands on the child&rsquo;s stomach. A few hours later a worm, fifteen inches long, came out of his mouth, and the boy was whole. Does God know? Hebrews 4:12-13. The discernment of God goes to every part of you&mdash;neither is there any creature not manifest in His sight. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Ireland a woman had her thigh broken in two places. She lay in bed and could just reach the mantel-piece. When I laid hands on her she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going right down.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is going right down?&rdquo; &ldquo;The power of God.&rdquo; And in His strength she arose. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The year 1859 is known as that of the great Irish revival. Two years previously, a mighty awakening had come to the United States. Prayer meetings had been held in every large city, and were attended by thousands of people. As men called on God, the Spirit of the Lord mightily worked, and it was estimated that every month 50,000 souls passed from death unto life. The news of the revival of 1857 in the USA and of the revival of 1859 in Ireland, set the people of Britain to praying. Soon revival fires began to burn throughout that country. C.H. Spurgeon preached to vast throngs in London and at every service many received Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Wales, Christmas Evans was engaged in a wonderful evangelistic ministry. His converts became so exuberantly happy that they would dance for joy in his meetings, and Evans would not restrain them. Because of this, scores of sinners sought Christ in order to receive the same &ldquo;joy unspeakable.&rdquo; At the same time, the hearts of many who were attending the Wesleyan Methodist churches throughout Great Britain were &ldquo;strangely warmed.&rdquo; One of their evangelists, William Booth, was singularly used. In 1859 he broke with the Wesleyan church to give himself entirely to the work of evangelism and was led to choose the slums of the east end of London as his first place of ministry. The worst of sinners were transformed into the greatest of saints and went preaching the Gospel throughout the land. Booth later founded the Salvation Army. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was in this revival year of 1859, in a humble shack in Menston, in Yorkshire, England, that Smith Wigglesworth was born. One day when he was holding a meeting in Riverside, California, we said to him, &ldquo;Tell us your story.&rdquo; He related to us the following: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My father was very poor and worked long hours for little pay in order to support mother and us three boys and one girl. I can remember one cold frosty day when my father had been given the job of digging a ditch seven yards long and a yard deep, and filling it up again, for the sum of three shillings and sixpence. My mother said that if he would only wait a bit, it might thaw and his task would be easier. But he needed that money for food, for there was none in the house. So he set to work with a pickaxe. The frost was deep, but underneath the hard ground was some soft wet clay. As he threw up some of this, a robin suddenly appeared, picked up a worm, ate it, flew to a branch of a nearby tree, and from there sent out a song of joyous praise. Up to now, father had been very despondent, but he was so entranced by the robin&rsquo;s lovely song of thanksgiving that he took fresh courage and began to dig with renewed vigor&mdash;saying to himself, &ldquo;If that robin can sing like that for a worm, surely I can work like a father for my good wife and my four fine children!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was 6 years of age, I got work in the field, pulling and cleaning turnips, and I can remember how sore my tiny hands became pulling turnips from morning until night. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At 7 years of age, my older brother and I went to work in a woolen mill. My father obtained employment in the same mill as a weaver. Things were easier in our house from that time on, and food became more plentiful. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My father was a great lover of birds and at one time he had 16 songbirds in our home. Like my father I had a great love for birds and at every opportunity I would be out looking for their nests. I always knew where there were some 80 or 90 of them. One time I found a nest full of fledglings, and thinking they were abandoned, I adopted them, taking them home and making a place for them in my bedroom. Somehow the parent birds discovered them and would fly in through the open window and feed their young ones. One time I had both a thrush and a lark feeding their young ones in my room. My brothers and I would catch some songbirds by means of birdlime, bring them home, and later sell them in the market. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My mother was very industrious with her needle and made all our clothes, chiefly from old garments that had been given to her. I usually wore an overcoat with sleeves three or four inches too long, which was very comfortable in cold weather. I cannot forget those long winger nights and mornings, having to get out of bed at five o&rsquo;clock to snatch a quick meal and then walk two miles to be at work by six. We had to work 12 hours each day, and I often said to my father, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time from six until six in the mill.&rdquo; I can remember the tears in his eyes as he said, &ldquo;Well, six o&rsquo;clock will always come.&rdquo; Sometimes it seemed like a month coming. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I can never recollect a time when I did not long for God. Even though neither father nor mother knew God, I was always seeking Him. I would often kneel down in the field and ask Him to help me. I would ask Him especially to enable me to find where the bird-nests were, and after I had prayed I seemed to have an instinct to know exactly where to look. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One time I walked to work in a great thunderstorm. It seemed that for half an hour I was enveloped with fire as the thunders rolled and the lightnings flashed. Young as I was, my heart was crying to God for His perseverance, and He wrapped me in His gracious presence. Though all the way I was surrounded with lightning and I was drenched to the skin, I knew no fear&mdash;I only sensed that I was being shielded by the power of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My grandmother was an old-time Wesleyan Methodist and would take me to the meetings she attended. When I was 8 years of age there was a revival meeting held in her church. I can remember one Sunday morning at seven o&rsquo;clock when all those simple folks were dancing around a big stove in the center of the church, clapping their hands and singing, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, the Lamb, the bleeding Lamb, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lamb of Calvary, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lamb that was slain, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That liveth again </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">To intercede for me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I clapped my hands and sang with them, a clear knowledge of the New Birth came into my soul. I looked to the Lamb of Calvary. I believed that He loved me and had died for me. Life came in&mdash;eternal life&mdash;and I knew that I had received a new life which had come from God. I was born again. I saw that God wants us so badly that He has made the condition as simple as He possibly could&mdash;</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;Only believe.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> That experience was real and I have never doubted my salvation since that day. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But I had no words. The longer I lived the more I thought, but the less language I had to express my thoughts. In this respect I resembled my mother. She would begin to tell a story, but what she said was so unintelligible that father would have to interrupt, saying, &ldquo;Nay, mother, you&rsquo;ll have to begin again!&rdquo; She just could not express herself. I was the same. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But I delighted in going to meetings, especially those in which everyone was giving a testimony. I would arise to give mine, but would have no language to convey what I felt in the depths of my soul. Invariably I would burst out crying. One memorable day three old men, whom I knew very intimately, came across to where I was weeping, unable to speak. They laid their hands on me. The Spirit of the Lord came upon me and I was instantly set free from my bondage. I not only believed, but I could also speak. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">From the time of my conversion I became a soul-winner, and the first person I won for Christ was my own dear mother. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was 9 years of age I was tall, and so I got full-time work in the mill. Schooling was not compulsory in those days, and so I was robbed of an education. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Father wanted all of us to go to the Episcopal church. He had no desire to go himself, but he liked the parson, because they met at the same pub and drank beer together. My brother and I were in the choir in this church, and although I could not read I soon learned the tunes of the hymns and chants. When most of the boys in the choir were 12 years of age they had to be confirmed by the bishop. I was not 12, but between 9 and 10, when the bishop laid his hands on me. I can remember that as he imposed his hands I had a similar experience to the one I had 40 years later when I was baptized in the Holy Spirit. My whole body was filled with the consciousness of God&rsquo;s presence, a consciousness that remained with me for days. After the confirmation service all the other boys were swearing and quarreling, and I wondered what had made the difference between them and me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was 13, we moved to Bradford. There I went to the Wesleyan Methodist church and began to enter into a deeper spiritual life. I was very keen for God. This church was having some special missionary meetings and they chose seven boys to speak. I was one of the seven chosen, and I had three weeks in which to get ready for a 15-minute talk. For three weeks I lived in prayer. I remember that as I began there were such loud Amens and shoutings. I do not recollect what I said, but I know I was possessed with a mighty zeal, a burning desire to get people to know my Savior. At that time I was always getting in touch with boys and talking to them about salvation. I had many rebuffs and rebukes. I wanted to share the great joy I had, but so many did not seem too eager to listen to me, and that was a great mystery to me. I suppose I was not very tactful. I always carried a Testament with me even though I was not able to read much. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was 16 years of age the Salvation Army opened up a work in Bradford. I delighted to be with these earnest Salvation Army people. It was laid very deeply upon me to fast and pray for the salvation of souls in those days, and every week we saw scores of sinners yielding their hearts to Christ. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the mill where I worked there was a godly man belonging to the Plymouth Brethren. He was a steam-fitter. I was given to him as a helper and he taught me how to do plumbing work. He talked to me about water baptism and its meaning. I can remember that he said to me, &ldquo;If you will obey the Lord in this, you do not know what He may have for you.&rdquo; I gladly obeyed the Word of the Lord to be buried with Him in baptism unto death and come forth from the symbolic watery grave to a newness of life in God. I was about 17 at that time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was this good man who taught me about the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus. Again and again when I had a sense that I had failed God, I would be troubled with the thought that the Lord would come and I would not be ready to meet Him. From time to time it was a relief to me to go to work and find this godly man there. Then I knew the Lord had not come in the night and left me behind. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I continued with the Salvation Army because it seemed to me they had more power in their ministry than anybody else at the time. We used to have all nights of prayer. Many would be laid out under the power of the Spirit, sometimes for as long as 24 hours at a time. We called that the Baptism in the Spirit in those days. Those early Salvationists had great power and it was manifested in their testimony and in their lives. We would join together and claim in faith 50 or 100 souls every week and know that we would get them. Alas, today many are not laying themselves out for soul-winning but for fleshly manifestations. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I looked for the Lord, and He surely helped me in everything. When I was 18 years of age, I went to a plumber to ask for employment. I cleaned up my shoes with an extra shine, put on a clean collar, and applied at the home of this man. He said, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t need anyone.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Thank you, Sir. I am sorry.&rdquo; The man let me walk down to his gate and then called me back, saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about you that is different. I just can&rsquo;t let you go.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He sent me to do a job fitting a row of homes with water piping, which I finished in a week. The master was so amazed that he said, &ldquo;It cannot possibly be done!&rdquo; but he went and found the work perfect. He said he could not keep me employed at that speed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was 20 years of age, I moved to Liverpool, and the power of God was mightily upon me. I had a great desire to help the young people. Every week I used to gather around me scores of boys and girls, barefooted, ragged, and hungry. I earned good money, but I spent all of it on food for those children. They would congregate in the sheds in the docks, and what meetings we had! Hundreds of them were saved. A friend of mine and I devoted ourselves to visiting the hospitals and also the ships. God gave me a great heart for the poor. I used to work hard and spend all I had on the poor and have nothing for myself. I fasted all day every Sunday and prayed, and I never remember seeing less than 50 souls saved by the power of God in the meetings with the children, in the hospitals, on the ships, and in the Salvation Army. These were the days of great soul awakening. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At the Salvation Army meetings the officer in charge would constantly ask me to speak. I cannot tell why he should ask me, for my speech was always broken, weeping before the people. I could not hold back the tears. I would have given a world to be able to speak in a more eloquent way; but like Jeremiah I was a man with a fountain of tears. But as I wept before the people, this would often lead to an altar call. I thank God for those days because the Lord kept me in a broken, contrite spirit. The memory of those Liverpool days is very precious to me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was about 23 years of age, I was led to go back to Bradford, and I was strongly led to open up a business for myself as a plumber and give my spare time to helping the Salvation Army. It was there I met the best girl in the world! </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Recently the office of the Missionary Treasurer was visited by an evangelist of international note, a man who has been especially honored of God in praying for the sick. Real miracles of healing have followed him wherever he has gone. We had not talked with him long until we discovered the secret of his power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This man of God is not reaching out after things for himself, but he has put God first in everything. The work of the Lord is the chief concern of his life. He is tremendouslv concerned that the Gospel be given to as many as possible before the Lord comes. He stated to us, &ldquo;I am not concerned about myself, for the Lord will take care of me. But I will not consent to hold a campaign unless I am given the privilege of taking a missionary offering. God has given me a ministry of faith and I must use it for the glory of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some evangelists seem to think that missions and evangelism do not go well together. They seem to feel that unless every effort is made to raise money for the expenses of the meeting that they will not be met and the campaign will be a financial failure. But here is an evangelist who has proven that when Missions are put to the front, God takes care of the running expenses of the campaign and his own needs as well. It has been a real inspiration to meet such a man. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The evangelist referred to is Smith Wigglesworth, who is just now opening a campaign in the Convention Hall, in cooperation with the Assembly of God at Springfield, Mo. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">From the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April 21, 1928.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.&rdquo; Acts 26:19. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to speak of Pentecost and the fullness of the Spirit, and of what God is able to do with any man who is yielded to Him. We need to kindle in one another a holier zeal than we have ever possessed before. No man can meet the need of to-day but the man filled with God. God has promised to fill us. You may be filled with the mighty power of God, and yet in a way not realize it; be used by a power apart from yourself, a power that keeps you from self-exbihition. Just as the sun by its mighty power brings certain resources to nature, so I believe the power of God in the human soul is capable, as we exercise living faith, of bringing about things which otherwise could never he accomplished. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Paul&rsquo;s conversion.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you will read the twenty-sixth chapter of Acts you will see Paul testifying to his conversion, to the commission given him to go to the Gentiles to turn them from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, and to the fact that he &ldquo;was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.&rdquo; In Acts 9, we read that for three days after this vision Paul was blind. I believe that in those days he was brought to a state of broken-heartedness. And then God had him. It is a wonderful thing when God gets you. You are not much good for anything until God gets you. When God gets you, you are loosened, you are free, but you act only as He wills for you to act. And when you act only for Him and are living in the Spirit, some things that are worth while will be accomplished all the time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe that in those three days Paul was brought to a place of weeping, contrition, heart-meltedness, yieldedness. It is when we are brought to a place of real repentance, of broken-heartedness, of contrition, that it is possible for God&rsquo;s likeness to be stamped on us. It is then that the water of life begins to fill us, and as we are open to the floods of the Spirit which come in the Baptism in the Holy Ghost, we will find that the Holy Ghost will not only fertilize our own life but rivers of life will flow from us, rivers that will touch many others. No one can tell what a river can do when it is set flowing by God. The ever deepening river that Ezekiel speaks of, brought abundance of life everywhere it flowed. So it is with the life in the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Many opportunities.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> A life in the Holy Ghost is one of selflessness. You will remember that our Lord Jesus after He was filled with the Spirit refused to make bread for Himself at the suggestion of Satan, but we find that He reached a place where He could make bread for thousands. And when I come to the place where I refuse to live for my own selfish interests, then God will do something for me, and by His grace, I will gladly do anything for Him that He may desire me to do. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In his helplessness and brokenness, Paul cried: &ldquo;Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?&rdquo; That cry reached to heaven, and as a result there came to him a holy man touched with the same fire and zeal that filled his Master and he laid his hands upon Paul and said, &ldquo;Receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; And with that word of power a celestial glory came into the life of Paul. That was for Paul the beginning of a life in the Holy Ghost. It is evident from Paul&rsquo;s testimony that God gave him a vision, a vision to which he was not disobedient. There should always be a vision in the Baptism in the Spirit. Be sure and get the vision of God&rsquo;s plan and purpose for your life. But visions are no good except we make them real, except we claim them as they come and make them our own, and the purpose of our life is to carry out what the Spirit reveals by vision. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many people lack the power because they do not keep the vision, because they do not allow the fire which has come, to continue to burn. There must be a continuous burning on the altar. Holy Ghost power in a man is meant to be an increasing force, an enlargement. When Ezekiel saw the vision of the river that came out from the threshold under the altar, that river did not grow smaller and smaller, but larger and larger. That is God&rsquo;s plan always. God has never anything of a diminishing type. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Changed into another man.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord took particular care of Paul and did not rush him through the business. He gave him time to study the Word. He gave him time to get a revelation of His wonderful grace. There are some people who think that everything ought to be done in a tremendous hurry. With God it is not so. God takes plenty of time, and He has a wonderful way of developing things as He goes along. Trust Him as He takes time to work in you to will and to do His own pleasure. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man baptized in the Holy Ghost is no longer a natural man; he is transformed by the Spirit and changed into another man. Joshua and Caleb as they were filled with faith, were different from all the men around them, and so they encouraged all the others by saying, &ldquo;God who has taken us into the land and let us see it, will surely give us the land.&rdquo; They had got the vision of God&rsquo;s plan and purpose and they were true to the vision. Is God the Holy Ghost arranging things for you, or, are you arranging things according to your own plan? Catch the heavenly vision and enter into a place of rest where you can stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Reliance on God.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> A man who is dependent upon the Holy Ghost ceases from confidence in his own ability. He will rely only upon the omnipotent power of the Most High. The man who lives in the Spirit will always keep in touch with his Master, in the passing crowds or wherever he may be. He should have no room for anything that steps lower than the unction that was on his Master, or for anything that hinders him from being about his Master&rsquo;s business. If you are filled with the Holy Ghost you will long for the spiritual food that you find in the Word of God and you will have no resources but those that are heavenly. You have been &ldquo;planted&rdquo; with Christ and have &ldquo;risen with Him,&rdquo; and you are &ldquo;seated with Him in heavenly places&rdquo;; your language is the heavenly language, your source of inspiration is the will of the Lord; God is enthroned in your whole life and you see things from above and not from below. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The revelation of Jesus to my soul by the Holy Ghost brings me to the place where I am willing, if need be, to die on what the Word says. The three Hebrew children said to the king, &ldquo;We are not careful to awwer thee in this matter,&rdquo; and when a man of God is quickened by the Spirit, he does not fear the threatenings of men. The furnace seven times heated is of no consequence to the man who has heard the voice of God; the lions&rsquo; den has no terrors for the man who opens his windows and talks to the Father. The people who live in the unction of the Spirit are taken out of the world in the sense that they are kept in the the world without being defiled by the evil of the world. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">A life of revelation.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord said to Paul, &ldquo;I have appeared to thee to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee.&rdquo; Paul was given the vision as far as he could take it in, then the Lord said, &ldquo;There are other things in which I shall again appear unto thee.&rdquo; Did He ever appear unto Paul after that? Certainly He did. At a later date Paul said, &ldquo;When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&rsquo;s womb, and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.&rdquo; There is no man who can be clothed with the Spirit and catch the fire and zeal of the Master every day and many times a day, without ceasing in every way to be connected with the &ldquo;arm of flesh&rdquo; which would draw him aside from the power of God. Many men have lost the glory because they have been taken up with the natural. If we are going to accomplish in the Spirit the things that God has purposed for us, we must never turn again to the flesh. If we are Spirit-filled, God has brought us into relationship with Himself, and now He is all in all to us. Nehemiah stood before the king, and when the king, seeing his countenance sad, said to him, &ldquo;For what dost thou make request?&rdquo; he immediately communed with the God of heaven. If we keep in continuous communion with the Lord of heaven we should be ready for every emergency. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Eager for the vision.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When Paul was preaching to the saints in Troas (Acts 20) the holy, radiant glory that was filling Paul&rsquo;s soul was so great that the people became eager for it, so that until midnight they drank in at the fountain of his life, and as the rivers of water were pouring forth from him a young man fell down from the third loft. Paul went down and embraced him and the life of the Lord given to Paul was imparted to the young man and he was brought back to life. There was always an equipment for every emergency, a blessed, holy equipment given by God. It is wonderful to think that we, too, can be partakers of the divine nature just as Paul was and can enter into the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ even as he did, for the same Holy Ghost that was imparted to Paul, our Lord is willing to impart to us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Fellowship with Jesus.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was a necessity that Jesus live with His disciples for three years and walk in and out among them and show forth His glory from day to day. The Lord had continually day by day to bring Himself into their vision, into their mind, into their very nature. He had to press Himself into their life, to make them a success after He had ascended to heaven. He had to show them how wonderfully and gracefully and peacefully He could move the crowds. He had to bring Himself so into the minds and hearts of the disciples as to convince them that He was really and truly the Son of God. They could never accomplish what they had to accomplish until he had proved that to them. They could only manifest Him to others when He had imparted His life into the very core of their nature. He told them that it was expedient that He go away. After His death and resurrection the Holy Spirit would come and He Himself would come unto them and manifest His life and power through them. Just as He was clothed with the Spirit Himself, He wanted them to be clothed with the Spirit. And there was a wonderful continuance of His ministry through these yielded men when they were filled with the Spirit. And to-day there will be a mighty continuance of the glorious ministry of our risen Lord through men and women filled with the Spirit who refuse to live for their own purposes and plans, who are eager to fulfill the vision given them by our ascended Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">What is the baptism?</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Some people have a wrong notion concerning the Baptism in the Holy Ghost. The Baptism is nothing less than the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity coming down from the Glory, the Executive Spirit of the Triune God, indwelling your body, revealing the truth to you, causing your bowels to yearn with compassion for the lost, just as Jesus yearned, to travail as He travailed, to mourn as He mourned, to groan as He groaned. Oh, that God might bring from our hearts the cry for a deluge of the Spirit so that we may be prepared for Him to fulfill all His purposes in us and for us. What a blessing it is when you are at wits-end corner to be able to throw yourself on the omnipotent power of God, and what a wonderful transformation He can bring in a tnoment. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Last week I went into a house where they were very much distressed. A young woman was there who, they told me, had not been able to drink for six years. Her body had gone down, but the Lord had inspired her with faith and she said to her father, &ldquo;O Father, I ought to have relief to-day. Somehow I feel this whole trouble ought to go to-day.&rdquo; I knew what it was. It was a demon in the throat. I believe that the devil is at the bottom of practically every evil in human lives. It was a serious thing to see that beautiful young woman, who, because of this one thing in her life, was so disorganized in her mind and body. I knew it was the power of Satan. How did I know? Because it attacked her at a vital point, and the thing had preyed on her mind and she was filled with fear so that she said, &ldquo;I dare not drink, for if I do I shall choke.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Deliverance to the captives.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I asked the father and mother to go out of the room and then I said to the young woman, &ldquo;You will be free and drink as much as you want when I have done with you if you will only believe. As sure as you are there you will drink as much as you want.&rdquo; I said further, &ldquo;Our brethren are going out in the streets to preach to-night and I shall be among them, and in our preaching we will say definitely, &lsquo;Every one that will believe on the Lord Jesus Christ can be saved.&rsquo; We will also tell them that everyone that believes can be healed. The Word of God shows us plainly that the Son of God bore our sins and our sicknesses at Calvary. They will emphasize it over and over again. It is just as true to say, &lsquo;Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses,&rsquo; as it is to say, &lsquo;He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; So I said to her, &ldquo;Now do you believe?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Yes, I believe that in the name of Jesus you can cast the evil power out.&rdquo; I then laid my hands on her in the name of Jesus. &ldquo;It is done, you drink.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She went out laughingly and drew the first glass of water and drank. She cried out, &ldquo;Mother! Father! Brother! I have drunk one glass!&rdquo; There was joy in the house. What did it? It was the living faith of the Son of God. Oh, if we only knew how rich we are, and how near we are to the Fountain of life. &ldquo;All things are possible to him that believeth.&rdquo; Aeneas, who had kept his bed for eight years, was told by Peter, &ldquo;Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, make thy bed,&rdquo; and he arose immediately. What did it? A life clothed with the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">An enlarged ministry.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When I was baptized in the Holy Ghost there was the unfolding of a new era of my life and I passed into that and rejoiced in the fact of it, and others with me. But the moment I reached that, God has been ready with another ministry for me. Jesus said in substance, &ldquo;If you honor Me here, I will honor you yonder.&rdquo; Whatever it may be that you are working at for God here, He is working out a far greater and a divine glory for you. You have no need to be constantly talking of what you are going to appear like in glory. The chief thing is that you realize in yourself a deeper manifestation of the power of God to-day than yesterday, and that you hare something more clear to-day of the mind of the Spirit than you had the day before: that nothing comes between you and God to cloud your mind. You are to have more of a vision of the glory of God to-day than yesterday, and to be living in such a state of bliss that it is heavenly to live. Paul got to the place where the Holy Ghost could enlarge him more and more. I find that if I continually keep my mind upon God He unfolds things to me; and if I obediently walk before God and keep my heart pure and clean and holy and right, He will always be lifting me higher than I have ever expected to be. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Present your bodies.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> In Romans 12:1, Paul speaks about a certain place being reached. He speaks about an altar upon which he has laid himself. When he had experienced the mercies of the Lord he could do no other than make a presentation of his body on the altar. It was to be always on the altar, never to be taken off. And he beseeches us to be in this place of continual sacrifice. It is at this place the Holy Ghost will bring forth things new and old for us. Paul so lived in the Spirit that He brought His mind to Paul&rsquo;s mind so that the apostle could write and speak as the oracle of the Holy Ghost, things that portrayed the mind of God, and as we read these things to-day they come to us as the river flowing from the throne of God Himself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants us, also, to be oracles through whom He can cause the water of life to flow. How does it come? It comes when we are in a place low enough for God to pour in, pour in, pour in. God wants to do the same for us as He did for Paul. Shall we stop short of what He says we ought to be? Shall we cease to come into line with the Mind that is always thinking for our best? Shall we cease to humble ourselves before Him, who took the way of the cross for us? Shall we withhold ourselves from Him, who could weep over the doomed city, from the Lord Jesus Christ, who &ldquo;trod the winepress alone&rdquo;? Shall we cease to give Him our all? To what profit will it be if we hold back anything from Him who gives us a thousand times more than ever He asks from us? In Hebrews 2, He says He is going to bring many sons to glory. It means that He is going to clothe them with His glory. Let that be your vision. If you have lost the vision, He is tender to those who cry to Him. He never turns away from the broken heart, and those that seek Him with a whole heart will always find Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Great grace.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The people in the days of the apostles took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, and I know there is a like measure of grace given to the man who says, &ldquo;I will go all the way with Jesus.&rdquo; What is that measure of grace? It is the grace which enables us to press forward to the goal that God will have us reach. We should heed those words, &ldquo;Let no man take thy crown.&rdquo; We have only touched the very fringe of this outpouring of the Spirit. We must go in for all that God has for us. If we do not fall into line with the will of God there will be somebody else who will. God is able to raise up men who will carry out His behests. At the triumphal entry when the multitude cried out in praise, and the Pharisees objected, Jesus said, &ldquo;If these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I have a Jesus like that, who can speak the word and the thing is done. I have a Jesus indwelling me and vitalizing me with a faith that believes that all His promises are true; I have a Jesus within me who has never let me get faint-hearted. Let us press on in faith along the line of God&rsquo;s will, and the outpouring which we have longed to see will come. Cheer up, hold on, never let go the vision. Be sure it is as much for you as for anybody else, and God will surely bring it to pass. All blessings come from above: therefore, keep your eyes on Jesus. Never weary. He will be with you to strengthen you in the way. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">From the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, March 23, 1946.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the second chapter of Mark we have the wonderful story of the healing of the one sick of the palsy who was laid at the feet of the Lord Jesus. Christ spoke a word, &ldquo;and immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever, and wants to manifest Himself in our midst in a similar way. It is His purpose that signs and wonders shall be seen in our midst, and men shall go away and declare, &ldquo;We never saw it on this fashion.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants the gifts of healings and the working of miracles to be seen in our midst. In the book of Acts we read, &ldquo;There came also a multitude out of the cities round about Jerusalem bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">they were healed every one.</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; God wants us to move on into a Pentecostal experience where we shall see this happen in every meeting. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe that if there is anything that God is dissatisfied with, it is our settling down into a stationary condition. We stop on the threshold, when God in His great plan is inviting us into His treasury. Oh, this treasury of the Most High, the unsearchable riches of Christ, this divine position which God wants to move us into, so that we are altogether a new creation, the old self-life having passed away, where we are dead unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is one thing that hinders, and that is the carnal mind, which is enmity against God. But there is a glorious victory over carnality through the cross of Christ. My Bible tells me that my old man with all his carnality was crucified with Christ. At the cross of Christ there is victory complete and full over all the old self-life. God wants us to know the resurrection power of the Lord, and to bring us into a place of rest, of faith, of joy and peace and blessing and of fulness of life; the very same Spirit which raised up Christ from the dead quickening our mortal bodies so that we are full and overflowing with the life of Christ Himself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">May the Lord give us a new vision of Himself, and such a fulness of His divine life that we will shake off all that remains of the old life. Let us pray that He may bring us fully into all the newness of life. May He reveal to us the greatness of His will concerning us for there is no one who loves us as Jesus, there is no love like His, no compassion like His. He is filled with love and never fails to take those who fully obey Him into the promised land. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, in God&rsquo;s Word there is always more to follow, always more than we can know, and if we will allow the Spirit of God to take us into all that is in the mind of God for us, what wonderful things will happen. Do not merely take a part of the Bible, take it all. When we get such a thirst upon us that nothing can satisfy us but God, we have a royal time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If you are a child of God do not be satisfied with anything less than reality all the time. God has His hidden treasures for those who seek Him. Are you dry? There is no dry place in God, but all the good things come out of hard times. The harder the place you are in, the more blessedness can come out of it, as you yield to His plan. God is so abundant, so full of love and mercy; there is no lack to them that trust in Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is an ideal thing to get people to believe, when they ask, that they shall receive, for Christ has said, &ldquo;What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">ye shall have them.</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; It must be so, when God says it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the case of this man with the palsy, we see a helpless man, so infirm that he could not help himself to get to the place where Jesus was. Four men, whose hearts were full of compassion, carried the man to the house, but the house was full. I can see that house today as it was filled, jammed and crammed, just as I have seen houses in Mexico, in Switzerland, in Sweden, in Norway, and in Denmark. The places have been packed to hear the word of our Savior. There was no room even by the door. It was crowded inside and crowded outside. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The men who were carrying the palsied man said, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; But there is always a way. I have never found faith to fail, never once. Do not accept opposition. Believe through. There is always a way. May God the Holy Ghost give us a new touch of faith in God&rsquo;s unlimited power to remove every obstacle, and bring us to the place where we have such a living faith that we dare to trust Him and say, &ldquo;Lord, I do believe.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There was no room, not so much as by the door. But these men said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up on the housetop.&rdquo; Unbelievers would say, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo; But the men of faith declared, &ldquo;We must get this poor fellow in at all costs. It is nothing to remove the roof. Let&rsquo;s go up and go through.&rdquo; That is the spirit that </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">we</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> must have. These men said in their hearts, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop him right into the arms of Jesus, and He will fix him up.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">O beloved, that is a lovely thing to do, to drop right out of your self-righteous unbelief, right into the arms of Christ, who will meet every need of yours for spirit, soul, and body. I find some people who have been in a strange place of deadness for years; but press through to our lovely Christ and He will shake you out of it. He can make perfection out of imperfection by His wondrous loving touch. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I tell you, my sister, my brother, that when Christ&rsquo;s blood was shed, He paid the full price and met all the world&rsquo;s needs. Truly our Lord Jesus has met the need of the broken hearts and the sorrowful spirits, and also the withered limbs and the broken bodies. God&rsquo;s dear Son paid the debt for all, for He took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses. In all points He was tempted like as we are, in order that He might be able to succor them that are tempted. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to make Him real to you so that you will say, &ldquo;He is my only salvation, He is my only life, He is my only help.&rdquo; Oh, thank God! He has triumphed over all the power of hell. He came to seek and to save that which was lost, and He heals all that come to Him. Even though your faith may be tested, believe, and continue to believe. He never fails. In Him there is full redemption. He is still the same blessed Jesus, under the same mighty anointing filled with the Holy Ghost and with power, just as He was when He went about doing good in the days of His flesh, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As the palsied man is let down through the roof there is a great commotion, and all the people are gazing up at this strange sight. We read, &ldquo;When Jesus saw their faith, He said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.&rdquo; What did the forgiveness of sins have to do with the healing of this man? It had everything to do with it. Sin is at the root of disease. May the Lord cleanse us from outward sin and from inbred sin, and take away from us all that hinders the power of God from working through us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The scribes reasoned in their hearts, &ldquo;Who can forgive sins but God only?&rdquo; Christ answered the thoughts of their hearts by saying, &ldquo;Whether it is easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (He saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ had seen the weakness of that man and his helplessness. He saw also the faith of these four men. There is something in it for us today. Many people will not be saved unless some of you are used to stir them up. Do not say with Cain, &ldquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; We have a responsibility towards our brethren, we must take them to Jesus. When these men carried the palsied man, they pressed through until he could hear the voice of the Son of God, and liberty came to the captive. The man became strong by the power of God, arose, took up his bed, and went forth before them all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, I have seen wonderful things like this wrought by the power of God. We must never think about our God on small lines. He spoke one day and made the world from things which did not appear. That is the kind of God we have, and He is just the same today. There is no change in Him. Oh, He is lovely and precious above all thought of comparison. There is none like Him. Let us remember this. He has declared, &ldquo;The just shall live by faith,&rdquo; and nothing will profit you but that which you take by faith. God wants you to come into a close and intimate place with Himself, where you will believe and claim the promises, for they are Yea and Amen to all that believe. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Let us thank God for this full gospel which is not hidden under a bushel today. Let us thank Him that He is bringing out the gospel to us as in the days of His flesh. God is all the time working right in the very midst of us. Beloved, there is greater blessing for you than you ever received in your life. Do you believe it? Will you receive it? </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, October 19, 1946.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> 1 John 3:1. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God does not dwell in temples made with hands; but our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost. We read in Isaiah 57:15, &ldquo;Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The place in which we worship does not matter much, but the manner in which we worship is of utmost importance. Christ told us, &ldquo;God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.&rdquo; How much we need the Holy Spirit to bring us into the kind of spiritual worship that will bring joy to the heart of our heavenly Father, who delights to receive the worship of His blood-bought children. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He wants us to come to a place of undisturbed rest and peace. Only simple faith will bring us there. Christ said, &ldquo;Except ye... become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; Not that we should have a child&rsquo;s mind, but a child&rsquo;s spirit of meekness and gentleness. It is the only plane upon which we can meet God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How my heart cries out for a living faith, for a deep vision of God. The world cannot produce it. There is a place of vision where we see the Lord, where we have Him set always before us. And when we pray, we know that He hears us. We make our requests to God and believe for the answer, knowing no fear, and having a living faith as we come into the presence of God. In His wonderful presence we find fulness of joy, and at His right hand there are eternal pleasures. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God is looking for a people to whom He can reveal Himself. I used to have a tremendous temper, getting white with passion. I was difficult to please at the table. My wife was a good cook, but according to my judgment there was always something wrong with the food. God knew that I could never be of any service to the world until I become wholly sanctified. But after God sanctified me, I heard my wife testify in meeting that from that time on I was pleased with everything. I had men working for me, and I wanted to be a good testimony to them. One day they waited after work was over and said to me, &ldquo;We would like to have the spirit that you have.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read in 1 John 2:6, &ldquo;He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.&rdquo; Abiding in Christ and Christ abiding in us, our actions, all controlled by the blessed Holy Spirit, must be just like those of our Lord Jesus when He was upon the earth. There is a place of death and life where we become dead indeed unto sin in our daily reckoning, but we reckon ourselves </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">alive unto God</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and we let Christ reign in our body. Then all is well. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Word of God is a stimulant to our faith. The Lord would have us all come into a new place of grace, that all may see us as new creatures in Christ Jesus, all the old things of the flesh done away and all things become new and all things of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Note the word &ldquo;behold&rdquo; at the beginning of our text. What does it mean? It means that the Holy Spirit is arousing our attention. He has something special to say. He wants us to pay attention to the fact that our loving Father in heaven has bestowed such grace upon us that believe, that He calls us sons. He wants us, in likeness, in character, in spirit, in longings, in acts, to be made like unto His own beloved Son in whom He was well pleased. He purposes that we should be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You can reach this altitude only by faith. No man can keep himself. The old nature is too difficult to manage. You have been ashamed of it many times. However, God can change you. He will operate upon you by His power and will make you an entirely new creation, if you will only believe. Then you can have this testimony: &ldquo;I am kept by the power of God.&rdquo; The Almighty will stretch His covering over you, and you will know what it is to be able to do all things through Christ who strengtheneth you. For all things are possible to him that believeth. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ says to us, &ldquo;Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&rdquo; The world has no rest. It is full of trouble. But in Christ there is a peace that passeth understanding, and from Him there is an inward flow of divine power that changes your own nature until you live, move, and act in the power of God. The Scripture says, &ldquo;Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will give you an illustration of this. I have lived in one house for sixty years. I have preached from my own doorstep, and all the people in our neighborhood know me. They know me when they need someone to pray for them, when they are in trouble, or when they are in any special need. But when they call their friends, do they call me? No! Why? They would say, &ldquo;He is sure to want a prayer meeting, but we want to finish up with a dance.&rdquo; Wherever Jesus came, sin was revealed, and men did not like sin revealed. But it is sin that separates from God forever. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You are in a good place when you become sensitive to the least sin and weep before God, repenting over the least thing in which you have grieved Him. You may have spoken unkindly; you realize that it was not like the Lord, and your conscience has taken you to prayer. It is a wonderful thing to have a keen conscience. It is when we are close to God that our hearts are revealed to us; it is then we learn to loathe ourselves, and the Holy Spirit turns us to Christ. We take Him to be our righteousness and our holiness. God intends us to live in purity. He has said, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.&rdquo; And the pure in heart can see Him all the time in everything. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">even as He is pure</span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&rdquo; That is God&rsquo;s standard. Don&rsquo;t accept a lower one. Our Lord, who died for us, became poor that we might be made rich, that we might be made pure, that we may be made holy. What an offering! He suffered for us, He died for us. He was buried, but rose again, and is now living for us. How we should love Him! What a privilege to know that you may be a son of God </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">now!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How simple it is. It is written, &ldquo;As many as </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">received</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> on His name.&rdquo; When we </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, we </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">receive</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Him. When we receive Him, anything may take place, for all power is given unto Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul wrote to the Corinthians, &ldquo;In everything ye are enriched by Him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge.... Come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; God wants us to be enriched with utterance for Him, so that everywhere we go we are joyous witnesses of the goodness of the Lord. Wherever I am, whether traveling by train or ship, I preach to the people. It is God&rsquo;s plan for me. On board ship, the captain hears, the sailors hear, and the stewards hear. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;we have </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">another</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> on board!&rdquo; The world thinks there is something wrong with you if you are full of zeal for God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One time, on board ship, a young man came to me and asked me to take part in a sweepstake. I said to him, &ldquo;I am preaching on Sunday. Will you come if I do?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Later there was an entertainment. I said I would take part. It was the strangest thing for me. I said I would sing. I saw men dressed as clergymen entertaining the people with foolishness. I was troubled. I cried out to God. Then came my turn, just before the dance. A young woman came to take my book and accompany me. She was only half dressed. She said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play that!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Never worry.&rdquo; Then I sang, &ldquo;If I could only tell you how I love Him, I am sure that you would make Him yours today!&rdquo; There was no dance. A number began to weep, and six young men gave their hearts to God in my cabin. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">No man that sins has power. Sin makes a man weak. Sin dethrones, but purity strengthens. Temptation is not sin. The devil is a liar, and he will try to take away your peace. But we must always live in the Word of God and on that scripture which tells us, &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; If Christ condemns you not, who is he that can condemn you? Do not condemn yourself. If there is anything wrong, confess it out and then come to the blood of Jesus Christ. &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You can come into a new experience in God, with all fear gone. You can live in a new realm&mdash;among the sons of God with power. &ldquo;If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things which are pleasing in His sight.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Not long ago I received a wire asking me if I would go to Liverpool. There was a woman with cancer and gallstones, and she was very much discouraged. If I know God is sending me, my faith rises. The woman said, &ldquo;I have no hope.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, I have not come from Bradford to go home with a bad report.&rdquo; God said to me, &ldquo;Establish her in the fact of the new birth.&rdquo; When she had the assurance that her sin was gone and she was born again, she said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s everything to me. The cancer is nothing now. I have got Jesus.&rdquo; The battle was won. God delivered her from her sin, from her sickness, and she was free, up and dressed, and happy in Jesus. When God speaks, it is as a nail in a sure place. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Will you </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and will you </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">receive</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Him? Life and immortality is ours in the gospel. This is our inheritance through the blood of Jesus&mdash;</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">life for evermore!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">An excerpt published in </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Confidence</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April-June 1921.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bro. Smith Wigglesworth (70 Victor Road, Bradford, Yorks.) has been ministering on the Continent. <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/2007/09/god-working-in-switzerland.html"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He wrote from Switzerland:</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A young woman was dying of consumption, and her doctor had given her up. I laid hands on her in the name of Jesus, and she knew that the disease had passed away. This girl went to the doctor, who examined her and said, &ldquo;Whatever has taken place, you have no consumption now.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Doctor, I have been prayed over; can I tell the people I am healed?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Yes, and that I could not heal you.&rdquo; &ldquo;If I am to tell will you put it in b!ack and white?&rdquo; And he gave her a certificate, which I saw. God had healed her. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man was brought into one of the meetings in a wheel chair. He could not walk except by the aid of two sticks, and even then his locomotion was very slow. I saw him in that helpless condition, and told him about Jesus. Oh, that wonderful name! Glory to God! &ldquo;They shall call His name Jesus.&rdquo; I placed my hands upon his head and said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus thou art made whole.&rdquo; This helpless man cried out, &ldquo;It is done, it is done, Glory to God, it is done!&rdquo; And he walked out of the building perfectly healed. The man who brought him in the wheel chair and the children said that &ldquo;father so-and-so is walking.&rdquo; Praise the Lord! He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Herr Th. Plum (St. Ann&oelig;splads, Copenhagen, Denmark) wrote to the Editor of &ldquo;Confidence&rdquo; to tell him how God was using Bro. Wigglesworth greatly in Sweden, etc. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Since then he has been with Pastor Barratt in Christiania, and he asks for our prayers. &ldquo;So far, no buildings have been large enough, and hundreds have been turned away.&rdquo; After ministering in a hall which holds 3,000, a hall holding 5,000 was to be obtained. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Police on horseback had to control the crowds. &ldquo;Only by a great squeezing could I get into the hall, assisted by the police officers.&rdquo; Piles of crutches were left behind, the blind saw, epileptic fits dealt with, etc. &ldquo;I am at the feet of Jesus, and weep through my address, and God breaks up the peopie, and there are rows of people each night seeking salvation.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bro. Wigglesworth writes: &ldquo;A poor lame man in hospital asked the doctor for leave to attend the meetings, but was refused permission. He was told that if he broke the regulations he would not be permitted to return. He replied that he did not expect that he would have to return, and it was so.&rdquo; When Bro. Wigglesworth laid hands on him (not knowing all this) he was healed, and left his crutches with the others. The people have given largely to the missionaries and their work. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bro. Wigglesworth is to re-visit Denmark and Sweden, and later he returns to Switzerland. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Acts 20:16: &ldquo;Paul... hasted if it were possible for him to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.&rdquo; Acts 2:1: &ldquo;And witen the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one piace, and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If it had not been for Acts 2 we should not be here tonight. I am glad it filled the place, and I am also glad it was a new order, as Jesus said it would be. A new dispensation of power, grace, revelation. It gives us a deeper sense of what it meant for Jesus to die, rise, and ascend to His Father. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What is heaven? Jesus is heaven. In Him are all the rivers of life. Out of Him there is nothing. The Holy Ghost takes the veil from our eyes and shows us Jesus. There is nothing so beautiful as a soul melted and broken, so ready to be filled for all the Master&rsquo;s mission. When men&rsquo;s hearts are in perfect tune with God, He comes. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is divine in its thought, plan, and operations. You can get nothing except by the Breath of the Almighty. We are on the threshold of a greater place than we have ever known. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Breath of the Almighty&mdash;it filled all the place. It was so full of fire that it sent fire over everyone. The Holy Ghost is a fire, moving, burning, destroying, refining, reducing to ashes, and God always comes out of the ashes. They were at an end of themselves, in perfect stillness, and then God came. God always comes when we are brought to an end. God cannot save us until we are done with. Fire falling, then life; destruction, then life. The Holy Ghost manifested His Presence in the persons. They must have an inward moving, an inward working, then they become flames of fire. They were in a bursting condition. You have your boiler all right, you light the fire, the steam rises; but the boiler would burst unless there was an outflow. Flow on, flow on, flow on! May it flow on. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">By Anton Reuss.<br/>Published in </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Confidence</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April-June 1920.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My very dear Mr. and Mrs. Boddy, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is some little time since I last had the pleasure of writing you. I first wrote Bro. Smith Wigglesworth at your address, for I had forgotten his. Thank you for sending on my letter. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Before I begin to let you know how the Lord blessed our brother here in Bern and Thun, let me thank you for having always encouraged Bro. Smith Wigglesworth to come to us as he told me, for the enemy tried all ways and means to prevent him coming to us. Some one who ought to have known better told Bro. Smith Wigglesworth that &ldquo;If you go to Switzerland now you will not get enough to eat!&rdquo; We did our best to feed him up with our best, so that he exclaimed &ldquo;You are determined that before I leave I shall have to go out of the door sideways in order to be able to get out at all!&rdquo; Another well-meaning friend said &ldquo;If you go to Switzerland </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">now</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> you will suffer from cold!&rdquo; Well, we have not had a cold day since be has been here, and if we had we could have found ways and means to have heated the rooms and halls, etc. The enemy tried and failed to keep our brother in England. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I met Bro. Smith Wigglesworth at Neuch&acirc;tel Station on Saturday, the 31st January, and we had a slow but comfortable journey to Bern, where he stayed with me and my wife at the house of a sister, who is one of the mainsprings of our work, Sister W&uuml;thrich. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">At Bern.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I had taken the hall in the Casino, Bern, for our first Sunday meetings, as I rather expected a crowd of friends, but Ihe crowd did not turn up until Sunday, February 8th, when afternoon and evening the hall was crowded.. The meetings, as you know, began in Bern on the 1st and continued until the 10th February. As fast as our brother became known (and the healings too, for we had many healings) the people began to come in crowds. Every morning from 10 till 12 o&rsquo;clock we had prayer meetings&mdash;entrance only by card, as we wanted to keep the curious and opposers to the speaking in tongues out&mdash;and we had many blessed meetings. It was not an uncommon sight to see several people laying full length stretched out on the floor perfectly unconscious to anything and everything around them as our brother continued his preaching, for the Holy Ghost had begun to fall upon them, and they were there, the slain, so to speak, of the Lord. Several definitely received, but there were so many seekers that we had to have special waiting meetings every afternoon, where our friends were packed in like herrings in their anxiety to receive blessing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Healings continued the whole ten days, and often from 10 o&rsquo;clock till 11:30 p.m. at night our brother was anointing and dealing with the sick, who had to come up in rotation, having first stated in German the nature of the ailments, which I interpreted to him in English. We had two excellent interpreters, a Bro. Steiner from St. Gallen, and a Sister Kummer from Z&uuml;rich, whom I think you met in Labilliere&rsquo;s time. Scores, I can faithfully say, were healed, the unsaved saved, and Christians stirred, sanctified, and several baptized. We had ministers and preachers come both from German and French Switzerland. So many calls came to our brother to come and visit the sick in Bern, which, of course, was impossible, that at last, as these dear people implored me to bring him to them to see a son, a father, etc., I said &ldquo;Pay my taxi, and I will bring him.&rdquo; This was the beginning of events, for afrer that, for two whole afternoons, Bro. Smith Wigglesworth and I hurried all over Bern in a taxi visiting the sick, whom he could not possibly have visited o!herwise. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It may interest you to know that dear Mme. Gaullieur, who received her baptism in Sunderland on the same day as I, August 22nd, 1908, but who had only once since spoken in tongues, again spoke and conlinues to speak. Her maid also received the Baptism and spoke in tongues. To God be the glory! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The meetings lasted ten days in Bern, and on the last evening, Tuesday, we had a missionary meeting, the proceeds to go to the P.M.U., London, and the Congo Mission, in which Bro. Smith Wigglesworth&rsquo;s daughter is interested. Well, the Lord gave our brother the word, and the friends in Bern had been so blessed and interested that they raised the fine sum of frs. 2,100, which amount was subsequently raised to frs. 2,500, more than &pound;100. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If you ask me what the people thought of Bro. Smith Wigglesworth and his methods, I will only say that my friends who are in a position to judge say that Bern has never seen anything like it. It was completely stirred, and the enquiries were so many, also the requests that Bro. Smith Wigglesworth shouid again come to Bern, that I feel sure the biggest hall in Bern will not be too big for him, should the Lord graciously send him to us again in the near future. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">A Yorkshireman.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But what of Bro. Smith Wigglesworth? Well, we are all agreed that he is one who has been very specially blessed of God. Before he came I told my people that I rather believed Bro. Smith Wigglesworth to be an apostle who had apostolic power, and we can say that what we experienced was in a very marked measure apostolic, in spite of the times in which we are living of indifference and unbelief. Bro. Smith Wigglesworth&rsquo;s language, which had a delightful Yorkshire touch when he is in the natural, is not always good English, but when he is under the power of the Spirit his tongues are glorious! the interpretation of the same majestic!! and the English perfect!!! We have never seen anything to equal it in Pentecostal circles in Switzerland. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many of our brethren in Switzerland and Germany are greatly taken up with visions and prophecies, but Bro. Smith Wigglesworth brought us the Word of God, which the Holy Ghost especially emphasised by these powerful utterances in tongues and interpretation. Bro. Smith Wigglesworth is very humble, and the naive way in which he told us that he could not read before he was 23 years old, and that his wife taught him, moved many, and led us to magnify the Lord, who chose fishermen and other working people to be His representatives when He left the earth. When he is in the natural, which is not often, one sees the humble origin, the imperfect education, the man of the people; but when in the Spirit one is conscious of the presence of Someone else who is altogether lovely. Bro. Smith Wigglesworth&rsquo;s great strength is his humility and his love for Jesus, and longing that He alone should have all the glory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We began at Thun on Wednesday the 11th, and continued for six days, the meetings being larger every night. We had morning meetings of waiting upon God in my chalet, of which I enclose you a postcard. I need not say how it would delight us to see you and dear Mrs. Boddy out here for your holiday. It would do her a lot of good. Well, the meetings increased so through the many healings, that I was forced to take the largest place in the town in the Hotel Fresenliof. It holds, they tell me, 800 people. Well, we had quite 600 on Sunday afternoon, and again on Monday evening, our last night. Scores and scores were healed, I can faithfully say, and, what is astounding to us and our opposers, so many unsaved were healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A preacher came to Sister W&uuml;thrich and said, &ldquo;Can you help me to understand why in Bro. Smith Wigglesworth&rsquo;s meetings so many unsaved were healed? I myself brought a very dear young child of God to his meetings in the hope of her being healed. Many unsaved were healed, but not she. How do you explain it?&rdquo; She quietly replied, &ldquo;The unbelief of God&rsquo;s people.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We had about 30 visitors from Lausanne, French Switzerland, and from all over Switzerland people wrote and came to the meetings. If they had only continued longer in Thun I verily believe we should have had a revival, and this is the feeling of many to whom I have spoken in Thun. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Naturally the enemy was not going to take it lying down, so he set his satellites to work, who accused me of making money out of these healings. It is true that in many cases my wife and I were offered money by the grateful sufferers who had been healed, but we always naturally refused. Some would receive no refusal, and these left us 28 francs all told for the poor, which we shall gratefully distribute. But on the Saturday morning when Bro. Smith Wigglesworth left I wanted to accompany him to Liyem, when we were to meet my brother-in-law, R. Ruff, of Z&uuml;rich. I had to go before the Police Inspector in Thun to give an account of my doings in respect of taking money from the healed. I went with another brother-in-law, J. Nievergelt, an engineer in Schaffhausen, and after I had denied the charges my brother-in-law gave the inspector to understand in his own vernacular that this was a put-up job. The inspector was very nice as soon as he saw there was no truth in the charge. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bro. Smith Wigglesworth left here to preach in Z&uuml;rich, where I went to support him, and also in St. Gallen. He returns </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">via</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Basel on the 2nd inst., but he tells me he is invited to Ch&egrave;xbres (Vaud), French Switzerland, for the 16th March, for a week&rsquo;s convention. He returns from Bradford for this week. If he were to return again I believe the Lord would use him to move Switzerland, for, as I say, we have not seen anything like this in Switzerland since the Latter Rain began to fall in 1906 and 1907. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I feel I have written you a long enough letter to enable you to judge by the details that our Bro. Smith Wigglesworth&rsquo;s visit to us here has been signally blessed of God. I verily believe that many pastors and preachers, far more highly educated than our brother, have been forced to ask themselves how it is that this dear brother has so much more power and acceptance with the people than they have, for signs and wonders do so naturally follow his ministry. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">His coming brought us a little bit of old England and of Sunderland, as I heard Bro. Smith Wigglesworth preach at Sunderland, which has always had a very warm place in my heart, and should the Lord open the way for me to come to England this year, I will certainly take the opportunity of coming to see you and dear Mrs. Boddy, for I never forget it was at Sunderland God began first to really bless me at a time in my life when I needed His blessing. Good-bye, dear Mr. and Mrs. Boddy. By the time you receive this Bro. Smith Wigglesworth will be with you and able to relate more of his experiences to you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">With Christian love.<br/>Yours affectionately in Him.<br/>Anton B.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have been greatly stimulated again this month by the visit of our Brother, Mr. Smith Wigglesworth, from Bradford (70, Victor Road, Manningham). We rejoiced to see the ripening power of the Holy Ghost in our Brother, who has truly advanced from &ldquo;faith to faith,&rdquo; and from strength to strength. His first Address on Saturday night emphasized the immense importance of the &ldquo;members of the Body&rdquo; bearing each other up in prayer, especially those suffering from physical pressure, taking the burden as their own, and &ldquo;praying through&rdquo; to God, till the battle was won. The Kingdom of Heaven today is suffering violence. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">On Sunday afternoon and evening he gave us most helpful addresses on the </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">power</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> of the Holy Ghost coming upon us in the Baptism. Though he had known and experienced very much of the power of the Holy Spirit before he received the fulness, he knew now what a marvelous difference in power had come upon him since he received the Pentecostal blessing with the evidence of the &ldquo;Tongues.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Perhaps the most stirring meeting was on Monday, when our Brother, at our request, gave a brief sketch of his life, and recounted some of the hundreds of cases of Divine healing in which God had used him. To us it was interesting to hear how the first touch of Divine power he received was at his Confirmation as a &ldquo;Church&rdquo; boy in a Parish Church in Yorkshire. As the Bishop laid hands on him, the same divine power of the Holy Spirit, which he now experiences in a fuller measure, came upon him, and went through his whole being. Shortly after, in a meeting, he </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">knew</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> he was saved. A great hunger for souls came into his heart, and he began to work for God, and the Lord graciously used him, and later, both he and his wife together, in the saving of hundreds of souls. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then came the revelation of Divine Healing. Raised from the gates of death himself, and healed several times of severe attacks, God led him to open the Bowland Street Mission Hall, Manningham, Bradford (Yorkshire), and there preach full salvation for spirit, soul, and body. Very soon two cases of Epilepsy were instantly healed, and for some 15 years our Brother has had an unbroken record of God&rsquo;s marvelous love and power in healing. To Him alone be all the glory! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We just give one or two striking cases of healing. One, a woman suffering from blood poisoning, her body fearfully distended, and the suffering terrible. At first the oppression of the devil was great, but after a time of earnest wrestling in prayer, victory came, and as hands were laid on her she was instantly delivered and healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Another remarkable case was a woman whose foot was In a terrible condition. The flesh was just hanging off and the bone was bare. Nothing could be done for her but amputation. She listened to the truth of Divine Healing, and she (with ten others) was instantly healed in one meeting. Praise God! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A girl had fallen down a flight of steps, and in some way her tongue had got between her teeth, and half of the tongue was almost severed and hanging loose. Her hip was also out of joint. As Brother Wigglesworth cried to God and laid hands on her, her tongue was instantly healed, the only mark discernible being a white thread-iike line across to show where the wound had been. Her hip also went into joint at once. Quite recently a blind man received his sight instantly. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These and many other cases of healing (both instant and gradual) conclusively prove that the power of the Lord to heal is just the same today for those who believe. The Kingdom of God is still in our midst, for the blind are receiving sight, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, demons are cast out, and the Gospel preached&mdash;the glad tidings of the Victory of Calvary over all the works of the devil. Hallelujah! Amen. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Last November, while nursing a dear sister in the Lord, I fell from the top to the bottom of the stairs. When I got to the bottom I banged the top of my head into the wall. I felt a queer sensation in my neck and shoulder, and my arms went quite dead. I thought, &ldquo;There, I have killed myself and broken my arms.&rdquo; A deadly faintness was creeping over me, when something impressed me to look at my arms. I lifted my head to look, and suddenly the life came back into them, but the awful prickling sensation was terrible, and I could not bear them touching for weeks. The doctor wanted to take me to the infirmary, but I said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; so they made me a bed in the same room as the other sick one. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The doctor gave very little hopes of me, and said if I lived I should have to lie on my back for 18 months at least, and he did not think I should ever be able to move my head about as usual. Twice in a fortnight I was at the very gates of death. The first night I was so ill I thought I was going to live with Jesus, but I had a lovely vision of Him and He said, &ldquo;This sickness is not unto death, but for My glory, and that My name might be glorified throughout all the country.&rdquo; The second time I nearly passed away my dear husband gave himself to the Lord. The doctor said I had fractured and dislocated the spine, and when I lifted my head up the bone had slipped partly on again and liberated the spinal cord; but I felt it was the Lord doing His own work. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For 15 weeks I lay on my back without being able to move, then the Lord permitted my nurse to leave me. A dear friend took me to her home, a Pentecostal Divine Healing Home, and I was there only a few days when we were at prayer one morning. I was sitting up in a chair, my daughter was sitting at my knee, when all at once it seemed as though someone lifted me up and put me on my feet in the center of the room, and from that day I could walk from one room to the other, but with great pain in my back, and I could only move my head a little. It hurt me very much to try to lift up my head. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Bradford.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> On Saturday, April 3rd, I said to my husband, &ldquo;I should like to go to Bradford Convention,&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;I shall not take you; people would think I was mad to take a woman in your condition.&rdquo; However, I prayed to God to take all opposition out of him, and on Monday morning he seemed as eager as I was, and I said, &ldquo;I believe that is where I have to go to get healed, so that God may be glorified.&rdquo; So my husband got a cab to the station, also when we arrived at Bradford to take us to the Presbyterian Church, Infirmary Street. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bro. Wigglesworth took us into a smail room. My husband then went downstairs to have some refreshment, and Bro. Wigglesworth and two sisters came to me. Bro. Wigglesworth anointed me with oil in the name of the Lord, and in five minutes I could walk about the room and move my head any way. (I felt the bone slip into place.) I climbed to a bedroom four stories high to sleep, and walked over two miles next day, and have not had any pain in my back, neck or arms since. Praise the Lord! Nothing is too hard for Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I may say the doctor has often said he could not understand how it was I did not die. He said, &ldquo;From what you had done to yourself, by all the natural laws of medicine you ought to be a dead woman.&rdquo; He has repeated many times, &ldquo;It is marvelous; I cannot understand it.&rdquo; But God understands. I do not think that I ever murmured at the suffering after He said it would glorify Him. It is glorious to know He is with us in pain helping us to bear it. I do praise Him for keeping me patient through it all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I sincerely hope this testimony will be the means of helping others to trust the Lord with their bodies, as He bore our sicknesses as well as our sins on Calvary, and is all-sufficient for spirit, soul, and body. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Anyone wishing to write to me may have the names of several people who heard what the doctor said, and saw me throughout all the illness. I may also say I was healed of cancer in the body 4 years last November. I had not very long to live when Bro. Wigglesworth came over to Doncaster and laid hands on me, and I was instantly healed, and have had no more pain nor hemorrhage since. Wonderful Jesus! Five months after I received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit with the Sign of Tongues. And all my desire is that He will use me for His glory, as I am a living testimony of His wonderful power. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I only returned home on Saturday after a most wonderful time, in French Switzerland this time. There have been great scenes of Pentecost and spiritual revival. Truly hundreds hare been saved and not less than 1,000 healed. Some of the most wonderful miracles were wrought. One had diabetes and was so delivered that his doctor gave him a certificate to say that he was fully healed, without a trace of sugar. One man brought on a stretcher blind and paralyzed now sees and walks. A consumption case was given up by the doctor; the same doctor declared her free and told her to testify to every one, and put down on paper &ldquo;Healed fully.&rdquo; I could go on, but must give you more detalis some orher time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At Geneva now there is a good work, no Pentecost before. At Neuch&acirc;tel a good work; they have got the English Church, no Pentecost before. Lausanne now a strong center, only a few before. Vevey, on the Lake of Geneva, now a good work, and Aigle, not before; at Mayers also, and at Shil de Fos, a great place for watch making. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At all these places God worked wonders, and the largest halls were full of people. At my last meetings in Neuch&acirc;tel the great theater was full twice, and at a large morning meeting at Bern on August 6th I baptized in the open river 110 new converts. This will give you some idea of God&rsquo;s workings. The cry is great. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The people in Sweden and Norway had me booked for September, but the cry of French Switzerland was too appealing, so I remained. I am due back in Zurich (German Switzerland) on October 30th, for one month. Then I am to have a Convention for all French Swiss in December with the leaders, so I would like your beloved wife and yourself to keep me in remembrance. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I brought back for our Missionaries over &pound;300 again, and have &pound;200 promised to the P.M.U. and &pound;100 to the Congo. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God bless you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">His servant,<br/>Smith Wigglesworth.<br/>70 Victor Road,<br/>Bradford.<br/>October 5th, 1920. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ&rsquo;s resurrection power is keeping things alive; nothing but resurrection can displace that which is dead. He came forth. He came forth to be life and power that we might be able to loose the things that were bound, that His glory might be evidenced. There was a dear woman, her heart was bad, poor soul, her feet were swelled. When the devil gets your eyes he makes you look at death. I said, &ldquo;I believe the Lord wants you to have His message.&rdquo; I saw she saw death. It is a tremendous power Satan has when we haven&rsquo;t our eyes on Jesus, but He is alive, and He is risen to make everything living, and His glory is alive for evermore. I thought I would show this dear woman that He has the keys and she might take the promise for a new heart (Psalm 91) and &ldquo;with long life will I satisfy him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is a new word to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;all revelation is new.&rdquo; Three days did wonders. She had risen right into the condition of this life. She said, &ldquo;It is Amen, I have a new heart, my legs are not swelled.&rdquo; It is no good without it is the Amen from above. The Amen&mdash;what does it mean&mdash;&ldquo;let it be.&rdquo; It was Jesus who said it&mdash;it was He who was Clothed who said it&mdash;The One from heaven, the One who had won the victory, and God wants us to do it in His place. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">* * * </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, I remember one day stepping into a barber&rsquo;s shop where I heard a man moaning pitifully, with a shade over his eyes. &ldquo;What is the matter,&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Doctor says it is inflammation and will always be like this.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the Name of Jesus,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I command you to go.&rdquo; The man then said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done, I am free.&rdquo; Where is He? I tell you He is risen. It was He that acted. Oh, to be so closely interwoven with His great Heart and it&rsquo;s done.&mdash;Did it finish there? No! The man came and got saved and baptized in the Holy Ghost. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory&mdash;it is impossible for it to be told. The Acts of the Apostles will never be finished till we get into the glory. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Then said they unto Him, &lsquo;What shall we do that we might work the works of God?&rsquo; Jesus answered and said unto them, &lsquo;This is the work of God: that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.&rsquo; &rdquo; &mdash;John 6:28-29. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;This is the work of God, that ye believe.&rdquo; Nothing in the world glorifies God so much as simple rest of faith in what God&rsquo;s Word says. Jesus said, &ldquo;My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.&rdquo; He saw the way the Father did the works; it was on the ground work of knowledge, faith based upon knowledge. When I know Him, there are any amount of promises I can lay hold of, then there is no struggle, for he that asketh receiveth, he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus lived to manifest God&rsquo;s glory in the earth, to show forth what God was like, that many sons might be brought to glory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">John the Baptist came as a forerunner, testifying beforehand to the coming revelation of the Son. The Son came, and in the power of the Holy Ghost revealed faith. The living God has chosen us in the midst of His people. The power is not of us, but of God. Yes, beloved, it is the power of another within us, Jesus the Son of God. Just in the measure we are clothed, and covered, and hidden in Him, is His inner working manifested. Jesus said, &ldquo;The works that I do shall ye do also, and My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.&rdquo; Oh, the joy of the knowledge of it! To know Him. We know if we look back how God has taken us on we love to shout &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; pressed out beyond measure by the Spirit, as He brings us face to face with reality, His blessed Holy Spirit dwelling in us and manifesting the works. I must know the sovereignty of His grace and the manifestation of His power. Where am I? I am in Him; He is in God. The Holy Ghost, the great Revealer of the Son. Three persons dwelling in man. The Holy Spirit is in us for revelation to manifest the Christ of God. &ldquo;Therefore be it known unto you He that dwelleth in God doeth the works.&rdquo; &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life having made us free from the law of sin and death.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Spirit working in righteousness, bringing us to the place where all unbelief is dethroned, and Christ is made the Head of the Corner. &ldquo;This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.&rdquo; It is a glorious fact, we are in God&rsquo;s presence, possessed by Him; we are not our own, we are clothed with Another. What for? For the deliverance of the people. Many can testify to the day and hour when they were delivered from sickness by a supernatural power. Some would have passed away with influenza if God had not intervened, but God stepped in with a new revelation, showing us we are born from above, born by a new power, God dwelling in us superseding the old. &ldquo;If ye ask anything in My name, I will do it.&rdquo; Ask and receive, and your joy shall be full, if ye dare to believe. &ldquo;What shall we do that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, &lsquo;This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.&rdquo; God is more anxious to answer than we are to ask. I am speaking of faith based upon knowledge. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A testimony. I was healed of appendicitis, and that because of the knowledge of it; faith based upon the knowledge of the experience of it. Where I have ministered to others God has met and answered according to His will. It is in our trust and our knowledge of the power of God&mdash;the knowledge that God will not fail us if we will only believe. &ldquo;Speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.&rdquo; Jesus said unto the centurion, &ldquo;Go thy way; as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee,&rdquo; and the servant was healed in the self-same hour. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">An instance. In one place where I was staying a young man came in telling us his sweetheart was dying; there was no hope. I said, &ldquo;Only believe.&rdquo; What was it? Faith based upon knowledge. I knew that what God had done for me He could do for her. We went to the house. Her sufferings were terrible to witness. I said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus come out of her.&rdquo; She cried, &ldquo;Mother, mother, I am well.&rdquo; Then I said that the only way to make us believe it was to get up and dress. Presently she came down dressed. The doctor came in and examined her careiully. He said, &ldquo;This is of God; this is the finger of God.&rdquo; It was faith based upon knowledge. If I received a check for &pound;1,000, and only knew imperfectly the character of the man that sent it, I should be careful not to reckon on it until it was honored. Jesus did great works because of His knowledge of His Father. Faith begets knowledge, fellowship, communion. If you see imperfect faith, full of doubt, a wavering condition, it always comes of imperfect knowledge. Jesus said, &ldquo; &lsquo;Father, I know that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people that stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou has sent Me.&rsquo; He cried with a loud voice, &lsquo;Lazarus, come forth.&rsquo; &rdquo; &ldquo;And God wrought special miracles by the hand of Paul, so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchlefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.&rdquo; For our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of His glory, according to the working whereby He is able to subdue all things unto Himself? How God has cared for me these twelve years, and blessed me, giving me such a sense of His presence! When we depend upon God how bountiful He is, giving us enough and to spare for others. Lately God has enabled me to take victory on new lines, a living-in-Holy-Ghost attitude in a new way. As we meet, immediately the glory falls. The Holy Ghost has the latest news from the Godhead, and has designed for us the right place at the right time. Events happen in a remarkable way. You drop in where the need is. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There have been several mental cases lately. How difficult they are naturally, but how easy for God to deal with. One lady came, saying, &ldquo;Just over the way there is a young man terribly afflicted, demented, with no rest day or night.&rdquo; I went with a very imperfect knowledge as to what I had to do, but in the weak places God helps our infirmities. I rebuked the demon in the name of Jesus, then I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come again tomorrow.&rdquo; Next day when I went he was with his father in the field and quite well. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Another case. Fifty miies away there was a fine young man, twenty-five years of age. He had lost his reason, could have no communication with his mother, and he was always wandering up and down. I knew God was waiting to bless. I cast out the demon-power, and heard long after he had become quite well. Thus the blessed Holy Spirit takes us on from one place to anoiher. So many things happen, I live in heaven on earth. Just the other day, at Coventry, God relieved the people. Thus He takes us on, and on, and on. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do not wait for inspiration if you are in need; the Holy Ghost is here, and you can have perfect deliverance as you sit in your seats. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was taken to three persons, one in care of an attendant. As I entered the room there was a terrible din, quarrelling, such a noise it seemed as if all the powers of hell were stirred. I had to wait God&rsquo;s time. The Holy Ghost rose in me at the right time, and the three were delivered, and at night were singing praises to God. There had to be activity and testimony. Let it be known unto you this man Christ is the same today. Which man? God&rsquo;s Man Who has to have the glory, power and dominion. &ldquo;For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet.&rdquo; When He reigns in you, you know how to obey, how to work in conjunction with His will, His power, His light, His life, having faith based upon knowledge, we know He has come. &ldquo;Ye shall receive power, the Holy Ghost coming upon you.&rdquo; We are in the experience of it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Sometimes a live word comes unto me, in the presence of a need, a revelation of the Spirit to my mind, &ldquo;Thou shalt be loosed.&rdquo; Loosed now? It looks like presumption, but God is with the man who dares to stand upon His word. I remember, for instance, a person who had not been able to smell anything for four years. I said, &ldquo;You will smell now if you believe.&rdquo; This stirred another who had not smelled for twenty years. I said, &ldquo;You will smell tonight.&rdquo; She went about smelling everything, and was quite excited. Next day she gave her testimony. Another came and asked, &ldquo;Was it possible for God to heal her ears?&rdquo; The drums were removed. I said, &ldquo;OnIy beiieve.&rdquo; She went down into the audience in great distress; others were healed but she could not hear. The next night she came again. She said, &ldquo;I am going to believe tonight.&rdquo; The glory fell. The first time she came feeling; the second time she came believing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one place there was a man anointed for rupture. He came the next night, rose in the meeting saying, &ldquo;This man is an impostor; he is deceiving the people. He told me last night I was healed; I am worse than ever today.&rdquo; I spoke to the evil power that held the man and rebuked it, telling the man he was indeed healed. He was a mason. Next day he testified to lifting heavy weights, and that God had met him. &ldquo;By His stripes we are healed.&rdquo; &ldquo;He hath made to light on Him the iniquity of us all.&rdquo; It was the Word of God, not me he was against. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What shall we do that we might work the works of God? Jesus said, &ldquo;This is the work of God that ye believe on Him Whom He hath sent.&rdquo; Anything else? Yes. He took our infirmities, and healed all our diseases. I myself am a marvel of healing. If I fail to glorify God, the stones would cry out. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Salvation is for all, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Healing is for all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Baptism of the Holy Ghost is for all.</span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Reckon yourselves dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">By His grace get the victory every time.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Gen 32:24: &ldquo;And Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As we look back over our spiritual career we shall always see there has been a good deal of our own day, and that the end of our day was the beginning of God&rsquo;s day. &ldquo;Can two walk together, except they be agreed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption,&rdquo; and we cannot enter into the deep things of God until we are free from our own ideas and ways. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob! The name means supplanter, and when Jacob came to the end of his way God had a way. How slow we are to see that there is a better day. Beloved, the glory is never so wonderful as when God has His plan and we are helpless and throw down our sword and give up our authority to another. Jacob was a great worker, and he would go through any hardship if he could have his way. In many ways he had his way, and in ignorance how gloriously God preserved him from calamity. There is a good and there is a better, but God has a best, a higher standard for us than we have yet attaIned. It is a better thing if it is God&rsquo;s plan and not ours. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob and his mother had a plan to secure the birthright and the blessing, and his father agreed to his going to Padan-aram, but God planned the ladder and the angels. &ldquo;The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.&rdquo; What a good thing for the lad, in the midst of the changes, God obtained the right place. The planning for the birthright had not been a nice thing, but here at Bethel he found God was with him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many things may happen in our lives, but when the veil is lifted and we see the glory of God, His tender compassion over us all the time, to be where God is, how wonderful it is. Bethel was the place where the ladder was set up twenty-one years before. Twenty-one years of wandering and fighting and struggling. Listen to his conversation with his wives: &ldquo;Your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.&rdquo; To his father-in-law: &ldquo;Except the God of my father had been with me, thou hadst sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction and the labor of my hands.&rdquo; Jacob had been out in the bitter frost at night watching the flocks. He was a thrifty man, a worker, a planner, a supplanter. We see the whole thing around us in the world today&mdash;supplanters. There may be a measure of blessing, but God is not first in their lives. We are out judging them, but there is a better way, better than our best&mdash;God&rsquo;s way. God first! &ldquo;There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But there is a way that God establisheth, and I want us to keep that way before us this morning&mdash;the way that God establisheth. In our own natural planning and way we may have much blessing, of a kind; but oh, beloved, the trials the hardships, the barrenness, the things missed which God could not give us! I realize this morning by the Holy Ghost, I realize by the anointing of the Spirit that there is a freshness, a glow, a planning in God where you can know that God is with you all the time. Can we know that God is with us all the time? Yes! Yes! Yes! I tell you there is a place to reach where all that God has for us can flow through us to a needy world all the time. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Verse 24: &ldquo;And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.&rdquo; Oh, to be left alone! Alone with God! In the context we read that several things had gone on. His wives had gone on, his children had gone on, all had gone on. His sheep and oxen had gone on, his camels and asses had gone on, all had gone on. He was alone. You will often find you are alone. Whether you like it or not, your wives will go on, your children will go on, your cattle will go on. Jacob was left alone. His wife could not make atonement for him, his children could not make atonement for him, his money was useless to help him. &ldquo;And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.&rdquo; What made Jacob come to that place of loneliness, weakness, and knowledge of himself? The memory of the grace with which God had met him twenty-one years before, when he saw the ladder and the angels and heard the voice of God: &ldquo;Behold I am with thee and will keep thee, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.&rdquo; He remembered God&rsquo;s mercy and grace. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here he was returning to meet Esau. His brother had become very rich, he was a chief, he had been blehsed abundantly in the things of this world, he had authority and power to bind all Jacob had and to take vengeance upon him. Jacob knew this. He knew also that there was only one way of deliverance. What was it? The mind of God. &ldquo;No one can deliver me but God.&rdquo; God had met him twenty-one years before, when he went out empty. He had come back with wives and children and goods, but he was lean in soul and impoverished in spirit. Jacob said to himself, &ldquo;If I do not get a blessing from God I can never meet Esau,&rdquo; and he made up his mind he would not go on until he knew that he had favor with God. Jacob was left alone, and unless we get alone with God, we shall surely perish. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;God interposes where strife is at an end; the way of revelation is plain, and the Holy Ghost&rsquo;s plan is so clear, that we have to say it was God after all.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob was left alone. He knelt alone. The picture is so real to me. Alone! Alone! Alone! He began to think. He thought about the ladder and the angels. I think as he began to pray his tongue would cleave to the roof of his mouth. Jacob had to get rid of a lot of things. It had all been Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! He got alone with God and he knew it. If you get alone with God, what a place of revelation! Alone with God! Jacob was left alone, alone with God. We stay too long with our relations, our camels and our sheep. Jacob was left alone. It would be afternoon. Hour after hour passed. He began to feel the presence of God. But God was getting disappointed with Jacob. If ever God is disappointed with you when you tarry in his presence, it will be because you are not white-hot. If you do not get hotter, and hotter, and hotter, you disappoint God. If God is with you and you know it, be in earnest. Pray! Pray! Pray! Lay hold! &ldquo;Hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.&rdquo; If you do not, you disappoint God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob was that way. God said: you are not real enough; you are not hot enough; you are too ordinary; you are no good to me unless you are filled with zeal&mdash;white hot! He said, &ldquo;Let me go, for the day breaketh. Jacob knew if God went without blessing him, Esau could not be met. If you are left alone&mdash;alone with God&mdash;and you cannot get to a place of victory, it is a terrible time. You must never let go, whatever you are seeking&mdash;fresh revelation, light on the path, some particular need&mdash;never let go. Victory is ours if we are in earnest enough. All must pass on, nothing less will please God. &ldquo;Let me go, the day breaketh!&rdquo; He was wrestling with equal strength. Nothing is obtained that way. You must always master that which you are wrestling with. If darkness covers you, if it is fresh revelation you need, or your mind to be relieved, always get the victory. God says you are not in earnest enough. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the Word does not say that.&rdquo; But it was God&rsquo;s mind. In wrestling the strength is in the neck, chest, and thigh; the thigh is the strength of all. So God touched his thigh. That strength gone, defeat is sure. What did Jacob do? He hung on. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;God means to have a people severed by the power of His power, so hold fast; He will never leave go. And if we do leave go we shall fall short.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob said, &ldquo;I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.&rdquo; And God blessed him. Verse 28: &ldquo;Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel.&rdquo; Now a new order is beginning, sons of God. How wonderful the change of Jacob to Israel! Israel! Victory all the time, God building all the time, God enough all the time. Power over Esau, power over the worId, power over the cattle. The cattle are nothing to him now. All is in subjection as he comes out of the great night of trial. The sun rises upon him. Oh, that God may take us on, the sun rising, God supplanting all! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What after that? Read how God blessed and honored him. Esau meets him. No fighting now&mdash;what a blessed state of grace! They kissed each other. &ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s ways please the Lord, he maketh his enemies to be at peace with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;What about all these cattle, Jacob?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a present.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I have plenty; I don&rsquo;t want your cattle. What a joy it is to see your face again!&rdquo; What a wonderful change! Who wrought it? God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Verse 25: &ldquo;When he saw that he prevailed not against Him.&rdquo; Could he hold God? Can you hold God?&mdash;it is irreverent to say so&mdash;oh, yes, you can. Sincerity can hold Him, dependence can hold Him, weakness can hold Him. When you are weak, then are you strong. I&rsquo;ll tell you what cannot hold Him. Self-righteousness cannot hold Him, pride cannot hold Him, assumption cannot hold Him, high-mindedness cannot hold Him; thinking you are something when you are nothing, puffed up in your imagination. Nothing but sincerity! You can hold Him in the closet, in the prayer meeting, everywhere. &ldquo;If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in, and will sup with him, and he with Me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Can you hold Him? There may be a thought, sometimes, that He has left you. Oh, no! He does not leave Jacob, Israel. What changed his name? The wrestling? What changed his name? The holding on, the clinging, the brokenness of spirit? If you do not help me I am no good, no good for the world&rsquo;s need. I am no longer salt. Jacob obtained the blessing on two lines: the favor of God, and a yieldedness of will. God&rsquo;s Spirit was working in him to bring him to a place of helplessness; God co-working to bring him to Bethel, the place of victory. Jacob remembered Bethel, and through all the mischievous conditions he had kept his vow. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When we make vows and keep them, how God helps us. We must call upon God and give Him account of the promise. Verse 30: &ldquo;And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&rdquo; How did he know? Do you know when God blesseth you, when you have victory? But twenty years afterwards the vision of the ladder and the angels! How did he know? We must have a perfect knowledge of what God has for us. He knew that he had the favor of God, and that no man could hurt him. Let us in all our seeking see we have the favor of God, walking day by day beneath an open heaven. Keeping His commandments, walking in the Spirit, tender in our hearts, lovable, appreciated by God; if so, we shall be appreciated by others and our ministry will be a blessing to those who hear. God bless you. God bless you&mdash;for Jesus&rsquo; sake. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to speak this afternoon of Pentecost and the fulness of the Spirit, and of what God is able to do with any man who is yielded to Him. We are here today for one purpose, and that is, to kindle one another with a holier zeal than ever has possessed us before. I believe there is a greater need for us today in the world than ever. There is a more broken spirit abroad in our land than for a long time past, and no one can meet the need today but the man filled with God. God has promised to fill us. You may be filled with the mighty power of God, and yet in a way not realize it, and yet know that you are being used by a power apart from yourself a power that keeps you from self-exhibition. Just as the sun by its mighty power brings certain resources to nature, so I believe the power of God in the human soul, the power filling it with Himself, is capable, by living faith, of bringing about what otherwise could never be accomplished. May God by His Spirit this afternoon prepare us for what He has to say. </span></p><h3 class="cs662E67A8">
					<span class="cs93C970F9">I</span></h3>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to draw your attention to Acts 26:12-19, where we are told of the light from heaven and the voice which arrested Paul in his way to Damascus, and of his conversion, and of the commission given to him to go unto the Gentiles to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, and of the fact that he &ldquo;was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.&rdquo; You remember how it is stated, in Acts 9, that for three days after this vision Paul was blind; he was in a state in which he could not see, in a state of broken-heartedness, I suppose. And then God had him. It is a wonderful thing when God gets you. You are not much good for anything until God gets you. When God gets you you are loose and you are bound; you are free, but you can act only as He wills for you to act; and when you act only for Him there is in the process that which brings out something mighty for all time. Well, Paul had first to come to this time of crying, weeping, contrition, heart-meltedness, yieldedness. He had done all he could in the natural, but the natural had only brought him to a broken place, to blindness, to helplessness, and this must come out of Paul&rsquo;s life before he could have the life of God. When we have altogether parted with our own, as it were, then there is a possibility of God&rsquo;s likeness being made manifest in us, of the water of life filling us, and not only fertilizing our own life, but </span><span class="cs53F207AF">FLOWING FROM US AS A RIVER</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that will touch others; and no one can tell what a river can do when it is set aflow by God, because when God is in the plan everything works mightily and harmoniously. I pray God the Holy Ghost that at all times I shouid cease from anything except that thing which God wants to bring out, and not I. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are so many wonderful things about a life filled with the Holy Ghost that one feels almost as if one were a machine and could never stop speaking of them. There are so many opportunities and such great forces that can never come along any other line. When Jesus has come to a place where He will not make bread for Himself, I find that He reaches a place where He can make bread for thousands. And when I come to a place where I will not do anything for myself, then God will do something for me, and </span><span class="cs53F207AF">I WILL GLADLY DO ANYTHING FOR HIM</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that He may desire me to do. That is in the order of the baptism. It is when we cease to clothe ourselves that God clothes us, and it is the clothing wherewith He clothes us that covers all our nakedness. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In his helplessness and brokenness Paul cries: &ldquo;Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?&rdquo; That cry reached to heaven, and as a result there came a holy man, touched with the same fire and zeal that filled his Master, and he laid his hands upon Paul and said, &ldquo;Receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
					<span class="csC18E74A5">[At this point in the service someone (possibly Wigglesworth) spoke in prophetic tongues. The interpretation was: &ldquo;The living touch of the river of the life of God is that which makes all things akin, and brings a celestial glory into the human heart, and phrases that meet the kindled desire therein.&rdquo;]</span></h5>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When God moves a man his body becomes akin with celestial glory all the time, and the man says things as he is led by the Holy Ghost who fills him. When we are filled with the Holy Ghost we go forth to see things accomplished that we could never see otherwise. First of all, Paul has a vision. There is always a vision in the Baptism of the Spirit. But visions are no good to me except I make them real, except I claim them as they come, except I make them my own; and if your whole desire is to carry out what the Spirit has revealed to you by vision, it will surely come to pass. Lots of people lack the power because they do not keep the vision, because they do not allow the fire which has come to infuse into them and continue to burn. There must be </span><span class="cs53F207AF">A CONTINUOUS BURNING ON THE ALTAR</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. Holy Ghost power in a man is meant to be an increasing force, an enlargement. God has never anything of a diminishing type. He is always going on. And I am going on. Are you going on? It is necessary, I tell you, to go on. You must not stop in the plains; there are far greater things for you on the hill-tops than in the plains. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus took particular care of Paul; He did not rush him through the business. Some people think that everything ought to be done </span><span class="cs53F207AF">IN A TREMENDOUS HURRY</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. With God it is not so. God takes plenty of time, and He has a wonderful way of developing things as He goes along. Nothing that you undertake will fail, if only you do not forget what He has told you, and if you act upon it. You really cannot forget that which the Holy Ghost brings right into your heart as His purpose for you. A man baptized by the Holy Ghost is no longer a natural man; he is forced by the Spirit, he is turned into another man. Joshua and Caleb could not say anything less than that &ldquo;God, who has taken us and let us see the land, He will surely give us the land.&rdquo; Where are you fixed? Is God the Holy Ghost arranging things for you, or are you arranging things according to your own plan? A man filled with the Holy Ghost has ceased to be, in a sense; he has come to a rest, he has come to where God is working, to a place where He can &ldquo;stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.&rdquo; What do I mean? I mean that such a man has ceased from his own works and abilities and associations. He will not trust his own heart; he relies only on the omnipotent power of the Most High, he is girded with Another. The man baptized with the Holy Ghost will always </span><span class="cs53F207AF">KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIS MASTER</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> in the passing crowd, or wherever he may be. He has no room for anything that steps lower than the unction that was on his Master, or for anything that hinders him from being about his Master&rsquo;s business. If you are baptized by the Holy Ghost, you have no spiritual food apart from the Word of God, you have no resources but those that are heavenly; you have been &ldquo;planted&rdquo; with Christ, and have &ldquo;risen with Him,&rdquo; and you are &ldquo;seated with Him in heavenly places&rdquo;; your language is a heavenly language, your source of inspiration is a heavenly touch; God is enthroned in your whole life, and you see things &ldquo;from above,&rdquo; and not from below. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man that is baptized with the Holy Ghost has a Jesus mission. He knows his vocation, the plan of his life. God speaks to him so definitely and really that there is no mistaking about it. Thank God for the knowledge which fixes me so solidly upon God&rsquo;s Word that I cannot be moved from it by any storm that may rage. The revelation of Jesus to my soul by the Holy Ghost brings me to a place where I am willing, if need be, </span><span class="cs53F207AF">TO DIE ON WHAT THE WORD SAYS</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. The three Hebrew children said: &ldquo;We are not careful to answer thee in this matter&rdquo;; and when a man of God by the Spirit is quickened he never moves toward, or depends upon, natural resources. The furnace &ldquo;one seven times more&rdquo; heated is of no consequence to the men who have heard the voice of God; the lions&rsquo; den has no fearfulness for the man who opens his windows and talks to his Father. The people who live in the unction of the Spirit are taken out of the world in the sense that they are kept in the world without being defiled by the evil of the world. </span></p><h3 class="cs662E67A8">

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But let us come back to this wonderful vision that Paul had. I want you to see how carefully the Lord deals with him. Verse 16: &ldquo;But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee.&rdquo; Do not you see how carefully the Lord works? He shows Paul the vision as far as Paul can take it in, and then He says: &ldquo;There are other things in the which I will again appear unto thee.&rdquo; Did He ever appear unto Paul after that? Certainly He did. But Paul never lost this vision; he kept it up, so to speak. What was there in the vision that held him in such close association with Jesus Christ that he was ready for every activity to which he was led by the Holy Ghost? There were certain things he had to do. Look, for instance, at Galatians 1:15-16. There you will find a very wonderful word&mdash;a word that has had a great impression upon me in relation to the subject of </span><span class="cs53F207AF">THE CONTINUATION OF THE BAPTISM</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. &ldquo;When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&rsquo;s womb, and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.&rdquo; Now read together the words: &ldquo;Therefore I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I conferred not with flesh and blood.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is no man here this afternoon who can be clothed in the Spirit, and catch the fire and zeal of the Master every day and many times in the day, without he ceases in every way to be connected with the &ldquo;arm of flesh&rdquo; which would draw him aside from the power of God. Many men have lost the glory because they have been taken up with the natural. If we are going to accomplish in the Spirit the thing God has purposed for us, we can never turn again to the flesh. If we are Spirit-filled God has cut us short and brought us into relationship with Himself, joined us to Another, and now He is all in all to us. You may have </span><span class="cs53F207AF">A VISION OF THE LORD</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> all the time you are in a railway train, or in a tramcar, or walking down a street. It is possible to be lonely in the world and to be a Christian, without what? Without you cease to be a natural man. I mean that the Christian ought to have such an unction as to realize at any moment, whether in the presence of others or alone, that he is with God. He can have a vision in the tramcar, or in the railway train, even if he has to stand with others in front or behind him; or he can have a vision if he is there alone. Nehemiah stood before the king because of trouble in Jerusalem which had nigh broken his heart. He was sorrowful, and it affected his countenance; but he was so near to God that he could say: &ldquo;I have communed with the God of heaven.&rdquo; And if we believers are to go forth and fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose with us, the Holy Spirit must be constantly filling us and moving upon us until our whole being is on fire with the presence and power of God. That is the order of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. The man is then ready for every emergency. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now it is a most blessed thought&mdash;it struck me as I was reading at our assembly on Sunday morning&mdash;that in the holy, radiant glory of the vision that was filling Paul&rsquo;s soul (Acts 20), the people became so hungry after it that until midnight they drank in at the fountain of his life, and as he was pouring forth a young man fell down from the third loft, and Paul, in the same glorious fashion, as always, went down and embraced him and pressed the very life from himself into the young man, and brought him back to life. Always equipment for emergency, a blessed, holy equipment by God! Someone calls at your door and wants to see you particularly; but you </span><span class="cs53F207AF">CANNOT BE SEEN TILL YOU ARE THROUGH WITH GOD</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. Living in the Holy Ghost, walking in the Divine likeness, having no confidence in the flesh, but growing in the grace and knowledge of God, and going on from one state of glorious perfection unto another state of perfection&mdash;that is it. You cannot compare the Holy Ghost to anything less, but something more, than ever you thought about with all your thoughts. That is the reason why the Holy Ghost has to come into us to give us Divine revelations for the moment. The man that is a &ldquo;partaker of the Divine nature&rdquo; has come into a relationship where God imparts His Divine mind for the comprehension of His love and of the fellowship of His Son. We are only powerful as we know that source, we are only strong as we behold the beatitudes and all the wonderful things and graces of the Spirit. </span></p><h3 class="cs662E67A8">

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was a necessity that Jesus should live with His disciples for three years, and walk in and out amongst them and manifest His glory, and show it forth day by day. I will show you why it was a necessity. Those men believed in God. But this Messiah had continually, day by day, to bring Himself into their vision, into their mind, into their very nature. He had </span><span class="cs53F207AF">TO PRESS HIMSELF</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> right into their life to make them a success after He had ascended to heaven. He had to show them how wonderfully and gracefully and peacefully He could move the crowds. You remember that the house to which they brought the sick of the palsy, and in which He was speaking to the people, was so crowded that they could not come nigh unto Him except by uncovering the roof and dropping the man through. The way to the cities was so pressed with the people who were following Jesus and his disciples, that He and they could hardly get along, but He always had time to stop and perform some good deed on the journey thither. What He had to bring home to the minds and hearts of the disciples was that He was truly the Son of God. They never could accomplish what they had to accomplish until He had proved that to them, and until He had soared to the glory. They could only manifest Him to others when He had imparted His life into </span><span class="cs53F207AF">THE VERY CORE OF THEIR NATURE</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and make others confess that they were astonished, and that &ldquo;we never saw things like this.&rdquo; It was the Son of God travelling in the greatness of His strength to manifest before those disciples the keynote of truth that no one could gainsay. They had been with Him and seen His desire, His craving, His lust to serve God. Yes, He lusted to be like God in the world manifesting Him so that they might see what Philip had missed when Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Hast thou not seen the Father?&rdquo; He wanted them to be clothed with the Spirit, baptized by the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some people get a wrong notion of the Baptism. The Baptism is nothing less than the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity coming down from the glory, the Executive Spirit of the Triune God indwelling your body, revealing the truth to you, and causing you sometimes to say &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; till your bowels yearn with compassion, as Jesus yearned, to travail as He travailed, to mourn as He mourned, to groan as He groaned. It cannot be otherwise with you. You cannot get this thing along a merely passive line. It does not come that way. But, glory be to God, it does come. O that God might bring from our hearts the cry for such </span><span class="cs53F207AF">A DELUGE OF THE SPIRIT</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that we could not get away till we were ready for Him to fulfill His purpose in us and for us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I had a wonderful revelation of the power of God this last week. If there is anything I know about this baptism it is this: that it is such a force of conviction in my life that I am carried, as it were, through the very depths of it. Sometimes we have to think; at other times we have not time to think, and it is when we are at our wits&rsquo; end that God comes and brings deliverance. When you are at your wits&rsquo; end, and you throw yourself on the omnipotent power of God, what a wonderful transformation there is in a moment. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs53F207AF">AN INCIDENT</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. I went to a house where they were very much distressed. It is a peculiar thing, but it is true, that the Spirit of the Lord upon one either binds people together or makes them tremendously fidgety or restless, that they have to come to some place of decision. I know nothing like the mighty power of the Spirit; it works so harmoniously with the will of God. I was talking lo the people in that house, and a young woman was there, and she said, &ldquo;Oh, father, I ought to have relief today. I am sitting here and I do know what to say, but somehow I feel that this whole trouble ought to go today.&rdquo; &ldquo;What trouble?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For six years I have not been able to drink. I cannot drink. I go to the tea-table and cannot drink. My body has gone down.&rdquo; I knew what it was. It was </span><span class="cs53F207AF">A DEVIL IN THE THROAT</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. You say, &ldquo;You must be very careful.&rdquo; Well, I don&rsquo;t care whom I affront by saying that; I believe the devil is the root of all evil, and it is a serious thing for a beautiful young woman who had perfect health, otherwise to be, as a result of that one thing, so disorganized in her mind and body. I knew it was the power of Satan. How did I know? Because it attacked her at a vital point, and it got her mind on that point, and when it got her mmd on that point she went downhill, and she said, &ldquo;I dare not drink; if I do I shall choke.&rdquo; I asked the father and mother to go out, and then I said to the young woman, &ldquo;You will be free and you will drink as much as you want as soon as I have done with you, if you will believe. As sure as you are there you will drink as much as you want.&rdquo; Our brethren are going out into the streets tonight, and I may be amongst them, and they will be preaching, and they will say definitely, &ldquo;Everyone that believeth can be saved.&rdquo; They will mean, everyone that believeth can be healed. The </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">same</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> truth. They will emphasize it over and over again. They have no more right to emphasize that than I have a right to say &ldquo;He was wounded for my transgressions, He was bruised.&rdquo; So I said to her, &ldquo;Now, dare you believe?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I believe that in the name of Jesus you can cast the evil power out.&rdquo; I then laid my hands upon her, and I said, &ldquo;</span><span class="cs53F207AF">IT&rsquo;S DONE; YOU DRINK</span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&rdquo; She went laughingly, praise God, and drew the first glass of water and drank. &ldquo;Mother! father! brother!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drunk one glass!&rdquo; There was joy in the house. What did it? It was the living faith of the Son of God. Oh, if we only knew how rich we are, and how near we are at the fountain of life! &ldquo;All things are possible to him that believeth.&rdquo; When Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, was told by Peter to &ldquo;Arise and make thy bed, and he arose immediately,&rdquo; what did it? A life clothed with the Spirit. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
					<span class="csC18E74A5">[Another message in tongues: &ldquo;The living water is falling and making manifest the Christ mission to those who will enter in by a living faith. Nothing can hinder the life-flow to those who believe, for all things are possible to them that believe.&rdquo;]</span></h5>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I wonder how many people there are here this afternoon who have missed the point. If I talked to you for a short time you would probably say to me, &ldquo;I had a wonderful vision when I was baptized.&rdquo; I want you to notice that this vision that Jesus gave to Paul was right on the threshold of his baptism. An inspired life is always on the very open door of the quickening of that life by the Spirit. I want you to notice also that when a man is born of God, or when, as it were, God is born into the man, and he becomes a quickened soul to carry out the convictions of the life of the Spirit of God in him&mdash;when he is born of God, instantly on the threshold of this new birth there comes a vision of what his life is to be. The question is whether you dare go through with it, whether you are going to hold ou to the very thing the Holy Ghost brought to you, and never lose sight of it, but press on in a life of devotion to God and of fellowship and unity with Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs53F207AF">A WARNING</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. That is what Paul did, that is what Jesus did, and that is what we all have to do. In this connection I want to say advisedly that when we are baptized with the gift of tongues we must not allow tongues to entertain us, nor he entertained with speaking in tongues. When you have accomplished one thing in the purpose of God for you, He mean you to go forward and accomplish another. As soon as you accomplish one thing it is, so to speak, no more to you, and God will enlarge you and fit you for the next thing He wants you to do. </span><span class="cs53F207AF">WHEN I WAS BAPTIZED IN THE HOLY GHOST</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> there was the unfolding of a new era of my life, and I passed into that and rejoiced in the fact of it, and others with me. But the moment I reached that, God has been ready with another ministry for me. If you are careful to watch for God, God is always caring for you. Jesus said: &ldquo;If you honor Me here, I will honor you yonder.&rdquo; Whatever it may be that you are working out for God here, He is working out a far greater, a Divine glory for you. You have no need to be constantly talking of what you are going to appear like in the glory. The chief thing you are to watch is that you realize within yourself a deeper manifestation of the power of God today than yesterday, that you have something more clear today of the mind of the Spirit than you had the day before, that nothing comes between you and God to cloud your mind. You are to see a </span><span class="cs53F207AF">VISION OF THE GLORY OF GOD</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> more today than yesterday, and to be living in such a state of bliss that it is heavenly to live. Paul lived in that ecstasy because he got into a place where the Holy Ghost could enlarge him more and more. I find that if I continually keep my mind upon God, He unfolds things to me, and if I obediently walk before God and keep my heart pure and clean and holy and right, He will always be lifting me higher than I have ever expected to be. </span></p><h3 class="cs662E67A8">
					<span class="cs93C970F9">IV</span></h3>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How does it come? On this line. In Romans 12:1, Paul speaks about a certain place being reached&mdash;he speaks about an altar on which he had laid himself. When he had experienced the mercies of the Lord he could do no other than make a presentation of his body on the altar, and it was always to be on the altar and never to be taken off. As soon as he got there he was at the place where the Holy Ghost could bring out of him &ldquo;things new and old,&rdquo; and, as we read in his Epistles, &ldquo;things&rdquo; which Peter said were &ldquo;hard to be understood.&rdquo; How was that? Because he so lived in the Spirit that God brought His mind into Paul&rsquo;s mind, so that the apostle could write and speak, as an oracle of the Holy Ghost, things which had never been in print before, things portraying the mind of God; and we read them today and drink them in as a river, and we come out of the Epistles, as it were, clothed with mighty power, the power of God Himself. How does it come? It comes when we are in </span><span class="cs53F207AF">A PLACE LOW ENOUGH</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and where God can pour in, pour in, pour in. Paul could say that not one thing that God had spoken of him had failed. In Acts 26 and Romans 15, you will find that he accomplished the whole of what Jesus said he would accomplish, when he was re-organized, or filled, or in-filled by the mighty power of God. God wants to do the same for you and for me, according to the gifts He has bestowed upon us. Shall we stop short of what He says we ought to be&mdash;shall we cease to come into line with the Mind which is always thinking for our best&mdash;shall we cease to humble ourselves before Him Who took the way of the Cross for us&mdash;shall we cease to withhold ourselves from Him Who could weep over the doomed city, from the Lord Jesus Christ Who &ldquo;trod the winepress alone&rdquo;&mdash;shall we cease to give Him our all? To what profit will it be if we hold back anything from Him Who gives us a thousand times more than ever He asks from us? In Hebrews 2 He says He is going to bring many sons to glory. Let that be your vision. If you have lost the vision, He is tender to those who cry to Him; from the broken heart </span><span class="cs53F207AF">HE NEVER TURNS AWAY</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and they that seek Him with a whole heart will find Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I speak to you this afternoon I feel somehow that my heart is very much enlarged, that my compassion for my Lord is intensified, that nothing is too hard. The people in the days of the apostles took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, and I feel there is a measure of grace given to the man who says, &ldquo;I will go all the way with Jesus.&rdquo; What is that measure of grace? It is a girding with hopefulness in pressing forward to the goal that God would have us reach. But it is important that we forget not Paul&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Let no man take thy crown.&rdquo; He saw there was a possibility lest any man who had been the means of sowing the good seed of the Gospel should lose that for which God had apprehended him. </span></p><h3 class="cs662E67A8">
					<span class="cs93C970F9">* * *</span></h3>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In closing, let me remind you that the Holy Ghost has brought us here. For what purpose has He brought us? Can anyone have come here, either seeker or speaker, without a cry to God to make some men today, as it were, flames of fire? My passion is that God shall endue this Convention with such an unction and cry that you won&rsquo;t be satisfied until you feel the very members of your body all on fire with a Spirit-kindled unity. It is not too late to don the girdle today, it is not too late to put on the armor of God, to put on the shield, to </span><span class="cs53F207AF">PUT ON THE SANDALS</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> better than ever before. This afternoon God wants me to know, and you to know, that experimentally we have only touched the very frill, the very edge, of this outpouring of the Spirit. If we do not allow God to fill us with Himself He will choose somebody else. If we do not fall into line with the will of God, there will be somebody else who will. God is able to raise up men to carry out His behests. The children were crying out one day, and the disciples rebuked them. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;if these were to hold their peace, the very stones,&rdquo; of which He could make bread&mdash;He could make them cry out. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs53F207AF">I HAVE A JESUS LIKE THAT</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, who call speak the word, and the thing is done; I have a Jesus indwelling me and vitalizing me with a faith that believes it is true; I have a Jesus within me who has never let me get faint-hearted or weary. Let us press on in faith along the line of God&rsquo;s will and the outpouring which we have longed to see will come. Cheer up, hold on, never let go the vision; be sure it is for you just as much as for anybody else, and God wll surely make it come to pass. Never look down, because then you will only see the ground and miss the vision. All blessings come from above; therefore keep your eye on Jesus. Never weary. If you do not fall out by the way, He will be with you to strengthen you in the way. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These are the last days; the days of the falling away. These are days when Satan is having a great deal of power. But we must keep in mind that Satan has no power only as he is allowed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is a great thing to know that God is loosing you from the world, loosing you from a thousand things. You must seek to have the mind of God on all things. If you don&rsquo;t, you will stop His working. I had to learn that as I was on the water en route to Australia. We stopped at a place called Aden, where they were selling all kinds of ware. Among other things were some beautiful rugs arid ostrich feathers in great quantities. There was a gentleman in &ldquo;first class&rdquo; who wanted feathers. He bought one lot and the next lot put up was too big; he did not want so many. He said to me, &ldquo;Will you join me?&rdquo; I knew I did not want feathers for I had no room or use for them and wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with them if I got them. However, he pleaded with me to join him. I perceived it was the Spirit as clearly as anything and I said, &ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo; So the feathers were knocked down for fifteen dollars. Then I found the man had no money on him. He had plenty in his cabin. I perceived it was the Spirit again, so it fell to my lot to pay for the feathers. He said to me, &ldquo;I will get the money and give it to one of the stewards.&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;No, that is not business. I am known all over the ship. You seek me out.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The man came and brought the money. I said, &ldquo;God wants me to talk to you. Now sit down.&rdquo; So he sat down and in ten minutes&rsquo; time the whole of his life was unhinged, unraveled, broken up, so broken that like a big baby he wept and cried for salvation. It was &ldquo;feathers&rdquo; that did it. But you know we shall never know the mind of God till we learn to </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">know</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the voice of God. The striking thing about Moses is that it took him forty years to learn human wisdom, forty years to know his helplessness, and forty years to live in the power of God. One hundred and twenty years it took to teach that man, and sometimes it seems to me it will take many years to bring us just where we can tell the voice of God, the leadings of God, and all His will concerning us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I see that all revelation, all illumination, everything that God had in Christ was to be brought forth into perfect light that we might be able to live the same, produce the same, and be in every activity sons of God with power. It must be so. We must not limit the Holy One. And we must clearly see that God brought us forth to make us supernatural, that we might be changed all the time on the line of the supernatural, that we may every day live so in the Spirit, that all of the revelations of God are just like a canvas thrown before our eyes, on which we see clearly step by step all the divine will of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Any assembly that puts its hand upon the working of the Spirit will surely dry up. The assembly must be as free in the Spirit as possible, and you must allow a certain amount of extravagance when people are getting through to God. Unless we are very wise, we can easily interfere and quench the power of God which is upon us. It is an evident fact that one man in a meeting, filled with unbelief, can make a place for the devil to have a seat. And it is very true, that if we are not careful we may quench the Spirit of some person who is innocent but incapable of helping himself. &ldquo;And ye that are strong must bear the infirmities of the weak.&rdquo; If you want an assembly full of life you must have one in which the Spirit of God is manifested. And in order to keep at the boiling pitch of that blessed incarnation of the Spirit, you must be as simple as babies; you must be as harmless as doves and as wise as serpents. I always ask God for a leading of grace. It takes grace to be in a meeting because it is so easy if you are not careful, to get on the natural side. The man who is a preacher, if he has lost the unction, will be well repaid if he will repent and get right with God and get the unction back. It never pays us to be less than always spiritual, and we must have a divine language and the language must be of God. Beloved, if you come into real perfect line with the grace of God, one thing will certainly take place in your life. You will change from that old position of the world&rsquo;s line where you were judging everybody; and where you were not trusting anyone, and come into a place where you will have a heart that will believe all things; a heart that under no circumstances reviles again when you are reviled. I know many of you think many times before you speak once. Here is a great word: &ldquo;For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf; but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.&rdquo; Innocent. No inward corruption or defilement, that is full of distrusts, but just a holy, divine likeness of Jesus that dares believe that God Almighty will surely watch over all. Hallelujah! &ldquo;There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall give His angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.&rdquo; The child of God who is rocked in the bosom of the Father has the sweetest touch of heaven, and the honey of the Word is always in it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If the saints only knew how precious they are in the sight of God they would scarcely be able to sleep for thinking of His watchful, loving care. Oh, He is a precious Jesus! He is a lovely Saviour! He is divine in all His attitude toward us, and makes our hearts to burn. There is nothing like it. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said on the road to Emmaus, &ldquo;did not our hearts burn within us as He walked with us and talked with us?&rdquo; Oh beloved, it must be so today. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Always keep in your mind the fact that the Holy Ghost must bring manifestation. We must understand that the Holy Ghost is breath, the Holy Ghost is Person, and it is the most marvelous thing to me to know that this Holy Ghost power can be in every part of your body. You can feel it from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. Oh, it is lovely to be burning all over with the Holy Ghost! And when that takes place there is nothing but the operation of the tongue that must give forth the glory and the praise. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You must be in the place of magnifying the Lord. The Holy Ghost is the great Magnifier of Jesus, the great Illuminator of Jesus. And so after the Holy Ghost comes in it is impossible to keep your tongue still. Why, you would burst if you didn&rsquo;t give Him utterance. Talk about a dumb baptized soul? Such a person is not to be found in the Scriptures, You will find that when you speak unto God in the new tongue He gives you, you enter into a close communion with Him hitherto never experienced. Talk about preaching! I would like to know how it will be possible for all the people filled with the Holy Ghost to stop preaching. Even the sons and daughters must prophesy. After the Holy Ghost comes in a man is in a new order in God. And you will find it so real that you will want to sing, talk, laugh, and shout. We are in a strange place when the Holy Ghost comes in. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If the incoming of the Spirit is lovely, what must be the onflow? The incoming is only to be an onflow. I am very interested in scenery. When I was in Switzerland I wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied till I went to the top of the mountain, though I like the valleys also. On the summit of the mountain the sun beats on the snow and sends the water trickling down the mountains right through to the meadows. Go there and see if you can stop it. Just so in the spiritual. God begins with the divine flow of His eternal power which is the Holy Ghost, and you cannot stop it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We must always clearly see that the Baptism with the Spirit must make us ministering spirits. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Peter and John had been baptized only a short time. Did they know what they had? No I defy you to know what you have. No one knows what he has in the Baptism with the Holy Ghost. You have no conception of it. You cannot measure it by any human standards. It is greater than any man has any idea of, and consequently those two disciples had no idea what they had. For the first time after they were baptized in the Holy Ghost they came down to the Gate Beautiful. There they saw the man sitting who for forty years had been lame. What was the first thing after they saw him? Ministration. What was the second? Operation. What was the third? Manifestation, of course. It could not be otherwise. You will always find that this order in the Scripture will be carried out in everybody. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I clearly see that we ought to have spiritual giants in the earth, mighty in apprehension, amazing in activity, always having a wonderful report because of their activity in faith. I find instead that there are many people who perhaps have better discernment than you, better knowledge of the Word than you, but they have failed to put it into practice, so these gifts lie dormant. I am here to help you to begin on the sea of life with mighty acts in the power of God through the gifts of the Spirit. You will find that this which I am speaking on is out of knowledge derived from a wonderful experience in many lands. The man who is filled with the Holy Ghost is always acting. You read the first verse of the Acts of the Apostles, &ldquo;Jesus began both to do and teach.&rdquo; He began to do first, and so must we. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, we must see that the Baptism with the Holy Ghost is an activity with an outward manifestation, When I was in Norway God was mightily moving there, though I had to talk by interpretation. However, God always worked in a wonderful way. One day we met a man who stopped the three men I was with, one being the interpreter. I was walking on but I saw he was in a dilemma so I turned back, and said to the interpreter, &ldquo;What is the trouble?&rdquo; &ldquo;This man&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is so full of neuralgia that he is almost blind and he is in a terrible state.&rdquo; As soon as ever they finished the conversation I said to the spirit that was afflicting him, &ldquo;Come out of him in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; And the man said, &ldquo;It is all gone! It is all gone! I am free.&rdquo; Ah, brothers, we have no conception of what God has for us! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will tell you what happened in Sydney, Australia, A man with a stick passed a friend and me. He had to get down and then twist over, and the tortures of his face made a deep impression on my soul. I asked myself, &ldquo;Is it right to pass this man?&rdquo; So I said to my friend, &ldquo;There is a man in awful distress and I cannot go further, I must speak to him.&rdquo; I went over to this man and said to him, &ldquo;You seem to be in great trouble.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am no goad and never will be.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You see that hotel. Be in front of that door in five minutes and I will pray for you, and you shall be as straight as any man in this place.&rdquo; This is on the line of activity in the faith of Jesus. I came back after paying a bill, and he was there. I will never forget him wondering if he was going to be trapped, or what was up that a man should stop him in the street and tell him he should be made straight. I had said it, so it must be. If you say anything you must stand with God to make it so. Never say anything for bravado, without you have the right to say it. Always be sure of your ground, and that you are honoring God. If there is anything about it to make </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">you</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> anything, it will bring you sorrow. Your whole ministry will have to be on the line of grace and blessing. We helped him up the two steps, passed him through to the elevator and took him upstairs. It seemed difficult to get him from the elevator to my bedroom, as though Satan was making the last stroke for his life, but we got him there. Then in five minutes&rsquo; time this man walked out of that bedroom as straight as any man in this place, He walked perfectly and declared he hadn&rsquo;t a pain in his body. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh brother, it is ministration, it is operation, it is manifestation! Those are three of the leading principles of the Baptism with the Holy Ghost. And we must see to it that God is producing these three through us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Bible is the Word of God, it has the truths and whatever people may say of them they stand stationary, unmovable. Not one jot or tittle shall fail of all His good promises. His word will came forth. In heaven it is settled, on earth it must be made manifest that He is the God of everlasting power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants manifestation and He wants His glory to be seen. He wants us all to be filled with that line of thought that He can look upon us and delight in us subduing the world unto Him. And so you are going to miss a great deal if you don&rsquo;t begin to act. But once you begin to act in the order of God, you will find that God establishes your faith and from that day starts you on the line of the promises. When will you begin? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In a place in England I was dealing on the lines of faith and what would take place if we believed God. Many things happened. But when I got away it appeared one man who worked in the colliery had heard me. He was in trouble with a stiff knee. He said to his wife, &ldquo;I cannot help but think every day that that message of Wigglesworth&rsquo;s was to stir us to do something. I cannot get away from it. All the men in the pit know how I walk with a stiff knee, and you know how you have wrapped it around with yards of flannel. Well, I am going to act. You have to be the congregation.&rdquo; He got his wife in front of him, &ldquo;I am going to act and do just like Wigglesworth did.&rdquo; He got hold of his leg unmercifully saying, &ldquo;Come out, you devils, came out! In the name of Jesus. Now Jesus help me. Come out you devils, come out.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Wife they are gone! Wife, they are gone. This is too good. I am going to act now.&rdquo; So he went to his place of worship and all the collier boys were there. It was a prayer meeting. As he told them this story these men became delighted. They said, &ldquo;Jack, come over here and help me.&rdquo; And Jack went. As soon as he was through in one home he was invited to another, loosing these people of the pains they had gotten in the colliery. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Ah, brothers and sisters, we have no idea what God. has for us if we will only begin! But oh, the grace we need! We may make a mishap. If you do it outside of Him, if you do it for yourself, and if you want to be some one, it will be a failure. We shall only be able to do well as we do it in the name of Jesus. Oh the love that God&rsquo;s Son can put into us if we are only humble enough, weak enough, and helpless enough to know that except He does it, it will not be done! &ldquo;What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive and ye shall have them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit, walk in the communion of the Spirit, talk with God. All leadings of the divine order are for you. I pray that if there are any who have turned to their own way and have made God second, they will come to repentance on all lines. Separate yourself from every earthly touch and touch ideals. And God will bring you to an end of yourself. Begin with God this moment. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">From </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Confidence</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April/June 1924.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord Jesus came to bring back to us what was forfeited in the Garden. Adam and Eve were there&mdash;free from sin and disease&mdash;and first sin came, then disease, and then death came after, and people want to say it is not so! But I tell you, &ldquo;Get the Devil out of you, and you will have a different body. Get disease out, and you will get the Devil out.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus rebuked sickness, and it went, and so I want to bring you to a place where you will see that you are healed. You must give God your life; you must see that sickness has to go and God has to come in; that your lives have to be clean, and God will keep you holy; that you have to walk before God, and He will make you perfect, for God says, &ldquo;Without holiness no man shall see Him,&rdquo; and as we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, cleanseth us from all sin. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to say to you believers that there is a very blessed place for you to attain to, and the place where God wants you is a place of victory. When the Spirit of the Lord comes into your life it must be victory. The disciples, before they received the Holy Ghost, were always in bondage. Jesus said to them one day, just before the Crucifixion, &ldquo;One of you shall betray Me,&rdquo; and they were so conscious of their inability and their human depravity and helplessness that they said one to another, &ldquo;Is it I?&rdquo; And then Peter was ashamed that he had taken that stand, and he rose up and said, &ldquo;Though all men deny Thee, yet will not I.&rdquo; And likewise the others rose and declared that neither would they; but they&mdash;every one&mdash;did leave Him. But, beloved, after they received the power of the enduement of the Holy Ghost upon them, if you remember, they were made like lions to meet any difficulty. They were made to stand any test, and these men that failed before the Crucifixion, when the power of God fell upon them in the upper room, they came out in front of all those people who were gathered together and accused them of crucifying the Lord of Glory. They were bold. What had made them so? I will tell you. Purity is bold. Take, for instance, a little child. It will gaze straight into your eyes for as long as you like, without winking once. The more pure, the more bold; and I tell you God wants to bring us into that Divine purity of heart and life&mdash;that holy boldness. Not officiousness; not swelled-headedness; not self-righteousness; but a pure, holy, Divine appointment by One Who will come in and live with you, defying the powers of Satan, and standing you in a place of victory&mdash;overcoming the world. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You never inherited that from the flesh. That is a gift of God, by the Spirit, to all who obey. And so, none can say they wish they were overcomers, but that they have failed and failed until they have no hope. Brother, God can make </span><span class="cs53F207AF">YOU</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> an overcomer. When the Spirit of God comes into your body He will transform you, He will quicken you. Oh, there is a life in the Spirit which makes you free from the law of sin and death, and there is an audacity about it&mdash;also there is a personality about it. It is the personality of the Deity. It is God in you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I tell you that God is able to so transform and change and bring you into order by the Spirit that you can become a new creation after God&rsquo;s order. There is no such thing as defeat for the believer. Without the Cross, without Christ&rsquo;s righteousness, without the new birth, without the indwelling Christ, without this Divine incoming of God, I see myself a failure. But God, the Holy Ghost, can come in and take our place till we are renewed in righteousness&mdash;made the children of God. Nay, verily, the Sons of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you think that God would make you to be a failure? God has never made man to be a failure. He made man to be a &ldquo;Son&rdquo;; to walk about the earth in power; and so when I look at you I know that there is a capability that can be put into you which has the capacity of controlling and bringing everything into subjection. Yes, there is the capacity of the power of Christ to dwell in you, to bring every evil thing under you till you can put your feet upon it, and be master over the flesh and the devil; till within you there is nothing rises except that which will magnify and glorify the Lord; and God wants me to show you these disciples, who were so frail, like you and me, that we, too, may now be filled with God, and become pioneers of this wonderful truth I am preaching. Here we see Peter, frail, helpless, and, at every turn of the tide, a failure. And God filled that man with the Spirit of His righteousness, till he went up and down, bold as a lion, and when he came to death&mdash;even crucifixion&mdash;he counted himself unworthy of being crucified like his Lord, and asked that his murderers would put him head downwards on the tree. There was a deep submissiveness, and a power that was greater than all flesh. Peter had changed into the power of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Scriptures do not tell two stories. They tell the truth. I want you to know the truth, and the truth will set you free. What is truth? Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.&rdquo; &ldquo;He that believeth on Me, as the Scriptures have said, out of his innermost being shall flow forth rivers of living water.&rdquo; This He spake of the Spirit that should be given them after Jesus was glorified. I do not find anything in the Bible but holiness, and nothing in the world but worldliness. Therefore if I live in the world I shall become worldly; but, on the other hand, if I live in the Bible, I shall become holy. This is the truth, and the truth will set you free. The power of God can remodel you. He can make you hate sin and love righteousness. He can take away bitterness and hatred and covetousness and malice, and can so consecrate you by His power, through His blood, that you are made pure&mdash;every bit holy. Pure in mind, heart and actions&mdash;pure, right through. God has given me the way of life, and I want to give it to you, as though this were the last day I had to live. Jesus is the best there is for you, and you can each take Him away with you. God gave His Son to be the propitiation for your sins, and not only so, but also for the sins of the whole world. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus came to make us free from sin&mdash;free from disease and pain. When I see any who are diseased and in pain, I have great compassion for them, and when I lay my hands upon them, I know God means men to be so filled with Him that the power of sin shall have no effect upon them, and they shall go forth, as I am doing, to help the needy, sick, and affiicted. But what is the main thing? To preach the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. Jesus came to do this. John came preaching repentance. The disciples began by preaching repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and I tell you, beloved, if you have really been changed by God, there is a repentance in your heart never to be repented of. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Through the revelation of the Word of God we find that Divine healing is solely for the glory of God, and salvation is to make you to know that now you have to be inhabited by another, even God, and you have to walk with God in newness of life. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Brother Smith Wigglesworth writes, &ldquo;After seven weeks in Switzerland, I had a call into Italy to visit some sick one belonging to two of the people who were baptized in my first visit to Switzerland five years ago. After a week of much blessing, they came with me to Florence, Rome and Naples. I had the joy of my life preaching in Rome. I prayed much about this, that God would provide me with an interpreter, and the first man I met in Rome was a man that was in my meetings in San Jose, an Italian, and he really did good work for me. We had a great meeting that reminded me of a red-hot Welsh revival. I had a great crowd of Italians crying to God for mercy, many fine men among them, and after this, many seeking the Baptism. Quite a number received and others were under the power. A number were healed. They now want me to go back to them again. I was given to understand that there are many Pentecostal meetings in Italy.&rdquo; Brother Wigglesworth is now on his way to Ceylon and is looking forward to working with the missionaries in Ceylon and India during the next few months.

Christ said, &ldquo;Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&rdquo; Because you are free you step into the liberty of freed men and claim the possessions of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is the dispensation of the Holy Ghost. It is 33 years since God filled me with the Holy Ghost. The fire burned in my bosom then and it is still burning, producing more activity for God than 33 years ago. The Holy Spirit is not played out. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God is waiting for people who dare to believe, and when you believe all things are possible. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Only believe, only believe;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">All things are possible, only believe.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Only believe, only believe;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">All things are possible, only believe.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants to sweep away all unbelief from your heart and for you to dare to believe His Word. It is the Word of the Spirit. If you allow anything to come in between you and the Word, it will poison your whole system, and you will have no hope. One bit of unbelief against that Word is poison. It is like the devil putting a spear into you. The Word of Life is the breath of heaven, the quickening power by which your very life is changed, and you begin to bear the image of the heavenly. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A young man in South Africa, who was dying of consumption, read my book, &ldquo;Ever-Increasing Faith.&rdquo; He was saved and then God healed him. This young man grew so in the knowledge of God that he was made a pastor. When I arrived in South Africa, five years ago, he came up to me like a son to a father, and said, &ldquo;If you like, I will go with you all the way over South Africa.&rdquo; He bought the best car for the job. If you go to South Africa you must have a car to go through the ploughed fields, one that will jump the hedges, jump in the river and jump out again. That young man drove us 5,000 miles through all the territories, right among the Zulus, and God took us through everything. Talk about life, why this is overcoming life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I arrived in Capetown a man was there whose deathly face was filled with the very devil&rsquo;s manifestation of cancer. I said to the people, &ldquo;There is a man in the place suffering with a tremendous thing. He does not know I am talking about him at all. You can have the choice. If you desire me to deliver that man, so that he can enjoy the meeting, I will go down in the name of the Lord and deliver him, or I will preach.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Come down.&rdquo; I went down and the people saw what God can do, saw that man shouting, raving, for he was like a man that was intoxicated. He was shouting, &ldquo;I am free! I have been bound.&rdquo; It was a wonderful thing to see that man changed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One man after laying out $4,500 upon his wife for operation after operation, year by year, brought her helpless to the the meeting. I went to her and said, &ldquo;Look here, this is the greatest opportunity of your life. I will give an altar call tonight. There will be fifty people come up, and when you see them loosed, you believe, and you, will be loosed like them, and then we shall have a testimony from you.&rdquo; They came and my hands were laid upon them in the name of the Lord. I said, &ldquo;Testify,&rdquo; and they testified. This woman saw their faces, and when all these people were through I said, &ldquo;Do you believe?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I cannot help but believe.&rdquo; There is something in the manifestation of faith. I laid hands upon her in the name of Jesus and the power af God went right through her. I said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus, arise and walk.&rdquo; An impossibility? If you do not venture, you remain ordinary as long as you live. If you dare the impossible then God will abundantly do far above all you ask or think. As if a cannon had blown her up, she rose. I thought her husband would go mad with joy and excitement because he saw his wife mightily moved by the power of God and made free. She was in the first meeting afterwards to glorify God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The divine plan is so much greater than all human thought. When we are willing to yield to His sovereign will, when we have no reserve, how wonderful God is, always willing to open the door till our whole life is filled with the fragrance of heaven. Jesus is the substance and fullness of the divine nature, and He dwells in our hearts. Oh, this wonderful, fascinating Jesus! What a wonderful Jesus we have! Something about Him kindles fire in the darkest place. Something about our Lord makes all darkness light. When we have Him we have more than we can speak about or think about. God&rsquo;s Son can set the world ablaze and bring heaven right into the place where we live. Dare to believe God, and nothing shall be impossible to you. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Hebrews 11:1-3. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Faith is a reality, and God wants to I bring us to the fact of it. He wants us to know that we have something greater than we can see or handle, because everything we can see and handle is going to pass away. The heavens are going to be wrapped up and the earth melt with fervent heat, but the word of the Lord shall abide for ever. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Through faith we understand that the worlds were made by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.&rdquo; God spoke the word and made the world, and I want to impress upon you this wonderful word which made the world. I am saved by the incorruptible word, the word that made the world, and so my position by faith is to lay hold of the things which cannot be seen, and believe the things which cannot be understood. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Faith lives in a commanding position where you know God will work the miracle, if you dare to stand upon the Word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul related his conversion many times over, and I believe it is good to rehearse what God has done for you. I have been privileged to be in many parts of the world, and have seen that God has arranged a plan for me. I said to our people, &ldquo;The Lord is moving me to go out through the States and Canada.&rdquo; When the Lord told me I said, &ldquo;Lord, you have three things to do; you have to find money for home; and find money to go; and you have to give me a real change, for you know that sometimes my mind or memory is no good at all to me.&rdquo; Straight away money came from all over and I said, &ldquo;It is true God is sending me. I have already $250.&rdquo; I went to Liverpool and a man said, &ldquo;Here is $25 for you.&rdquo; When I was on the ship a lady, poorly dressed, gave me a red sugar bag; and when the ship went I opened the red sugar bag and there was $250. Just as I was getting on the ship a man came and gave me a book and said, &ldquo;There is a leaf for every day in the year.&rdquo; The Lord said to me, &ldquo;Put down everything that takes place in the month.&rdquo; I did so, and I had a memory like an encyclopedia. You see, I never learned geography, and God sent me all over the world to see it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord has a way of making you equal to live in a place of command in the power of the Holy Ghost so long as you have learned the lesson needed. God will make us know how to live. I went to a Quakers&rsquo; meeting, quiet and still, and there was such a silence that I was moved. You know it is of faith, and so I jumped up and I had the time of my life. All these Quakers came round me. They said, &ldquo;You are the first man that we have ever seen in this place who was so quickly led by the Spirit.&rdquo; John says it is the unction of the Holy One, and you need no man to teach you, it is the Holy Ghost who teaches. It is simplicity itself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When the ship began to move I said to the people, &ldquo;I am going to preach on this ship on Sunday. Will you come and hear me preach?&rdquo; They said no. Later they came around again and said, &ldquo;We are going to have an entertainment and we would like you to be in it.&rdquo; So I said, &ldquo;Come in a quarter of an hour and I will tell you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They came round again and said, &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I told them, &ldquo;I have got a clear witness that I have to be in the entertainment.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Well, what can you do?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I can sing.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Now we want to know what position you would like to have on the program.&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Tell me what you are going to have on the program.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Recitations, instruments and many things.&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;What do you finish up with?&rdquo; &ldquo;A dance,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;Well, put me down just before the dance.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I went to the entertainment and when I saw the clerical gentlemen trying to please the people it turned me to prayer. Every hour had been bathed in prayer. When they had all done their pieces, my turn came and I went up to the piano with my &ldquo;Redemption Song.&rdquo; A lady who was rather less than half dressed, when she saw the music said, &ldquo;I cannot play this kind of music.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Be at peace, young lady, I have music and words inside.&rdquo; So I sang: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">If I could only tell Him as I know Him,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">My Redeemer who has brightened all my way;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">If I could tell how precious is His presence,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">I am sure that you would make Him yours today.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Could I tell it, Could I tell it,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">How the sunshine of His presence lights my way,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">I would tell it, I would tell it,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">And I&rsquo;m sure that you would make Him yours today.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God took it up, and from the last to the greatest they were weeping. They did not have a dance hut they had a prayer meeting, and six young men were saved by the power of God in my cabin. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Every day God was saving people on that ship. I never can forget a young man and woman who came to me. They were paid to look after a lady and gentleman in the first class. They said, &ldquo;Our lady is in great distress. She is a Christian Scientist and she gets no relief. She has brought a doctor and he gives her no hope, and now she is in despair and we have told her about you.&rdquo; They brought me to the door which they opened and I went in and stood at the door just inside. I looked at the lady who was in a poor state of health, and said, &ldquo;I am not going to preach, I am going to stand here and pray, and I believe as I pray you will be perfectly healed.&rdquo; While I was praying God healed her, and she shouted. She said, &ldquo;This is something new; come over, will you?&rdquo; I had the opportunity of bringing that woman into the fulness of redemption. God delivered her and she said she would not rest until she had gone through all England in Christian Science and had told them about the blood of Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Live in the Acts of the Apostles and you will see every day some miracle wrought by the power of the living God. Do not fail to claim your holy position so that you will overcome the power of the devil. The best time you have is when you have the most difficult position. Sometimes the strangest things happen for the furtherance of the gospel. I was at Southampton station and there were four men to see me into the train. They knew everything and I knew nothing, only I soon found that I was in the wrong carriage. There was a man in the carriage, and I said to him, &ldquo;I have been to Bournemouth before, but I do not seem to be on the way. Where are you going?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am going to South Wales.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, if I am wrong I am right. I have never once been wrong in my life only when I have been right.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I asked, &ldquo;What is the Lord Jesus Christ to you? He is my personal Friend and Saviour.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I do not thank you to speak to me about these things.&rdquo; The train stopped and I said to the porter, &ldquo;Am I right for Bournemouth? How many stops?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Three.&rdquo; I said to the man, &ldquo;It has to be settled before I leave the train; you are going to hell.&rdquo; That man wished he had never met me. The train stopped and I had to get out. I said, &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I will make Him my own.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We are born of the incorruptible Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever, which made the world and brought into existence things that were not there, and there was nothing made but what He made, and so I realize I am made twice. I was made first by the creation of God. The next time I was begotten in a moment of time, eternally begotten, and if you believe in your heart you can begin to say, and whatsoever you say will come to pass if you believe in your heart. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man came to me with two people assisting him. He said, &ldquo;Can you help me?&rdquo; He had a cancer in his chest, and when they operated they found the cancer entwined about the swallow. They took away the cancer and the only way to save his life was to take away the swallow. Now they knew he could never eat again, so they made a hole in his stomach with a tube. So for three months before he came to me he was feeding himself with different juices made by his wife, and they were pouring the liquid in. He was just a shadow of what life ought to be. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Could I help him? For faith is a fact, and as you live in the glorious possession of God&rsquo;s wealth, you will find how wonderful it is. When this man stood before me I believed what Jesus said in Mark 11.23, &ldquo;Believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Listen, you shall eat a good supper.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I cannot swallow.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Listen, you shall eat a good supper. Take him home.&rdquo; His wife asked, &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Nothing! You know I cannot swallow, but he has told me I shall eat a good supper tonight in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He was ravenously hungry and he ate all his wife could give him. I had no need to go. All I had to do was to believe. As he chewed and chewed, God made his swallow as perfect as ever it was, and the food went down until he was full up. They had such joy, and when they woke the next morning they began to talk about the remarkable thing. He looked down to see the hole that the doctors had made, but God had closed it up. He had been a policeman in Switzerland, and as he went round again the people came out and said, &ldquo;Let us go out and look at -----.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am just full to overflowing with praises to God for the faith that works impossibilities.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Ask God to give you the grace to use the faith you have. Peter had like precious faith. When you were saved it was by the like precious faith, wonderful faith. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, January 17, 1942.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the first chapter of Mark we read of John the Baptist who was filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother&rsquo;s womb. Because of this mighty infilling there was a mighty message on his lips. It was foretold of John by the prophet Isaiah, that be would be the voice of one crying in the wilderness. He was to lift up his voice with strength, and cry to the cities of Judah, &ldquo;Behold your God!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And so we find John as he pointed to Jesus, crying out, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God,&rdquo; proclaiming Him the One of whom Abraham prophesied when he said to his son Isaac, &ldquo;The Lord will provide </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Himself</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> a lamb&rdquo;&mdash;the Lamb of God and God the Lamb. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">John was so filled with the Spirit of God that the cry he raised moved all Israel. This shows that when God gets hold of a man and fills him with the Spirit, he can have a cry, a message, a proclamation of the gospel that will move people. The man who does not have the Spirit of the Lord may cry for fifty years and nobody take notice of him. The man who is filled with the Spirit of God needs to cry out but once and people will feel the effect of it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This should teach us that there is a necessity for everyone of us to be filled with the Spirit of God. It is not sufficient just to have a touch or to have usually a desire. There is only one thing that will meet the needs of the people today, and that is to be immersed in the life of God&mdash;God taking you and filling you with His Spirit, until you live right in God and God lives in you; so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, it shall be all for the glory of God. In that place you will find that all your strength and all your mind and all your soul are filled with zeal, not only for worship, but to proclaim the gospel message, a proclamation that is accompanied by the power of God which must defeat Satanic power, discomfit the world, and redound to the glory of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The reason the world today is not seeing Jesus is because </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Christian people are not filled with the Spirit of Christ</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. They are satisfied with going to church, occasionally reading the Bible, and sometimes praying. Beloved, if God lays hold of you by the Spirit, you will find that there is an end to everything of the old life. All the old things will have passed away, and all things will have become new&mdash;all things are of God. You will find that as you are wholly yielded to God, your whole being will be transformed by the divine indwelling. He will take you in hand so that you may become a vessel unto honor. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our lives are not to be for ourselves, for if we live for self, we shall die. If we seek to save our lives we shall lose them, but if we lose our lives we shall save them. If we through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, we shall live, live a life of freedom and joy and blessing and service, a life that will bring blessing to others. God would have us to see that we must be filled with the Spirit, every day live in the Spirit and walk in the Spirit, and be continually renewed in the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Study the life of Jesus. It was quite a natural thing for Him after He had served a whole day among the multitude, to want to go to His Father to pray all night. Why? He wanted a renewing of divine strength and power. He wanted fellowship with His Father. His Father would speak to Him the word that He was to bring to others, and would empower Him afresh for new ministry. He would come from those hours of sweet communion and fellowship with His Father, clothed with His holy presence and Spirit, and anointed with the Holy Spirit and power He would go about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the enemy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When He met sickness it had to leave. He came from that holy time of communion with power to meet the needs of the people, whatever they were. It is an awful thing for me to see people who profess to be Christians lifeless and powerless. The place of holy communion is open to us all. There is a place where we can be daily refreshed and renewed and re-empowered. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the 4th chapter of Hebrews we are told, &ldquo;There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works.&rdquo; Oh, what a blessed rest that is, to cease from your own works, to come to the place where God is now enthroned in your life, working in you day by day to will and to do His good pleasure, working in you an entirely new order of things. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants to bring you forth as a flame of fire, with a message from God, with a truth that shall defeat the powers of Satan, with an unlimited supply for every needy soul. So, just as John moved the whole of Israel with a mighty cry, you too by the power of the Holy Ghost will move the people so that they repent and cry, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is what Jesus meant when He said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God... that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.&rdquo; If we only knew what these words mean to us, to be born of God! An infilling of the life of God, a new life from God, a new creation, living in the world but not of the world, knowing the blessedness of that word, &ldquo;Sin shall not have dominion over you.&rdquo; How shall we reach this place in the Spirit? By the provision of the Holy Spirit that He makes. If we live in the Spirit we shall find all that is carnal swallowed up in life. There is an infilling of the Spirit which quickens our mortal bodies. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Give God your life, and you will see that sickness has to go when God comes in fully. Then you are to walk before God, and you will find that He will perfect that which concerns you. That is the place where He wants believers to live, the place where the Spirit of the Lord comes into your whole being. That is the place of victory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Look at the disciples. Before they received the Holy Spirit they were in bondage. When Christ said, &ldquo;One of you shall betray Me,&rdquo; they were all doubtful of themselves and said, &ldquo;Is it I?&rdquo; They were conscious of their human depravity and helplessness. Peter said, &ldquo;Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny Thee.&rdquo; The others declared the same; yet they all forsook Him, and fled. But after the power of God fell upon them in the upper room, they were like lions to meet difficulty. They were bold. What made them so? The purity and power that is by the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God can make you an overcomer. When the Spirit of God comes into your surrendered being He transforms you. There is a life in the Spirit that makes you free, and there is an audacity about it, and there is a personality in it&mdash;it is God in you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God is able to so transform you and change you, that all the old order has to go before God&rsquo;s new order. Do you think that God will make you to be a failure? God never made man to be a failure. He made man to be a son, to walk the earth in the power of the Spirit, master over the flesh and the devil, until nothing arises within him except that which will magnify and glorify the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus came to set us free from sin, to free us from sickness, so that we should go forth in the power of the Spirit and minister to the needy, sick and affiicted. Through the revelation of the Word of God, we find that divine healing is solely for the glory of God, and that salvation is walking in newness of life so that we are inhabited by Another, even God. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">Preached at Bowland Street Mission, March 1917.<br/>Published in </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Confidence</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, May/June 1917.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">1 Peter 1:3: &ldquo;Being begotten again unto a living hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In 1 Corinthians 15, we read of the glorious fact of Christ the first-fruits. A farmer goes over his land eagerly scanning the first ears of corn that show themselves above the soil because he knows, as the first beginnings, so may the harvest be. And just in the measure as Jesus Christ is risen from the dead, so are we. As He is, so are we in this world. Christ is now getting the Church ready for translation. Here, we read in Peter, &ldquo;We are begotten again into a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; Oh, to be changed&mdash;a living fact in the body. Just as in the flesh Jesus triumphed by the Spirit. Oh, to be like Him! What a living hope it is! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul and Peter were very little together, but both were inspired to bring before the vision of the church this wonderful truth of the living being changed. If Christ rose not, our faith is vain, we are yet in our sins, it has no foundation. But Christ has risen and become the first-fruits, and we have now the glorious hope that we shall be so changed. We who were not a people are now the people of God. Born out of due time, out of the mire, to be among princes. Beloved, God wants us to see the preciousness of it. It will drive away the dulness of life; it is here set above all other things. Jesus gave all for this treasure. He purchased the field because of the pearl, the pearl of great price&mdash;the substratum of humanity. Jesus purchased it, and we are the pearl of great price for all time. Our inheritance is in Heaven, and in 1 Thessalonians 4:18, we are told to comfort one another with these words. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What can you have better in the world than the hope that in a little while the change will come. It seems such a short time since I was a boy; in a little while I shall be changed by His grace and be more than a conqueror in an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away. The inheritance is in you, something that is done for you, accomplished by God for you; a work of God wrought out for us by Himself, an inheritance incorruptible. When my daughter was in Africa she often wrote of things &ldquo;corroding.&rdquo; We have a corruptible nature, but, as the natural decays, the spiritual man is at work. As the corruptible is doing its work we are changing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When will it be seen? When Jesus comes. Most beautiful of all, we shall be like Him. What is the process? Grace! What can work it out? Love! Love! Love! It cannot be rendered in human phrases. God so loved that He gave Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is something very wonderful about being undefiled, there in the presence of my King to be undefiled, never to change, only to be more beautiful. Unless we know something about grace and the omnipotence of His love, we should never be able to grasp it. Love, fathomless as the sea. Grace flowing for you and for me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He has prepared a place for us, a place which will fit in beautifully, with no fear of anyone else taking it; reserved. When I went to a certain meeting I had a seat reserved and numbered. I could walk in any time. What is there in the reserving? Having a place where we can see Him; the very seat we would have chosen. He knows just what we want! There will be no brokenness or jar or wish to have come sooner. He has made us for the place. The beginning of all joys. He loved me so; no jar throughout all eternity. Will you be there? Is it possible for us to miss it? We are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What is there peculiar about it? The fulness of perfection, the ideal of love&mdash; the beatitudes worked in. The poor in spirit, the mourners, the meek, the hungry and thirsty, the merciful, the pure&mdash;all ready to be revealed at the appearing of Jesus Christ. You could not remain there but for the purifying, the perfecting, the establishing; working out His perfect will when ready! Refined enough, you will go. But there is something to be done yet to establish you, to make you purer. A great price has been paid. The trial of your faith is more precious than gold that perisheth. (Men are losing their heads for gold.) And we must give all, yield all, as our Great Refiner puts us again and again in the melting pot; what for? To lose the chaff, that the pure gold of His presence is so clearly seen and His glorious image reflected. From glory to glory even by the Spirit of the Lord. We must be steadfast, immovable, until all His purposes are wrought out. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Praising God on this line in a meeting is a different thing to the time when you are faced with a hard career: there must be no perishing though we are tried by fire. What is going to appear at the appearing of Jesus? Faith! Faith! The establishing of your heart by the grace of the Spirit, not to crush, but to refine; not to destroy, but to enlarge you. Oh, beloved, to make you know the enemy as a defeated foe, and Jesus not only conquering but displaying the spoils of conquest. The pure in heart shall see God. If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. What is it? Loyalty to the Word by the power of the Blood. You know your inheritance within you is more powerful than all that is without. How many have gone to the stake and through fiery persecution? Did they desire it? Faith tried by fire had power to stand all ridicule, all slander. The faith of the Son of God who, for the joy that was set before Him, endured the Cross. Oh, the joy bf pleasing Him. No trial, no darkness; nothing too hard for me. If only I may see the image of my Lord in it again and again. He removes the skimmings until in the melting pot His face is seen. When it reflects Him, it is pure. Who is looking into our hearts? Who is the refiner? My Lord. He will only remove that which will hinder. Oh, I know the love of God is working out in my heart a great purpose of reality. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I remember going to the Crystal Palace when General Booth had a review of representatives of the Salvation Army from all nations. It was a grand sight as company after company with all their peculiar characteristics passed a certain place where he could view them. It was a wonderful scene. We are going to be presented to Him. The trials are getting us ready for the procession and the presentation. We are to be a joy to look at, to be to His praise and glory. No one will be there but the tried by fire. Is it worth it? Yes, a thousand times. Oh, the ecstasy of exalted pleasure. A God thus reveals Himself to our hearts. Verse 22 speaks of unfeigned faith and unfeigned love. What it means to have unfeigned faith! When ill-used, put to shame, or whatever the process, it never alters, only to be more refined, more like unto Him. Unfeigned love full of appreciation for those who do not see eye to eye with you. &ldquo;Father, forgive them.&rdquo; Remember Stephen: &ldquo;Lay not this sin to their charge.&rdquo; Unfeigned love is the greatest thing God can bestow on my heart. Verse 23 shows we are saved by a power incorruptible&mdash;a process always refining, a grace always enlarging, a glory always increasing, thus we are made neither barren nor unfruitful, in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. The spirits of just men made perfect are garnered in the treasury of the Most High. Purified as sons. To go out no more. To be as He is&mdash;holy, blameless. Through all eternity to gaze upon Him with pure, unfeigned love. God glorified in the midst, as the whole company of Heaven cry out: &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.&rdquo; Verse 35: And this is the Word which by the gospel is preached unto you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How can we be sad, or hang our heads or be distressed? Oh, if we only knew how rich we are! Blessed be the name of the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, May 28, 1932.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus saith, &ldquo;Be not afraid, only believe.&rdquo; The people in whom God delights are the ones who rest upon His word without wavering. God has nothing for the man who wavers, for &ldquo;let him that wavereth expect nothing from God.&rdquo; Therefore I would like us to get this verse deep down into our hearts, until it penetrates every fibre of our being: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Only believe! Only believe! All </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">things are possible</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&mdash;</span><span class="cs53F207AF">ONLY BELIEVE</span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has a plan for this meeting, beyond anything that we have ever known before. He has a plan for every individual life, and if we have any other plan in view, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">we miss the grandest plan of all!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Nothing of the past is equal to the present, and nothing of the present can equal the things of tomorrow, for &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; should be so filled with holy expectations that we will be &ldquo;living flames&rdquo; for Him. God never intended His people to be ordinary, or commonplace; His intentions were that they should be on fire for Him, conscious of His divine power, realizing the glory of the Cross that foreshadows the Crown. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has given us a very special scripture for this service: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;And in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint unto this business ... and the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip...&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">During the time of the inauguration of the Church the disciples were hard pressed on all lines; the things of natural order could not be attended to, and many were complaining concerning the neglect of their widows. The disciples therefore decided upon a plan, which was to choose seven men to do the work&mdash;men who were &ldquo;full of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; What a divine thought! No matter what kind of work was to be done, however menial it may have been, the person chosen must be </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">filled with the Holy Ghost</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. The plan of the Church was that everything, even of natural order, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">must be sanctified unto God</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, for the Church had to be a Holy Ghost Church. Beloved, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">God has never ordained anything less!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is one thing that I want to stress in these meetings; that is, no mater what else may happen, first and foremost I would emphasize the question&mdash; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Have you received the Holy Ghost since you belived?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you filled with divine power?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is the heritage of the Church, to be so endued with power that God can lay His hand upon any member at any time to do His perfect will. There is no stop in the Spirit-filled life: we begin at the Cross, the place of ignominy, shame, and death, and that very death brings the power of resurrection life; and, being filled with the Holy Spirit, we go on &ldquo;from glory to glory.&rdquo; Let us not forget that possessing the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, means there must be an &ldquo;ever-increasing&rdquo; holiness. How the Church needs divine unction&mdash;God&rsquo;s presence and power so manifest that the world will know it. The people know when the tide is flowing; they also know when it is ebbing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The necessity that seven men be chosen for the position of &ldquo;serving tables&rdquo; was very evident. The disciples knew that these seven men were </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">men ready for active service</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and so they chose them. In the 5th verse, we read: &ldquo;And the saying pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip...&rdquo; There were others, of course, but Stephen and Philip stand out most prominently in the Scriptures. Philip was a man so filled with the Holy Ghost that a revival always followed wherever he went. Stephen was a man so filled with divine power, that although serving tables might have been all right in the minds of the other disciples, yet, God had a greater vision for him&mdash;a </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">baptism of fire</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, of power and divine unction, that took him on and on to the climax of his life, until he saw right into the open heavens. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Had we been there with the disciples at that time, I believe we should have heard them saying to each other, &ldquo;Look here! neither Stephen nor Philip are doing the work we called them to. If they do not attend to business, we shall have to get someone else!&rdquo; That was the </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">natural</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> way of thinking, but divine order is far above our finite planning. When we please God in our daily ministration, we shall always find in operation the fact &ldquo;that everyone who is faithful in little, God will make faithful in much.&rdquo; We have such an example right here&mdash;a man chosen to &ldquo;serve tables,&rdquo; having such a revelation of the mind of Christ and of the depth and height of God, that there was no stop in his experience, but a going forward with leaps and bounds. Beloved, there is a race to be run, there is a crown to be won; we </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">cannot stand still!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I say unto you, Be vigilant! </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Be vigilant! &ldquo;Let no man take thy crown!&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has privileged us in Christ Jesus to live above the ordinary human plane of life. Those who want to be ordinary, and live on a lower plane, can do so; but as for me, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">I will not!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> for the same unction, the same zeal, the same Holy Ghost power is at our command as was at the command of Stephen and the apostles. We have the same God that Abraham had, that Elijah had, and </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">we need not come behind in any gift or grace</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. We may not possess the gifts, as abiding gifts, but as we are full of the Holy Ghost and divine unction, it is possible, when there is need, for God to </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">manifest every gift of the Spirit</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> through us. As I have already said, I do not mean by this that we should necessarily possess the gifts permanently, but there should be a </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">manifestation of the gifts</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> as God may choose to use us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">ordinary</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> man Stephen became mighty under the Holy Ghost anointing, until he stands supreme, in many ways, among the Apostles&mdash;&ldquo;And Stephen full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.&rdquo; As we go deeper in God, He enlarges our conception and places before us a wide-open door; and I am not surprised that this man chosen to &ldquo;serve tables&rdquo; was afterwards caIled to a higher plane. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; you may ask. &ldquo;Did he quit this service?&rdquo; No! but he was </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">lost</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> in the power of God. He lost sight of everything in the natural, and steadfastly fixed his gaze upon Jesus, &ldquo;the author and finisher of our faith,&rdquo; until he was transformed into a shining light in the kingdom of God, Oh that we might be awakened to believe His word, to understand the mind of the Spirit, for there is an </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">inner</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> place of whiteness and purity where we can &ldquo;see God.&rdquo; Stephen was just as ordinary a man as you and I, but he was in the place where God could so move upon him that he, in turn, could move all before him. He began in a most humble place, and ended in a blaze of glory. Beloved, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">dare to believe Christ!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As you go on in this life of the Spirit, you will find that the devil will begin to get restless and there will be a stir in the synagogue; it was so with Stephen. Any amount of people may be found in the &ldquo;synagogue,&rdquo; who are very proper in a worldly sense&mdash;always correctly dressed, the elite of the land, welcoming into the church everything but the power of God. Let us read what God says about them: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Then there arose certain in the synagogue, which is called the Synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians ... disputing with Stephen, and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;The Libertines&rdquo; could not stand the truth of God. With these opponents, Stephen found himself in the same predicament as the blind man whom Jesus healed. As soon as the blind man&rsquo;s eyes were opened they shut him out of the synagogue. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">They will not have anybody in the &ldquo;synagogue&rdquo; with their eyes open;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> as soon as you receive spiritual eyesight, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">out you go!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> These Libertines, Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, rose up full of wrath in the very place where they should have been full of the power of God, full of love divine, and reverence for the Holy Ghost; they </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">rose up against</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Stephen, this man &ldquo;full of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; Beloved, if there is anything in your life that in any way </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">resists</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the power of the Holy Ghost and the entrance of His word into your heart and life, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">drop on your knees and </span><span class="cs419B124">CRY ALOUD</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19"> for mercy!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When the Spirit of God is brooding over your heart&rsquo;s door, do not resist Him but open your heart to the touch of God, There is a resisting &ldquo;unto blood&rdquo; striving </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">against sin</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and there is a resisting of the Holy Ghost that will drive you </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">into sin</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Stephen spoke with marked wisdom; where he was, things began to move. You will find that there is always a moving when the Holy Spirit has control. These people were brought under conviction by the message of Stephen, but they resisted, they did anything and everything to stifle that conviction. Not only did they lie, but they got others to lie against this man, who would have laid down his life for any one of them. Stephen was used to heal the sick, perform miracles, and yet they brought false accusations against him. What effect did it have on Stephen? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Something had happened in the life of this man, chosen for menial service, and he became </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">mighty for God</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. How was it accomplished in him? It was because </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">his aim was high;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> faithful in little, God brought him to full fruition. Under the inspiration of divine power by which he spoke, they could not but listen,&mdash;even the angels listened, as with holy prophetic utterance he spoke before that council. Beginning with Abraham and Moses, he continued unfolding the truth. What a marvelous exhortation! take your Bibles and read it, &ldquo;listen in&rdquo; as the angels listened in. As light upon light, truth upon truth, revelation upon revelation, found its way into their calloused hearts, they gazed at him in astonishment; their hearts perhaps became warm at times, and they may have said, &ldquo;Truly, this man is sent of God,&rdquo;&mdash;but when he hurled at them the truth: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers; who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.&rdquo;&mdash;then what happened? These men were </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">moved;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> they were &ldquo;pricked to the heart, and gnashed upon him with their teeth.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are two marvelous occasions* in the Scriptures where the people were &ldquo;pricked to the heart.&rdquo; In the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, 37th verse, after Peter had delivered that inspired sermon on the Day of Pentecost, the people were &ldquo;pricked to the heart&rdquo; with conviction, and there were added to the Church three thousand souls. Here is Stephen, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and the men of this council being &ldquo;pricked to the heart&rdquo; rise up as one man to slay him. As you go down through this chapter, from the 55th verse, what a picture you have before you. As I close my eyes, I can get a vision of this scene in every detail&mdash;the howling mob with their vengeful, murderous spirit, ready to devour this holy man, and he &ldquo;being full of the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; gazed steadfastly into heaven. What did he see there? From his place of helplessness, he looked up and said: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Is that the position that Jesus went to take? No! He went to &ldquo;sit&rdquo; at the right hand of the Father; but in behalf of the </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">first martyr</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, in behalf of the man with that burning flame of Holy Ghost power, God&rsquo;s Son </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">stood up</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> in honorary testimony of him who, called to serve tables, was faithful unto death. But is that all? No! I am so glad that it is not all. As the stones came flying at him, pounding his body, crashing into his bones, striking his temple, mangling his beautiful face, what happened? How did this scene end? With that sublime, upward look, this man chosen for an ordinary task but filled with the Holy Ghost, was so moved upon by God that he finished his earthly work in a blaze of glory, magnifying God with his latest breath. Looking up into the face of the Master, he said: </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Lord Jesus, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">forgive them!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Lay not this sin to their charge!&rdquo; When he had said this, he fell asleep. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Friends, it is worth dying a thousand deaths to gain that spirit.

					<span class="cs12506F1C">Subtitled, &ldquo;The applause of the world vs. the approval of God.&rdquo;<br/>Preached at the Stone Church communion service, November 5, 1922<br/>Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Latter Rain Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, June 1923.</span></h4>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is a very blessed time for us to gather together in remembrance of the Lord. I want to remind you of this fact, that this is the only service we render to the Lord. All other services we attend are for us to get blessing from the Lord, but Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;This do in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We have gathered together to commemorate that wonderful death, victory, and triumph, and the looking forward to the <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('tit%202:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;glorious hope,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and I want you, if it is possible at all, to get rid of your religion. It has been &ldquo;religion&rdquo; at all times that has slain and destroyed that which was good. When <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('john%2013:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Satan entered into Judas,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the only people that the devil could speak to thru Judas were the priests, sad as it is to say it. They conspired to get him to betray Jesus, and the devil took money from these priests to put Jesus to death. Now it is a very serious thing, for we must clearly understand whether we are of the right spirit or not, for no man can be of the Spirit of Christ and persecute another; no man can have the true spirit of Jesus and slay his brother, and no man can follow the Lord Jesus and have enmity in his heart. You cannot have Jesus and have bitterness and hatred, and persecute the believer. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is possible for us, if we are not careful, to have within us an evil spirit of unbelief, and even in our best state it is possible for us to have enmity unless we are perfectly dead and let the life of the Lord lead us. You remember Jesus wanted to pass thru a certain place as He was going to Jerusalem, because He would not stop and preach to them concerning the kingdom, they refused to allow Him to go thru their section of the country. And the disciples which were with Jesus said to Him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%209:54')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Shall we call down fire from heaven upon them as Elijah did?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But Jesus turned and said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%209:55')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Ye know not what spirit ye are of.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There they were, following Jesus and with Him all the time, but Jesus rebuked that spirit. I pray God that we may get this out of this service, that our knowledge of Jesus is pure love, and pure love to Jesus is death to self on all lines, body, soul and spirit. I believe if we are in the will of God, we will be perfectly directed at all times, and if we would know anything about the mighty works of Christ, we shall have to follow what Jesus said. Whatever He said came to pass. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many things happened in the lives of the apostles to show His power over all flesh. In regard to paying tribute, Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;We are free, we can enter into the city without paying tribute; nevertheless, we will pay.&rdquo; I like that thought, that Jesus was so righteous on all lines. It helps me a great deal. Then Jesus told Peter to do a very hard thing. He said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('matt%2017:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Take that hook and cast it into the sea. Draw out a fish and take from its gills a piece of silver for thee and Me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This was one of the hardest things Peter had to do. He had been fishing all his life, but never had he taken silver out of a fish&rsquo;s mouth. There were thousands and millions of fish in the sea, but one fish had to have a piece of silver in it. He went down to the sea as any natural man would, speculating and thinking, &ldquo;How can it be?&rdquo; But how could it not be, if Jesus said it would be? Then the perplexity would arise, &ldquo;But how many fish there are, and which fish has the money?&rdquo; Brother, if God speaks, it will be as He says. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What you need is to know the mind of God and the Word of God, and you will be so free you will never find a frown on your face, nor a tear in your eye. The more you know of the mightiness of revelation, the more does everything in the way of fearfulness pass away. To know God, is to be in the place of triumph. To know God is to be in the place of rest. To know God is to be in the place of victory. No doubt many things were in Peter&rsquo;s mind that day, but thank God there was one fish, and he obeyed. Sometimes to obey in blindness brings the victory. Sometimes when perplexities arise in your mind, obedience means God working out the problem. Peter cast the hook into the sea, and it would have been amazing if you could have seen the disturbance the other fish made to move out of the way, all excepting the right one. Just one among the millions of fish God wanted. God may put his hand upon you in the midst of millions of people, but if He speaks to you, that thing that He says will be appointed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">On this occasion, Jesus said to Peter and the rest, that <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">when they went out into the city they would see a man bearing a pitcher of water, and they should follow him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was not customary in the East for men to carry anything on their heads. The women always did the carrying, but this had to be a man, and he had to have a pitcher. One day there was a man preaching and he said it was quite all right for Jesus to go and arrange, for a colt to be tied there, and another preacher said it was quite easy to feed all those thousands of people, because the loaves in those days were so tremendously big, but he didn&rsquo;t tell them it was a little boy that had the five loaves. Unbelief can be very blind, but faith can see thru a stone-wall. Faith when it is moved by the power of God can laugh when trouble is on. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They said to the man with the pitcher, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Where is the guest chamber?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;How strange it is that you should ask,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have been preparing that, wondering who wanted it.&rdquo; It is marvelous when God is leading how perfectly everything works into the plan. He was arranging everything. You think He cannot do that today for you? People who have been in perplexities for days and days, He knows how to deliver out of trouble; He knows how to be with you in the dark hour. He can make all things work together for good to them that love God. He has a way of arranging His plan, and when God comes in, you always know it was a day you lived in God. Oh to live in God! There is a vast difference between living in God and living in speculation and hope. There is something better than hope; something better than speculation. <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('dan%2011:32')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;They that know their God shall be strong and do exploits,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and God would have us to know Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And when the hour was come, He sat down and the twelve apostles with Him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;When the hour was come&rdquo;&mdash;that was the most wonderful hour. There never was an hour, never will be an hour like that hour. What hour was it? It was an hour of the passing of creation under the blood. It was an hour of destruction of demon power. It was an hour appointed of life coming out of death. It was an hour when all that ever lived came under a glorious covering of the blood. It was an hour when all the world was coming into emancipation by the blood. It was an hour in the world&rsquo;s history when it emerged from dark chaos, a wonderful hour! Praise God for that hour! Was it a dark hour? It was a dark hour for Him, but a wonderful light dawned for us. It was tremendously dark for the Son of Man, but praise God He came thru it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are some things in the Scriptures which move me greatly. I am glad that Paul was a man. I am glad that Jesus was a Man. I am glad that Daniel was a man, and I am also glad that John was a man. You ask Why? Because I see that whatever God has done for other men, He can do for me. And I find God has done such wonderful things for other men that I am always on the expectation that these things are possible for me. Think about this. It is a wonderful thought to me. Jesus said in that trying hour&mdash;hear it a moment: <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I have a desire to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Desire? What could be His desire? His desire because of the salvation of the world. His desire because of dethronement of the powers of Satan. His desire because He knew he was going to conquer everything and make every man free that ever lived. It was a great desire, but what lay between it? Just between that and the cross lay </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Gethsemane!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Some people say that Jesus died on the cross. It is perfectly true, but is that the only place? Jesus died in Gethsemane. That was the tragic moment! That was the place where He paid the debt. It was in Gethsemane, and Gethsemane was between Him and the cross. He had a desire to eat this Passover and knew Gethsemane was between Him and the cross. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want you to think about Gethsemane. There alone, and with the tremendous weight, the awful effect of all sin and disease upon that body, He cries out, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('matt%2026:39')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;If it be possible, let it pass.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Oh could it be! He could only save when He was man, but here like a giant refreshed and coming out of a great chaos of darkness He comes forth: <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('john%2018:37')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;To this end I came.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was His purpose to die for the world. Oh brother, will it ever be said to pass thru your lips or your mind for a moment that you will not have a desire to serve Christ like that? Can you deign, under any circumstances to take your cross fully, to be in the place of any ridicule, any surrender, anything for the Man who said He desired to eat the Passover with His disciples, knowing what it meant? It can only come out of the depths of love we have for Him that we can say this morning, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I will follow.&rdquo; Oh brother there is something very wonderful in the decision in your heart! God knows the heart. You do not always have to be on the house-top to shout to indicate the condition of your heart. He knows your inward heart. You say, &ldquo;I would be ashamed not to be willing to suffer for a Man who desired to suffer to save me.&rdquo; </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;With desire,&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He says. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I know what it is to have the kingdom of heaven within you. He said that even <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%207:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John the Baptist,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> meaning those who are under the blood, those who have seen the Lord by faith, those who know by redemption <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('john%201:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">they are made sons of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I say to you, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He will never taste again until we are there with Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The kingdom will never be complete&mdash;it could not be&mdash;until we are all there at that great <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('rev%2019:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Supper of the Lamb</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> where there will be millions and trillions of redeemed, which no man can number. We shall be there when that Supper is taking place. I like to think of that. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I hope you will take one step into definite lines with God and believe it. It is an act of faith God wants to bring you into; a perfecting of that love that cannot fail to avail. It is a fact that He has opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers, and that He gives eternal life to them that believe. The Lord, the Omnipotent God, it is <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('isa%2046:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He that knoweth the end from the beginning,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and has arranged by the blood of the Lamb to cover the guilty and make intercession for all believers. Oh it is a wonderful inheritance of faith to find shelter under the blood of Jesus! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want you to see that He says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He took the cup, He took the bread, and He gave thanks. The very attitude of giving thanks for His shed blood, giving thanks for His broken body, overwhelms the heart. To think that my Lord could give thanks for His shed blood! To think that my Lord could give thanks for His broken body! Only Divinity can reveal this sublime act unto the heart! The natural man cannot receive it, but the spiritual man, the man who has been created anew by faith in Christ, he is open to it. The man who believes God comes in is inborn with the eternal seed of truth and righteousness and faith, and from the moment he sees the truth on the lines of faith he is made a new creation. The flesh ceases, the spiritual man begins. One passes off, the other passes on, until a man is in the existence of God. I say the Lord brings a child of faith into a place of rest, causes him to sit with Him in heavenly places, gives him a language in the Spirit and makes him know he belongs no longer to the law of creation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You see this bread which represents His broken body? The Lord knew He could not bring us any nearer to His broken body. Our bodies are made of bread. The body of Jesus was made of that bread, and He knew He could bring us no nearer. He took the natural elements and said, &ldquo;This bread represents my broken body.&rdquo; Now will it ever become that body of Christ? No, never. You cannot make it so. It is foolishness to believe it, but I take it as an emblem and when I eat it, the natural leads me into the supernatural, and instantly I begin to feed on the supernatural by faith, One leads me into the other. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('mark%2014:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Take eat, this is my body.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I have a real knowledge of Christ thru this emblem. May we take from the table of the riches of His promises. The riches of heaven are before us. Fear not, only believe, for God has opened the treasures of His Holy Word. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As they were all gathered together, He looked on them and said right into their ears, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('matt%2026:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;There is one of you which will betray Me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('john%2013:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">knew who would betray Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He had known it for many, many months. They whispered to one another, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; None of them had real confidence that it would not be he. That is the serious part about it; they had so little confidence in their ability to face the opposition that was before them, and they had no confidence it would not be one of them. Jesus knew. He had been talking to Judas many times, rebuking him, and telling him that his course would surely bring him to a bad end. He never had told any of His disciples, not even John <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('john%2021:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">who leaned on His breast.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Now if that same spirit was in any church, it would purify the church. But I fear sometimes Satan gets the advantage and things are told before they are true. I believe God wants to so sanctify us, so separate us, that we will have that perfection of love that will not speak ill of a brother, that will not, slander a brother whether it is true or not. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There was strife among them who should be the greatest, but He said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;He that is chief let him be as he that doth serve,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and then he, the Master said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I am among you as one that serveth.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He, the noblest, the purest, He was the servant of all! Exercising lordship over another is not of God. We must learn in our hearts that fellowship, true righteousness, loving one another and preferring one another must come into the church. Pentecost must outreach everything that ever has been, and we know it will if we are willing. But it cannot be if we will not. We can never he filled with the Holy Ghost so long as there is any human, craving desire for our own will. Selfishness must be destroyed. Jesus was perfect, the end of everything, and God will bring us all there. It is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">giving</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that pays; it is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">helping</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that pays; it is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">loving</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that pays; it is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">putting yourself out of the way for another</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that pays. <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:27-28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I am among you as one that serveth. Ye are they which have continued with Me in My temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto Me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I believe there is a day coming greater than anything any of us have any conception of. This is the testing road. This is the place where your whole body has to be covered with the wings of God that your nakedness shall not be seen. This is the thing that God is getting you ready for, the most wonderful thing your heart can conceive. How can you get into it? First of all, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Ye have continued with me in my temptations.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He had been in trials, He had been in temptation. There is not one of us that is tempted beyond what He was. If a young man can be so pure that he cannot be tempted, he will never be fit to be made a judge, but God intends us to be so purified during these evil days that He can make us judges in the world to come. If we can be tried, if we can be tempted on any line, Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('luke%2022:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Ye are they which have continued with Me in My temptation.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Have faith and God will keep you pure in the temptation. How shall we reach it? In Matt. 19:28, Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('matt%2019:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;Follow in regeneration&rdquo;&mdash;every day is a regeneration; every day is a day of advancement; every day is a place of choice. Every day you find yourself in need of fresh consecration. If you are in a place to yield God moves you in the place of regeneration. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For years and years God has been making me appear to hundreds and thousands of people as a fool. I remember the day when He saved me and when He called me out. If there is a thing God wants to do today He wants to be as real to you and me as He was to Abraham. After I was saved I joined myself up to a very lively lot of people who were full of a revival spirit, and it was marvelous how God blest. And then there came a lukewarmness and indifference, and God said to me as clearly as anything, &ldquo;Come out.&rdquo; I obeyed and came out. The people said, &ldquo;We cannot understand you. We need you now and you are leaving us.&rdquo; The Plymouth Brethren at that time were in a Conference. The Word of God was with them in power, the love of God was with them unveiled. Baptism by immersion was revealed to me, and when my friends saw me go into the water they said I was altogether wrong. But God had called me and I obeyed. The day came when I saw that the Brethren had dropped down to the letter, all letter, dry and barren. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At that time the Salvation Army was filled with love, filled with power, filled with zeal; every place a revival, and I joined up with them. For about six years the glory of God was there, and then the Lord said again, &ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; and I am glad I came. It dropped right into a social movement and God has no place for a social movement. We are saved by regeneration and the man who is going on with God has no time for social reforms. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God moved on, and at that time there were many people who were receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost without signs. Those days were &ldquo;days of heaven on earth.&rdquo; God unfolded the truth, showed the way of sanctification by the power of the blood of Christ, and I saw in that the great inflow of the life of God. I thank God for that, but God came along again and said, &ldquo;Come out.&rdquo; I obeyed God and went with what they called the &ldquo;tongues&rdquo; folks; they got the credit for having further light. I saw God advancing every movement I made, and I can see even in this Pentecostal work, except we see there is a real death, God will say to us, &ldquo;Come out.&rdquo; Unless Pentecost wakes up to shake herself free from all worldly things and comes into a place of the divine-likeness with God, we will hear the voice of God, &ldquo;Come out&rdquo; and He will have something far better than this. I ask every one of you, will you hear the voice of God and come out? You ask, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Every one of you knows without exception, there is no word for Pentecost, only being on fire. If you are not on fire you are not in the place of regeneration. It is only the fire of God that burns up the entanglements of the world. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When we came into this new work God spoke to us by the Spirit and we knew we had to reach the place of absolute yieldedness and cleansing, so that there would be nothing left. We were swept and garnished. Brother, that was only the beginning, and if you have not made tremendous progress in that holy zeal and power and compassion of God, we can truly say you have backslidden in heart. The backslider in heart is dead. He is not having the open vision. The backslider in heart is not seeing the Word of God more fresh every day. You can put it down that a man is a backslider in heart if he is not hated by the world. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">If you have the applause of the world you are not having the approval of God.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I do not know whether you will receive it or not but my heart burns with this message, &ldquo;changing in the regeneration&rdquo; for in this changing you will get a place in the kingdom to come where you shall be in authority; that place which God has prepared for us, that place which is beyond all human conception. We can catch a glimpse of that glory, when we see how John worshipped the angel, and the angel said to him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="http://smithwigglesworth.blogspot.com/vs('rev%2022:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow-servant, of thy brethren the prophets.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This angel is showing John the wonders of the glorious kingdom and in his glorified state, John thought he was the Lord. I wonder if we dare believe for it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Let me close with these words: As sure as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall have the image of the heavenly. It means to us that everything of an earthly type has to cease, for the heavenly type is so wonderful in all its purity. God, full of love, full of purity, full of power! No power only on the lines of purity! No open door into heaven only on the lines of the conscience void of sin between man and God, the heavens open only where the Spirit of the Lord is so leading, so that flesh has no power, but we will live in the Spirit. God bless you and prepare you for greater days. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%204:33')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And great grace was upon them all.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Great grace is upon us when we magnify the Lord. If ever you want to see what God means when He gets a chance at His people, have a peep at the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%204')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">fourth chapter of Acts,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and see what God did. Just because all the people shouted aloud to Him He imparted to them such blessing that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%204:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">every person was filled with the Holy Ghost,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and I believe what God wants to do in these days is to give an inward manifestation of His divine presence within the body until the body is moved by the power of the Spirit. Beloved, we are accustomed to earthly things, but when God sends the heavenly it is beyond our understanding. Oh, to have the revelation of the mind of God! It fills my soul, the thought of it! Oh, for the kind of loosening of the body that we will never be bound again! Just filled with God! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe God wants us to understand something of the words of this life. What life? The manifestation of the power of Jesus in the human body, a divine life, a divine power, a quickening, thrilling energy given to you. I was baptized with the Holy Ghost in 1907. If anyone had said to me: &ldquo;Now, Wigglesworth, you will see such and such things,&rdquo; it would have been beyond my human comprehension, but the tide has risen for fifteen years, and it is still rising. Thank God, there has never been a black day, nor a blank day. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I think about the first Church, how God favored her, how He burst thru her, how He definitely spoke, how He transformed Christians and made them move with the power of apostles, that wherever they went they transformed lives&mdash;God did such wonderful things, and when I think of it, I think, that we should have something far in advance, and say: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%2021:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Look up; your redemption draweth nigh!&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want to take a perspective of what they were, and we must be. I am inwardly convinced of the power that awaits us, the installation of God&rsquo;s movement right in our hearts. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I notice in the first Church it wasn&rsquo;t possible for a lie to live, and I want you to keep in mind that there is a time coming when nothing of uncleanness will be able to remain in His little flock. The first Church was so pure God overshadowed it; He nursed it, brought it thru, and He has His hand upon us at this time. How do we know? The Lord hath laid the foundation which is an immovable foundation. It is built upon the prophets; it is built upon the apostles; it is built upon the Word of God, and the church will yet come into the fullness of the manifestation of the body of Christ. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God will keep His Word. The church will be ready <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rev%2021:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">like a bride adorned for her husband;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the gifts will be a ministry clothed upon; the graces will adorn the believer, and will be far beyond anything we have seen. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now, Ananias and Sapphira were, I believe, baptized believers. I have a firm conviction in my heart that God in the first outpouring of the Spirit did His work so beautifully that those three thousand who were pricked in their hearts met the condition of the Bible pattern. Peter said unto them: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%202:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Repent, believe, be baptized and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> They obeyed and we have reason to believe they received the Holy Ghost. I cannot conceive of anything else but what the Early Church all received the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. And I believe today that we should press home to every soul the necessity of meeting the conditions and being filled with the Holy Ghost. Then I notice here in this <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%205')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">fifth chapter of Acts</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that God had the particular oversight of the Church. I love to think of this. They gave of their substance, they gave willingly; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%204:35')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">they laid it down at the apostles&rsquo; feet,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and they were so eager to give that they began selling their property, and brought the proceeds to the apostles. Now there were two people who had sold the land who began to talk over the thing at home, and this was the sense of their argument: &ldquo;This thing may go down; it may leak out. If we give it all, we shall lose it all and have nothing left,&rdquo; and so they reserved for themselves a portion, but they missed it. Listen: God never wants anything from you but a spontaneous heart gift, and anyone who gives spontaneously to God will always get a big cup full. God is never in any man&rsquo;s debt. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I notice the moment God visited this people in showing up this sin and bringing death to Ananias and Sapphira, it instantly brought <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%205:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a tremendous fear over all the church,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> a fear that brought an answer. There is a fear that brings an answer. Were they afraid of God? No, it was something better than that. When they saw that God was there in judgment upon them they turned with a holy fear, with a reverence. It sobered things and the people began to see that God was zealous for them. There are two kinds of fear, one that is afraid of God, and another fear that loves God, and that was the fear that came over them, the fear of grieving God, which the Lord wants us to have. Oh, to fear Him in such a way that you would rather be shot than to grieve Him! That is it. This came over the people, and when it came, another thing happened. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%205:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;No one durst join themselves to them.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> That was a wonderful time. May God so sanctify His church that no one durst come near without he means business. Brother, did God have a hand in your plan? Did you join this people because you felt they were a choice people, or did you have the constraining power of God upon you? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I see more and more in this glorious life of God, that there is a pure whiteness to be achieved, there is a pure sonship without fear and the saints of God shall rise in such confidence until they will remove what people think are mountains, till they will subdue what you call kingdoms. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I have had some wonderful times in Belfast, and in fact all over Ireland. I was in Belfast one day and a young man came to me and said: &ldquo;Brother Wigglesworth, I am very much distressed,&rdquo; and he told me why. They had an old lady in their assembly who used to pray heaven down upon them. She had an accident. Her thigh was broken and they took her away to the infirmary. They put her in a plaster of Paris cast and she was in that condition for five months. Then they broke the cast and lifted her on to her feet and asked her to walk. She fell again and broke her leg in another place. And they found out that the first break had never knit together. They brought her home and laid her on the couch and the young man asked me to go and pray for her. When I got into the house I asked: &ldquo;Do you believe that God can heal you?&rdquo; She said &ldquo;Yes. When I heard you had come to the city I thought, &lsquo;This is my chance to be healed.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; An old man, her husband, was sitting in a chair, had been sitting there for four years helpless. And he said: &ldquo;I do not believe. I will not believe. She was the only help I had. She has been taken away with a broken leg, and they have brought her back with her leg broken twice. How can I believe God?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I turned to her and said: &ldquo;Now is it all right?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is all right.&rdquo; The right leg was broken in two parts. Physicians can join up bones beautifully, and make them fit together, but if God doesn&rsquo;t come in with His healing power, there is no physician can heal them. As soon as the oil was placed upon her head and hands laid on, instantly down the right limb there was a stream of life, and she knew it. She said: &ldquo;I am healed.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;If you are healed, you do not need anybody to help you.&rdquo; I went out. She took hold of the mantle shelf above her head and pulled herself up and walked all around the room. She was perfectly healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The old man said: &ldquo;Make me walk.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;You old sinner, repent.&rdquo; Then he began: &ldquo;You know, Lord, I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; I really believe he was in earnest, and to show you the mercy and compassion of God, the moment I laid hands upon him, the power of God went thru him and he rose up after four years being stiff and walked around the room. That day both he and his wife were made whole. Do you not believe now that God has a plan in all these things? I want you to realize that what God wants to do in us and thru us in these days is to blend us together, give us one heart and one mind. They were all of one heart and one mind, and they had such faith that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%205:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the shadow of Peter worked a transformation in their bodies.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Of course, it was God that did the healing. But as Peter came along I can see the people moved by his presence. Beloved, we have one in the meeting tonight who is a million times mightier than Peter. His touch will set you free. It is the living virtue! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%205:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Go speak to the people the words of this life,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the life of the Son of God, the quickener by the Word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The first outpouring was of the Spirit, and the latter is to be the fullness of the Spirit. When God&rsquo;s mighty power shakes the foundation and purifies, there is a transformation. The Lord is the life, and where the life of the Spirit and the Word are together they bring forth an issue of transforming and quickening until the man is made like Jesus. Jesus is the first fruits. It is lovely to think that God sent Him in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh. Then we are here tonight with a clear conception of this thing, that the life of Jesus has come into our flesh and delivered us from the power of darkness and disease, from bitterness and covetousness, idolatry and lust; from the corruption of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%201:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the present evil world,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> by the same Spirit, the same life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe the Lord would have me take you to a moment in my life. I was having some meetings in Belfast, and this is the rising tide of what I believe was the move of the Spirit in a certain direction, to show the greatness of that which was to follow. Night after night the Lord had led me on certain lines of truth. There was so much in it that one felt they could not give up, and every night until ten o&rsquo;clock we were opening up the Word of God. They came to me and said: &ldquo;Brother, we have been feasting and are so full we are ready for a burst of some kind. Don&rsquo;t you think it is time to call an altar service?&rdquo; I said I knew that God was working and the time would come when the altar service would be called, but we would have to get the mind of the Lord upon it. There was nothing more said. They began early in the afternoon to bring the sick people. We never had a thing said about it. The meeting came and every seat was taken up, the window sills were filled and every nook and corner. The glory of God filled the place. It was the easiest thing in the world to preach; it came forth like a river, and the power of God rested mightily. There were a lot of people who had been seeking the baptism for years. Sinners were in the meeting, and a number of sick people. What happened? God hears me say this: There was a certain moment in that meeting when every sick person was healed, every lame person was healed, and every sinner saved, and it all took place in five minutes. There comes into a meeting sometimes something we cannot understand, and it is amazing how things happen. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was on the ship there was a man who had trained all his life, as it were, to be a physician. He got to be eminent and was looked up to as one of the leading physicians, an Indian. He had been over to England to lecture, and was going back on the ship on which I was traveling. When the Christian Science lady got healed she saw the captain and told him what God had done. The Captain arranged a meeting and I had a fine chance to preach to all on the ship. The Indian doctor was there and he was struck with what happened. At the close of the meeting people decided for Christ; some people followed me into my stateroom, where God healed them. This Indian doctor came to me. &ldquo;I am done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have no spirit left. You must talk to me.&rdquo; For two hours we talked and God dealt with him. He stood before me. &ldquo;I will never have any more medicine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;God has saved me.&rdquo; That physician saw the power of God and recognized it. You ask, What is that? That is where God plans a life in a moment, thru one act. God wants the way into our lives. He wants to transform you by His grace. He wants to make you know that you are only here to be filled with His power and His presence for His glory. The <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%203:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;seed of the woman&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> must <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%203:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now, beloved, the Acts of the Apostles were written to prove to us that the power and manifestation of God were to be continuous. Have you read about <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%208:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the scattering of these people at Jerusalem,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> how God was with them? Do not be afraid of persecution. I am never at my best until I am in a conflict, and until I have a fight with the enemy. They think I am rather unmerciful in my dealing with the sick, but I have no mercy for the devil and get him out at any cost. I resist him with all the power that is within me. God wrought mightily thru the persecution which came upon the church, and He could do the same today under similar circumstances. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to speak to you this morning on the subject of the Gifts. These are days when all the saints need to be furnished with the graces and the gifts of the Spirit and we must keep in mind that it is impossible to find the gifts of the Spirit made manifest without the graces; they always work harmoniously and the person filled with the power of the Spirit will find that the one will help the other to strengthen the person in the needy hour. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We need a clear knowledge of the Word of God; we cannot put too much emphasis on that. Then I want to say also that God demands of every believer who has been baptized in the Holy Spirit that he should have some &ldquo;acts&rdquo; and if you do not have them you had better get face to face with God and demand from Him your acts. When I was baptized in the Holy Ghost I received from God an utterance as all people do when they receive the Baptism; it was not an earthly language, but heavenly, and I was satisfied that God had granted unto me <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2014:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the Comforter, the Holy Ghost.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But for nine months after that I never spoke in tongues and then God gave to me the gift of tongues. I cannot say that I was very anxious or very hungry in asking for this as I was longing more that I might speak <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">as the Spirit gave utterance</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but God knew what I needed to be able to help others along this line. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next evening after I had received the gift of tongues, I was walking down the road, loaded with bundles and God came upon me mightily and tongues began to come forth in terrific force. I walked down the road without stopping, but soon I began to realize that this had no intelligence in it for me <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and neither was it a profit to anyone else.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There were some men working in a garden near by and as soon as they heard this peculiar noise they stuck their heads through the fence to find out where it was coming from. Right then I said to God, &ldquo;I will not leave till You give me the interpretation. You have poured forth a language, now You must interpret,&rdquo; and suddenly God gave the interpretation and that message has been fulfilled to the very letter over and over again. Since that time I have always claimed the right to have the interpretation. I believe God wants us to be definite and I don&rsquo;t want you to run away with any wrong impression; if you come out on anything else but a definite side then God has not spoken. I am not here to make children but men and women of you, men and women after the mind of God; in spirit we must be children but in understanding we must be men and women. So if God says to us that we must understand spiritual gifts you put your name right under that &ldquo;must&rdquo; and apply it as your very own. I believe as long as you dwell in the Spirit it is impossible for you ever to become twisted. You never heard of a Roman Catholic being filled with the Spirit as long as he was a Roman Catholic; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:alert(fn1)"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">*</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the same is true of a Russellite, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:alert(fn2)"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">*</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> or a man who believes in New Theology. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:alert(fn3)"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">*</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Scripture is clearly against it for it says <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">that no man can call Jesus, Lord except by the Holy Ghost</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and every man who has the Holy Ghost believes all the Bible. The man who is filled with the Holy Ghost is filled with that which gave the Bible; he is filled with the very matter of the Bible for the Word is Christ and the Holy Ghost has come to manifest Christ. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You will always find that all the blessings and all the manifestations of the power, of God which you receive, come always on the line of faith; every saved person <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%202:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">is saved by faith</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and saving faith is not something which you can take down and then hang up again. The saving faith of God is a permanent thing which God gave and which will remain with you. It is a gift and because of that I know that everyone in this place can choose that gift but you have to come into that blessing under the shadow of the blood and claim your rights in the Scriptures. I want to say, however, that no man can come to God and claim His blessings if he knows that God can put His finger on any sin in his life. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2066:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God never will hear sinners</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and if you expect any blessings don&rsquo;t come to Him with sin in your life. When a man repents <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('exod%2034:6-7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God is gracious and full of mercy and forgives all sin</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and that man can begin from that moment with the knowledge that God has removed the past from him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are two points in this <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">12th chapter of Corinthians</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> which have helped me more than anything else and I am sure they will help you; one is this&mdash;Paul prayed for a keen conscience and also that he might not have his conscience seared. Do you know that a keen conscience is the greatest blessing anyone can have? A keen conscience is one which is easily disturbed, one which is easily broken and brought to repentance before God, one which will not permit you to sleep until everything is made right with your brother; a keen conscience is the place where God reigns supreme as a Refiner of fire. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What is a <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1tim%204:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">seared conscience?</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is a conscience which once was keen but the person got out of the will of God and failed to repent after committing a sin. God could not come in before that sin was undone and the person went on sinning until he got to the place where he thought he had a right to sin. This is the most horrible place to be in. I pray that God will keep us in the place where we may hear His voice and heed it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want you to notice that I am trying to show you, by the grace of God, that if you keep in the fulness of the Spirit you will have such a revelation of the Word of God in your life that it will save you and keep you from stumbling. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2034:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2037:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He shall hide thee in the secret place, in the cleft of the rock, and in the time of adversity <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2059:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He shall raise up a standard against the enemy.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is the Lord who reigns supreme over His household whose House ye are, His establishment, and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('prov%2012:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">ye shall not be moved.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This means that God establishes His Kingdom in you and in me. Oh how we need to be filled with <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('neh%208:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the joy of the Lord which is our strength</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and to have a fresh inflow of His life and love! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man who is filled with the Spirit must have three things flowing through him; the ministration, operation and manifestation of the Spirit. It is to your detriment if you have not these three working in your life. If you are to keep your path all clear and bright <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2015:58')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">you must remain steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We must <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2015:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">abound in hope,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> rejoice in tribulation and then God will <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2012:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">make straight paths for our feet.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The man who has faith is never ruffled; he does not run off as if he had been shot but he is always resting, knowing that God is over all. We must understand these principles because faith is God. Faith is the knowledge of God. Faith is that which lays hold, which will not let go. Faith is inwrought God, faith is God inwrought; faith is that which brings heaven on earth and lives in it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The word which God would bring before us this morning is found in the 10th verse of the 12th chapter of 1st Corinthians: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The first we have to deal with is the discerning of spirits. Perhaps this is the most necessary thing in this present day. In connection with this we must speak on the different kinds of voices for so many people are disturbed by voices. They have an idea that it is the voice of God but begin to find themselves in difficulty as a result of obeying that voice. We are told in the 4th chapter of the Epistle of John that we must be able to discern the spirits. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%204:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Beloved, believe not every spirit but try the spirits, whether they are of God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> So God would have us know the difference between false prophecy and the spiritual, divinely appointed prophecy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are voices of all descriptions. I have for some time had to deal with people along this line. If ever you find a person under the power of the evil one you will find that that spirit will never acknowledge that Jesus came in the flesh; so if you want to test any spirit you can tell by that, because often the voice will come right out and say, &ldquo;No, Jesus did not come in the flesh,&rdquo; and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%204:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus came in the flesh is not of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%204:1-13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">4th chapter of Luke we see how Jesus dispelled the power of Satan.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you test a false spirit by the inward presence it will disturb the peace of God and you will know it is of Satan. Make that thing worship the Christ within and the devil will flee. No person need be captured at any time with an evil thought, because we are to understand <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%206:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the wiles of the devil.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Many people are disturbed with thoughts, evil thoughts which usually come early in the morning, but if these are tested the person will always find that they will deny that Jesus came in the flesh. Perhaps some will ask, &ldquo;Is not that a gift of the Spirit to discern the spirits?&rdquo; Yes, it is a gift, but I want to say right here that if you are living in the fulness of the Spirit you will have this gift at any moment when needed. It will not be an abiding gift, just a gift for the needy moment. Every one of you without exception will find that as you go on and on with God you will have to be in the Spirit of God or you will be a failure. It is not possible to love the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%201:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">present evil world</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and have the Holy Ghost within; you cannot love carnality and have the Holy Ghost. When the Holy Ghost comes in, every evil power will be dispelled till your whole body is free from sin and death. Oh you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost to be ready at any moment for Satan&rsquo;s power! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to show you how terribly deceiving these voices can be. One time when I was ministering in a certain place, two young ladies came into the room about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon and instantly we perceived that something had taken place. One of them had on white kid gloves which were spotted with blood. The excitement of these two ladies was such that one could see there was no peace abiding within. If ever you get out of the will of God and Satan comes in you will find there is no rest. I have learned that if anything disturbs my peace it is always Satanic. Neither one of these girls was willing to tell us what had happened. Now that is another way to test voices; God never reveals anything that you cannot tell on the housetop; everything God says to you, you can preach out and if you feel you dare not tell what you have heard this voice telling you, you may be sure it is evil. I know people pride themselves that God speaks to them differently from everyone else; if ever you get to that place you are on the wrong track, you are going one notch downward. It is the false pride of the devil. Some people seem to believe that the devil comes around only with horns and a long tail, big ears and big eyes. Don&rsquo;t you believe it; the devil was turned out of heaven because of his pride and you must never forget that he is called the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%2011:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;angel of light.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He has never lost that pride. And to you ministers I would say that whenever a person comes to you and says, &ldquo;I never heard a man preach like you,&rdquo; you can make sure that is the voice of the devil every time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These two girls were working in a telegraph station and Satan came as an angel of light to one saying, &ldquo;If you will obey me, I will make you the biggest and the best preacher in the world.&rdquo; Now God never speaks that way. The girl became so excited about this and was sure it was the voice of God. She asked off from work for an hour and she became more excited as the voice repeated those words over and over; she got so worked up that she dug her nails into her flesh until the blood came. Then the voice further said to her, &ldquo;You go to the station at 7:30 and, a train will come in. Buy two tickets. Don&rsquo;t tell anyone what I have said except your sister. You will find a train leaving for Glasgow at 7:32. When you have purchased the two tickets you will have six pence over.&rdquo; Sure enough after she had the two tickets she had the six pence left. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;that surely was the Lord speaking to her.&rdquo; Then another part of the message came true for the train came in exactly at 7:32. She was to find in one of the coaches a gentleman sitting with his back to the engine and this man was to have all the money that the girl wanted and was to have it deposited in a certain bank. It needed only brains to think it out, but the people who get to that place do not use their brains and will not let anyone else think for them. They say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try to stop me for no one can stop me. You do not need to talk to me, you have not had the Lord speak to you.&rdquo; This is a dangerous place. These two girls went up and down the coach, the full length of the railway train and failed to find anyone fitting that description. Someone said she had better come down for the next train, so they stayed there until nine o&rsquo;clock. Then the voice said to her, &ldquo;Now that I have found you will obey me, I will make you the best and biggest missionary in the world.&rdquo; You have no idea what it took to get those two girls out of that awful delusion, but God prevailed and both are now on the mission field doing good work. Never be unwilling to take advice for God has other people who know His voice and you must be willing to learn. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">While ministering in another place I had a letter from York, England, saying that they had about fourteen people who were seeking to be filled with the Holy Spirit. They were asking me to come and give them a few addresses on this important subject. So I went and upon arriving I heard the best news anyone could wish to hear. The people said, &ldquo;We have had one of the finest men to join us that you have ever seen; he is a fine teacher. We will just wait and see if he receives the Baptism and then we are thinking of keeping him here as pastor.&rdquo; That was all very good. The preaching went on and God manifested Himself; the power of God came down and people began seeking. About 10:30 that night we saw this promising young man laid out under the power of God. The saints could hardly keep quiet, they rejoiced so over God&rsquo;s dealings. They would say, &ldquo;Now we have him; when he receives his baptism we will have the best man,&rdquo; and they were so jubilant. Everything went well and then about 11:30 the power of God slew him and divine utterance came forth and we were all so glad and had a good time praising God. When he was getting ready to go home the saints came around and said, &ldquo;Oh, we are so glad you got through! you certainly are the best teacher.&rdquo; And then one woman went up to him and said, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you were not the second John the Baptist.&rdquo; That night, while on his way home, the devil came to this young man and said, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you were the second John the Baptist.&rdquo; But he was able to throw it off and would have nothing to do with the voice. But listen, in the middle of the night the devil awakened him, &ldquo;You are John the Baptist. Arise.&rdquo; He was unable to shake that off and the next day he went up and down the street shouting, &ldquo;I am John the Baptist.&rdquo; Who spoiled him? The saints. Who was to blame for his downfall? Those people who should have had more sense. Never tell a preacher how wonderful he is. He knows he is nothing if he is in the right place, and don&rsquo;t you try to make him something. If you do you will get out of the will of the Lord and get him out, too. Is there deliverance for these people? Oh, how we need to distinguish the voice of God from that of Satan. We need to know that God the Holy Ghost has a better plan for us than that. I have met such wrecks. I came across one of the finest men in the ministry, such a good teacher who had been blessed to all the assemblies. It makes me weep now to think of it. You couldn&rsquo;t teach him anything and if you spoke to him he would tell you that God had not spoken to you as to him, adding, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that God has made me a prophet?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t move him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The important point is, How can we tell the difference between the voice of Satan and the voice of God? It is very simple. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">If you don&rsquo;t aspire to be something you will never get into that dangerous place; it is when your own heart desires it that the devil can switch you there.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Never desire to be anything, for in the true Christian&rsquo;s life no man wants to be anything but desires <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('col%203:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Christ to be his all and in all;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> it is to live only for the glory of God, to be filled with the power of God, to be kept at all times in that place where you know you are nothing and can do nothing but for the grace of God. If you ever think you are anything of importance consider Jesus and if you consider Jesus you will find there is no room for exaltation, only brokenness of heart and contriteness of spirit. The Kingdom of God is brought forth in righteousness and truth. What is truth? Truth says that Jesus is the Way; truth says that Jesus is the ideal for us, and we must be like Him; no man who truly follows Jesus and reads the words in Philippians can say any more about himself. Jesus who was the Son of God <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phil%202:7-8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">made Himself of no reputation, took on Himself the form of a servant and humbled Himself even to the death of the cross.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Discerning of Spirits. How much we need it! Sometimes I have been shut in for weeks with demon-possessed men and in the middle of the night-watches these evil spirits have jumped upon me but in the midst of it I have held my ground for God and prayed the man right into perfect deliverance. I am especially reminded of one man. I was shut in for weeks with him and every time an evil spirit was cast out of him it leaped on me. The last one to be cast but laid hold of me so that I had to deliver myself first before I could deliver any one else. In this case the evil spirits used to come out of this man and bind me so that I had to stand still. I couldn&rsquo;t move and the man who was possessed would stand and look at me. As I commanded the evil spirit to leave I would be free again. That man today is perfectly delivered and preaching the Gospel. It took someone who would lay hold of God and not let go until the work was completed. I have learned many things by experience, and if I can make you see this morning that you never will be anything I will be able to get something done here. Anything that is not done for the glory of God is not worth having; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('matt%206:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God sees in secret and will reward openly;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we will have to have secret power with God; we will have to meet God face to face in the closet and then we can come out strong for Him. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

My message is on the lines of faith. Because some do not hear in faith it profits them nothing. There is a hearing of faith and a hearing which means nothing more than listening to words. I beseech you to see to it that everything done may bring not only blessing to you but strength and character, and that you may be able to see the goodness of God in this meeting. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to impress upon you the importance of believing what the Scripture says, and I may have many things to relate about people who dared to believe God until it came to pass. This is a wonderful Word. In fact, all of the Word of God is wonderful. It is an everlasting Word, a Word of power, a Word of health, a Word of substance, a Word of life. It gives life into the very nature, to everyone that lays hold of it, if he believes. I want you to understand that there is a need for the Word of God. But it is a need, many times, that brings us the blessing. What am I here for? Because God delivered me when no other hand could do it. I stand before you as one who was given up by everybody, when no one could help. I was earnest and zealous for the salvation of souls. If you were in Bradford (England), you would know. We had police protection for nearly twenty years in the best thoroughfare in the city, and in my humble way with my dear wife, who was all on fire for God, we were ministering in the open air. Full of zeal? Yes. But one night, thirty years ago, I was carried home helpless. We knew very little about divine healing, but we prayed through. It is thirty years and more since God healed me. I am 68 years old and fresher, in better health, and more fit for work than I was at that time. It is a most wonderful experience when the life of God becomes tbe life of man. The Divine power that sweeps through the organism, cleansing the blood, makes the man fresh every day. The life of God is resurrection power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When they brought me home helpless we prayed all night. We did all we knew. At ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning I said to my wife, &ldquo;This must be my last roll call.&rdquo; We had five children around us. I tell you it was not an easy thing to face our circumstances. I told my wife to do as she thought best but the poor thing didn&rsquo;t know what to do. She called a physician who examined me, shook his head and said, &ldquo;It is impossible for anything to be done for your husband; I am absolutely helpless. He has appendicitis and you have waited too long. His system will not stand an operation. A few hours, at best, will finish him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What the doctor said was true. He left her and said he would come back again but he couldn&rsquo;t give her any hope. When he was nicely out of the house an old lady and a young man who knew how to pray came in. The young man put his knees on the bed and said: &ldquo;Come out, you devil, in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; It was a good job, we had no time for argument, and instantly I was free. Oh, Hallelujah! I was as free as I am now. I never believed that any person ought to be in bed in the daytime and I jumped up and went downstairs. My wife said: &ldquo;Oh, are you up?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, wife; it is all right now,&rdquo; I said. I had some men working for me and she said none of them had turned up that morning, so I picked up my tools and went to work. Then the doctor came. He walked up the stairs and my wife called, &ldquo;Doctor, doctor, he is out!&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is out at work.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will never see him alive again. They will bring him in a corpse.&rdquo; Am I a corpse? Oh, when God does anything it is done forever! and God wants you to know that He wants to do something in you forever. I have laid my hands on people with appendicitis when the doctors were in the place, and God has healed them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will tell you one incident before I pass on. It will stir up your faith. I am not here to be on exhibition. I am here to impart divine truth to you concerning the Word of God that after I leave you can do the same thing. I went to Switzerland and after I had been there for some weeks a brother said, &ldquo;Will you not go to meeting tonight?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have been at it all this time, you can take charge tonight.&rdquo; &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Paul the apostle, left people to do the work and passed on to another place&mdash;I have been here long enough now, you do the work.&rdquo; So he went to the meeting. When he came back he said, &ldquo;We have had a wonderful time.&rdquo; &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I invited them all out, took off my coat and rolled up my sleeves, and prayed and they were all healed. I did just like you did.&rdquo; Jesus says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%2010:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I give you power over all the power of the enemy.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> They entered into the houses and healed the sick that were therein. The ministry of divine operation in us is wonderful, but who would take upon himself to say, &ldquo;I can do this or that?&rdquo; If it is God, it is all right, but if it is yourself, it is all wrong. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%2012:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">When you are weak, then you are strong.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When you are strong in your own strength, you are weak. You must realize this and live only in the place where the power of God rests upon you, and where the Spirit moves within you. Then God will mightily manifest his power and you will know as Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%204:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God brings a remarkable, glorious fact to our minds tonight, the healing at a little helpless girl. The physicians had failed. The mother said to the father: &ldquo;There is only one hope&mdash;if you can see Jesus! As sure as you can meet Jesus our daughter will live.&rdquo; Do you think it is possible for anybody anywhere to go looking for Jesus without seeing Him? Is is possible to think about Jesus without Jesus drawing near? No. This man knew the power there was in the name of Jesus: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2016:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;In my name shall ye cast out devils.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But we must be sure we know that name, for in Acts 19 <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2019:13-15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the seven sons of Sceva said to the man possessed with devils, &ldquo;We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preached to come out.&rdquo; The evil spirit said, &ldquo;I know Paul and I know Jesus, but who are you?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Yes, the devil knows every believer&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2019:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and the seven sons of Sceva nearly lost their lives. The evil powers came upon them and they barely escaped.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is more than repeating the Name; it is the nature of the Name in you; it is more than that; it is the divine personality within the human life which has come to take up His abode in you, and when He becomes all in all then God works through you. It is the life, the power of God. God works through the life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord is that life, and the ministry of it and the power in the ministry, by the Holy Spirit, bring everybody in such a place of divine relationship that He mightily lives in us and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%2010:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">enables us to overcome the powers of the enemy.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord healed that child as they got a vision of Jesus. The word of the Lord came not with observation but with divine, mighty power, working in them until by the power of the Spirit, men and women were created anew by this new life divine. We have to see that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">when this divine Word comes to us by the power of the Holy Ghost, it is according to the will of God that we speak;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> not with men&rsquo;s wisdom, but with divine minds operated by the Word of God; not channels only, but as oracles of the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">As the ruler of the synagogue sought Jesus he worshiped Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How they gathered around Him! How everybody listened to what He had to say! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('matt%207:29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He spoke not as a scribe, but with authority</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and power, decked with divine glory. A young man was preaching in a market place. At the close of the address some atheist came and said, &ldquo;There have been five Christs. Tell us which one it is that you preach.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;The Christ that rose from the dead.&rdquo; There is only one that rose from the dead. There is only one Jesus that lives. And as He lives, we live also. Glory to God! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('col%202:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">We are risen with Him,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> are living with Him, and will reign with Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This ruler, as he drew near the crowd, went up to Him and said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Jesus, my daughter lieth at the point of death. Come and lay thy hands upon her and she will be healed.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; Jesus said. What a beautiful assurance. But as they were coming along the road, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a woman met them who had an issue of blood for twelve years.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When she began with this trouble <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">she sought many physicians. She had some money, but the physicians took it all, and left her worse than they found her.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Have you any that do the same thing around here? When I was a plumber I had to finish my work before I got the money, and I didn&rsquo;t always get it then. I think that if there was an arrangement whereby no doctor got his fee until he cured the patient, there wouldn&rsquo;t be so many people die. Twelve years of sickness this woman had. She needed some one now who could heal without money, for she was bankrupt and helpless. Jesus comes to people that are withered up, diseased, lame, crippled in all kinds of ways, and when He comes there is liberty to the captive, opening of eyes to the blind, and the opening of ears to the deaf. Many had said to this woman, &ldquo;If you had only been with us today. We saw the most marvelous things, the crooked made straight, the lame to walk, the blind to see&rdquo;&mdash;and the woman twelve years sick said, &ldquo;Oh, you make me feel that if I could only see Him I should be healed.&rdquo; It strengthened her faith and it became firm. She had a purpose within her. Faith is a mighty power. Faith will reach at everything. When real faith comes into operation you will not say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel much better.&rdquo; Faith says, &ldquo;I am whole.&rdquo; Faith doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lame leg.&rdquo; Faith says, &ldquo;My leg is all right.&rdquo; Faith never sees a goiter. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A young woman with a goiter came to be prayed for. In a testimony meeting she said, &ldquo;I do praise the Lord for healing my goiter.&rdquo; She went home and said to her mother, &ldquo;O Mother, when the man prayed for me, God healed my goiter.&rdquo; For tweIve months she went about telling everybody how God healed her goiter. Twelve months afterward I was in the same place and people said, &ldquo;How big that lady&rsquo;s goiter is!&rdquo; There came a time for testimony. She jumped up and said, &ldquo;I was here twelve months ago and God healed me of my goiter. Such a marvelous twelve months!&rdquo; When she went home her folks said, &ldquo;You should have seen the people today when you testified that God had healed your goiter. They think there is something wrong with you. If you go upstairs and look in the glass you will see the goiter is bigger than ever it was.&rdquo; She went upstairs, but she didn&rsquo;t look in the glass. She got down on her knees and said, &ldquo;O Lord, let all the people know just as You have let me know, how wonderfully You have healed me.&rdquo; The next morning her neck was as perfect as any neck you ever saw. Faith never looks. Faith praises God&mdash;it is done! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This poor, helpless woman who had been growing weaker and weaker for twelve years pushed into the crowded thoroughfare when she knew Jesus was in the midst. She was stirred to the depths, and she pushed through and touched Him. If you will believe God and touch Him you will be healed at once. Jesus is the Healer! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now listen! Some people put the touch of the Lord in the place of faith. The Lord would not have that woman believe that the touch had done it. She felt as soon as she touched Him that virtue had gone through her, which is true. When the people were bitten by fiery serpents in the wilderness, God&rsquo;s Word said through Moses, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('num%2021:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;He that looketh shall be healed.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The look made it possible for God to do it. Did the touch heal the woman? No, the touch meant something more&mdash;it was a living faith. Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:34')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Thy faith hath made thee whole.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If God would just move on us to believe, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a sick person who could not receive healing. As soon as this woman in the street, with all the crowd about her, began to testify, the devil came. The devil is always in a testimony meeting. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('job%201:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">When the sons of God gathered together in the time of Job, he was there.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:35')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">While this was happening in the street, three persons came rushing from the house of Jairus and said, &ldquo;There is no use now, your daughter is dead. This Jesus can do nothing for a dead daughter. Your wife needs you at home.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:36')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">But Jesus said, &ldquo;Be not afraid, only believe.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He speaks the word just in time! Jesus is never behind time. When the tumult is the worst, the pain the most severe, the cancer gripping the body, then the word comes, &ldquo;Only believe.&rdquo; When everything seems as though it will fail, and is practically hopeless, the Word of God comes to us, &ldquo;Only believe.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">When Jesus came to that house there were a lot of people weeping and wailing.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I have taken my last wreath to the cemetery. To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord, and if you believe that, you will never take another wreath to the cemetery. It is unbelief that mourns. If you have faith that they are with the Lord you will never take another flower to the grave. They are not there. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These people were round about, weeping, wailing and howling. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:39')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He says, &ldquo;Why make you this to-do? The maid is not dead, but sleepeth.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is a wonderful word that God wants you to hear. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2011:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The believer may fall asleep, but the believer doesn&rsquo;t die. Oh, that people would understand the deep things of God&mdash;it would change the whole situation. It makes you look out with a glorious hope to the day when the Lord shall come. What does it say? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1thes%204:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;They that sleep will God bring with Him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus knew that. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('matt%209:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The maid is not dead, but sleepeth; and they laughed him to scorn.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> To show the insincerity of these wailers, they could turn from wailing to laughing. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:40-41')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Jesus took the father and the mother of the maid and, going into the room where she was took her hand and said, &ldquo;Daughter, arise.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And the child sat up. Praise the Lord! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:43')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And He said, &ldquo;Give her something to eat.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, the remarkableness of our Lord Jesus! I want to impress upon you the importance of realizing that He is in the midst. No person need be without the knowledge that they are not only saved, but that God can live in these bodies. You are begotten the moment you believe, unto a lively hope. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%203:36')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;He that believeth hath eternal life.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You have eternal life the moment you believe. The first life is temporal, natural, material, but in the new birth you exist as long as God&mdash;forever&mdash;we are begotten by an incorruptible power, by the Word of God. The new birth is unto righteousness, begotten by God the moment that you believe. God always saves through the heart. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2010:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He that believeth in the heart and confesseth with his mouth shall be saved.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus is here tonight to loose them that are bound. If you are suffering in your body, He will heal you now as we pray. He is saying to every sin-sick soul, to every disease-smitten one, &ldquo;Be not afraid, only believe.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:34')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As we look back over our spiritual careers we always see that there has been a good deal of our own day, and that the end or our day was the beginning of God&rsquo;s day. We cannot enter into the deep things of God until we are free from our own ideas and ways. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2027:36')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The name means supplanter,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but when Jacob came to the end of his way God had a way. How slow we are to see that God has a better way for each one of us. Beloved, the glory is never so wonderful as when God has His way, when we are helpless and throw down our sword and give up our authority to another. Jacob was a great worker and he would go through any hardship if he could only have his way. In many things he had his way, and how gloriously God preserved him from calamity. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('pro%2014:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">There is a way that seems good, but the end of that way is death:</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but God has His very best for each of His own, a higher standard for us than we have yet attained. The best thing is for God&rsquo;s plan and purpose to he fulfilled in our lives, and that we shall be delivered from the way our own natural hearts might lead us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob and his mother had a plan to secure the blessing from Isaac. But how inglorious was the fulfilling of this carnal plan. The result of it was that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2027:41')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing where with his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, &ldquo;The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Our own plans lead us so frequently into disaster. Jacob had to flee from the land. But how gracious the Lord was to that fleeing fugitive. God planned the ladder and the angels. Our God is so gracious that He refused to have His plans of grace frustrated by the carnal workings of Jacob&rsquo;s mind; and so He revealed Himself to Jacob, saying to him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2028:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into the land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the goodness of the Lord that leads to repentance,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and I believe that if ever Jacob was conscious of his own meanness it was when God revealed His wonderful goodness to him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many things may happen in our lives to show us how depraved we are by nature, but when the veil is lifted we see how merciful and tender God is. His tender compassion is over us all the time. Oh how wonderful it is to be where God is! Since the time that Jacob had had the revelation of the ladder and the angels he had had twenty-one years of wandering, fighting and struggling. But God had been faithful to His promise all these years. Listen to Jacob&rsquo;s testimony to his wives. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2031:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God suffered him not to hurt me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And his further testimony to his father-in-law, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2031:42')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Except the God of my father had been with me, thou hadst sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction and the labor of my hands.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now that Jacob was returning to the land of his birth, his heart was full of fear. If ever he needed the Lord it was just at this time. He wanted to be alone with God. Oh to be left alone! Alone with God! In the context we read that all that he had, had gone on. His wives had gone on, his children had gone on, his sheep and oxen had gone on, his camels and asses had gone on, all had gone on. He was alone. You will often find that you are alone. Whether you like it or not. your wife will go on, your children will go on, your cattle will go on. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord saw Jacab&rsquo;s need and came down and met with him. He it was who wrestled with the supplanter, breaking him, changing him, transforming him. Jacob was brought to a place of absolute weakness. He knew that his brother Esau had power to take away all that he had and execute vengeance upon him. He knew that there was only one kind of deliverance. No one could deliver him but God. And there alone, lean in soul and impoverished in spirit he met with God. Oh we need to get alone with God, we need to be broken, we need to he changed, we need to he transformed. And when we meet with God, when He interposes, all care and strife is at an end. When He reveals Himself, all is plain, and the plan of the Holy Ghost is so clear. Get alone with God and receive the revelation of His infinite grace and of His wonderful purposes and plans for your life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob was left alone. The picture is so real to me. Alone! Alone! Alone! He began to think. He would think about the ladder and the angels. I think as he began to pray <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%20137:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">his tongue would cleave to the roof of his mouth.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jacob had to get rid of a lot of things. It had been all Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! It would all be so plain to him there alone with God. If you get alone with God, what a place of revelation! What a revelation of self! What a revelation of the provision at Calvary! It is here that we get the revelation of a life <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%202:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">crucified with Christ,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> transformed by grace, and empowered by the Spirit! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Hour after hour passed. Oh that we might spend all nights alone with God! We stay too long with our relations, our camels and sheep. We are occupied too much with the things of time and sense. We need the presence of God. We need to give God time if we are to receive new revelations from Him. We need to get past all the thoughts of earthly matters that crowd in so rapidly. We need to give God time to deal with us. It is only after He has dealt with us as He dealt with Jacob that we can have power with Him and prevail. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob was not dry-eyed that night. Hosea tells us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('hos%2012:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;He wept and made supplication.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He knew he had been a disappointment to the Lord, he had heen a groveller. But in the revelation that he received as he wrestled that night, he saw the possibility of being transformed from a supplanter to become a prince with God. The testing hour came when at break of day the angel, who was none other than the Lord of hosts, said to him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Let me go, for the day breaketh.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is where we so often fail. Jacob knew that if God went without blessing him, Esau could not be met. You cannot meet the terrible things that await you in the world unless you secure the blessing of God. If you are left alone&mdash;alone with God&mdash;and you cannot get to a place of victory, it is a terrible time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You must never let go, whatever you are seeking&mdash;fresh revelation, light on the path, some particular need&mdash;never let go. Victory is ours if we are earnest enough. If darkness covers you, if it is a fresh revelation you need, or your mind needs relef, or there are problems that you know you cannot solve, lay hold of God and declare, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I will not let Thee go, except thou bless me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In wrestling, the strength is in the neck, the breast and the thigh; but your greatest strength is in your thigh. And so <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the Lord touched Jacob&rsquo;s thigh.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> With his strength gone, surely defeat is certain. What did Jacob do? He hung on. God means to have a people who are broken in themselves, for divine power can only come when there is an end of self-sufficiency. When you are broken, still hold fast. If we let go we shall fall short. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jacob cried, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I will not let thee go except thou bless me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And God blessed him and declared, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Now a new order is beginning. The old supplanter <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%205:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">has passed away, there is a new creation,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and Jacob the supplanter is transformed to Israel the prince. God has come into his life. Henceforth he is a soldier of God and there is victory. When God comes into your life you will find Him enough for all time and all eternity. As Israel comes forth the sun rises upon him and he has power over all the things of the world, and power over Esau. Read how God blessed and honored him. Esau meets him. There is no fighting now, but a blessed reconciliation. They kissed each other. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('pro%2016:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s ways please the Lord, He maketh his enemies to be at peace with him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2033:8-10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;But what about all these cattle, Jacob?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a present.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I have plenty; I don&rsquo;t want your cattle. What a joy it is to see your face again!&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What a wonderful change! The material things don&rsquo;t count for much after a night of revelation. Who wrought this change? God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Could Jacob hold on to the Lord? Can you hold God? Yes, you can. Sincerity can hold Him, dependence can hold Him, weakness can hold Him. It is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%2012:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">when you are weak that you are strong.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But I will tell you what cannot hold Him. Self-righteousness cannot hold Him, pride cannot hold Him, presumption cannot hold Him, highmindedness cannot hold Him; thinking you are something when you are nothing puffed up in your own imagination. But sincerity can hold Him. You can hold Him in the closet, in the prayer meeting, everywhere. If you become lukewarm, instead of being at white-heat, you become a disappointment to God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There may be a thought sometimes that He has left you. Oh no. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2013:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He has promised never to leave us nor forsake us.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He had promised not to leave Jacob and He did not fail in His promise. He has promised not to leave us and He will not fail. We need to get alone with God, to have a real meeting with God. He will bring us down. He will change our names. He will transform us from Jacob to Israel. But we need to lay hold of Him. Jacob held on and clung to Him until the blessing came. If God does not help me I am no good for this world&rsquo;s need. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%2014:34')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">I am no longer salt. It is so easy to lose the savor.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But as we get alone with God and meet with Him and He gives us His blessing, He resalts us, He empowers us, He brings us to brokenness, and moves us into the orbit of His own perfect will. God&rsquo;s Spirit was working in Jacob to bring him to a place of helplessness. We need to be brought to a place of helplessness where we <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('pro%203:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">do not lean upon our own natural understanding.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But when we are brought to a state of helplessness it is then that we need the Lord. It is then that we need His power, and we need to lay hold on Him and not let Him go until our whole being is surging with the mighty power of God, until we are filled with the mighty faith of God, and His very nature is implanted in us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2032:30-31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. And as he passed over Peniel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You may ask, &ldquo;What is the use of a lame man?&rdquo; It is those who have seen the face of God and have heen broken by Him that can meet the forces of the enemy and break down the bulwarks of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2033:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">It is the lame that take the prey.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jacob was brought to a place of dependence upon God. It is when we have the revelation of Calvary, and see that we ourselves are good for nothing, and that God counts us as good for nothing, and has crucified our old natures upon that rugged cross, and has made the cross of Christ real in our lives so that we are broken, that we can come forth to a life of dependence upon the power of the Holy Ghost. Henceforth we are nothing without Him, we are absolutely dependent upon Him. I am absolutely nothing without the power and unction of the Holy Ghost. Oh for a life of absolute dependence! It is only a life of dependence that is a life of power. If you are not there, get alone with God, let Him change and transform you, and never let Him go until He blesses you and makes you an Israel, a prince with God. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Hebrews 11.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is a wonderful passage; in fact all the Word of God is wonderful. It is not only wonderful, but it has power to change conditions. Any natural condition can be changed by the Word of God, which is a supernatural power. In the Word of God is the breath, the nature, and the power of the living God, and His power works in every person who dares to believe His Word. There is life through the power of it; and as we receive the Word in faith we receive the nature of God Himself. It is as we lay hold of God&rsquo;s promises in simple faith that we become <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2pet%201:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">partakers of the divine nature.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As we receive the Word of God we come right into touch with a living force, a power which changes nature into grace, a power that makes dead things live, a power which is of God, which will be manifested in our flesh. This power has come forth with its glory to transform us by divine act into sons of God, to make us like unto THE Son of God, by the Spirit of God who moves us on from grace to grace and from glory to glory as our faith rests in thIs living Word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is important that we have a foundation truth, something greater than ourselves, on which to rest. In <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2012')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Hebrews 12</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we read, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2012:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus is our life and He is the power of our life. We see in the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">5th chapter of Acts</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that as soon as Peter was let out of prison the word of God came, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Go speak... all the words of this life.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is only one Book that has life. In this Word we find Him <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2010:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">who came that we might have life and have it more abundantly,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and by faith this life is imparted to us. When we come into this life by divine faith (and we must realize that it is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%202:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">by grace we are saved through faith, and that it is not of ourselves, but is the gift of God</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">), we become partakers of this life. This Word is greater than anything else. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%201:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">There is no darkness at all in it.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Anyone who dwells in this Word is able under all circumstances to say that he is willing <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%203:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to come to the light that his deeds may be made manifest.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But outside of this Word is darkness, and the manifestations of darkness <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%203:19-20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">will never come to the light because their deeds are evil.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But the moment we are saved by the power of the Word of God we love the light, the truth. The inexpressible divine power, force, passion, and fire that we receive is of God. Drink, my beloved, drink deeply of this Source of life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Faith is the substance of things hoped for.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Someone said to me one day, &ldquo;I would not believe in anything I could not handle and see,&rdquo; Everything you can handle and see is temporary and will perish with the using. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%204:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">But the things not seen are eternal</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and will not fade away. Are you dealing with tangible things or with the things which are eternal, the things that are facts, that are made real to faith? Thank God that through the knowledge of the truth of the Son of God I have within me a greater power, a mightier working, an inward impact of life, of power, of vision and of truth more real than anyone can know who lives in the realm of the tangible. God manifests Himself to the person who dares to believe. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But there is something more beautiful than that. As we receive divine life in the new birth we receive a nature <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2040:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">that delights to do the will of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As we believe the Word of God <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%204:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a well of water springs up within our heart.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> A spring is always better than a pump. But I know that a spring is apt to be outclassed when we get the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%204:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">It was a spring to the woman at the well,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but with the person who has the Holy Ghost it is flowing rivers. Have you these flowing rivers? To be filled with the Holy Ghost is to be filled with the Executive of the Godhead, who brings to us all the Father has and all the Son desires; and we should be so in the Spirit that God can cause us to move with His authority and reign by His divine ability. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I thank God He baptizes with the Holy Ghost. I know He did it for me because they heard me speak in tongues and then I heard myself. That was a scriptural work and I don&rsquo;t want anything else, because I must be <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the epistle of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There must be emanating through my body a whole epistle of the life, of the power, and of the resurrection of my Lord Jesus, There are wonderful things happening through this divine union with God Himself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%201:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;God... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> By this divine Person, this Word, this Son, God made all things. Notice that it says that He made the worlds by this Person and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">made them out of the things that were not there.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Everything we see was made by this divine Son. I want you to see that as you receive the Son of God, and as Christ dwells in your heart by faith, there is a divine force, the power of limitless possibilities, within you, and that as a result of this incoming Christ God wants to do great things through you. By faith, if we receive and accept His Son, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:16-17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God brings us into sonship, and not only into sonship but into joint-heirship, into sharing together with Him all that the Son possesses.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I am more and more convinced every day I live that very few who are saved by the grace of God have a right conception of how great is their <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%2010:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">authority over darkness, demons, death, and every power of the enemy.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is a real joy when we realize our inheritance on this line. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was speaking like this one day and someone said, &ldquo;I have never heard anything like this before. How many months did it take you to get up that sermon?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;My brother, God pressed my wife from time to time to get me to preach and I promised her I would preach. I used to labor hard for a week to get something up, then give out the text and sit down and say, &lsquo;I am done.&rsquo; Oh brother, I have given up getting things up. They all come down. And the sermons that come down stop down, then go back, because the Word of God says <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2055:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">His word shall not return unto Him void.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But if you get anything up it will not stop up very long, and when it goes down it takes you down with it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The sons of God are made manifest</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> in this present earth <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%202:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to destroy the power of the devil.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> To be saved by the power of God is to be brought from the realm of the ordinary into the extraordinary, from the natural into the divine. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you remember the day when the Lord laid His hands on you? You say, &ldquo;I could not do anything but praise the Lord.&rdquo; Well, that was only the beginning. Where are you today? The divine plan is that you increase until you receive the measureless fulness of God. You do not have to say, &ldquo;I tell you it was wonderful when I was baptized with the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; If you have to look back to the past to make me know you are baptized, then you are backslidden. If the beginning was good, it ought to be better day by day, till everybody is fully convinced that you are filled with the might of God in the Spirit. Filled with all the fulness of God! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%205:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I don&rsquo;t want anything else than being full, and fuller, and fuller, until I am overflowing like a great big vat. Do you realize that if you have been created anew and begotten again by the Word of God that there is within you the word of power and the same light and life as the Son of God Himself had. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants to flow through you with measureless power of divine utterance and grace till your whole body is a flame of fire. God intends each soul in Pentecost to be a live wire. Not a monument, but a movement. So many people have been baptized with the Holy Ghost; there was a movement but they have become monuments and you cannot move them. God wake us out of sleep lest we should become indifferent to the glorious truth and the breath of the almighty power of God. We must <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%205:13-14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">be the light and salt of the earth,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> with <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%206:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the whole armor of God</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> upon us. It would be a serious thing if the enemies were about and we had to go back and get our sandals. It would be a serious thing if we had on no breastplate. How can we be furnished with the armor? Take it by faith. Jump in, stop in, and never come out, for this is a baptism to be lost in, where you only know one thing and that is the desire of God at all times. The Baptism in the Spirit should be an ever-increasing enduement of power, an ever-increasing enlargement of grace. Oh Father, grant unto us a real look into the glorious liberty Thou hast designed for the children of God who are delivered from this present world, separated, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2tim%202:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">sanctified, and made meet for Thy use,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> whom Thou hast designed to be filled with all Thy fulness. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Nothing has hurt me so much as this, to see so-called believers have so much unbelief in them that it it hard to move them. There is no difficulty in praying for a sinner to be healed. But with the &ldquo;believer,&rdquo; when you touch him he comes back and says, &ldquo;You did not pray for my legs.&rdquo; I say you are healed all over if you believe. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%209:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Everything is possible to them that believe.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God will not fail His Word whatever you are. Suppose that all the people in the world did not believe, that would make no difference to God&rsquo;s Word, it would be the same. You cannot alter God&rsquo;s Word. It is from everlasting to everlasting, and they who believe in it <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%20125:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">shall be like Mount Zion which cannot be moved.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was preaching on faith one time and there was in the audience a man who said three times, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe.&quot; I kept right on preaching because that made no difference to me. I am prepared for a fight any day, the fight of faith. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2tim%201:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">We must keep the faith which has been committed unto us.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I went on preaching and the man shouted out, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe.&rdquo; As he passed out of the door he cried out again, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe.&rdquo; Next day a message came saying there was a man in the meeting the night before who said out loud three times. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; and as soon as he got outside the Spirit said to him, &ldquo;Because thou wouldst not believe thou shalt be dumb.&rdquo; It was the same Spirit that came to Zacharias and said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%201:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I believe in a hell. Who is in hell? The unbeliever. If you want to go to hell, all you need to do is to disbelieve the Word of God. The unbelievers are there. Thank God they are there for they are no good for any society. I said to the leader of that meeting, &ldquo;You go and see this man and find out if these things are so.&rdquo; He went to the house and the first to greet him was the man&rsquo;s wife. He said, &ldquo;Is it true that your husband three times in the meeting declared that he would not believe, and now he cannot speak?&rdquo; She burst into tears and said, &ldquo;Go and see.&rdquo; He went into the room and saw the man&rsquo;s mouth in a terrible state. The man got a piece of paper and wrote, &ldquo;I had an opportunity to believe. I refused to believe, and now I cannot believe and I cannot speak.&rdquo; The greatest sin in the world is to disbelieve God&rsquo;s Word. We are not of those who draw back, but we are of those who believe, for God&rsquo;s Word is a living Word and it always acts. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day a stylishly dressed lady came to our meeting and on up to the platform. Under her arm, going down underneath her dress, was a concealed crutch that nobody could see, She had been helpless in one leg for twenty years, had heard of what God was doing, and wanted to be prayed for. As soon as we prayed for her she exclaimed, &ldquo;What have you done with my leg?&rdquo; Three times she said it, and then we saw that the crutch was loose and hanging, and that she was standing straight up. The lady that was interpreting for me said to her, &ldquo;We have done nothing with your leg. If anything has been done it is God who has done it.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I have been lame and used a crutch for twenty years, but my leg is perfect now.&rdquo; We did not suggest that she get down at the altar and thank God; she fell down among the others and cried for mercy. I find when God touches us it is a divine touch, life, power, and it thrills and quickens the body so that people know it is God and conviction comes and they cry for mercy. Praise God for anything that brings people to the throne of grace. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God heals by the power of His Word. But the most important thing is, Are you saved, do you know the Lord, are you prepared to meet God? You may be an invalid as long as you live, but you may be saved by the power of God. You may have a strong healthy body but may go straight to hell because you know nothing of the grace of God and salvation. Thank God I was saved in a moment, the moment I believed, and God will do the same for you. God means by this divine power within you to make you follow after the mind of the Spirit by the Word of God, till you are entirely changed by the power of it. You might come on this platform and say, &ldquo;Wigglesworth, is there anything you can look up to God and ask Him for in your body?&rdquo; I will say now that I have a body in perfect condition and have nothing to ask for, and I am 65. It was not always so. This body was a frail, helpless body, but God fulfilled His Word to me according to Isaiah and Matthew&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%208:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Himself took my infirmities and my diseases, my sicknesses, and by His stripes I am healed.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is fine to go up and down and not know you have a body. He took our infirmities, He bore our sickness, He came to heal our broken-heartedness. Jesus would have us to come forth in divine likeness, in resurrection force, in the power of the Spirit, to walk in faith and understand His Word, what He meant when He said <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%2010:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He would give us power over all the power of the enemy.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He will subdue all things till everything comes into perfect harmony with His will. Is He reigning over your affections, desires, will? If so, when He reigns you will be subject to His reigning power. He will be authority over the whole situation. When He reigns, everything must be subservient to His divine plan and will for us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">See what the Word of God says: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; Bless God forever. Oh for Him to be Lord and Master! for Him to rule and control! for Him to be filling your whole body with the plan of truth! Because you are in Christ Jesus all things are subject to Him. It is lovely, and God wants to make it so to you. When you get there you will find divine power continually working. I absolutely believe that no man comes into the place of revelation and activity of the gifts of the Spirit but by this fulfilled promise of Jesus that He will baptize us in the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was taken to see a beautiful nine-year-old boy who was lying on a bed. The mother and father were distracted because he had been lying there for seven months. They had to lift and feed him; he was like a statue with flashing eyes. As soon as I entered the place the Lord revealed to me the cause of the trouble, so I said to the mother, &ldquo;The Lord shows me there is something wrong with his stomach.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Oh no, we have had two physicians and they say it is paralysis of the mind.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;God reveals to me it is his stomach.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no, it isn&rsquo;t. These physicians ought to know, they have X-rayed him.&rdquo; The gentleman who brought me there said to the mother, &ldquo;You have sent for this man, you have been the means of his coming, now don&rsquo;t you stand out against him. This man knows what he has got to do.&rdquo; But Dr. Jesus knows more than that. He knows everything. You have no need to ring the bell for doctors. All you have to do is ring your bell for Jesus and He will come down. You should never turn to human things, because divine things are so much better and just at your call. Who shall interfere with the divine mind of the Spirit which has all revelation, who understands the whole condition of life, for the Word of God declares <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%203:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He knoweth all things,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> is well acquainted with the manifestation of thy body, for everything is naked and open before Him with whom we have to do. Having the mind of the Spirit we understand what is the will of God. I prayed over this boy and laid my hands on his stomach. He became sick and vomited a worm thirteen inches long, and was perfectly restored. Who knows? God knows. When shall we come into the knowledge of God? When we cease from our own mind and allow ourselves to become clothed with the mind and authority of the mighty God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Spirit of God would have us understand there is nothing that can interfere with our coming into perfect blessing except unbelief. Unbelief is a terrible hindrance. As soon as we are willing to allow the Holy Ghost to have His way, we will find great things will happen all the time. But oh how much of our own human reason we have to get rid of, how much human planning we have to become divorced from. What would happen right now if everybody believed God? I love the thought that God the Holy Ghost wants to emphasize the truth that if we will only yield ourselves to the divine plan He is right there to bring forth, the mystery of truth. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How many of us believe the Word? It is easy to quote it, but it is more important to have it than to quote it. It is very easy for me to quote, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%203:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Now are we the sons of God,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but it is more important for me to know whether I am a son of God. When the Son was on the earth He was recognized by the people who heard Him. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%207:46')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Never man spake like Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> His word was with power, and that word came to pass. Sometimes you have quoted, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and you could tell just where to find it. But brother, is it so? Can demons remain in your presence? You have to be greater than demons, Can disease lodge in the body that you touch? You have to be greater than the disease. Can anything in the world stand against you and hold its place if it is a fact that greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world? Dare we stand on the line with the Word of God and face the facts of the difficulties before us? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I can never forget the face of a man that came to me one time: His clothes hung from him, his whole frame was shrivelled, his eyes were glaring and glassy, his jaw bones stuck out, his whole being was a manifestation of death. He said to me, &ldquo;Can you help me?&rdquo; Could I help him? Just as we believe the Word of God can we help anybody, but we must be sure we are on the Word of God. If we are on the Word of God it must take place. As I looked at him I thought I had never seen anybody alive that looked like him. I said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He answered with a breath voice, &ldquo;I had a cancer on my chest. I was operated on and in removing the cancer they removed my swallower; so now I can breathe but cannot swallow.&rdquo; He pulled out a tube about nine inches long with a cup at the top and an opening at the bottom to go into a hole. He showed me that he pressed one part of that into his stomach and poured liquid into the top; and for three months had been keeping himself alive that way. It was a living death. Could I help him? See what the Word of God says: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2011:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Whosoever... shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God wants to move us on scriptural lines. On those lines I said, &ldquo;You shall have a good supper tonight.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot swallow.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You shall have a good supper tonight.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I cannot swallow.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall have a good supper; go and eat.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When he got home he told his wife that the preacher said he could have a good supper that night. He said, &ldquo;If you will get something ready I&rsquo;ll see if I can swallow.&rdquo; His wife got a good supper ready and he took a mouthful. He had had mouthfuls before but they would not go down. But the Word of God said &ldquo;whatsoever,&rdquo; and this mouthful went down, and more and more went down until he was full up. Then what happened? He went to bed with the joy of the knowledge that he could again swallow, and he wakened next morning with that same joy. He looked for a hole in his stomach, but God had shut that up when he opened the other. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Faith is the substance of things hoped for.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Faith is the Word.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2020:7-10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">20th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at verse 7.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Humanity is a failure everywhere. But when humanity is filled with divine power, there is no such thing as failure; and we know that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is not a failure. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are two sides to this Baptism: the first is, that you possess the Baptism; the second is that the Baptism possesses you. This is my message at this time&mdash;</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">being possessed by the Baptizer,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and not merely possessing the Baptizer. There is no limit to the possibilities of such a life, because it has God behind it, in the midst of it, and through it. I see people from time to time very slack, cold, and indifferent; but after they get filled with the Holy Spirit they become ablaze for God. I believe that God&#39;s ministers are to be <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%201:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">flames of fire;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> nothing less than flames; nothing less than mighty instruments with burning messages, with a heart full of love, with such a depth of consecration that God has taken full charge of the body and it exists only that it may manifest the glory of God. Surely, this is the ideal and the purpose of this great plan of salvation for man&mdash;that we might be filled with all the fulness of God, and become ministers of life, God working mightily in us and through us to manifest His grace&mdash;the saving power of humanity. We are only instruments for Him to use, channels through which He shall manifest His power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This glorious Baptism is to be a witness to Jesus, and we must reach the ideal of identification with the Master, so that He can reveal Himself in His grace and power through us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now let us turn to this wonderful Word of God. I want you to see the demonstration of this power in this man Paul&mdash;this man who was <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2015:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;born out of due time;&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> this Paul, who was <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('zec%203:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">plucked as a brand from the burning;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> this Paul <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%209:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">whom God chose to be an apostle to the Gentiles.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> See him first as a persecutor, mad to destroy those who were bringing glad tidings to the people. See how madly he rushed those people to prison, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2026:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">striving to make them blaspheme</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that holy name. Then see this same man changed by the power of God and the Gospel of Christ; see him filled with the Holy Ghost, becoming a builder for God and a revealer of the Son of God, so that he could say, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%202:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;It is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo; (Gal 2:20)</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%209')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">9th chapter of Acts,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we read that he was called to a special ministry. The Lord said to Ananias, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%209:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I will show him what great things he must suffer for my name&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I don&rsquo;t want you to think that this means suffering from diseases; for it means suffering persecution, suffering from slander, from strife, from bitterness, from revilings and from many other evil things; but none of these things will hurt you; rather, they will kindle the fire of holy ambition, because the scripture says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%205:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; (Matt 5:10)</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> To be persecuted for Christ&rsquo;s sake is to be joined up with a blessed, blessed people; but, better still, it means to be united with our Lord Jesus in the closest of fellowship, the fellowship of His suffering. There is a day coming when we will rejoice greatly that we have been privileged to suffer for His name&rsquo;s sake. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, God wants witnesses, witnesses to the truth, witnesses to the full truth, witnesses to the fulness of redemption&mdash;deliverance from sin and deliverance from disease&mdash;by the eternal power working in them, as they are filled with life through the Spirit. God wants us to believe that we may be ministers of that kind&mdash;of glorious things wrought in us by the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">See in <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">verse 7,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> how Paul was lost in his zeal for his ministry, so that he <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;continued his speech until midnight.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Then something happened that threatened to break up the meeting&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a young man, becoming sleepy, fell out of the window.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> That was enough to break up any ordinary meeting. But this man, filled with the Spirit of God, was equal even to such an emergency even on the moment. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He went down, picked up the young man, brought life back into him</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> by the Spirit of life that was in him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">then returned to the upper room and continued the meeting</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> until break of day. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Switzerland the people said to me, &ldquo;How long can you preach to us?&rdquo; I said to them, &ldquo;When the Holy Ghost is upon us, we can preach forever!&rdquo; When I was in San Francisco, driving down the main street one day, we came across a crowd in the street. The driver stopped and I jumped out of the car, and right across from where the tumult was, I found a boy lying on the ground apparently in the grip of death. I got down and asked, &ldquo;What is amiss?&rdquo; He replied in a whisper, &ldquo;tramp.&rdquo; I put my hand underneath his back and said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus, come out.&rdquo; And the boy jumped up and ran away, not even stopping to say, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So you will find out that, with the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, you will be in a position to act when you have no time to think. The power and working of the Holy Spirit is of divine origin. It is the supernatural, God thrilling and moving one with the authority and power of almightiness, and it brings things to pass that could not come to pass in any other way. I had some things of this character happen on the ship as I was crossing the ocean. I want ever to be in Paul&rsquo;s position&mdash;that at any time, even at midnight, in the face of anything, even death itself, God may be able to manifest His power and do what He wants to do through me. This is what it means to be possessed by the Spirit of God. My heart is thrilled with the possibility of coming into the place where Paul was. Let us read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">verse 19,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that we may get our mind perfectly fortified with this blessed truth that God has for us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2020:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Serving the Lord with all humility of mind.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> None of us are going to be able to be ministers of this new covenant of promise in the unction and power of the Spirit without humility. It seems to me that the way to get up is to get down. It is clear to me that in the measure that the dying of the Lord is in me, the life of the Lord will abound in me. And to me, truly, a Baptism in of the Holy Spirit is not the goal, but it is an inflow to reach the highest level, the holiest position that it is possible for human nature to reach by Divine power. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is given to reveal and to make real Him in whom dwells <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('col%202:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo;&nbsp;(Col. 2:9)</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> So I see that to be baptized in the Holy Spirit means to be baptized into death, into life, into power, into fellowship with the Trinity, where the old life ceases to be, and the life of God possesses us forever. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('exod%2033:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">No man can live after seeing God;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and God wants us all to see Him in all His glorious, infinite sufficiency, so that we shall joyfully cease to be&mdash;that He may become our life. Thus it was that Paul could say, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%202:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;It is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I believe that God wants to make real to us all this ideal of humility where we so recognize human helplessness and human insufficiency that we shall rest no more on human plans and human devices and human energy, but continually look to God for His thought, for His voice, for His power, for His all-sufficiency in all things. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now here is another word for us. Let us read it. It is found in <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">verse 22. &ldquo;Now, behold, I go bound in spirit.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Is there a possibility of the human so coming into oneness with the divine will? Let me give you two other versions of Scripture. Jesus was a man of flesh and blood like ourselves, though He was the incarnation of the authority and power and majesty of heaven, yet he bore about in his body our flesh, our human weakness, being <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%204:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Oh, He was so lovely! Such a perfect Savior! Oh, that I could shout &ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; so that all the world would hear. There is salvation, life, power, and deliverance through that name; but, beloved, I read in <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%201:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Mark 1:12, that that body was driven by the Spirit.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%204:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">fourth chapter of Luke, it says &ldquo;led&rdquo; by the Spirit.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And now here is Paul &ldquo;bound&rdquo; in the spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, what condescension that God should lay hold of humanity and so possess it with His holiness, with His righteousness, with His truth, with His faith, that man can say, &ldquo;I am bound in spirit; I have no choice; my only choice is for God; my only desire, my only ambition is the will of God; I am bound with God.&rdquo; Is this possible, beloved? If you look into <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%201')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Galatians, first chapter,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> you will see how wonderfully he rose into this state of bliss. If you look in the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">third chapter of the Ephesians,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> you will see that he recognized himself as <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">less than the least of all saints.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Then, if you&#39;ll look into the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2026')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">26th chapter of Acts,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> you will find him saying, &ldquo;I have never lost the vision, King Agrippa, I have never lost it.&rdquo; Then if you will look again in Galatians, you will see that, in order to keep the vision, he <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%201:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">conferred not with flesh and blood;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God laid hold of him, God bound him, God preserved him. I ought to say, however, that it is a wonderful position to be in&mdash;to be preserved by Almightiness&mdash;and we ought to see to it that we leave ourselves to God. The consequences will be all right. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%209:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life for my sake the same shall save it.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is no end to such a life; it reaches right into glory. As a man yields hitnself to God. God lays hold of him in the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. There is a possibility of being taken charge of by God and left in the world to carry out the plan of God, to be the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%205:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;salt of the earth.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now, beloved, I am out for men. It is my business to be out for men. It is my business to make everybody hungry, dissatisfied. It is my business to make people either glad or mad. I have a message from heaven that will not leave people as I find them. Something must happen after they are filled with the Holy Spirit. A man filled with the Holy Spirit is no longer an ordinary man. A man can be swept by the power of God in the first stage of the revelation of Christ so that from that moment he will be an extraordinary man. But to be filled with the Holy Spirit he has to become a free, free body for God to dwell in, and to use, and to manifest Himself through. So I appeal to you, you people who have received the Holy Spirit, I appeal to you to let God have His way at whatever cost; I appeal to you to keep moving on with God into an ever-increasing realization of His infinite purposes in Christ Jesus for His redeemed ones until <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">you are filled unto all the fulness of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> To remain three days in the same place would indicate that you had </span><span class="cs12506F1C">lost the vision.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The child of God must catch the vision anew every day. Every day the child of God must be moved more and more by the Holy Ghost. The child of God must come into line with the power of heaven so that he knows that God has His hand upon him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;I know the Lord, I know the Lord, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I know the Lord laid His hand on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is the same Jesus, the very same Jesus. He went about doing good. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2010:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Beloved, is not that the ministry that God would have us see we are heir to? The mission of the Holy Ghost is to give us a revelation of Jesus and to make the Word of God life unto us as it was when spoken by the Son&mdash;as new, as fresh, as effective as if the Lord Himself were speaking. The Bride loves to hear the Bridegroom&rsquo;s voice! Here it is, the blessed Word of God, the whole Word, not part of it, no, no, no! We believe in the whole of it. We really have such an effectiveness worked in us by the Word of life, that day by day we are finding out that the Word itself giveth life; the Spirit of the Lord, breathing through, revealing by the Word, giving it afresh to us, makes the whole Word alive today. Amen. So I have within my hands, within my heart, within my mind, this blessed reservoir of promises that is able to do so many marvelous things. Some of you most likely have been suffering because you have a limited revelation of Jesus, of the fulness of life there is in Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Oakland, Calif., we had a meeting in a large theater. God wrought in filling the place till we had to have overflow meetings. There was a rising tide of people getting saved in the meeting by rising voluntarily up and down in the place, and getting saved. And then we had a rising tide of people who needed help in their bodies, rising in faith and being healed. One of these latter was an old man 95 years of age. He had heen suffering for three years, till he got to the place where for three weeks he had been taking liquids. He was in a terrible state. I got him to stand while I prayed for him; and he came back, and, with radiant face, told us that new life had come into his body. He said, &ldquo;I am 95 years old. When I came into the meeting, I was full of pain from cancer of the stomach. I have been so healed that I have been eating perfectly, and have no pain.&quot; Many of the people were healed in a similar way. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">(After the telling of the above incident in the meeting in Wellington, New Zealand, where this address was given, a lady arose who had rheumatism in the left leg. After being prayed for, she ran the full length of the hall several times, then testified to partial healing. A young man with pain in the head was healed instantly. Another man with pain in the head was healed instantly also.) </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%202')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">second chapter of Acts,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> you will see that when the Holy Ghost came there was such a manifestation of the power of God that it wrought conviction as the Word was spoken in the Holy Ghost. In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%203')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">third chapter</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we read of the lame man healed at the Beautiful Gate through the power of the Spirit, as Peter and John went into the Temple.

Will you not, right now, open your heart to this wonderful God, and let Him come into your life and make of you all that His infinite wisdom has conceived, all that His infinite love has moved Him to provide in Christ Jesus, and that His infinite power, through the Holy Ghost, has made possible to be wrought in sinful man. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Seek this vision from God, and keep it ever before you.

When the Holy Spirit fell in the early days, a number of spiritists came to our meetings. They thought we had received something like they had and they were coming to have a good time. They filled the two front rows of our mission. When the power of God fell, these imitators began their shaking and muttering under the power of the devil. The Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon me and I cried. &ldquo;Now, you devils, clear out of this!&rdquo; And out they went. I followed them right out into the street and then they turned round and cursed me. There was power from below, but it was no match for the power of the Holy Ghost, and they soon had to retreat. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord wants all saved people to receive power from on High&mdash;power to witness, power to act, power to live, and power to show forth the divine manifestation of God within. The power of God will take you out of your own plans and put you into the plan of God. You will be unmantled and divested of that which is purely of yourself and put into a divine order. The Lord will change you and put His mind where yours was, and thus enable you to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%202:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">have the mind of Christ.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Instead of you laboring according to your own plan, it will be God working in you and through you to do His own good pleasure through the power of the Spirit within. Someone has said that you are no good until you have your &ldquo;I&rdquo; knocked out. Christ must reign within, and the life in the Holy Ghost means at all times the subjection of your own will to make way for the working out of the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2012:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">good and acceptable and perfect will of God</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> within. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord Jesus gave commandment that the disciples should tarry until they were endued with power from on High, and in <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%202')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 2</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we read how the Spirit of God came. He comes the same way today and we don&rsquo;t know of the Holy Ghost coming any other way. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was holding a meeting, once, in London, and at the close a man came to me and said, &ldquo;We are now allowed to hold meetings in this hall after 11 o&rsquo;clock, and we would like you to come home with us. I am so hungry for God.&rdquo; The wife said she, too, was hungry, and so I agreed to go with them. At about 12:30 we arrived at their house. The man began stirring up the fire and said, &ldquo;Now we will have a good supper.&rdquo; I said to them, &ldquo;I did not come here for your warm fire, your supper or your bed. I came here because I thought you were hungry to get more of God.&rdquo; We got down to pray and at about 3:30 the Lord baptized the wife, and she spoke in tongues as the Spirit gave utterance. At about 5 o&rsquo;clock I spoke to the husband and asked how he was getting on. He replied, &ldquo;God has broken my iron, stubborn will.&rdquo; He had not received the Baptism, but God had wrought a mighty work within him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The following day, at his business, everyone could tell that a great change had come to him. Before he had been a walking terror. The men who labored for him had looked upon him as a regular devil because of the way he had acted; but coming into contact with the power of God that night completely changed him. Before this he had made a religious profession, but he had never truly entered into the experience of the new birth until that night, when the power of God surged so mightily through his home. A short while afterwards I went to this man&rsquo;s home, and his two sons ran to me and kissed me, saying, &ldquo;We have a new father.&rdquo; Previous to this these boys had often said to their mother, &ldquo;Mother, we cannot stand it in the home any longer. We will have to leave.&rdquo; But the Lord changed the whole situation that night as we prayed together. On the second visit the Lord baptized this man in the Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit will reveal false positions, pull the mask off any refuge of lies and clean up and remove all false conditions. When the Holy Spirit came in, that man&rsquo;s house and business and he himself were entirely changed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When the Holy Spirit comes in He comes to empower you to be an effective witness. At one time we were holding some special meetings and I was out distributing bills. I went into a shoemaker&rsquo;s store and there was a man with a green shade over his eyes and also a cloth. My heart looked up to the Lord and I had the witness within that He was ready to change any condition. The man was crying, &ldquo;Oh! Oh!! Oh!!!&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; He said he was suffering with great inflammation and burning. I said, &ldquo;I rebuke this condition in Jesus&rsquo; name.&rdquo; Instantly the Lord healed him. He took off the shade and cloth and said, &ldquo;Look, it is all gone.&rdquo; I believe the Lord wants us to enter into real activity and dare to do for Him. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%201:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one time a lady wrote and asked if I could go and help her. She said that she was blind, having two blood clots behind her eyes. When I reached the house they brought the blind woman to me. We were together for some time and then the power of God fell. Rushing to the window she exclaimed, &ldquo;I can see! Oh, I can see! The blood is gone, I can see.&rdquo; She then inquired about receiving the Holy Spirit and confessed that for ten years she had been fighting our position. She said, &ldquo;I could not bear these tongues, but God has settled the whole thing today. I now want the Baptism in the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; The Lord graciously baptized her in the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Spirit will come when a man is cleansed. There must be a purging of the old life. I never saw anyone baptized who was not clean within. I never saw a man baptized who smoked. We take it for granted that anyone who is seeking the fullness of the Spirit is free from such things as these. You cannot expect the Third Person of the Trinity to come into an unclean temple. There first must be a confession of all that is wrong and a cleansing in the precious blood of Jesus Christ. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I remember being in a meeting at one time, where there was a man seeking the Baptism, and he looked like he was in trouble. He was very restless, and finally he said to me, &ldquo;I will have to go.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;God is unveiling things to me, and I feel so unworthy.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Repent of everything that is wrong.&rdquo; He continued to tarry and the Lord continued to search his heart. These times of waiting on God for the fullness of the Spirit are times when He searches the heart and tries the reins. Later the man said to me, &ldquo;I have a hard thing to do, the hardest thing I have ever had to do.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Tell the Lord you will do it, and never mind the consequences.&rdquo; He agreed, and the next morning he had to take a ride of thirty miles and go with a bag of gold to a certain party with whom he dealt. This man had a hundred head of cattle and he bought all his feed at a certain place. He always paid his accounts on a certain day, but one day he missed. He was always so punctual in paying his accounts that when later the people of his firm went over their books, they thought they must have made a mistake in not crediting the man with the money and so they sent him a receipt. The man never intended not to pay the account, but if you defer to do a right thing the devil will see that you never do it. But when that man was seeking the Lord that night the Lord dealt with him on this point, and he had to go and straighten the thing the next morning. He paid the account and then the Lord baptized him in the Spirit. They <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2052:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">that bear the vessels of the Lord must be clean,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> must be holy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When the Holy Spirit comes He always brings a rich revelation of Christ. Christ becomes so real to you that, when, under the power of the Spirit, you begin to express your love and praise to Him, you find yourself speaking in another tongue. Oh, it is a wonderful thing! At one time I belonged to a class who believed that they had received the Baptism in the Spirit without the speaking in tongues. There are many folks like that today, but if you can go with them to a prayer meeting you will find them asking the Lord again and again to baptize them in the Spirit. Why all this asking if they really have received the Baptism? I have never heard anyone who has received the Baptism in the Holy Ghost after the original pattern asking the Lord to give them the Holy Ghost. They know of a surety that He has come. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was once traveling from Belgium to England. As I landed I received a request to stop at a place between Harwich and Colchester. The people were delighted that God had sent me, and told me of a special case they wanted me to pray for. They said, &ldquo;We have a brother here who believes in the Lord, and he is paralyzed from his loins downward. He cannot stand on his legs and he has been twenty years in this condition.&rdquo; They took me to this man and as I saw him there in his chair I put the question to him. &ldquo;What is the greatest desire in your heart?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Oh, if I could only receive the Holy Ghost!&rdquo; I was somewhat surprised at this answer, and I laid my hands on his head and said, &ldquo;Receive ye the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; Instantly the power of God fell upon him and he began breathing very heavily. He rolled off the chair and there he lay like a bag of potatoes, utterly helpless. I like anything that God does. I like to watch God working. There he was with his great, fat body, and his head was working just as though it was on a swivel. Then to our joy he began speaking in tongues. I had my eyes on every bit of him and as I saw the condition of his legs I said, &ldquo;Those legs can never carry that body.&rdquo; Then I looked up and said, &ldquo;Lord, tell me what to do.&rdquo; The Holy Ghost is the executive of Jesus Christ and the Father. If you want to know the mind of God you must have the Holy Ghost to bring God&rsquo;s latest thought to you and to tell you what to do. The Lord said to me, &ldquo;Command him in My name to walk.&rdquo; But I missed it, of course. I said to the people there, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can lift him up.&rdquo; But we could not lift him, he was like a ton weight. I cried, &ldquo;Oh Lord, forgive me.&rdquo; I repented of doing the wrong thing, and then the Lord said to me again, &ldquo;Command him to walk.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Arise in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; His legs were immediately strengthened. Did he walk? He ran all round. A month after this he walked ten miles and back. He has a Pentecostal work now. When the power of the Holy Ghost is present, things will happen. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is more for us all yet, praise the Lord. This is only the beginning. So far we have only touched the fringe of things. There is so much more for us if we will but yield to God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you want to receive the Spirit? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%2011:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I am a father and I want to give my boys the very best. We human fathers are but finite, but our heavenly Father is infinite. There is no limit to the power and blessing <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%202:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He has laid up for them that love Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Be filled with the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

It is God&rsquo;s delight to make possible to us that which seems impossible, and when we reach a place where He alone has right of way, then all the things that have been misty and misunderstood are cleared up. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2pet%201:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">like precious faith</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that Peter is writing about is a gift that God is willing to give to all of us, and I believe God wants us to receive it so that we may subdue kingdoms, work righteousness, and, if the time is come, to stop the mouths of lions. We should be able under all circumstances to triumph, because we have <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phil%203:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">no confidence in ourselves,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but our confidence would be only in God. It is always those people who are full of faith that have a good report, that never murmur, that are in the place of victory, that are not in the place of human order but of divine order, since God has come to dwell in them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord Jesus is the Divine Author and brings into our minds the &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord&rdquo; every time. We must not have anything in our lives but what we have a &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord&rdquo; for it. We must see to it that the Word of God is always the standard of everything. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This like precious faith is for us all. But there may be some hindrance in your life that God will have to deal with. It seems as if I had had a thousand road engines come over my life to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%202:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">break me up like a potter&rsquo;s vessel.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is no other way into the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%202:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">deep things of God</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but a broken spirit. There is no other way into the power of God.

Whatever your estimation is of your ability, or your righteousness, you are no better than your faith. No one is ever any better than their faith. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%205:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God overcomes the world.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How? This Jesus, upon whom your faith is placed, the power of His name, His personality, His life, His righteousness, are all made yours through faith. As you believe in Him and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%203:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">set your hope only on Him, you are purified even as He is pure.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You are strengthened because He in whom you trust is strong.

I can not understand God by impressions or feelings; I can not get to know God by sentiments. If I am going to know God I am going to know Him by His Word. I know I shall be in heaven, but I could not build on my feelings that I am going to heaven. I am going to heaven because God&rsquo;s Word says it and I believe God&rsquo;s Word. And <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2010:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is one thing that can hinder our faith, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1tim%204:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a conscience that is seared.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Paul sought <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2024:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to have a conscience void of offense.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is a conscience that is seared, and there is a conscience that is so opened to the presence of God that the smallest thing in the world will drive it to God. What we need is a conscience that is so opened to God that not one thing can come into and stay in our lives to break up our fellowship and shatter our faith in God. And when we can come into the presence of God with <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1tim%201:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a clear conscience and a faith unfeigned,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> our heart condemning us not, then have we confidence toward God, and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%203:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">whatsoever we ask we receive of Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2011:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Mark 11:24</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we read, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2011:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The previous verse speaks of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2011:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">mountains removed,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> difficulties cleared away. Veneering won&rsquo;t do. We must have reality, the real working of our God. We must know God. We must be able to go in and hold converse with God. We must also know the mind of God toward us, so that all our petitions are always on the line of His will. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As this like precious faith becomes a part of you, it will make you so that you will dare to do anything. And remember, God wants daring men. Men who will dare all, men who will be strong in Him and dare to do exploits. How shall we reach this plane of faith? Give up your own mind. Let go your own thoughts, and take the thoughts of God, the Word of God. If you build yourself on imaginations you will go wrong. You have the Word of God and it is enough. A man gave this remarkable testimony concerning the Word, &ldquo;Never compare this Book with other books. Comparisons are dangerous. Never think or never say that this book contains the Word of God. It is the Word of God. It is supernatural in origin, eternal in duration, inexpressible in value, infinite in scope, regenerative in power, infallible in authority, universal in interest, personal in application, inspired in totality. Read it through. Write it down. Pray it in. Work it out. And then pass it on.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And truly the Word of God changes a man until he becomes an epistle of God. It transforms his mind, changes his character, moves him on from grace to grace, makes him an inheritor of the very nature of God. God comes in, dwells in, walks in, talks through, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rev%203:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and sups with him who opens his being</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> to the Word of God and receives the Spirit who inspired it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was going over to New Zealand and Australia, I had many to see me off. There was an Indian doctor who was riding in the same car with me to the docks. He was very quiet and took in all things that were said on the ship. I began to preach of course, and the Lord began to work among the people. In the second class of the ship there was a young man and his wife who were attendants on a lady and gentleman in the first class. And as these two young people heard me talking to them privately and otherwise, they were very much impressed. Then the lady they were attending got very sick. In her sickness and her loneliness she could find no relief. They called in the doctor, and the doctor gave her no hope. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And then, when in this strange dilemma&mdash;she was a great Christian Scientist, a preacher of it, and had gone up and down preaching it&mdash;they thought of me. Knowing the conditions, and what she lived for, that it was late in the day, that in the condition of her mind she could only receive the simplest word, I said to her, &ldquo;Now you are very sick, and I won&rsquo;t talk to you about anything save this; I will pray for you in the name of Jesus, and the moment I pray you will be healed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And the moment I prayed she was healed. That was this like precious faith in operation. Then she was disturbed. Now I could have poured in oil very soon. But I poured in all the bitter drugs possible, and for three days I had her on cinders. I showed her her terrible state, and pointed out to her all her folly and the fallacy of her position. I showed her that there was nothing in Christian Science, that it is a lie from the beginning, one of the last agencies of hell. At best a lie, preaching a lie, and producing a lie. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then she wakened up. She became so penitent and broken hearted. But the thing that stirred her first was she had to go to preach the simple gospel of Christ where she had preached Christian Science. She asked me if she had to give up certain things. I won&rsquo;t mention the things, they are too vile. I said, &ldquo;No, what you have to do is to see Jesus and take Jesus.&rdquo; When she saw the Lord in His purity, the other things had to go. At the presence of Jesus all else goes. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This opened the door. I had to preach to all on the boat. This gave me a great chance. As I preached, the power of God fell, conviction came and sinners were saved. They followed me into my cabin one after another. God was working there. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then this Indian doctor came. He said, &ldquo;What shall I do? I can not use medicine any more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, your preaching has changed me. But I must have a foundation. Will you spend some time with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course I will.&rdquo; Then we went alone and God broke the fallow ground. This Indian doctor was going right back to his Indian conditions under a new order. He had left a practice there. He told me of the great practice he had. He was going back to his practice to preach Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If you have lost your hunger for God, if you have not got a cry for more of God, you are missing the plan. There must come up from us a cry that can not be satisfied with anything but God. He wants to give us the vision of the prize ahead that is something higher than we have ever attained. If you ever stop at any point, pick up at the place where you have dropped through, and begin again under the refining light and power of Heaven and God will meet you. And while He will bring you to a consciousness of your own frailty and to a brokenness of spirit, your faith will lay hold of Him and all the divine resources. His light and compassion will be manifested through you, and He will send the rain. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Shall we not dedicate ourselves afresh to God? Some say, &ldquo;I dedicated myself last night to God.&rdquo; Every new revelation brings a new dedication. Let us seek Him. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

We have no right to open the Word of God carelessly or indifferently. I have no right to come to you with any message unless it is absolutely in the perfect order of God. I believe we are in order to consider further the subject so necessary to be informed about in these days when so many people are receiving the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and then do not know which way to go. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have a great need to-day.

God&rsquo;s love is desirous that we should walk up and down the earth as His Son, clothed, filled, radiant, with fire beaming forth from the countenance, setting forth the power of the Spirit, so that the people jump into liberty. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But there is deplorable ignorance among those who have gifts. It is not right for you to think that because you have a gift you are to wave it before the people and try to get their minds upon that, because if you do you will be out of the will of God. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2011:29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Gifts and callings may be in the body without repentance,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but remember that God calls you to account for the gifts being properly administered in a spiritual way after you have received it. It is not given to adorn </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">you</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, but to sustain, build, edify and bless the church. When the church receives this edification and God ministers through that member, then all the members will rejoice together. God moves upon us as His offspring, as His choice, and fruit of the earth. He wants us to be decked in wonderful raiment, even as our Master. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">His operations upon us may be painful but the wise saint will remember that among those whom God chastens it is he who is exercised hy that chastening to whom <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2012:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; Therefore let Him do with you what seemeth Him good, for He has His hand upon you and He will not willingly take it off till He has performed the thing He knows you need. So if He comes with a fan, be ready for the fan. If He comes with chastisement, be ready for chastisement. If He comes with correction, be ready for correction. Whatever He wills to do, let Him do it and He will bring you to the land of plenty. Oh, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">it is worth the world to be under the power of the Holy Ghost!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If He chastens you not, if you sail placidly along without incident, without crosses, without persecutions, without trials, remember that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2012:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, thon are ye bastards and not sons.&rdquo; Hebrews 12:8.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Therefore <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%2013:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Never forget that Jesus said this word: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2010:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;They that hear My voice, follow Me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus wants you all to follow, wants you to have a clear ring in your testimony. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You are eternally saved by the power of God. Do not be led astray by anything, do not take your feelings for your salvation, do not take anybody&rsquo;s word for your salvation. Believe that God&rsquo;s Word is true. What does it say? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%203:36')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;He that hath the Son hath life; he that hath not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When your will becomes entirely the will of God, then you are clearly in the place where the Holy Ghost can make Jesus Lord in your life, Lord over your purchases, Lord over your selling, Lord over your eating and your drinking, your clothing and your choice of companionship. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:4-7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.&rdquo; 1 Corinthians 12:4-7.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The variation of humanity is tremendous. Faces are different, so is physique. Your whole body may be so tempered that one particular gift would not suit you at all while it would suit another person. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So the Word of God deals here with varieties of gifts, meaning that these gifts perfectly meet the condition of people in this place. That is God&rsquo;s plan. Not one person, it may be, would be led out to claim all gifts. Nevertheless, do not be afraid; the Scriptures are definite. Paul said that you need not come behind in any gift. God has for you wonderful things beyond what you have ever known. The Holy Ghost is so full of prophetic operation of divine power, that it is marvelous what may happen after the Holy Ghost comes. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How He loosed me! I am no good without the Holy Ghost. The power of the Holy Ghost loosed my language. I was like my mother. She had no language. If she began to tell a story, she couldn&rsquo;t go through. My father would say, &ldquo;Mother, you will have to begin again.&rdquo; I was like that. I couldn&rsquo;t tell a story, I was bound. Plenty of thought, but no language. But oh, after the Holy Ghost came! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When He came I had a great desire after gifts. So the Lord caused me to see that it is possible for every believer to live in such holy unction, such divine communion, such pressed-in measure by the power of the Spirit that every gift can he his. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But is there not a vast and appalling unconcern about possessing the gifts? Ask of a score of saints chosen at random from almost any assembly, &ldquo;Have you any of the gifts of the Spirit?&rdquo; and the answer will be, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and given in a tone and with a manner that conveys the thought that the saint is not surprised at not having the gifts, that he doesn&rsquo;t expect to have any of them, and does not expect to seek for them. Isn&rsquo;t this terrible when this living Word exhorts us specifically to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Covet earnestly the best gifts&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So in order that the gift might be everything and in evidence, we have to see that we cease to live excepting for His glory. He works with us, we work with Him, co-operative, working together. This is divine. Surely this is God&rsquo;s plan. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has brought you to the banquet and He wants to send you away full. We are in a place where God wants to give us visions. We are in a place where His great love is being bent over us with kisses. Oh, how lovely the kiss of Jesus, the expression of His love! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh come, let us seek Him for the best gifts, and let us strive to be wise and rightly divide the Word of Truth, giving it forth in power that the church may be edified and sinners may be saved. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The most important thing, the one thing that counts, is to see that we are filled with the Holy Spirit, filled to overflowing. Anything less than this is displeasing to God. We are commanded by God to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%205:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">be filled with the Spirit,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and in the measure you fall of this you are that far short of the plan of God. The Lord would have us moving on from faith to faith, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">from glory to glory,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> from fulness to overflowing. It is not good for us to be ever thinking of the past tense, but we should be moving on to the place where we dare believe God. He has declared that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%201:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">after the Holy Ghost is come upon us we shall have power.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I believe there is an avalanche of power from God to be apprehended if we will but catch the vision. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul wrote at one time, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%2012:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I will now come to visions and revelations.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God has put us in a place where He expects us to have His latest revelation, the revelation of that marvelous fact, </span><span class="cs53F207AF">CHRIST IN US</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and what this really means. We can apprehend Christ fully only as we are filled and overflowing with the Spirit of God. Our only safeguard from dropping back into our natural mind from which we can never get anything, is to be filled and yet filled again with the Spirit of God and to be taken on to visions and revelations on a new line. The reason why I emphasize the importance of the fulness of the Holy Ghost is that I want to get you beyond all human plans and thoughts into the fulness of vision, into the full revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. Do you want rest? It is in Jesus. Do you want to be saved from everything the devil is bringing up in these last times? Receive and continue in the fulness of the Holy Ghost, and He will be ever revealing to you that all you need for all times is in Christ Jesus your Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I desire to emphasize the importance of the Spirit&rsquo;s ministration and of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Cor%2012:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the manifestation of the Spirit which is given to every man to profit withal.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As you yield to the Spirit of the Lord He has power over your intellect, over your heart, and over your voice. The Holy Spirit has power to unveil Christ and to project the vision of Christ upon the canvas of your mind, and then He uses your tongue to glorify and magnify Him in a way that you could never do apart from the Spirit&rsquo;s power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Never say that when you are filled with the Holy Ghost you are &ldquo;obliged&rdquo; to do this or that. When people say that they are &ldquo;obliged&rdquo; to do this or that I know it is not the Spirit of God, but their own spirit moving them on to do that which is unseemly and unprofitable. Lots of people spoil meetings because they scream. If you want to do that kind of thing you had better get into some cellar. That is not to edification. I believe that, when the Spirit of God is upon you and moving you <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to speak as He gives utterance,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> it will <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">always be to edification.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But don&rsquo;t spoil the prayer meeting because when you ought to stop you go on. Who spolls the prayer meeting? The man who starts in the Spirit and finishes in the flesh. Nothing is more lovely than prayer, but a prayer meeting is killed if you will go on and on in your own spirit when the Spirit of God is through with you. You say as you come from some meetings, &ldquo;That was a lovely message if the preacher only had stopped half an hour before he did.&rdquo; Learn to cease immediately [once] the unction of the Spirit lifts. The Holy Ghost is jealous. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%206:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Your body is the temple, the office of the Holy Ghost,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but He does not fill the temple for human glorification, but only for the glory of God. You have no license to continue beyond a &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is another side to this. God would have the assembly as free as possible, and you must not put your hand upon the working of the Spirit or it will surely bring trouble. You must be prepared to allow a certain amount of extravagance in young and newly baptized souls. You must remember that when you were brought into this life of the Spirit you had as many extravagances as anybody, but you have now become somewhat sobered down. It is a pity that some do get sobered down, for they are not where they were in the early days. We have to look to God for wisdom that we do not interfere or dampen the Spirit or quench the power of God when He is manifested in our meetings. If you want to have an assembly full of life you must have an assembly full of manifestation. Nobody will come if there is no manifestation. We need to look to God for special grace that we do not move back to looking at things from a natural viewpoint. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The preacher, after he loses his unction, should inwardly repent and get right with God and get the unction back. We are no good without the unction of the Spirit of God. If you are filled with the grace of God you will not be judging everybody in the assembly, you win rather be trusting everybody, you will not be frightened at what is being done, you will have a heart to believe an things, and to believe that though there may be some extravagances, the Spirit of God will take control of things and will see that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is exalted, glorified, and revealed to hungry hearts that desire to know Him. The Lord would have us <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2016:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evll,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> free from distrust, entering into a divine likeness to Jesus, that dares believe that God Almighty will surely watch over all. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Ghost is the One who magnifies the Lord Jesus Christ, the One who gives illumination of Him. If you are filled with the Holy Ghost, it is impossible to keep your tongue still. Talk about a dumb baptized soul! It is not to be found in the Scriptures or outside of the Scriptures. We are filled with the Spirit in order that we may magnify the Lord, and there should be no meeting in which the saints do not glorify, magnify, praise, and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%204:23-24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">worship the Lord in Spirit and in truth.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I would like to give one word of caution, for fallure often comes through our not recognizing the fact that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2013:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">we are always in the body.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We will need our bodies as long as we live. But our body is to he used and controlled by the Spirit of God. We are to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2012:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">present our bodies, holy and acceptable unto God, which is our reasonable service.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Every member of our body must be so sanctified that it works in harmony with the Spirit of God. Our very eyes must be sanctified. God hates the winking of the eye. From the day that I read in the Proverbs <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('prov%206:13,%2010:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">what God had to say about the winking of the eye (Proverbs 6.13 and 10.10)</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I have never winked. I desire that my eyes may be so sanctified that they can always be used for the Lord. The Spirit of God will bring within us a compassion for souls that will be seen in our very eyes. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has never changed the order of things that, first, there comes the natural, and then the spiritual. For instance, when it is on your heart to pray, you begin in the natural and your second word will probably be under the power of the Spirit. You begin and God will end. It is the same in giving forth utterances under the Spirit&rsquo;s power. You feel the moving of the Spirit within and you begin to speak and the Spirit of God will give forth utterance. Thousands have missed wonderful blessings because they have not had faith to move out and begin in the natural, in faith that the Lord would take them into the realm of the supernatural. When you receive the Holy Ghost you receive God&rsquo;s gift, in whom are all the gifts of the Spirit. Paul counsels Timothy to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2tim%201:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">stir up the gift that was within.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You have power to stir up God&rsquo;s executive within you. The way you stir up the gift within you is by beginning in faith, and then He gives forth what is needed for the occasion. You would never begin unless you were full of God. When we yield to timidity and fear we simply yield to Satan. Satan whispers, &ldquo;It is all self.&rdquo; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%208:44')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He is a liar.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I have learned this: If the Spirit of God is stirring me up, I have no hesitation in beginning to speak in tongues, and the Spirit of God gives me utterance and gives me the interpretation. I find that every time I yield to the Lord on this line I get a divine touch, I get a leading thought from the Spirit of God, and the meeting is moved up on the line of faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You attend a meeting in faith, believing that the Lord is going to meet you there. But perhaps the evangelist is not in harmony with God. The people in the assembly are not getting what God wants. The Lord knows it. He knows His people are hungry. What happens? He will take perhaps the smallest vessel and put His power upon them. As they yield to the Spirit they break forth in a tongue. Another yields to the Spirit and there comes forth the interpretation. The Lord&rsquo;s church has to be fed, and the Lord will take this means of speaking to His people. Pentecostal people cannot be satisfied with the natural message. They are in touch with heavenly things and cannot be satisfied with anything less. They feel when there is something lacking in a meeting, and they look to God and He supplies that which is lacking. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When a man is filled with the Spirit he has no conception of what he has. We are so limited in our conception of what we have received. The only way we can know the power that has been given is through the ministration and manifestation of the Spirit of God. Do you think that Peter and John knew what they had when they went up to the temple to pray? They were limited in thought, and limited in their expression. The nearer we get to God the more conscious we are of the poverty of the human, and we cry with Isaiah, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%206:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I am undone, I am unclean.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But the Lord will bring the precious blood and the flaming coals for cleansing and refining and send us out to labor for Him empowered by His Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has sent forth this outpouring that we may all be brought into a revelation of our sonship&mdash;that we are sons of God, men of power, that we are to be like the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to have the powers of sonship, the power to lay hold of that which is weak and to quicken it. The Baptism of the Spirit is to make us sons of God with power. We will be conscious of our human limits, but we will not limit the Holy One who has come to dwell within. We must believe that since the Holy Ghost has come upon us we are indeed sons of God with power. Never say that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%209:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All things are possible to them that believe.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Launch out into the deep and believe that God has His all for you, and that you <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phil%204:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">can do all things through Him who strengthens you.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Peter and John knew that they had been in the upper room, they had felt the glory, they had been given divine utterances. They had seen conviction on the people. They knew that they had come into a wonderful thing. They knew that what they had would be ever increasing and that it would be ever needful to cry, &ldquo;Enlarge the vessel that the Holy Ghost may have more room within.&rdquo; They knew that all the old things were moved away and they had entered into an increasing and ever increasing knowledge of God, and that it was their Master&rsquo;s wish that they should be filled with the Spirit of God and with power every day and every hour. The secret of power is the unveiling of Christ, the all-powerful One within, the revelation of God who comes to abide within us. As they looked upon <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%203:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the crippled man at the Beautiful Gate</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> they were filled with compassion. They were prompted by the Spirit to stop and speak with him. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%203:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">They said to the lame man, &ldquo;Look on us.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was God&rsquo;s plan that the man should open his eyes with expectation. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%203:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Peter said, &ldquo;Of silver and gold we have none. But we have something and we will give it to you.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We don&rsquo;t know what it is, but we give it to you. It is all in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; And then began the ministry of God. You begin in faith and you see what will happen. It is bidden from us at the beginning, but as we have faith in God He will come forth. The coming forth of the power is not of us but of God. There is no limit to what He will do. It is all in a nutshell as you believe God. And so <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%203:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Peter said, &ldquo;Such as I have I give to thee: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And the man who had been in that way for forty years stood up, and began to leap, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%203:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and entered into the temple walking and leaping and praising God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want you to keep in mind the importance of never expecting the gifts of the Spirit apart from the power of the Spirit. In coveting the best gifts, covet to be so full of God and His glory that the gifts in manifestation will always glorify Him. We do not know all and we cannot know all that can be brought forth in the manifestation of the word of wisdom. One word of wisdom from God, one flashlight on the Word of God, is sufficient to save us from a thousand pitfalls. People have bullt without a word from God, they have bought things without a word from God, and they have been ensnared. They have lacked that word of wisdom which will bring them into God&rsquo;s plan for their lives. I have been in many places where I have needed a word of wisdom from God and this has heen vouchsafed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will give you one instance. There is one thing I am very grateful to the Lord for, and that is that He has given me grace not to have a desire for money. The love of money is a great hindrance to many; and many a man is crippled in his ministry because he lets his heart run after financial matters. I was walking out one day when I met a godly man who lived opposite me and he said, &ldquo;My wife and I have been talking together about selling our house and we feel constrained to sell it to you.&rdquo; As we talked together he persuaded me to buy his place, and before we said good-by I told him that I would take it. We always make big mistakes when we are in a hurry. I told my wife what I had promised, and she said, &ldquo;How will you manage it?&rdquo; I told her that I had managed things so far, but I did not know how I was going to get through this. I somehow knew that I was out of divine order. But when a fellow gets out of divine order it seems that the last person he goes to is God. I was relying on an architect to help me, but that scheme fell through. I turned to my relations and I certainly had a wet shirt as one after another turned me down. I tried my friends and managed no better. My wife said to me, &ldquo;Thou hast never been to God yet.&rdquo; What could I do? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I have a certain place in our house where I go to pray. I have been there very often. As I went I said, &ldquo;Lord, if You will get me out of this scrape, I will never trouble Thee on this line again.&rdquo; As I waited on the Lord He just gave me one word. It seemed a ridiculous thing, but it was the wisest counsel. There is divine wisdom in every word He speaks. I came down to my wife, saying, &ldquo;What do you think? The Lord has told me to go to Brother Webster.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It seems very ridiculous, for he is one of the poorest men I know.&rdquo; He was the poorest man I knew, but he was also the richest man I knew, for he knew God. My wife said, &ldquo;Do what God says, and it will be right.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I went off at once to see him, and he said as he greeted me, &ldquo;Smith, what brings you so early?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;The word of God.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;About three weeks ago I promised to buy a house of a man, and I am short 100 pounds.* I have tried to get this money, but somehow I seem to have missed God.&rdquo; &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you have come to me only now?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Because I went to the Lord about it only last night.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a strange thing; three weeks ago I had 100 pounds. For years I have heen putting money into a co-operative system and three weeks ago I had to go and draw 100 pounds out. I hid it under the mattress. Come with me and you shall have it. Take it. I hope it will bring as great a blessing to you as it has been a trouble to me.&rdquo; I had had a word from God, and all my troubles were cnded. This has been multiplied in a hundred ways since that time. If I had been walking along filled with the Holy Ghost, I would not have bought that house and would not have had all that strain. I believe the Lord wants to loose us from things of earth. But I am ever grateful for that word from God. There have been times in my life when I have been in a great crisis and under a great weight of intercession. I have gone to the meeting without the knowledge of what I would say, but somehow or other God would vouchsafe the coming forth under the power of the Spirit of some word of wisdom, just what some souls in that meeting needed. As we look to God His mind will he made known, and His revelation and His word of wisdom will be forthcoming. </span></p><h6 class="cs39141F69">

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bible Reading <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2019:1-20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 19:1-20.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is a wonderful reading; it has many things in it which indicate to us that there was something more marvelous about it than human power, and when I think about Pentecost I am astonished from day to day because of its mightiness, of its wonderfulness and how the glory overshadows it. I think sometimes about these things and they make me feel we have only just touched it. Truly it is so, but we must thank God that we have touched it. We must not give in because we have only touched. Whatever God has done in the past, His name is still the same. When hearts are burdened and they come face to face with the need of the day, they look into God&rsquo;s Word and it brings in a propeller of power or an anointing that makes you know He has truly visited. It was a wonderful day when Jesus left the glory. I can imagine all the angels and God the Father and all heaven so wonderfully stirred that day when the angels were sent to tell that wonderful story: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%202:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Peace on earth and good will to men.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was a glorious day when they beheld the Babe for the first time and God was looking on. What happened after that day and until He was 30 years old I suppose it would take a big book to put it all in. It was a working up to a great climax. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I know that Pentecost in my life is a working up to a climax; it is not all done in a day. There are many waters and all kinds of times until we get to the real summit of everything. The power of God is here to prevail. God is with us. The mother of Jesus <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%202:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">hid a lot of things in her heart.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The time came when it was made manifest at Jordan that Jesus was the Son of God. Oh, how beautifully it was made known! It had to be made known first to one that was full of the vision of God. The vision comes to those who are full. Did it ever strike you we cannot be too full for a vision, we cannot have too much of God? The more of God, then the visions begin. When God has you in His own plan, what a change, how things operate. You wonder, you see things in a new light. And how God is being glorified as you yield from day to day, and the Spirit seems to lay hold of you and bring you on. Yes, it is pressing on, and then He gives us touches of His wonderful power, manifestations of the glory of these things and indications of greater things to follow, and these days which we are living in now speak of better days. How wonderful! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Where should we have been today if we had stopped short, if we had not fulfilled the vision which God gave us? I am thinking about that time when Christ sent the Spirit; and Paul did not know much about that; his heart was stirred, his eyes were dim, he was going to put the whole thing to an end in a short time, and Jesus was looking on. We can scarcely understand the whole process only as God seems to show us, when He gets us into His plan and works with us little by little. We are all amazed that we are amongst the &ldquo;tongues people;&rdquo; it is altogether out of order according to the natural. Some of us would have never been in this Pentecostal movement had we not been drawn, but God has a wonderful way of drawing us. Paul never intended to be among the disciples, Paul never intended to have anything to do with this Man called Jesus, but God was working, God has been working with us and has brought us to this place. It is marvelous! Oh! the vision of God, the wonderful manifestation which God has for Israel. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I have one purpose in my heart, and it is surely God&rsquo;s plan for me, that I want you to see that Jesus Christ is the greatest manifestation in all the world, and His power is unequaled, but there is only one way to minister it. I want you to notice that these people, after they had seen Paul working wonders by this power, began on a natural line. I see it is necessary for me if I want to do anything for God, I must get the knowledge of God, I must get the vision of God, I cannot work on my own. It must be a divine revelation of the Son of God. It must be that. I can see as clearly as anything that Paul in his mad pursuit had to be stopped in the way, and after he was stopped in the way and had the vision from heaven and that light from heaven, instantly he realized that he had been working the wrong way. And as soon as ever the power of the Ho]y Ghost fell upon him, he began in the way in which God wanted him to go. And it was wonderful how he had to suffer to come into the way, It is broken spirits, it is tried lives and it is being driven into a corner as if some strange thing had happened; that is surely the way to get to know the way of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul had not any power to use the name of Jesus as he did use it; only as he had to go through the privations and the difficulties, and even when all things seemed as though shipwrecked, God stood by him and made him know that there was something behind all the time that was with him, and able to carry him through, and bring out that for which his heart was all the time longing. Unconsciously he seemed to be so filled with the Holy Ghost that all that was needed was just the bringing of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2019:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the aprons and the handkerchiefs</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and sending them forth. I can imagine these people looking on and seeing him and saying, &ldquo;But it is all in the name, don&rsquo;t you notice that when he sends the handkerchiefs and the aprons he says, &lsquo;In the name of the Lord Jesus I command that evil to come out.&rsquo;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These people had been looking round and watching, and they thought, &ldquo;It is only the name, that is all that is needed,&rdquo; and so these men said, &ldquo;We will do the same.&rdquo; These vagabond Jews, those seven sons of Sceva, were determined to make this thing answer, and they came to the place where that man had been for years possessed with an evil power, and as they entered in they said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2019:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;We adjure thee in the name of Jesus to come out.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The demons said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2019:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Jesus we know, and Paul we know, but who are ye?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and this evil power leaped upon them and tore their things off their backs, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2019:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and they went out naked and wounded.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was the name, only they did not understand it. Oh, that God should help us to understand the name! It is the name, oh! it is still the name, but you must understand there is the ministry of the name, there is something in the name that makes the whole world charmed. It is the Holy Spirit back of the ministry, it is the knowledge of Him, it is the ministry of the knowledge of Him, and I can understand it is only that. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to speak about the ministry of the knowledge; it is important. God help us to see. I am satisfied with two things; one is this, I am satisfied it is the knowledge of the Blood of Jesus Christ today, and the knowledge of His perfect holiness. I am perfectly cleansed from an sin and made holy in the knowledge of His holiness. I am satisfied today that as I know Him, and the knowledge of His power, and the Christ that is manifested, and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the power that worketh in me</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> to minister as I am ministering only in the knowledge of it, it is effective, so that it brings out the very thing which the word of God says it will do, in the ministry of which, as I know it, it has power over an evil powers by its effectual working in that way. I minister today in the power of the knowledge of the ministry of it, and beyond that there is a certain sense that I overcome the world according to my faith in Him, and I am <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:37')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">more than conqueror</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> over everything just in the knowledge that I have of Him being over everything, as crowned by the Father <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%202:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to bring everything into subjection.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Shouting won&rsquo;t do it, but there is a lubrication about it which is gloriously felt within and brings it into perfect harmony with the will of God, but it is not in the shout, and yet we cannot help but shout, but it is in the ministry of the knowledge that He is Lord over all demons, all powers of wickedness. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
					<span class="csC18E74A5">[At this point in the service someone (possibly Wigglesworth) spoke in prophetic tongues. The interpretation was: &quot;The Holy One which anointed Jesus is so abiding by the Spirit in the one that is clothed upon to use the Name till the glory is manifested and the demons flee, they cannot stand the glory of the manifestation of the Spirit which is manifest.&quot;]</span></h5>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So I am realizing that Paul went about clothed in the Spirit, This was wonderful. His body was full of virtue? No!! He sent forth handkerchiefs from his body and aprons from his body, and when they touched the needy they were healed and demons were cast out. Virtue in his body? No! Virtue in Jesus, by the ministry of faith in the name of Jesus through the power of the unction of the Holy Ghost in Paul. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
					<span class="csC18E74A5">[Another message in tongues: &quot;The liberty of the Spirit bringeth the office.&quot;]</span></h5>
				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is an office, it is a position, it is a place of rest, of faith. Sometimes the demon powers are dealt with very differently, not all the same way: but the ministry of the Spirit by which it is ministered by the power of the word &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; never fails to accomplish the purpose for which the one in charge has wisdom or discernment to see, because along with the Spirit of ministry there comes the revelation of the need of the needy one that is bound. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So differently the Spirit ministers the name of Jesus. I see it continually happening. I see those things answer and all the time the Lord is building up a structure of His own power by a living faith in the knowledge of the sovereignty of the name of Jesus. If I turn to John&rsquo;s Gospel I get the whole thing practically in a nutshell. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2017:3)"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">To know Thee, O God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent, is eternal life.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We must have the knowledge and power of God and the knowledge of Jesus Christ, the embodiment of God, to be clothed upon with God, God in human flesh. I see there are those who have come into line, they are possessed with the blessed Christ, and the power of the Baptism which is the revelation of the Christ of God within, and it is so evidently in the person who is baptized and the Christ is so plainly abiding that the moment he is confronted with evil, instantly he is sensitive of the position of this confronting, and he is able to deal accordingly. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The difference between the sons of Sceva and Paul is this: They said &ldquo;It is only using the word.&rdquo; How many people only use the word, how many times people are defeated because they think it is just the word, how many people have been brokenhearted because it did not answer when they used the word? If I read into my text this afternoon this: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2016:17-18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;He that believeth shan speak in tongues, he that believeth shall cast out devils, he that believeth shall lay hands on the sick,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> if I read this into my text, on the surface of it it seems exactly easy, but you must understand this, there are volumes to be applied to the word believe. To believe is to believe in the need of the majesty of the glory of the power, which is all power, which brings all other powers into subjection. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And what is belief? Sum it up in a few sentences. To believe is to have the knowledge of Him in whom you believe; it is not to believe in the word Jesus, but to believe in the nature, to believe in the vision, for <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('matt%2028:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">all power is given unto Him,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">greater is He that is within thee in the revelation of faith than he that is in the world,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and so I say to you, do not be discouraged if every demon has not gone out. The very moment you have gone, do not think there is an end of it. What we have to do is to see this, that if it had only been using the name those evil powers would have gone out in that name by the sons of Sceva. It is not that. It is the virtue of the power of the Holy Ghost, with the revelation of the Deity of our Christ of glory, where all power is given unto Him, and in the knowledge of Christ, in the faith of what He is, demons must surrender, demons must go out, and I say it reverently, these bodies of ours are so constructed by God that we may be filled with that divine revelation of the Son of God till it is manifest to the devils you go to and they have to go. The Master is in, they see the Master. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2019:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Jesus I know, and Paul I know.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The ministry of the Master! How we need to get to know Him till within us we are fun of the manifestation of the King over all demons. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Brothers and sisters, my heart is full. The depths of my yearnings are for the Pentecostal people. My cry is that we will not miss the opportunity of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, that Christ may be manifested in the human till every power of evil will be subject to the Christ which is manifested in you, The devils know. Two important things are before me: To master the situation of myself. You are not going to meet devils if you cannot master yourself, because you soon find the devil bigger than yourself, and it is only when you are subdued that Christ is enthroned and the embodiment of the Spirit is so gloriously covering the human life that Jesus is glorified to the full. So first it is the losing of ourself and then it is the incoming of Another; it is the glorifying of Him which is to fulfill all things and when He gets lives He can do it. When He gets lives that will so yield themselves to God, God will be delighted to allow the Christ to be so manifested in you, that it will be no difficulty for the devil to know who you are. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I am satisfied that Pentecost is to reestablish God in human flesh. Do I need to say it again? The power of the Holy Ghost has to come to be enthroned in the human life so it does not matter what state we are in. Christ is manifested in the place where devils are, the place where religious devils are, the place where a false religion and unbelief is, the place where a formal religion has taken the place of holiness and righteousness. You have need to have holiness, the righteousness and Spirit of the Master, so that in every walk of life everything that is not like our Lord Jesus will have to depart and that is what is needed today. I ask you in the Holy Ghost to seek the place where He is in power. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2019:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Jesus I know, Paul I know but who are ye?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> May God stamp it upon us for the devil is not afraid of you. May the Holy Ghost make us today terrors of evil doers, for the Holy Ghost came into us to judge the world of sin, of unbelief, of righteousness, and that is the purpose of the Holy Ghost. The devils will know us, and Jesus will know us. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our lesson is in the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">first Epistle of Peter, chapter 1.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Whenever, in the history of the world, there has been a divine revelation, God coming forth in some manifestation of His Spirit, there have been antagonism and opposition to the same with persecution of those who received such manifestations or revelations. In the old dispensation, as well as in the new, when the Spirit of God has been moving mightily, there has been trouble and difficulty. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Why is this? It is because there are some things very much against revelation of God and the operation of the Spirit of God. First, there is the flesh, the natural man, because, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The carnal mind is enmity against God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The very fact that men throughout the world, as a rule, are opposed to the working of God, is evidence of the truth of this statement of Scripture. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Out of this enmity of the mind of the natural man against God grows the opposition of the world, which is the mass of these antagonistic individuals. Our Lord Jesus Christ has made it unmistakably plain to all His followers for all time that the world is contrary to Him and to His kingdom. He said concerning His disciples, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2017:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I have given them thy word; and </span><span class="cs5EE81C7D">THE WORLD HATH HATED THEM</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The devil and all his evil hosts are also arrayed against all manifestations of God. The devil is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2012:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;the prince of this world;&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and he is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%202:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> All these are opposed to God and His working; but they can never defeat the purposes of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So far as the human eye can see, God&#39;s cause is often in the minority; but viewed by those who have spiritual eyesight. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kings%206:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;They that be with us are more than they that be with them.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> So, as Elisha said to his servant, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kings%206:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Fear not.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Wickedness may increase and abound; but when the Lord raises His banner over the saint, it is victory, though the saint may seem to be in the minority. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So we read in the first verse that these saints were <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;scattered abroad,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> meaning that they did not have much liberty to meet together, but were driven from place to place. In the days of John Knox of Scotland the people who served God had to be in very close quarters, because the Roman church set out to destroy them. They were in the minority from the human viewpoint, but they swept through to victory, and the Roman power was defeated in Scotland. Cry to God that it may not rise again, for it has always meant bloodshed to the saints of God and opposition to the working of the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Ghost wants us to understand our privileges&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This work of the sanctification of the Spirit does not refer to cleansing from sin. It refers to a higher order of redemptive work. The blood of Jesus is all-powerful for cleansing; but when sin is gone, when we are clean and when we know we have the Word of God in us, and when the power of the Spirit is bringing everything to a place where we triumph over all evil, then comes a revelation through the Spirit which lifts you on to higher ground and unveils the fulness of the life of Christ within us in such a way that we are led on till we are <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;</span><span class="cs5EE81C7D">FILLED</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> unto all the </span><span class="cs5EE81C7D">FULNESS</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> of God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is the sanctification of the Spirit. It is the great work for which the Spirit is given. This is the purpose for which God has called you; but whether you haye accepted your election, whether you proved yourself worthy of your election, whether you have allowed this Spirit to thus sanctify you, I do not know; but if you yield yourself to God and let His Holy Spirit have His way in your spirit to lead you into the will of God, as it is revealed in the Word of God, He will not fail to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This word &ldquo;elect&rdquo; is a very precious word to me. It shows me that, before the world was, God planned to bring us into such glorious triumph and victory in Christ that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;unto him (shall) be the glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Feed upon these words. Let them sink into your heart&mdash;God has purposed to do for those in the church something which will redound to the glory of His Name unto the endless ages. This is the most solid ground for faith&mdash;that salvation is to be <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%201:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;to the praise of the glory of His grace.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God has predetermined, has planned, has made full provision to accomplish this wondrous work in all who will not <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%202:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;frustrate the grace of God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some people pervert this blessed truth; they say, &ldquo;Oh, well, you see, we are elected; we are all right.&rdquo; I know manv who believe in that kind of election. They say they are elected to be saved; and they believe others are elected to be damned. It is not true. Everybody is elected to be saved; whether they come into it or not is another thing. This perverted view of this precious truth makes souls indifferent to its great purpose, the &ldquo;sanctification of the Spirit.&rdquo; This is one of the ways in which Satan opposes the work of God in the world&mdash;by perverting it, making it to appear to mean something that it does not mean; so that souls are kept from pressing on into the glorious purpose of God for which salvation was planned. That would be a poor salvation which did not deliver man from the thing which causes all the sorrow and trouble in this world&mdash;</span><span class="cs53F207AF">SIN</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Notice again, this sanctification of the Spirit is &ldquo;unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; There is no sanctification if it is not sanctification unto obedience. There would be no trouble with any of us if we would all come definitely to the the place where we understand and accept that Word of our Lord Jesus whcn He said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2017.19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2017:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When you come into the election of the sanctification of the Spirit, you will be obedient to everything revealed in that Word; and in the measure that you are not obedIent you have not come into the sanctification of the Spirit. A little thing spoils many good things. People say, &ldquo;Mrs. So-and-So is very good, but&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, you know that young man is progressing tremendously, but&mdash;&rdquo; There are no &ldquo;buts&rdquo; in the sanctification of the Spirit. &ldquo;But&rdquo; and &ldquo;if&rdquo; are gone, and it is &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will&rdquo; all the way through. Beloved, if there are any &ldquo;buts&rdquo; in your attitude toward the Word of Truth, it indicates that there is something unyielded to the Spirit. I do pray God that we may be willing to yield ourselves to the sanctification of the Spirit, that we may enter into the mind of God regarding this election, in actual possession of it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Perhaps to encourage you, it wiil be helpful to show you what election is; because there is no difficulty in proving whether you are elected or not. Why are you interested in this book? Is it because you have a desire for more of God? If so, it is God who has given you that desire; and God is drawing you unto Himself. If you have truly received Jesus as your Lord and Savior, it has been because the Father drew you to Him; for He said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%206:44')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And we may be sure that God will not go back on what He has begun to do; for our Lord Jesus added to the above, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%206:44')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And I will raise him up at the last day.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Also the apostle Paul says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phi%201:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">in Philippians 1:6, &ldquo;Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I think of my own case, I recall that in my childhood I was strangely moved upon by the Spirit. At the age of eight years I was definitely saved; and at nine, I felt the Spirit come upon me just as when I spoke in tongues. You may say, &ldquo;When I was in sin, I was troubled.&rdquo; Thank God for it; for it was His Spirit that troubled you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is a most blessed thought that we have a God of love, of compassion, and of grace, who <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2033:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">willeth not the death of one sinner.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God has made it possible for all men to be saved, by causing Jesus, His well beloved Son, to die <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%202:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">for the sins of the whole world.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is true that He took our sins; it is true that He paid the price for the whole world; it is true that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2010:45')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He gave Himself a ransom for many;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> it is true, beloved, it is true. And you say, &ldquo;For whom?&rdquo; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rev%2022:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What about the others? It would have to be a refusal of the Blood of Jesus; it would have to be a refusal to have Christ reign over them; that&rsquo;s it. It is &ldquo;Whosoever will,&rdquo; on the one side, and &ldquo;Whosoever won&rsquo;t&rdquo; on the other side; and there are people in the world who &ldquo;won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; What is up with them? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believed not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Through sanctification of the Spirit, according to this election, you will get to a place where you are not disturbed. There is a peace in the sanctification of the Spirit, because it is a place of revelation&mdash;of heavenly places into which you are brought. It is a place where God comes and makes Himself known unto you; and when You are face to face with God you get a <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phil%204:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">peace that passeth all understanding,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and which lifts you from state to state of inexpressible wonderment. Oh, it is wonderful! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This sanctification of the Spirit brings us into definite line with this wonderful &ldquo;lively hope&rdquo; of the glory of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A lively hope is exactly the opposite of something dead. A lively hope means movement. A lively hope means looking into what we hope for. A lively hope means pressing into that which is promised. A lively hope means leaving behind you other things. A lively hope means keeping the vision. A lively hope sees Jesus coming. And you live in this lively hope. You are not trying to make yourself feel that you are believing. But this lively hope keeps you waiting, and ready, and filled with the joy of expectation of the coming of the King. Praise the Lord! If the thought of the coming of the King is not such a lively hope to you, you need to search whether you have ever truly enthroned Him as King over your own life. God has this in mind for you. There is real joy in expectation of His coming; and there will be infinitely greater joy in the realization. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I trust that you will be so reconciled to God that not one thing will interfere with your having this lively hope. If you have any love for the world, this hope cannot be a lively hope to you; for His coming will mean the overthrow of the world. If there is in you <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%202:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the pride of life,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> this hope cannot be to you a lively hope; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%202:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">for every high thing will be brought low in that day.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Salvation is very much misunderstood. That which comes to you in a moment of time, through believing, is only the beginning, Salvation is so wonderful, so mighty, so tremendous, that it goes on and on from one degree to another until there shall be nothing in us from which we need to be delivered, either in spirit, or soul, or mind, or body, Everything is ready so far as God is concerned, and is waiting for man to get ready to receive it. Sin began in the spirit of man, and salvation must be wrought out there before there can be deliverance from the consequences of sin. In the meantime, if we rest our faith in the power of God, we will be <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You have no idea what God wants to do for you through trials and temptations. They do two things for us: Where there is anything wrong in us which we are not recognizing, they bring it to the surface, that we may see our need of God&rsquo;s salvation in this respect. But why are the most faithful also of God&rsquo;s children tried and tempted? It is that their very faithfulness and loyalty and the purity of their faith may be </span><span class="cs53F207AF">MADE MANIFEST</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Gold has to he tried with fire, and it is made more precious thereby. Your faith, Peter says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;is </span><span class="cs5EE81C7D">MUCH MORE PRECIOUS</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> than gold that perisheth.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day I went to a certain place and a gentleman there said to me, &ldquo;Would you like to see the purification of gold?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; So he got some gold and put it into a crucible, and put a blast of heat under it. First it became blood red, and then changed and changed. Then this man took an instrument and passed it over the gold. It drew off something, which was foreign to the gold. He did this several times, until every bit of that foreign substance was taken away. Then he said to me, &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; And there we both saw our faces in the gold! It was wonderful! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My brother, the trial of your faith is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">much more precious than of gold that perisheth.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As you are tested in the fire, the Master is bringing the dross to the surface, that He may take it away, all that hinders His image being seen in you&mdash;taking away all the dross from your life, all that is not enduring, all that is not precious in His sight. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is lovely to know that, in times of misunderstanding, times when you are in the right and yet are treated as though you were in the wrong, God is meeting you, blessing you, accomplishing something which will not only glorify His name, but be to your <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> So do not chafe or fret; let the fire burn; it will do you good. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Whom having not seen, ye love.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Oh, how sweet! There is no voice so gentle, so soft, so full of tenderness to me, as His; and no touch. Is it possible to love Him when we have not seen Him? God will make it possible; and, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;though now ye see him not, yet believing,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He will enable you to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%201:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Rejoice! We have something to rejoice over. Oh, what a salvation God has provided for us in all our worthlessness and nothingness and helplessness! I entreat you from the Lord to be so reconciled to Him that there will be no division between you and Him. Will you give Him preeminence in all things? Shall He not have His rightful place, and decide for you the way and plan of your life? Beloved, when you allow Him to decide for you, when you want nothing but His blessed will, when He is in very deed Lord and Sovereign of all, you will have a foretaste of heaven all the time. The Lord bless you with grace to leave all and say, &ldquo;I will follow Thee, Lord Jesus.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is a settled thing in the glory that in the fulness of time the latter rain has to be greater than the former. Some of our hearts have been greatly moved by the former rain, but it is the latter rain we are crying out for. What will it be when the fulness comes and the heart of God is satisfied? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 2:4: &ldquo;And they began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What a lovely thought that the Holy Ghost had such partiality that the word was all His! We are having to learn, whether we like it or not, that our end is God&rsquo;s beginning. Then it is all God, and the Lord Jesus stands forth in the midst with such Divine glory and men are impelled, filled, led so perfectly. Nothing else will meet the need of the world. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is something beautiful about Peter and John when we read that people <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%204:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There was something so real, so after the order of the Master. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%204:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 4:13: &ldquo;Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled, and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> May all in the temple glorify Jesus; it can be so. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The one thing marked more than anything else in the life of Jesus was the fact that the people glorified God in Him, and when God is glorified and gets the right of way and thought of His people everyone is as He is, filled with God. Whatever it costs it must be. Let it be so. Filled with God! The only thing to help people is to tell out the latest thing God has given us from the glory. There is nothing outside salvation. We are filled, immersed, clothed upon; there must be nothing felt, seen, spoken about, but the mighty power of the Holy Ghost. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%205:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">We are new creatures in Christ Jesus,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> baptized into a new nature.

Praise God, the thirst is of God, the desire is of God, the plan is of God, the purpose is of God. God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s thought, God&rsquo;s vessel and God&rsquo;s servant. In the world to meet the need; but not of the world or of its spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God incarnate in humanity.

It is God&rsquo;s mind to fill us with that wine, to make us ready to burst forth with new rivers, fresh energy, no tired feeling. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God manifest in the flesh&mdash;that is what we want, and it is what God wants, and it satisfies everybody.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our ten days&rsquo; Convention is beyond describing by words. The presence of God was upon us all the time. Letters have already come to say it was a thousand times in advance of last year. The deep revelations by the inspired speakers dove-tailed from day to day, and made hearts to burn with the sense of a need. A prayer came forth from all to God for our poor, broken world, in its present chaos of war, and a cry was raised for deliverance for our land. The missionary zeal was also intensified by returned and going-out missionaries. The voluntary offering on the Bible, amounting to over &pound;200, denotes the hopefulness of the future. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One could not pick out special speakers in this Convention. From the first to the last of the ten days, the speakers and listeners were broken before God. The singing in the Spirit at most of the meetings was beyond human expression, as the glory of God covered us as a mantle from time to time with power to sing through falling tears of joy, expressing through the heart that God had got a people in his control. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God cared for us in this Convention and provided butter, cheese, sugar, and tea for upwards of 2,000 meals, and many other good things; there was no lack. The last day of the Feast was better than the first. People were baptized in the Spirit every day, and twenty-seven people passed through the waters of baptism. There were also many notable cases of healing. Two people were healed and saved, and one healed and baptized in the Spirit at the same time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">All the speakers announced came, and we are thankful that God has such treasured vessels in His great work. We labored for weeks in prayer, cleaning and painting inside and out of the Mission, but felt it would all be of no use if God did not fill it with His glory as the temple of Jerusalem. Truly, He made our hearts glad as again and again the glory fell upon us. We now see the Pentecostal future of unlimited success, when the war ceases and railway fares and food are as before. One could say that a month&rsquo;s Convention is as little as one dare venture to have, after our present experience in these hard times, clearly proving to us that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%202')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 2</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> is going on to be fulfilled in a fuller measure. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I now close by saying what a joy it would have been if all the Pentecostal people could have shared with us in this great feast. </span></p><p class="cs662E67A8"><span class="cs78AB3212">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">The Convention opened on Thursday evening by the convener, Mr. S.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:1-2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is necessary that we have a great desire for spiritual gifts. We must thirst after them and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">covet them earnestly</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> because the gifts are necessary and important, that we, by the grace of God having received the gifts, may be used for God&rsquo;s glory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has ordained this speaking in an unknown tongue unto Himself as a wonderful, supernatural means of communication in the Spirit. As we speak to Him in the unknown tongue we speak wonderful mysteries in the Spirit. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In Romans 8:27 we read, &ldquo;He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Many times as we speak unto God in an unknown tongue we are in intercession and as we pray thus in the Spirit we pray according to the will of God. And there is such a thing as <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the Spirit making intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">On this line I want to tell you about Willie Burton, who is laboring for God in the Belgium Congo. Brother Burton is a mighty man of God and is giving his life for the heathen in Africa. He took fever and went down to death. They said, &ldquo;He has preached his last; what shall we do?&rdquo; All their hopes seemed to be blighted, and there they stood, with broken hearts, wondering what was going to take place. They left him for dead; but, in a moment, without any signal, he stood right in the midst of them; and they could not understand it. The explanation he gave was this, that, when he came to himself, he realized a warmth going right through his body; and there wasn&rsquo;t one thing wrong with him. How did it come about? It was a mystery until he went to London and was telling the people how he was left for dead, and then was raised up. A lady came up and asked for a private conversation with him, and arranged a time. She asked, &ldquo;Do you keep a diary?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She told him, &ldquo;It happened on a certain day that I went to pray; and as soon as I knelt, I had you on my mind. The Spirit of the Lord took hold of me and prayed through me in an unknown tongue. A vision came before me in which I saw you laid out helpless; and I cried out in the unknown tongue till I saw you rise up and go out of that room.&rdquo; She had kept a note of the time and when he turned to his diary he found that it was exactly the time when he was raised up. There are great possibilities as we yield to the Spirit and speak unto God in quiet hours in our bedrooms. God wants you to be filled with the Holy Ghost so that everything about you shall be charged with the dynamite of heaven. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want you to see that he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself, or builds himself up. We must be edified before we can edify the church. I cannot estimate what I, personally, owe to the Holy Ghost method of spiritual edification. I am here before you as one of the biggest conundrums in the world. There never was a weaker man on the platform. Language? None. Inability&mdash;full of it. All natural things in my life point exactly opposite to my being able to stand on the platform and preach the gospel. The secret is that the Holy Ghost came and brought this wonderful edification of the Spirit. I had been reading this Word continually as well as I could, but the Holy Ghost came and took hold of it, for the Holy Ghost is the breath of it, and He illuminated it to me. And He gives me language that I cannot speak fast enough; it comes too fast; and it is there because God has given it. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('joh%2014:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">When the Comforter is come He shall teach you </span><span class="cs5EE81C7D">ALL</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> things;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and He has given me this supernatural means of speaking in an unknown tongue to edify myself, so that, after being edified, I can edify the church. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%202:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In 1 John 2:20 we read, &ldquo;But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%202:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In verse 27 we read, &ldquo;But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man should teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; Even when you are baptized in the Spirit you may say, &ldquo;I seem so dry, I don&rsquo;t know where I am.&rdquo; The Word says you have an unction. Thank God you have received an anointing. The Holy Ghost here says that He is abiding and that He teaches you of all things. These are great and definite positions for you. The Holy Ghost would have you stir up your faith to believe that this word is true that you have the unction and that the anointing abideth. As you rise up in the morning believe this wonderful truth, and as you yield to the Spirit&rsquo;s presence and power you will find yourself speaking unto God in the Spirit and you will find that you are personally being edified by doing this. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%203:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Let everything about you be a lie, but let this word of God be true.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The devil will say you are the driest person and that you will never do anything, but you believe God&rsquo;s word, that the anointing which ye have received of Him abideth in you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edification.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You must understand that God would always have you to be in the place of prophecy, for everyone who has received the Holy Ghost has a right to prophesy. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In verse 31 we read, &ldquo;Ye may all prophesy one by one.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Now prophecy is far in advance of speaking in tongues, except that you have the interpretation of the speaking in tongues, and then God gets an equivalent to prophecy. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In verse 13 we read, &ldquo;Let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is an important word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After receiving the Baptism in the Holy Ghost and speaking in tongues as the Spirit gave utterance, I did not speak with tongues again for nine months. I was troubled about it because I went up and down laying hands upon people that they might receive the Holy Ghost, and they were speaking in tongues, but I did not have the joy of speaking myself. God wanted to show me that the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">speaking in tongues as the Spirit gave utterance,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> which I received when I received the Baptism, was distinct from the gift of tongues which I subsequently received. When I laid hands on other people and they received the Holy Ghost, I used to think, &ldquo;Oh, Lord Jesus, it would be nice if You would let me speak.&rdquo; He withheld the gift from me, for He knew that I would meet many who would say that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost can be received without the speaking in tongues, and that people simply received the gift of tongues when they received the Baptism. I did not receive the gift of tongues at that time, but nine months later I was going out of the door one morning, speaking to the Lord in my own heart, when there came a volume of tongues. When the tongues stopped I said to the Lord, &ldquo;Now, Lord, I did not do it, and I wasn&rsquo;t seeking it; so You have done it, and I am not going to move from this place until you give me interpretation.&rdquo; And then came an interpretation which has been fulfilled all the world over. Is it the Holy Ghost who speaks? Then the Holy Ghost can interpret. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Let him that speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and God will give it. We must not rush through without getting a clear understanding of what God has to say to us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you pray in an unknown tongue in the Spirit you do not know what you are praying; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">you have no understanding of it. It is unfruitful to those round about you;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but you have the same power to pray with the understanding under the unction of the Spirit as you have to pray in an unknown tongue. Some say, &ldquo;Oh, I could do that, but it would be myself doing it.&rdquo; If </span><span class="cs53F207AF">YOU</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> pray, it is yourself, and everything you do in the beginning is yourself. I kneel down to pray and the first and second sentences may be in the natural; but as soon as I have finished, the Spirit begins to pray through me. The first may be yourself. Granted. The next will be the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost will take you through, praise the Lord. Everything but faith will say, &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo; Faith says, &ldquo;It is right.&rdquo; The natural man says, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo; Faith says, &ldquo;It is right.&rdquo; Paul says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also;&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and he does it in faith. The devil is against it and your own self-life is against it. May God the Holy Ghost bring us into that blessed place where we may live, walk, pray and sing in the Spirit, and pray and sing with the understanding also. Faith will do it. Faith has a deaf ear to the devil and to the working of the natural mind, and a big ear to God. Faith has a deaf ear to yourself and an open ear to God. Faith won&rsquo;t take any notice of feelings. Faith says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('col%202:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;You are complete in Him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is a wonderful thing to pray in the Spirit and to sing in the Spirit, praying in tongues and singing in tongues as the Spirit of God gives you utterance. I never get out of bed in the morning without haying communion with God in the Spirit. It is the most wonderful thing on earth. It is most lovely to be in the Spirit when you are dressing and you come out to the world and the world has no effect on you. You begin the day like that and you will be conscious of the guidance of the Spirit right through the day. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:18-19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Many people will come round and say that Paul said he would rather speak five words with the known tongue than ten thousand words without understanding. They will always leave out that part of the sentence, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Paul was here correcting the excessive speaking in tongues without interpretation, which was not for the edification of the assembly. If there was no interpreter present, they were simply to speak to themselves and to God. Suppose we had someone preaching and we had twenty or thirty people all up and down in tongues, it would be very serious. There would be confusion. The people who attend the meeting would rather have five words to edification, consolation and comfort than ten thousand words without understanding. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Because you feel a touch of the Spirit you are not obliged to speak in tongues. The Lord will give you a sound mind so that you will hold your body in perfect order for the edification of the church. But Paul here says <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">that he spake in tongues more than they all;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and, as it is evident that the Corinthian church was given to this thing very considerably, he certainly must have been speaking tremendously in tongues both day and night. He was so edified by this wonderful, supernatural means of being built up, that he could go to the church, and preaching in a manner so that they could all understand him, he would marvelously edify the saints. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will explain to you the most perfect way to receive the gift. Come with me to the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kin%202')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">second chapter of 2 Kings</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and I will show you a man receiving a gift. Elijah had been mightily used of God in calling down fire and in other miracles; and Elisha is moved with a great spirit of covetousness to have this man&rsquo;s gifts. You can be very covetous for the gifts of the Spirit and God will allow it. When Elijah said to him, &ldquo;I want you to stop at Gilgal,&rdquo; Elisha said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kin%202:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There was no stopping him. When Elijah wanted Elisha to stop at Jericho he said in substance, &ldquo;I am not stopping.&rdquo; The man that stops gets nothing. O, don&rsquo;t stop at Jericho; don&rsquo;t stop at Jordan; don&rsquo;t stop anywhere when God would have you move on into all of His fulness that He has for you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They came to Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and smote the waters. They divided; and Elijah and Elisha went over on dry ground. Elijah turned to Elisha and said in substance, &ldquo;Look here, what do you want?&rdquo; Elisha was wanting what he was going to have, and you may covet all that God says that you shall have. Elisha said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kin%202:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This was the plow-boy, who had washed the hands of his master; but his spirit got so big that he purposed in his heart that, when Elijah stepped off the scene, he would be put into his place. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kin%202:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Elijah said, &ldquo;Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> May God help you never to stop persevering till you get what you want. Let your aspiration be large and your faith rise until you are wholly on fire for God&rsquo;s best. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Onward they go, and as one steps, the other steps with him. He purposed to keep his eye on his master until the last. It took a chariot of fire and horses of fire to part them asunder, and EJijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. I can fancy I hear Elisha crying out, &ldquo;Father Elijah, drop that mantle.&rdquo; And it came down. Oh, I can see it lowering, lowering and lowering. Elisha took all of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces, and then he took up the mantle of Elijah. I do not believe that, when he put on that other mantle, he felt any different in himself; hut when he came to Jordan, he took the mantle of Elijah and smote the waters and said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kin%202:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Where is the Lord God of Elijah?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And the waters parted and he went over on dry ground. And the sons of the prophets said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2kin%202:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The spirit of Elijah doth rest upon Elisha.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is like receiving a gift, you don&rsquo;t know that you have it till you act in faith. Brothers and sisters, as you ask, </span><span class="cs53F207AF">BELIEVE</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. </span></p><p class="cs463A9CC6"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

				<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;To another discerning of spirits.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is a vast difference between natural discernment and spiritual. When it comes to natural discernment you will find many people loaded with it, and they can see so many faults in others. To such the words of Christ in the sixth chapter of Luke surely apply, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%206:41')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother&rsquo;s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you want to manifest natural discernment, focus the same on yourself for at least twelve months and you will see so many faults in yourself that you will never want to fuss about the faults of another. In the sixth of Isaiah we read of the prophet being in the presence of God and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%206:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">he found that even his lips were unclean and everything was unclean.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But praise God, there is the same live coal for us today, the baptism of fire, the perfecting of the heart, the purifying of the mind, the regeneration of the spirit. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%206:6-7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">How important it is that the fire of God shall touch our tongues.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%204:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">1 John 4:1 we are told, &ldquo;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We are further told, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%204:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> From time to time as I have seen a person under a power of evil, or having a fit, I have said to the power of evil, or Satanic force that is within the possessed person, &ldquo;Did Jesus Christ come in the flesh?&rdquo; and straightway they have answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; They either say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; or hold their tongues, refusing altogether to acknowledge that the Lord Jesus Christ came in the flesh. It is then, remembering that further statement of John&rsquo;s, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; that you can in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ deal with the evil powers and command them to come out. We as Pentecostal people must know the tactics of the evil one and must be able to displace and dislodge him from his position. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was preaching in Doncaster, England, at one time on the line of faith and a number of people were delivered. There was a man present who was greatly interested and moved by what he saw. He was suffering himself with a stiff knee and had yards and yards of flannel wound around it. After he got home he said to his wife, &ldquo;I have taken in Wigglesworth&rsquo;s message and now I am going to act on it and get deliverance. Wife, I want you to be the audience.&rdquo; He took hold of his knee and said, &ldquo;Come out, you devil, in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;It is all right, wife.&rdquo; He took the yards and yards of flannel off and found he was all right without the bandage. The next night he went to the little Primitive Methodist Church where he worshiped. There was a lot of young people who were in bad plight there and Jack had a tremendous business delivering his friends through the name of Jesus. He had been given to see that a great many ills to which flesh is heir are nothing else but the operation of the enemy, but his faith had risen and he saw that in the name of Jesus there was a power that was more than a match for the enemy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I arrived one night at Gottenberg in Sweden and was asked to hold a meeting there. In the midst of the meeting a man fell full length in the doorway. The evil spirit threw him down, manifesting itself and disturbing the whole meeting. I rushed to the door and laid hold of this man and cried out to the evil spirit within him, &ldquo;Come out, you devil! In the name of Jesus we cast you out as an evil spirit.&rdquo; I lifted him up and said, &ldquo;Stand on your feet and walk in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know whether anybody in the meeting understood me except the interpreter, but the devils knew what I said. I talked in English but these devils in Sweden cleared out. A similar thing happened in Christiania. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The devil will endeavor to fascinate through the eyes and through the mind. At one time there was brought to me a beautiful young woman who had been fascinated with some preacher, and just because he had not given her satisfaction on the line of courtship and marriage, the devil took advantage and made her fanatical and mad. They brought her 250 miles in that condition. She had previously received the Baptism in the Spirit. You ask, &ldquo;Is there any place for the enemy in one that has been baptized in the Holy Ghost?&rdquo; Our only safety is in going on with God and in constantly being filled with the Holy Ghost. You must not forget Demas. He must have been baptized with the Holy Ghost for he appears to have been a right-hand worker with Paul, but the enemy got him to the place where <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2tim%204:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">he loved this present world and he dropped off.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When they brought this young woman to me the evil power was immediately discerned and immediately I cast the thing out in the name of Jesus. It was a great joy to present her before all the people in her right mind again. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a life of perfect deliverance, and this is where God wants you to be. If I find my peace is disturbed on any line, I know it is the enemy who is trying to work. How do I know this? Because the Lord has promised <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2026:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to keep your mind in perfect peace when it is stayed on Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Paul tells us <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2012:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our reasonable service,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the Holy Spirit breathes through him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2012:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And be not conformed to this world; </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He further tells us <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phi%204:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">in Phil. 4, &ldquo;Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As we think about that which is pure, we become pure. As we think about that which is holy, we become holy. And as we think about our Lord Jesus Christ, we become like Him. We are changed into the likeness of the object on which our gaze is fixed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">To discern spirits we must dwell with Him who is holy, and He will give the revelation and unveil the mask of Satanic power on all lines. In Australia I went to one place where there were disrupted and broken homes. The people were so deluded by the evil power of Satan that men had left their wives, and wives had left their husbands, and had gotten into spiritual affinity with one another. That is the devil! May God deliver us from such evils in these days. There is no one better than the companion God has given you. I have seen so many broken hearts and so many homes that have been wrecked. We need a real revelation of these evil seducing spirits which come in and fascinate by the eye and destroy lives, and bring the work of God into disrepute. But there is always flesh behind it. It is never clean; it is unholy, impure, Satanic, devilish, and hell is behind it. If the enemy comes in to tempt you on any line like this, I beseech you to look instantly to the Lord Jesus. He can deliver you from any such Satanic power. You must be separated on all lines if you are going to have faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Ghost will give us this gift of discerning of spirits if we desire it so that we may perceive by revelation this evil power which comes in to destroy. We can reach out and get this unction of the Spirit that will reveal these things unto us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You will have people come to meetings who are spiritists. You must be able to deal with spiritist conditions. You can so deal with them that they will not have any power in the meetings. If you ever have Theosophists or Christian Scientists, you must be able to discern them and settle them. Never play with them; always clear them out. They are better with their own company always, unless they are willing to be delivered from the delusion they are in. Remember the warning of the Lord Jesus, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('joh%2010:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs13159BA7"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before Satan can bring his evil spirits there has to be an open door. Hear what the Scriptures say: <a class="cs955DD547" href="javascript:vs('1joh%205:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;That wicked one toucheth him not.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> <a class="cs955DD547" href="javascript:vs('psa%20121:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: He shall preserve thy soul.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> How does Satan get an opening? When the saint ceases to seek after holiness, purity, righteousness, truth; when he ceases to pray, stops reading the Word and gives way to carnal appetites. Then it is that Satan comes. So often sickness comes as a result of disobedience. David said, <a class="cs955DD547" href="javascript:vs('psa%20119:67')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Before I was afflicted, I went astray.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Seek the Lord and He will sanctify every thought, every act, till your whole being is ablaze with holy purity and your one desire will be for Him who has created you in holiness. Oh, this holiness! Can we be made pure? We can. Every inbred sin must go. God can cleanse away every evil thought. Can we have a hatred for sin and a love for righteousness? Yes, God will create within thee a pure heart. <a class="cs955DD547" href="javascript:vs('eze%2036:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He will take away the stony heart out of the flesh.</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> <a class="cs955DD547" href="javascript:vs('eze%2036:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He will sprinkle thee with clean water and thou shalt be cleansed from all thy filthiness.</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> When will He do it? When you seek Him for such inward purity</span><span class="cs72B5A8C2"> </span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, March 11, 1944.</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Let us read together the 11th chapter of Hebrews. This is a wonderful passage. In fact, all the Word of God is wonderful. It is not only wonderful, but it has power to change conditions. Any natural condition can be changed by the Word of God, which contains supernatural power. In the Word of God there is the breath and the very nature and power of the living God, and His power works in every person who dares to believe His Word. It is as we lay hold of God&rsquo;s promises in simple faith, that we become partakers of the divine nature. As we receive the Word of God we come in touch with the living force that makes dead things live. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Hebrews 12.2 we read, &ldquo;Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.&rdquo; As we look unto Him we receive life, and faith springs up in our hearts. And as we continue to look unto Him, He will perfect our faith. He Himself will become the very power of our lives. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We see that when the disciples were let out of prison, the angel of the Lord said to them, &ldquo;Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">words of this life.</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; The message of the gospel, that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried, and that He rose again, is the word of life. There is only one Book that has life. In his Word we find Him who came that we might have life, and have it more abundantly. By faith this life is imparted to us. Drink, my beloved, drink deeply of this Source of life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Faith is the substance of things hoped for.&rdquo; Someone said to me one day, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t believe in anything I couldn&rsquo;t handle and see.&rdquo; Everything you can handle and see is temporal and will perish with the using; but the things not seen are eternal and will not fade away. Are you taken up merely with tangible things? or have you set your affections on things that are eternal, the things that are made real to faith? I thank God that through the knowledge of the truth of the Son of God, I have within me a greater power, a mightier working, an inward power, a vision of the truth more real than anyone can know who lives entirely in the realm of the tangible. God manifests </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Himself</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> to the person who dares to believe. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As we receive life in the new birth, and the more abundant life that Christ delights to give in the fullness of the Spirit, we receive a nature that delights to do the will of God. As we continue to believe the Word of God, a well of water springs up within our hearts, an overwhelming spring that issues out in rivers of living water. A spring is always better than a pump. It was a well of water, springing up, to the woman at the well, but to the person who has the Holy Ghost it is flowing rivers. Have you these flowing rivers? To be filled with the Holy Ghost is to be filled with the executive of the Godhead, who brings to us all the unlimited resources of the Father and all that the Son of God desires that we should have. As we are filled with the Spirit God will cause us to move in His authority and reign by His divine ability. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;God ... hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.&rdquo; By the Son of God, the Word of God, all things were created. The things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. The Son of God created everything that is seen out of things that were not there when He spoke. I want you to see that as you receive the Son of God, as Christ dwells in your heart by faith, there is the incoming of divine force, the power of limitless possibilities within you, and that as a result of this incoming Christ, God wants to do great things through you. If we receive and accept His Son, God brings us into sonship; and not only sonship, but joint heirship, into sharing together with Him all that the Son possesses. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Every day I live I am more and more convinced that very few who are saved by the grace of God have the right conception of how great is their authority over darkness, demons, death and every power of the enemy. It is a real joy when we realize our inheritance on this line. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was speaking like this one day, and someone said, &ldquo;I have never heard anything like this before. How many months did it take you to get up that sermon?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, God pressed my wife from time to time to get me to preach, and I promised her I would. I used to labor hard for a week to get something up. I would give out my text and then sit down and say, &lsquo;I am done.&rsquo; O brother, I have given up getting things up. They all come down, and the sermons that come down stop down as long as He wants them. Then they go back to God, with fruitage, for the Word of God declares that His Word shall not return unto Him void. If you get anything up, it will not stay up very long. But when it comes down from above, it takes you down with it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Son of God was manifested in this world to destroy the works of the devil; and it is His purpose that the sons of God should also be manifested on this present earth to destroy the works of the devil. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you remember the day when the Lord laid His hand on you? You say, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do anything but praise the Lord.&rdquo; Well, that was only the beginning. Where are you today? The divine plan is that you increase until you receive the measureless fullness of God. You do not have to say, &ldquo;It was wonderful when I was baptized with the Holy Ghost!&rdquo; If you have to look back to the past to make me know that you are baptized, then I fear you are back-slidden. If the beginning was good, it ought to be better day by day, until everyone is fully cohvinced that you are filled with the fullness of God! I don&rsquo;t want anything less than being full, and to be fuller and fuller until I am overflowing day by day. Do you realize that if you have been created anew and begotten again by the Word of God, that there is within you the same word of power, the same light and life that the Son of God Himself had? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants to flow through you in marvelous power and divine utterance and grace, until your whole body is a flame of fire. God intends each soul in Pentecost to be a live wire. So many people who have been baptized with the Holy Ghost came in because there was a </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">movement</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, but so many of them have become monuments, and you cannot move them. The Baptism in the Spirit should be an ever-increasing enlargement of grace. Jump in, stop in, and never come out; for this is the Baptism&mdash;to be lost in it, where you only know one thing, and that is the desire of God at all times. O Father, grant unto us a real look into the glorious liberty Thou hast designed for the children of God who are delivered from this present evil world, separated, sanctified, and made meet for Thy use; whom Thou hast designed to be filled with all Thy fullness! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Nothing has hurt me so much as this: to see so-called believers have so much unbelief in them that it is hard to move them. Everything is possible to them that believe. God will not fail to fulfill His Word, wherever you are. Suppose that all the people in the world did not believe, that would make no difference to God&rsquo;s Word. It would be the same. You cannot alter God&rsquo;&rsquo;s Word. It is from everlasting to everlasting, and they who believe in it shall be like Mount Zion which cannot be moved. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God heals by the power of His Word. But the most important thing is this: Are you saved? Do you know the Lord? Are you prepared to meet God? You may be an invalid as long as you live, but you may be saved by the power of God. You may have a strong, healthy body, but may go straight to hell because you know nothing of the grace of God and salvation. Thank God, I was saved in a moment, the moment I believed. And God will do the same for you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Spirit of God would have us understand there is nothing that can interfere with our getting into perfect blessing except our unbelief. Unbelief is a terrible hindrance. As soon as we are willing to allow the Holy Ghost to have His way, we shall find great things will happen all the time. But oh, how much of our own human reason we have to get rid of! How much human planning we have to become divorced from! What would happen right now if everyone believed God? I love the thought that God the Holy Ghost wants to emphasize truth. If we will only yield ourselves to the divine plan, He is right here to do great things, and to fulfill the promise in Joel 2.21, &ldquo;Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">the Lord will do great things.</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How many of us believe the Word? It is easy to quote it, but it is more important to believe it than to quote it. It is very easy for me to quote, &ldquo;Now are we the sons of God,&rdquo; but it is more important for me to know whether I am a son of God, When the Son of God was on the earth He was recognized by the people who heard Him. &ldquo;Never man spake like this man.&rdquo; His word was with power, and that word came to pass. Sometimes you have quoted, &ldquo;Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world,&rdquo; and you could not tell just where to find it. But, brother, is it so? Can demons remain in your presence? You have to be greater than demons. Can disease lodge in a body which you touch? You have to be greater than the disease. Can anything in the world stand against you and hold its place, if it is a fact that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world? Dare we to stand on the line of the Word of God and face the facts? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Have faith in the fact that Christ indwells you, and dare to act in harmony with that glorious truth. Christ said, &ldquo;Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">he shall have whatsoever he saith.</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If you have been begotten of the Word and the Word is in you, the life of the Son is in you, and God wants you to </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">fully believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. He says to you, &ldquo;What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that ye receive them, and </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">ye shall have</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has given us much in these last days, and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%2012:48')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">where much is given much will be required.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord has said to us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%205:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We see a thought on the same line when our Lord Jesus says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2015:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> On the other hand He tells us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2015:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If we do not move on with the Lord these days, and do not walk in the light of revealed truth, we shall become as the savorless salt, as a withered branch. This one thing we must do, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phil%203:13-14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">forgetting those things that are behind, the past failures and the past blessings, we must reach forth for those things which are before, and press toward the mark for the prize of our high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For many years the Lord has been moving me on and keeping me from spiritual stagnation. When I was in the Wesleyan Methodist Church I was sure I was saved and was sure I was all right. The Lord said to me, &ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; and I came out. When I was with the people known as the Brethren I was sure I was all right now. But the Lord said, &ldquo;Come out.&rdquo; Then I went into the Salvation Army. At that time it was full of life and there mere revivals everywhere. But the Salvation Army went into natural things and the great revivals that they had in those early days ceased. The Lord said to me, &ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; and I came out. I have had to come out three times since. I believe that this Pentecostal revival that we are now in is the best thing that the Lord has on the earth today, and yet I believe that God has something out of this that is going to be still better. God has no use for any man who is not <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%205:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">hungering and thirsting for yet more of Himself and His righteousness.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord has told us to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">covet earnestly the best gifts,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and we need to be covetous for those that will bring Him most glory. We need to see the gifts of healing and the working of miracles in operation today. Some say that it is necessary for us to have the gift of discernment in operation with the gifts of healing, but even apart from this gift I believe the Holy Ghost will have a divine revelation for us as we deal with the sick. Most people seem to have discernment, or think they have, and if they would turn it on themselves for twelve months they would never want to discern again. The gift of discernment is not criticism. I am satisfied that in Pentecostal circles today that our paramount need is more perfect love. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Perfect love will never want the preeminence in everything. it will never want to take the place of another, it will always be willing to take the back seat. If you go to a convention there is always someone who wants to give a message, who wants to he heard. If you have a desire to go to a convention you should have three things settled in your mind. Do I want to be heard? Do I want to be seen? Do I want anything on the line of finances? If I have these things in my heart I hare no right to be there. The one thing that must move us must be the constraining love of God to minister for Him. A preacher always loses out when he gets his mind on finances. It is well for Pentecostal preachers to avoid making much of finances except to stir up people to help our missionaries on financial lines. A preacher who gets big collections for the missionaries need never fear, the Lord will take care of his finances. A preacher should not land at a place and say that God had sent him. I am always fearful when I hear a man advertising this. If he is sent of God, the saints will know it. God has His plans for His servants and we must so live in His plans that He will place us where He wants us. If you seek nothing but the will of God, He will always put you in the right place at the right time. I want you to see that the gifts of healing and the working of miracles are part of the Spirit&rsquo;s plan and will come forth in operation as we are working along that plan. I must know the movement of the Spirit and the voice of God. I must understand the will of God if I am to see the gifts of the Spirit in operation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The gifts of healing are so varied. You may go and see ten people and every case is different. I am never happier in the Lord than when I am in a bedroom with a sick person. I have had more revelations of the Lord&rsquo;s presence when I have ministered to the sick at their bedsides than at any other time. It is as your heart goes out to the needy ones in deep compassion that the Lord manifests His presence. You are able to locate their position. It is then that you know that you must be filled with the Spirit to deal with the conditions before you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Where people are in sickness you find frequently that they are dense about Scripture. They usually know three scriptures though. They know about <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Paul&rsquo;s thorn in the flesh,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and that Paul told Timothy to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1tim%205:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">take a little wine for his stomach&rsquo;s sake,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2tim%204:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Paul left someone sick somewhere;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> they forget his name, and don&rsquo;t remember the name of the place, and don&rsquo;t know where the chapter is. Most people think they have a thorn in the flesh. The chief thing in dealing with a person who is sick is to locate their exact position. As you are ministering under the Spirit&rsquo;s power the Lord will let you see just that which will he most helpful and most faith-inspiring to them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in the plumbing business I enjoyed praying for the sick. Urgent calls would come and I would have no time to wash, and with my hands all black I would preach to these sick ones, my heart all aglow with love. Ah, you must have your heart in the thing when you pray for the sick. You have to get right to the bottom of the cancer with a divine compassion and then you will see the gifts of the Spirit in operation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was called at 10 o&rsquo;clock one night to pray for a young person given up by the doctor who was dying of consumption. As I looked, I saw that unless God undertook it was impossible for her to live. I turned to the mother and said, &ldquo;Well, mother, you will have to go to bed.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Oh, I have not had my clothes off for three weeks.&rdquo; I said to the daughters, &ldquo;You will have to go to bed,&rdquo; but they did not want to go. It was the same with the son. I put on my overcoat and said, &ldquo;Good-bye, I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t leave us.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can do nothing here.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Oh, if you will stop, we will all go to bed.&rdquo; I knew that God would move nothing in an atmosphere of mere natural sympathy and unbelief. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They all went to bed and I stayed, and that was surely a time as I knelt by that bed face to face with death and with the devil. But God can change the hardest situation and make you know that He is almighty. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then the fight came. It seemed as though <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('deu%2028:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the heavens were brass.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I prayed from 11 to 3:30 in the morning. I saw the glimmering light on the face of the sufferer and saw her pass away. The devil said, &ldquo;Now you are done for. You have come from Bradford and the girl has died on your hands.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be. God did not send me here for nothing. This is a time to change strength.&rdquo; I remembered that passage which said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%2018:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Men ought always to pray and not to faint.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Death had taken place but I knew that my God was all powerful, and He that had split the Red Sea is just the same today. It was a time when I would not have &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and God said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I looked at the window and at that moment the face of Jesus appeared. It seemed as though a million rays of light were coming from His face. As He looked at the one who had just passed away, the color came back to the face. She rolled over and fell asleep. Then I had a glorious time. In the morning she woke early, put on a dressing gown and walked to the piano. She started to play and to sing a wonderful song. The mother and the sister and the brother had all come down to listen. The Lord had undertaken. A miracle had been wrought. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord is calling us along this way. I am thanking God for difficult cases. The Lord has called us into heart union with Himself; He wants His bride to have one heart and one Spirit with Him and to do what He Himself loved to do. That case had to be a miracle. The lungs were gone, they were just in shreds, but the Lord restored lungs that were perfectly sound. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a fruit of the Spirit that must accompany the gift of healing and that is longsuffering. The man who is going through with God to be used in healing must he a man of longsuffering. He must be always ready with a word of comfort. If the sick one is in distress and helpless and does not see everything eye to eye with you, you must bear with them. Our Lord Jesus Christ was filled with compassion and lived and moved in a place of longsuffering, and we will have to get into this place if we are to help needy ones. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are some times when you pray for the sick and you apparently rough. But you are not dealing with a person, you are dealing with the Satanic forces that are binding the person. Your heart is full of love and compassion to all, but you are moved to a holy anger as you see the place the devil has taken in the body of the sick one, and you deal with his position with a real forcefulness. One day a pet dog followed a lady out of her house and ran all around her feet. She said to the dog, &ldquo;My dear, I cannot have you with me today.&rdquo; The dog wagged its tail and made a big fuss. She said, &ldquo;Go home, my dear.&rdquo; But the dog did not go. At last she shouted roughly, &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; and off it went. Some people deal with the devil like that. The devil can stand all the comfort you like to give him. Cast him out! You are dealing not with the person, you are dealing with the devil. Demon power must be dislodged in the name of the Lord: You are always right when you dare to deal with sickness as with the devil. Much sickness is caused by some misconduct, there is something wrong, there is some neglect somewhere, and Satan has had a chance to get in. It is necessary to repent and confess where you have given place to the devil, and then he can be dealt with. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When you deal with a cancer case, recognize that it is a living evil spirit that is destroying the body. I had to pray for a woman in Los Angeles one time who was suffering with cancer, and as soon as it was cursed it stopped bleeding. It was dead. The next thing that happened was that the natural body pressed it out, because the natural body had no room for dead matter. It came out like a great big ball with tens of thousands of fibers. All these fibers had been pressing into the flesh. These evil powers move to get further hold of the system, but the moment they are destroyed their hold is gone. Jesus said to His disciples that He gave them <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%2018:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">power to loose and power to bind.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is our privilege in the power of the Holy Ghost to loose the prisoners of Satan and to let the oppressed go free. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Take your position in the first epistle of John and declare, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Then recognize that it is not yourself that has to deal with the power of the devil, but the Greater One that is in you. Oh, what it means to be filled with Him. You can do nothing of yourself, but He that is in you will win the victory. Your being <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%206:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">has become the temple of the Spirit.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Your mouth, your mind. your whole being becomes exercised and worked upon by the Spirit of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was called to a certain town in Norway. The hall seated about 1500 people. When I got to the place it was packed, and hundreds were trying to get in. There were some policemen there. The first thing I did was to preach to the people outside the building. Then I said to the policemen. &ldquo;It hurts me very much that there are more people outside than inside and I feel I must preach to the people. I would like you to get me the market place to preach in.&rdquo; They secured for me a great park and a big stand was erected and I was able to preach to thousands. After the preaching we had some wonderful cases of healing. One man came a hundred miles bringing his food with him. He had not been passing anything through his stomach for over a month as he had a great cancer on his stomach. He was healed at that meeting. and opening his parcel, he began eating before all the people. There was a young woman there with a stiff hand. Instead of the mother making the child use her arm she had allowed the child to keep the arm dormant until it was stiff, and she had grown up to be a young woman and was like the woman that was bowed down with the spirit of infirmity. As she stood before me I cursed the spirit of infirmity in the name of Jesus. It was instantly cast out and the arm was free. Then she waved it all over. At the close of the meeting the devil laid out two people with fits. When the devil is manifesting himself, then is the time to deal with him. Both of these people were delivered, and when they stood up and thanked and praised the Lord what a wonderful time we had. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We need to wake up and be on the stretch to believe God. Before God could bring me to this place He has broken me a thousand times. I have wept, I have groaned. I have travailed many a night until God broke me. It seems to me that until God has mowed you down you never can have this longsuffering for others. We can never have the gifts of healing and the working of miracles in operation only as we stand in the divine power that God gives us and we stand believing God. and having done all we still stand believing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have been seeing wonderful miracles these last days and they are only a little of what we are going to see. I believe that we are right on the threshold of wonderful things, but I want to emphasize that all these things will be through the power of the Holy Ghost. You must not think that these gifts will fall upon you like ripe cherries. There is a sense in which you have to pay the price for everything you get. We must be covetous for God&rsquo;s best gifts, and say Amen to any preparation the Lord takes us through, in order that we may be humble, useable vessels through whom He Himself can operate by means of the Spirit&rsquo;s power. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The thought that has been pressing upon my mind for some time is the thought of &ldquo;</span><span class="cs53F207AF">ABIDING</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; and the joy of being at that Place where I can always count upon being in the Presence of Power, where I know God&rsquo;s Presence is with me, leading to a place where Victory is assured. Let us get hold of this thought&mdash;that if we keep in a certain place with God wonderful things may happen, for we shall then be in a place where we reach such spiritual attainment that marvels may be wrought because we are there. Then God will have His own way through us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">The anointed Jesus.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%204:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">fourth chapter of Luke, first verse, we read: &ldquo;And Jesus, being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Mark speaks about being &ldquo;driven&rdquo; by the Spirit. Whatever Mark means or Luke means, there is one thing certain, and that is this&mdash;we see a power, a majesty, falling on the Lord Jesus. He is no longer the same man. He has received a mighty anointing power of God, and in this place He realizes that the only thing for Him to do is to submit to God, and as He submits He is more and more covered with power and led by the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Spirit takes Him away into the wilderness, with its darkness and great privations. For forty days He was without food, but because of the Presence and the Power within and on Him He is certain of victory. With this Power He faces the wild beasts of the wilderness and the privations as to every human sustenance, and then at the end of forty days, in that holy attainment, He is forced into such persecution and trial as probably has never attacked man before; and in the place where He is God sustains Him mightily. With what? With this holy&mdash;and I want you to think about it&mdash;this holy, blessed unction which is upon Jesus, and which so brings prophecy to bear upon Satan that Jesus has a sword with which He can, as it were, defeat and almost slay Satan every time with prophecy by reminding him &ldquo;It is written.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%204:14-15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In the fourteenth verse you will see that &ldquo;Jesus returned in the power ofthe Spirit, and there went out a fame of Him through all the region round about; and He taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want you to understand that after the trials, after all the temptations and everything, He comes out more full of God, more clothed in the Spirit, more ready for the fight. The enduement with power had such an effect upon Him that other people saw it and flocked to hear Him, and great blessings came to the land. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Take another incident: He is among His kinsfolk and relations, and in the spirit of this kind of holy attainment He goes into the synagogue. There was delivered to Him a book, and He read: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%204:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, for He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is well to keep before us where the &ldquo;anointing&rdquo; came in. How was He anointed? How did it come to Him? You know how that was. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now in like manner I see that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%202:1-4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the Holy Ghost also fell upon the disciples at Pentecost.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I see that they were anointed with the same Power, and I see that they went forth and success attended their ministry until the Power of God swept through the whole &ldquo;inhabitable world.&rdquo; I want vou to see that it was because of this unction, this Power, that when <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%203:1-11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Peter and John spoke to the lame man at the gate of the temple he was able to rise and leap for joy.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Holy Ghost coming upon an individual is capable of changing him and fertilizing his spiritual life and filling him with such power and grace that he may not be able to say what would happen. What can not happen, what is not possible&mdash;if we reach this place and if we keep in it, if we abide in it? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision of dry bones.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want to turn to a portion of the Old Testament Scriptures, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">37th chapter of Ezekiel.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want you to see here particularly how a man was so full of the Spirit, was always so much in the Spirit that he could see that the hand of the Lord was upon him and who was led out in the Spirit. He was in a place of rest, and I want you to keep that before you. He had come to the place where he could rest and where he knew God was with him, and that he could rest there. This is an important point. Some people have an idea that they have to be doing something by way of breaking every rule and every movement. I beseech you, by the power of the Holy Ghost today, that you see that there is one thing only that is going to accomplish the purposes of God, and that is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">being in the Spirit</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. I don&rsquo;t care how dry the land is; I don&rsquo;t care how thirsty the land is, or how manv vessels or how few there are round about, I beseech you, in the Name of Jesus, that you keep in the Spirit. That&rsquo;s the secret. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here is a man who was in the right place and at the right time, and God well knows it. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2tim%202:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The Lord knoweth them that are His.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Ezekiel said: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:1-3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;The Lord carried me out in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of the valley, which was full of dry bones; and caused me to pass by them round about; and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. And He said unto me, &lsquo;Son of man, can these bones live?&rsquo; And I answered, &lsquo;O Lord God, Thou knowest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The vision is the Lord&rsquo;s, and you can see the Lord&rsquo;s vision only by being in the Spirit. When you are in the Spirit and dry bones are round about you and barren conditions all about, and you think everything is exactly opposite to your desires, and you can see no deliverance by human power, then, knowing that your condition is known to God and that God wants men and women who are willing to submit, and </span><span class="cs53F207AF">SUBMIT</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and SUBMIT, and yield, and </span><span class="cs53F207AF">YIELD</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and YIELD to the Holy Spirit until their bodies are saturated and soaked with God, you realize that God your Father has you in such condition that at any moment He can reveal His will to you and communicate whatever He wants to say to you. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Can these bones live?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou knowest, O Lord.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;Yes, I know. What do </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">you</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> think?&rdquo; &ldquo;From what I have known of you, Blessed Master, in the past, I believe that these dry bones can live, for You say so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very true, my child, go on and prophesy. Do as I tell you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Now I want you to understand that there is something more in it. I want you to see that God is everything to us, and I believe that we have to come to a place where we have to submit ourselves to the mighty </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">unctionizing</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> power of God, and where we shall see we are in the will of God, and I pray God the Holy Ghost that He will show us our leanness, our farness from this place. What we want is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">a great hunger and thirst for God.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I would like you to understand that God speaks first, and He speaks so loud and so clear and so distinct that this man (who was filled with the Spirit) of the Lord heard every word. Still there is not a move in the valley. Until the word of the Lord is uttered the bones are as dry as at the beginning. But what is the matter? God has spoken and the message has gone forth. What is it? Ah, it is only that the word of God has gone forth </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">through His servant the Prophet.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The world has to be brought to a knowledge of the truth, but that will! only be brought about </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">through human instrumentality,</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and that will be when the human instrument is at a place where he will say all that the Holy Spirit directs him to say. The man rose up, and clothed with the Divine Power he began to speak, he began to prophesy; and then as soon as he began to speak <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">there was a rattling among the bones,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and if we had been there we should have seen a bigger stir than we had ever seen before. Bone to bone at the voice of the man filled with the Spirit of the Living God. God had given him victory. God in like manner wants to give us victory. What does the word say? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ps%2046:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Be still, and know that I am God&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&mdash;the place of tranquility where we know that He is controlling and moving me by the mighty power of His Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, that is a place which we can reach. This prophecy is for us. Truly God wants to begin this in us. We must alwavs remember that it is God who is the Creator, and His creative power is in existence at this moment, and He knows where there is barrenness and where there is thirsty land, and it is He who can bring forth springs of water. There are many dry places. Indeed, nearly every town I go to is said to be the driest of places&mdash;&ldquo;the hardest town in the kingdom,&rdquo; they will say. What is that to do with you? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2059:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The Lord&rsquo;s hand is not shortened that it cannot save.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is man&rsquo;s extremity that God finds His opportunity, and it is for His word to awaken even you; and so God wants us to cheer up. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%209:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;All things are possible to them that believe.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But if we are to do the will of God at the right time and place we must yield to the Spirit and obey Him, so as to give God a fair chance. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:7')"><span class="cs449DA3AB">&ldquo;And I prophesied as was commanded.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He just did what he was told to do. It takes more to live in that place than in any other place that I know of&mdash;to live in a place where you hear God&rsquo;s voice. It is only by the power of the Holy Spirit that you can do as you are told quickly and without resistance <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold, a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is something worth vour notice in this. It is only the Spirit that can make the crooked straight. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some of you, no doubt, have thought some of your neighbors are a bit crooked, and were in fact some of the most crooked of-the-way bones vou ever saw in your life, and it would be impossible for them to get saved. That is nothing to do with you. It is for you to Jive in the Holy Ghost, and He can change the whole circumstance and you will be amazed at the way the crooked bones will be straightened. Nothing can change such circumstances as God can. &ldquo;Bone to bone,&rdquo; no crooked places now; but it takes God to do that. Man has been trying to do it all along, but as soon as a man has been truly baptized with tbe Holy Ghost, God does it. There is power in the Holy Ghost to transform, renew, and change the whole circumstances of life. You have to submit and let God take hold of you. Don&rsquo;t be troubled because you have not reached the place. You have reached somewhere, but the best is in store. Only yield so that He may have full control of all you are. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Here&rsquo;s a condition for them. There was the form, but no breath in it. But you must never give in and think the thing is fairly accomplished if you see the joining of the members and a kind of fellowship. You must never give in with tbat. They are never in the royal place until the breath of God has come into them and upon them. You must always lead people to receive the Holy Ghost and know that the breath of the Almighty is upon them. Justification will not be sufficient to accomplish the purpose of God. They may be justified and sanctified, but can never be satisfied until they are filled with the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There must be a real travailing of the human heart for God to bring forth. People are never safe until they are baptized with the Holy Ghost, and that is why the Apostles pressed that fact upon believers, and that is why Jesus was always pointing to the time when they should be filled with unction and power of the Spirit which would carry them all on. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2037:9-10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Then said He unto me: Prophesy.&rdquo; &ldquo;So I prophesied.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Glory to God! It is most wonderful. As soon as he began to prophesy he found there was somethingin it. Are you not wanting to get there? Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to be there? Do you think we ought to be satisfied until we are there? How can God be pleased with us until we reach that place? We must get to that place where we shall see God and know His voice when He sends us with a message that brings life and power and victory. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ezek%2039:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;And they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I know a lot of people who are seeking their baptism in a wonderful way. They see visions, and it is Scriptural that they should see visions. I believe that Paul was so imbued with the Holv Ghost and so filled with the glory of God that he could at times see visions and revelations. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">John in the Spirit.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want to point out something. John the Divine preached all over the country, and the enemies of Christ gnashed upon him with their teeth, and they tried to the best of their power to destroy him. Tradition says that they even put him in a pot of boiling oil, but, like a cat, he seemed to have nine lives, I tell you there is something in the power of the Holy Spirit. When God wants to keep a. man, nothing can destroy him. My life is in the hands of God. What can separate us from the love of God? Can <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:39')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">heights or depths?</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Is there anything that can separate us? No, praise God! nothing can separate us. No, his enemies said they could not kill him, so they cast him away on the rocky and desolate island of Patmos. They thought that would be an end of him; and there, on that lonely isle, he was &ldquo;</span><span class="cs53F207AF">IN THE SPIRIT</span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&rdquo; Have you ever been there?&quot; The very place that was not fit for humanity was the place where he was most filled with God, and where he was most ready for the revelation of Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, beloved, I tell you there is something in the baptism in the Holy Ghost worthy of our whole attention, worthy of our whole consideration in every way. The baptism in the Holy Ghost! Yes, the barren wilderness, the rocky and desolate isle, the dry land, and the most unfriendly place, may be filled with God. You read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rev%201')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the first chapter of the Revelation,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and you will see that in the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rev%201:9-10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">9th and 10th verses</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that John was in the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and behind him a great voice as of a trumpet. Immediately a revelation was made to him, which you cannot read without being blessed. The revelation given to him was a series of holy truths that have yet to be fulfilled, and will be fulfilled to the letter. There are wonderful things there. Blessed be God, we can come to that place which he speaks about. Jesus can reveal His mind to us from time to time. If you only think about it, you will see you are in a thousand times better position than John. In that barren place he was filled with the Spirit. You can have no excuse, for the lines have fallen to you in pleasant places. You will see from the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rev%204:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">second verse of the 4th chapter of Revelation</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that John was in so living and blessed a condition of fellowship with God that </span><span class="cs53F207AF">IMMEDIATELY</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> he was &ldquo;in the Spirit.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Immediately! What does it mean? It means this: that God wants us to be in a place where the least breath of heaven makes us all on fire, ready for everything. You say, &ldquo;How can I have that?&rdquo; Oh, you can have that as easy as anything. &ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; Yes, it is as simple as possible. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; Let heaven come in; let the Holy Ghost take possession of you, and when He comes into your body you will find out that that is the keynote of the spirit of joy and the spirit of rapture, and if you will allow the Holy Ghost to have full control you will find you are living in the Spirit, and you will find out that the opportunities will be God&rsquo;s opportunities, and there is a difference between God&rsquo;s opportunities and ours. You will find you have come to the right place at the right time, and you will speak the right word at the right time and in the right place, and you will not go a warfare at your own charge. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

I believe that Satan has many devices and that they are worse today than ever before; but I also believe that there is to be a full manifestation on the earth of the power and glory of God to defeat every device of Satan. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Ephesians 4 we are told to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%204:3-6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, for there is one body, and one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Baptism of the Spirit is to make us all one. Paul tells us <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">in 1 Corinthians 12.13 that by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is God&rsquo;s thought that we speak the same thing. If we all have the full revelation of the Spirit of God we shall all see the same thing. Paul asked these Corinthians, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%201:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When the Holy Ghost has full control, Christ is never divided, His body is not divided, there is no division. Schism and division are the products of the carnal mind. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How important it is that we shall have the manifestation of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;the word of knowledge&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> in our midst. It is the same Spirit who brings forth the word of wisdom that brings forth the word of knowledge. The revelation of the mysteries of God comes by the Spirit, and we must have a supernatural word of knowledge in order to convey to others the things which the Spirit of God has revealed. The Spirit of God reveals Christ in all His wonderful fullness, and He shows Him to us from the beginning to the end of the Scriptures. It is the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2tim%203:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Scriptures that make us wise unto salvation,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that open to us the depths of the kingdom of heaven, which reveal all the divine mind to us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are thousands of people who read and study the Word of God. But <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%20119:50')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">it is not quickened to them.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Bible is a dead letter except by the Spirit. The Word of God can never be vital and powerful in us except by the Spirit. The words that Christ spoke were not just dead words but <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%206:63')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">they were spirit and life.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And so it is the thought of God that a living word, a word of truth, the word of God, a supernatural word of knowledge, shall come forth from us through the power of the Spirit of God. It is the Holy Ghost who will bring forth utterances from our lips and a divine revelation of all the mind of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The child of God ought to thirst for the Word. He should know nothing else but the Word, and should know nothing among men save Jesus. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is as we feed on the Word and meditate on the message it contains, that the Spirit of God can vitalize that which we have received, and bring forth through us the word of knowledge that will be as full of power and life, as when He, the Spirit of God, moved upon holy men of old and gave them these inspired Scriptures. They were all inbreathed of God as they came forth at the beginning, and through the same Spirit they should come forth from us vitalized, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%204:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">living, powerful and sharper than any two~edged sword.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">With the gifts of the Spirit should come the fruit of the Spirit. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%205:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">With wisdom we should have love, with knowledge we should have joy, and with the third gift, faith, we should have the fruit of peace.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%205:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Faith is always accompanied by peace.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Faith always rests. Faith laughs at impossibilities. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%202:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Salvation is by faith, through grace, and it is the gift of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We are kept by the power of God through faith. God gives faith and nothing can take it away. By faith we have power to enter into the wondedul things of God. There are three positions of faith; saving faith, which is the gift of God; the faith of the Lord Jesus; and the gift of faith. You will remember the word of the Lord Jesus Christ given to Paul, to which he refers in the 26th of Acts, where the Lord commissioned him to go to the Gentiles, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2026:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them </span><span class="cs5EE81C7D">WHICH ARE SANCTIFIED BY FAITH THAT IS IN ME</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, this wonderful faith of the Lord Jesus. Your faith comes to an end. How many times I have been to the place where I have had to tell the Lord, &ldquo;I have used all the faith I have,&rdquo; and then He has placed His own faith within me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One of our workers said to me at Christmas time, &ldquo;Wigglesworth, I never was so near the end of my purse in my life.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Thank God, you are just at the opening of God&rsquo;s treasures.&rdquo; It is when we are at the end of our own, that we can enter into the riches of God&#39;s resources. It is when we possess nothing, that we can possess all things. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord will always meet you when you are on the line of living faith. I was in Ireland at one time and went to a house and said to the lady who came to the door, &ldquo;Is Brother Wallace here?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Oh, he has gone to Bangor, but God has sent you here for me. I need you. Come in.&rdquo; She told me her husband was a deacon of the Presbyterian Church. She had herself received the Baptism while she was a member of the Presbyterian Church, but they did not accept it as from God. The people of the church said to her husband, &ldquo;This thing cannot go on. We don&rsquo;t want you to be deacon any longer, and your wife is not wanted in the church.&rdquo; The man was very enraged and he became incensed against his wife. It seemed as though an evil spirit possessed him, and the home that had once been peaceful became very terrible. At last he left home and left no money behind him, and the woman asked me what should she do. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We went to prayer and before we had prayed five minutes the woman was mightily filled with the Holy Ghost. I said to her, &ldquo;Sit down and let me talk to you. Are you often in the Spirit like this?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Yes, and what could I do without the Holy Ghost now?&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;The situation is yours. The Word of God says that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%207:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">you have power to sanctify your husband.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Dare to believe the Word bf God. Now the first thing we must do is to pray that your husband come back tonight.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I know he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If we agree together, it is done.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I will agree.&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;When he comes home show him all possible love, lavish everything upon him. If he won&rsquo;t hear what you have to say, let him go to bed. The situation is yours. Get down before God and claim him for the Lord. Get into the glory just as you have got in today, and as the Spirit of God prays through you, you will find that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2037:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God will grant all the desires of your heart.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A month later I saw this sister at a convention. She told how her husband came home that night and that he went to bed, but she prayed right through to victory and then laid her hands upon him. The moment she laid hands upon him he cried out for mercy. The Lord saved him and baptized him in the Holy Spirit. The power of God is beyond all our conception. The trouble is that we do not have the power of God in a full manifestation because of our finite thoughts, but as we go on and let God have His way, there is no limit to what our limitless God will do in response to a limitless faith. But you will never get anywhere except you are in constant pursuit of all the power of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day when I came home from our open-air meeting at eleven o&rsquo;clock I found that my wife was out. I asked, &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; I was told that she was down at Mitchell&rsquo;s. I had seen Mitchell that day and knew that he was at the point of death. I knew that it was impossible for him to survive the day unless the Lord undertook. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are many who let down in sickness and do not take hold of the life of the Lord Jesus Christ that is provided for them. I was taken to see a woman who was dying and said to her, &ldquo;How are things with you?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I have faith, I believe.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You know that you have not faith, you know that you are dying. It is not faith that you have, it is language.&rdquo; There is a difference between language and faith. I saw that she was in the hands of the devil. There was no possibility of life until he was removed from the premises. I hate the devil, and I laid hold of the woman and shouted, &ldquo;Come out, you devil of death. I command you to come out in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; In one minute she stood on her feet in victory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But to return to the case of Brother Mitchell, I hurried down to the house, and as I got near I heard terrible screams. I knew that something had happened. I passed Mrs. Mitchell on the staircase and asked, &ldquo;What is up?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;He is gone! He is gone!&rdquo; I just passed her and went into the room, and immediately I saw that Mitchell had gone. I could not understand it, but I began to pray. My wife was always afraid that I would go too far, and she laid hold of me and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Dad! Don&rsquo;t you see that he is dead?&rdquo; I continued to pray and my wife continued to cry out to me, &rdquo;Don&rsquo;t, Dad. Don&rsquo;t you see that he is dead?&rdquo; But I continued praying. I got as far as I could with mv own faith, and then God laid hold of me. Oh, it was such a laying hold that I could believe for anything. The faith of the Lord Jesus laid hold of me and a solid peace came into my heart. I shouted. &ldquo;He lives! He lives! He lives!&rdquo; And he is living today. There is a difference between our faith and the faith of the Lord Jesus. The faith of the Lord Jesus is needed. We must change faith from time to time. Your faith may get to a place where it wavers. The faith of Christ never wavers. When you have that faith the thing is finished. When you have that faith you will never look at things as they are, you will see the things of nature give way to the things of the Spirit, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%204:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">you will see the temporal swallowed up in the eternal.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was at a camp meeting in Cazadero, California, about eight years ago, and a remarkable thing happened. A man came there who was stone deaf. I prayed for him and I knew that God had healed him. Then came the test. He would always move his chair up to the platform, and every time I got up to speak he would get up as close as he could and strain his ears to catch what I had to say. The devil said, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t done.&rdquo; I declared, &ldquo;It is done.&rdquo; This went on for three weeks, and then the manifestation came and he could hear distinctly sixty yards away. When his ears were opened he thought it was so great that he had to stop the meeting and tell everybody about it. I met him in Oakland recently and he was hearing perfectly. As we remain stedfast and unmoveable on the ground of faith, we shall see what we believe for in perfect manifestation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">People say to me, &ldquo;Have you not the gift of faith?&rdquo; I say that it is an important gift, but what is still more important is for us every moment to be making an advancement in God. Looking at the Word of God today I find that its realities are greater to me today than they were yesterday. It is the most sublime, joyful truth that God brings an enlargement. Always an enlargement. There is nothing dead, dry or barren in this life of the Spirit; God is always moving us on to something higher, and as we move on in the Spirit our faith will always rise to the occasion as different circumstances arise. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is how the gift of faith is manifested. You see an object and you know that your own faith is nothing in the case. The other day I was in San Francisco. I sat on a car and saw a boy in great agonies on the street. I said, &ldquo;Let me get out.&rdquo; I rushed to where the boy was. He was in agony through cramp of the stomach. I put my hands on his stomach in the name of Jesus. The boy jumped, and stared at me with astonishment. He found himself instantly free. The gift of faith dared in the face of everything. It is as we are in the Spirit that the Spirit of God will operate this gift anywhere and at any time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When the Spirit of God is operating this gift within a man, He causes him to know what God is going to do. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%203:1-3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">When the man with the withered hand was in the synagogue, Jesus got all the people to look to see what would happen.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The gift of faith always knows the results. He said to the man, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%203:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Stretch forth thine hand.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> His word had creative force. He was not living on the line of speculation. He spoke and something happened. He spake at the beginning and the world came into being. He speaks today and these things haye to come to pass. He is the Son of God and came to bring us into sonship. He was the firstfruit of the resurrection and He calls us to be first fruits, to be the same kind of fruit like to Himself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is an important point here. You cannot have the gifts by mere human desire. The Spirit of God distributes them severally as He will. God cannot trust some with the gift, but some who have a lowly, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2051:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">broken, contrite heart He can trust.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> One day I was in a meeting where there were a lot of doctors and eminent men, and many ministers. It was at a convention, and the power of God fell on the meeting. One humble little girl that waited at table opened her being to the Lord and was immediately filled with the Holy Ghost and hegan to speak in tongues. All these big men stretched their necks and looked up to see what was happening and were saying, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Then they learned it was &ldquo;the servant!&rdquo; Nobody received but &ldquo;the servant!&rdquo; These things <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%2011:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">are hidden and kept back from the wise and prudent,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but the little children, the lowly ones, are the ones that receive. We cannot have faith if we have honor one of another. A man who is going on with God won&rsquo;t accept honor from his fellow beings. God honors the man of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2034:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a broken, contrite spirit.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How shall I get there? So many people want to do great things, and to be seen doing them, but the one that God will use is the one that is willing to be hidden. My Lord Jesus never said He could do things, but He did them. When that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%207:11-12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">funeral procession was coming up from Nain with the widow&#39;s son carried upon the bier,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He made them lay it down. He spoke the word, &ldquo;Arise!&rdquo; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%207:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and gave the son back to the widow.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%207:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He had compassion for her.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And you and I will never do anything except on the line of compassion. We will never be able to remove the cancer until we are immersed so deeply into the power of the Holy Ghost, that the compassion of Christ is moving through us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I find that, in all my Lord did, He said that He did not do it, but that another in Him did the work. What a holy submission! He was just an instrument for the glory of God. Have we reached a place where we dare to be trusted with the gift? I see <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2013:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">in 1 Corinthians 13 that if I have faith to remove mountains and have not charity, all is a failure.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When my love is so deepened in God that I only move for the glory of God, that I only seek the glory of God, then the gifts can be made manifest. God wants to be manifested, and to manifest His glory to humble spirits. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A faint heart can never have a gift. There are two things essential; first, love, and second, determination, a boldness of faith that will cause God to fulfill His word. When I was baptized I had a wonderful time and had utterances in the Spirit, but for some time afterwards I did not again speak in tongues. But one day as I was helping another, the Lord again gave me utterances in the Spirit. I was one day going down the road and speaking in tongues a long while. There were some gardeners doing their work, and they stuck their heads out to see what was going on. I said, &ldquo;Lord, You have something new for me. You said that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">when a man speaks in tongues, he should ask for the interpretation.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I ask for the interpretation, and I&rsquo;ll stay right here till I get it.&rdquo; And from that hour the Lord gave me interpretation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one time I was in Lincolnshire in England and came in touch with the old pastor of an Episcopalian Church. He became very interested and asked me into his library. I never heard anything sweeter than the prayer the old man uttered as he got down to pray. He began to pray, &ldquo;Lord, make me holy. Lord, sanctify me.&rdquo; I called out, &ldquo;Wake up! Wake up now! Get up and sit in your chair.&rdquo; He sat up and looked at me. I said to him, &ldquo;I thought you were holy.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then what makes you ask God to do what He has done for you?&rdquo; He began to laugh and then to speak in tongues. Let us move into the realm of faith, and live in the realm of faith, and let God have His way. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, March 19, 1921.</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Everything I have seen in Switzerland has taken me down in brokenness before God. At Bern I have stood in a place which has been packed with people. and I have had to get a cleansing by weepIng as I have seen the people and then God gave us victory. Hundreds have been saved by the power of God. At Neuchatel God worked marvelously and the devil worked in between, but God is greater than all. At my second visit to Neuchatel the largest theater was hired and it was packed, and God moved upon the people, and on an average 100 souls were saved each night, and many healed through God&rsquo;s touch, yet many would not have Pentecostal teaching, and one man actually had meetings in opposition at places, but who Is the man who dares to put his hand on the child of God? This man also had prayer meetings to try to prevent people from going to the meetings, but they all turned to confusion. People came to be ministered unto. In all places it bas been the same. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one of the places a policeman was sent to ascertain what was going on and it resulted in his coming under the power of God, and he commenced to seek for the healing of his own body. Some of the opposers stated that the oil bottle I used was electrically charged and that I kept putting it into my pocket to get it recharged. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Ghost is preparing us for some wonderful event. I feel a burning in my bones. I preached one night on <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Eph. 3</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> for 3&frac12; hours, and so powerful was the Word that the people did not seem inclined to move. I preached and prayed with the sick until 11:30 p.m. Four people brought a man who was paralyzed and blind; the power of God fell upon him and us and he now walks and sees and is praising God. I have not been to one meeting where the power of God has not been upon us. I say this to His glory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In French Switzerland, where Pentecost was not known, seven different meeting places have been opened, and the work Is prospering. At Bern there is a band of praying people. Truly we have seen wonderful things. A girl was brought to me sitting in a chair. I would not minister at first, but told her she must wait and hear the Word of God. Her mother who had come with her was greatly moved as she listened to God&rsquo;s Word being expounded. I then laid hands on the girl, who had never walked. The power of God worked and she now walks. Another case, where a man had had a cancer taken out of his neck, after which he could no longer eat, not being able to swallow. He told me he could not even swallow the juice of a cherry. He had a pipe inserted in his neck so that food could be poured through it into his stomach. I said to him, &ldquo;You will eat tonight.&rdquo; I prayed with him. He came the next day. I saw that the color had come back into his face, and he told me he had been eating, and could swallow comfortably. He had looked for the hole where the pipe had been inserted but could not find It. God had completely healed him. He was well known; he was a tea grower and people said he had come to life again. When the Son of God touches a man he does come to life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has put His hand upon this work In Switzerland. Every afternoon people were baptized In the Holy Ghost, brought down into the dust for the power of God lays a man low. In Lausanne the power was mighty, also at Yevey and Geneva, and God has raised up Spirit-filled leaders In these towns. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man came to me suffering from diabetes. The power of God was upon me and I realized that God was working upon him. I said God has healed you. His address was taken and the case was followed up. He went to the doctor to be examined because he knew he was healed and asked him to examine him. He did so and stated that he was unable to find any trace of the disease whatever. He asked the doctor to give him a certificate which he did and I saw it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A young woman was dying of consumption, and her doctor had given her up. I laid hands on her in the name of Jesus and she knew that the disease had passed away. This girl went to the doctor, who examined her and said, &ldquo;Whatever has taken place, you have no consumption now.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Doctor I have been prayed over; can I tell the people I am healed?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Yes, and that I could not heal you.&rdquo; &ldquo;If I am to tell will you put it in black and white?&rdquo; And he gave her a certificate which I saw. God had healed her. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man was brought into one of the meetings in a wheel chair. He could not walk except by the aid of two sticks, and even then his locomotion was very slow. I saw him in that helpless condition, and told him about Jesus. Oh, that wonderful name! Glory to God! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%201:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;They shall call His name Jesus.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I placed my hands upon his head and said, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus thou art made whole.&rdquo; This helpless man cried out &ldquo;It is done, it is done, Glory to God, it is done!&rdquo; And he walked out of the building perfectly healed. The man who brought him in the wheel chair and the children said that father so and so Is walking. Praise the Lord <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2013:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He is the same yesterday, today and forever.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord made me a great blessing at Zurie last time, and I have promised to be there again on the 30th of October. Seven new places are glorifying God in tongues. I ministered last Sunday in a great theater which was filled, and there was a crying out to God for healing, and when they were healed they shouted for joy. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011:1-11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Hebrews 11.1-11.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe that there is only one way to all the treasures of God, and that is the way of faith. By faith and faith alone do we enter into a knowledge of the attributes, become partakers of the beatitudes, and participate in the glories of our ascended Lord. All His promises are Yea and Amen to them that believe. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God would have us come to Him by His own way. That is through the open door of grace. A way has been made. It is a beautiful way, and all His saints can enter in by this way and find rest. God has prescribed that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%201:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the just shall live by faith.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I find that all is a failure that has not its base on the rock Christ Jesus. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2014:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He is the only way, the truth and the life.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The way of faith is the Christ way, receiving Him in His fullness and walking in Him; receiving His quickening life that filleth, moveth and changeth us, bringing us to a place where there is always an Amen in our hearts to all the will of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I look into the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2012')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">12th chapter of Acts,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I find that the people were praying all night for Peter to come out of prison. They had a zeal but no faith. They were to be commended for their zeal in spending their time in prayer without ceasing, but there was one thing missing. It was faith. Rhoda had more faith than the rest of them. When the knock came to the door, she ran to it, and the moment she heard Peter&rsquo;s voice, she ran back again with joy saying that Peter stood before the gate. And all the people said, &ldquo;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2012:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">You are mad.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It isn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo; But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. But they had no faith, and conjectured, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2012:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Well, God has sent His angel.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But Peter continued knocking. They had zeal but no faith. And I believe there is quite a difference. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Zacharias and Elisabeth surely wanted a son, but even when the angel came and told Zarharias he was full of unbelief. And the angel said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%201:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Thou shalt be dumb because thou believest not my words.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But look at Mary: When the angel came to her, Mary said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luke%201:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Be it unto me according to thy word.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was her Amen to the will of God. And God wants us with an Amen in our lives, an inward Amen, a mighty moving Amen, a God-inspired Amen, that which says, &ldquo;It is, because God has spoken. It can not be otherwise. It is impossible to be otherwise.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Let us examine this 5th verse, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in Sweden, the Lord worked mightily. After one or two addresses the leaders called me and said, &ldquo;We have heard very strange things about you, and we would like to know if they are true. We can see that God is with you, and that God is moving, and we know that it will be a great blessing to Sweden.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have heard from good authority that you preach that you have the resurrection body.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in France I had an interpreter that believed this thing, and I found out after I had preached once or twice through the interpreter that she gave her own expressions. And of course I did not know. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to these brethren, &ldquo;I tell you what my personal convictions are. I believe that if I had the testimony of Enoch I should be off. I believe that the moment Enoch had the testimony that he pleased God, off he went.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I pray that God will so quicken our faith, for translation is in the mind of God; but remember that translation comes on the line of holy obedience and a walk that is pleasing to God. This was true of Enoch. And I believe that we must have a like walk with God in the Sririt, having communion with Him, living under His divine smile, and I pray that God by His Spirit may so move us that we will be where Enoch was when he walked with God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are two kinds of faith. There is the natural faith. But the supernatural faith is the gift of God. In <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2026:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 26.18,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Paul is telling Agrippa of what the Lord said to him in commissioning him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%2026:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Me.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Is that the faith of Paul? No, it is the faith that the Holy Ghost is giving. It is the faith that He brings to us as we press in and on with God. I want to put before you this difference between our faith and the faith of Jesus. Our faith comes to an end. Most people in this place have come to where they have said, &ldquo;Lord, I can go no further, I have gone so far and I can go no further. I have used all the faith I have, and I have just to stop now and wait.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I remember one day being in Lancashire, and going round to see some sick people. I was taken into, a house where there was a young woman lying on a bed, a very helpless case. The reason had gone; and many things were manifested there which were Satanic and I knew it. She was only a young woman, a beautiful child. The husband, quite a young man, came in with the baby, and he leaned over to kiss the wife. The moment he did, she threw herself over on the other side, just as a lunatic would do: That was very heart-breaking. Then he took the baby and pressed the baby&rsquo;s lips to the mother. Again another wild kind of thing happened. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I asked one who was attending her, &ldquo;Have you anybody to help?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have had everything.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;have you no spiritual help?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Her husband stormed out and said, &ldquo;Help? You think that we believe in God after we have had seven weeks or no sleep and maniac conditions? You think that we believe God? You are mistaken. You have come to the wrong house.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then a young woman of about eighteen or so just grinned at me and passed out of the door, and that finished the whole business. That brought me to a place of compassion for the woman that something had to be done, no matter what it was. Then with my faith I began to penetrate the heavens, and I was soon out of that house I will tell you, for I never saw a man get anything from God who prayed on the earth. If you get anything from God you will have to pray into Heaven for it is all there. If you are living in the earth realm and expect things from heaven, they will never come. And as I saw in the presence of God the limitations of my faith, there came another faith, a faith that could not be denied, a faith that took the promise, a faith that believed God&rsquo;s Word. And I came from that presence back again to earth, but not the same man under the conditions confronting me. God gave a faith that could shake hell and anything else. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &ldquo;Come out of her in the name of Jesus!&rdquo; And she rolled over and fell asleep and wakened in fourteen hours perfectly sane and perfectly whole. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a process on this line. Enoch walked with God. That must have been all those years as he was penetrating, and going through and laying hold, and believing and seeing and getting into such close co-operation and touch with God that things moved on earth and he began to move toward heaven. At last it was not possible for him to stop any longer. Oh Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2015')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">15th chapter of 1 Corinthians</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we read of the body being <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2015:43')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;sown with dishonor,&rdquo; to he raised in power.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It seems to me, that as we are looking for translation that the Lord would have us know something of that power now, and would have us kept in that power, so that we should not be sown in dishonor. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%205:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Enoch walked with God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God wants to raise the condition of saints so that they walk with Him and talk with Him. I don&rsquo;t want to build anything round myself, but it is true that if you find me outside of conversation with man, you will find me in conversation with God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is one thing that God has given me from my youth up, a taste and relish for my Bible. I can say before God, I have never read a book but my Bible, so I know nothing about books. It seems better to me to get the Book of books for food for your soul, for the strengthening of your faith and the building up of your character in God, so that all the time you are being changed and made meet to walk with God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I can see that it is impossible to please Him on any lines but faith, for everything that is not of faith is sin. God wants us to see that the plan of faith is the ideal and principle of God. In this connection I love to keep in my thoughts the beautiful words in the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2012:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">2nd verse of the 12th chapter of Hebrews: &ldquo;Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He is the author of faith. God worked through Him for the forming of the worlds. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%201:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And because of the exceeding abundant joy of providing for us so great salvation, He became the author of a living faith. And through this principle of living faith, looking unto Him who is the author and finisher of our faith, we <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has something better for you than you have ever had in the past. Come out into all the fullness of faith and power and life and victory that He is willing to provide, as you forget the things of the past, and press right on for the prize of His calling in Christ Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God wants us to enter into the rest of faith. He desires us to have all confidence in Himself. He purposes that His Word shall be established in our hearts; and, as we believe His Word, we will see that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%209:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">all things are possible.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">1 Corinthians 12:1 we read, &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is a great weakness in the church of Christ because of an awful ignorance concerning the Spirit of God and the gifts He has come to bring. God would have us powerful on all lines because of the revelation of the knowledge of His will concerning the power and manifestation of His Spirit. He would have us ever hungry to receive more and more of His Spirit. In times past I have arranged many conventions, and I have found that it is better to have a man on my platform who has not received the Baptism but who is hungry for all that God has for him, than a man who has received the Baptism and is satisfied and has settled down and become stationary and stagnant. But of course I would prefer a man that is baptized with the Holy Ghost and is still hungry for more of God. A man who is not hungry to receive more of God is out of order in any convention. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is impossible to overestimate the importance of being filled with the Spirit. It is impossible for us to meet the conditions of the day, to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%201:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">walk in the light as He is in the light,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> to subdue kingdoms and work righteousness and bind the power of Satan unless we are filled with the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read that in the early church <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('acts%202:42')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">they continued steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is important for us also to continue steadfastly in these same things. For some years I was associated with the Plymouth Brethren. They are very strong on the Word, and are sound on water baptism, and they do not neglect the breaking of bread service, but have it every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning as they had it in the early church. These people seem to have everything except the match. They have the wood, but they need the fire and then they would be all ablaze. Because they lack the fire of the Holy Spirit there is no life in their meetings. One young man who attended their meetings received the Baptism with the speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gave utterance. The brethren were very upset about this and came to the father and said to him, &ldquo;You must take your son aside and tell him to cease.&rdquo; They did not want any disturbance. The father told the son and said, &ldquo;My boy, I have been attending this church for twenty years and have never seen anything of this kind. We are established in the truth and do not want anything new. We won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo; The son replied, &ldquo;If that is God&rsquo;s plan I will obey, but somehow or other I don&rsquo;t think it is.&rdquo; As they were going home the horse stood still; the wheels were in deep ruts. The father pulled at the reins but the horse did not move. He asked. &ldquo;What do you think is up?&rdquo; The son answered, &ldquo;It has got established.&rdquo; God save us from becoming stationary. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God would have us to understand concerning spiritual gifts and to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">covet earnestly the best gifts, and also to enter into the more excellent way</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> of the fruit of the Spirit. We must beseech God for these gifts. It is a serious thing to have the Baptism and yet be stationary; to live two days in succession on the same spiritual plane is a tragedy. We must be willing to deny ourselves everything to receive the revelation of God&rsquo;s truth and to receive the fulness of the Spirit. Only that will satisfy God, and nothing less must satisfy us. A young Russian received the Holy Spirit and was mightily endued with power from on High. Some sisters were anxious to know the secret of his power. The secret of his power was continuous waiting upon God. As the Holy Ghost filled him it seemed as though every breath became a prayer and so all his ministry was on an increasing line. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I knew a man who was full of the Holy Ghost and would only preach when he knew that he was mightily unctionized by the power of God. He was asked to preach at a Methodist church. He was staying at the minister&rsquo;s house and he said, &ldquo;You go on to church and I will follow.&rdquo; The place was packed with people but this man did not turn up and the Methodist minister, becoming anxious, sent his little girl to inquire why he did not come. As she came to the bedroom door she heard him crying out three times, &ldquo;I will not go.&rdquo; She went back and reported that she heard the man say three times that he would not go. The minister was troubled about it, but almost immediately after this the man came in, and, as he preached that night, the power of God was tremendously manifested. The preacher asked him, &ldquo;Why did you tell my daughter that you were not coming?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I know when I am filled. I am an ordinary man and I told the Lord that I dared not go and would not go until He gave me a fresh filling of the Spirit. The moment the glory filled me and overflowed I came to the meeting.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Yes, there is a power, a blessing, an assurance, a rest in the presence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel His presence and know that He is with you. You need not spend an hour without this inner knowledge of His holy presence. With His power upon you there can be no failure. You are above par all the time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is the Gentile day. When the Jews refused the blessings of God He scattered them, and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%2011:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He has grafted the Gentiles into the olive tree where the Jews were broken off.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There never has been a time when God has been so favorable to a people who were not a people. He has brought in the Gentiles to carry out His purpose of preaching the gospel to all nations and to receive the power of the Holy Ghost to accomplish this task. It is of the mercy of God that He has turned to the Gentiles and made us partakers of all the blessings that belong to the Jews; and here under this canopy of glory, because we believe, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%203:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">we get all the blessings of faithful Abraham.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but hy the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There are many evil, deceiving spirits sent forth in these last days who endeavor to rob Jesus of His Lordship and of His rightful place. Many are opening the doors to these latest devils, such as New Theology and New Thought and Christian Science. These evil cults deny the fundamental truths of God&rsquo;s Word. They all deny eternal punishment and all deny the deity of Jesus Christ. You will never see the Baptism of the Holy Ghost come upon a man who accepts these errors. Neither will you see a Romanist <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:alert(fn1)"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">*</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> receive. They put Mary in the place of the Holy Ghost. I would like you to produce a Romanist who knows that he is saved. No man can know he is saved by works. If you ever speak to a Romanist you will know that he is not definite on the line of the new birth. They cannot be. Another thing, you will never find a Russellite <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:alert(fn2)"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">*</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> baptized in the Holy Ghost; nor a member of any other cult that does not put the Lord Jesus Christ pre-eminent above all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The all important thing is to make Jesus Lord. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:alert(fn3)"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">*</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Men can grow lopsided by emphasizing the truth of divine healing. Man can get wrong by all the time preaching on water baptism. But we never go wrong in exalting the Lord Jesus Christ, giving Him the pre-eminent place and magnifying Him as both Lord and Christ, yes, as very God of very God. As we are filled with the Holy Ghost our one desire is to magnify Him. We need to be filled with the Spirit to get the full revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God&rsquo;s command is for us to be filled with the Spirit. We are no good if we only have a full cup. We need to have an overflowing cup all the time. It is a tragedy not to live in the fulness of overflowing. See that you never live below the overflowing tide. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;Now there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Every manifestation of the Spirit is given that we might <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;profit withal.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When the Holy Spirit is moving in an assembly and His gifts are in operation, everyone will receive profit. I have seen some who have been terribly switched. They believe in gifts, in prophecy, and they use these gifts apart from the power of the Holy Ghost. We must look to the Holy Spirit to show us the use of the gifts, what they are for, and when to use them, so that we may never use them without the power of the Holy Ghost. I do not know of anything which is so awful today as people using a gift without the power. Never do it. God save us from doing it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man who is filled with the Holy Ghost, while he may not be conscious of having any gift of the Spirit, can have the gifts made manifest through him. I have gone to many places to help and have found that under the unction of the Holy Spirit many wonderful things have happened in the midst when the glory of the Lord was upon the people. Any man who is filled with God and filled with His Spirit might at any moment have <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:8-10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">any of the nine gifts</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> made manifest through him without knowing that he has a gift. Sometimes I have wondered whether it was better to be always full of the Holy Ghost and to see signs and wonders and miracles without any consciousness of possessing a gift, or whether it was better to know one has a gift. If you have received the gifts of the Spirit and they have been blessed, you should never under any circumstances use them without the power of God upon you pressing the gift through. Some have used the prophetic gift without the holy touch, and they have come into the realm of the natural, and it has brought ruin, caused dissatisfaction, broken hearts, upset assemblies. Do not seek the gifts unless you are purposed to abide in the Holy Spirit. They should be manifested only in the power of the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord will allow you <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%205:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to be very drunk in His presence,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but sober among people. I like to see people so filled with the Spirit that they are drunk like the 120 on the Day of Pentecost, but I don&rsquo;t like to see people drunk in the wrong place. That is what troubles us, somebody being drunk in a place of worship where a lot of people come in that know nothing about the Word. If you allow yourself to be drunk there you send people away, they look at you instead of seeing God. They condemn the whole thing because you have not been sober at the right time. Paul writes, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%205:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You can be beside yourself. You can go a bit further than being drunk. You can dance, if you will do it at the right time. So many things are commendable when all the people are in the Spirit. Many things are very foolish if the people round about you are not in the Spirit. We must be careful not to have a good time at the expense of somebody else. When you have a good time you must see that the spiritual conditions in the place lend themselves to help you and that the people are falling in line with you. Then you will find it always a blessing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">While it is right to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">covet earnestly the best gifts,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> you must recognize that the all important thing is to be filled with the power of the Holy Ghost Himself. You will never have trouble with people who are filled with the power of the Holy Ghost, but you will have a lot of trouble with people who have the gifts and have no power. The Lord wants us to come behind in no gift, but at the same time He wants us to be so filled with the Holy Ghost that it will be the Holy Spirit manifesting Himself through the gifts. Where the glory of God alone is desired you can look for every needed gift to be made manifest. To glorify God is better than to idolize gifts. We prefer the Spirit of God to any gift; but we can look for the Trinity in manifestation, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012:4-6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">different gifts by the same Spirit, different administrations but the same Lord, diversities of operation but the same God working all in all.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Can you conceive of what it will mean for our Triune God to be manifesting Himself in His fulness in our assemblies? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Watch that great locomotive boiler as it is filled with steam. You can see the engine letting off some of the steam as it remains stationary. It looks as though the whole thing might burst. You can see saints like that. They start to scream, but that is not to edification. But when the locomotive moves on, it serves the purpose for which it was built, and pulls along much traffic with it. It is wonderful to be filled with the power of the Holy Ghost, and for Him to serve His own purposes through us. Through our lips divine utterances flow, our hearts rejoice and our tongue is glad. It is an inward power within which is manifested in outward expression. Jesus Christ is glorified. As your faith in Him is quickened, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%207:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">from within you there will flow rivers of living water.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Holy Spirit will pour through you like a great river of life and thousands will be blessed because you are a yielded channel through whom the Spirit may flow. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is much controversy today as regards the genuineness of this Pentecostal work, but there is nothing so convincing as the fact that over fifteen years ago a revival on Holy Ghost lines began and has never ceased. You will find that in every clime throughout the world God has poured out His Spirit in a remarkable way in a line parallel with the glorious revival that inaugurated the church of the first century. People who could not understand what God was doing when He kept them concentrated in prayer, wondered as these days were being brought about by the Holy Ghost, and found themselves in exactly the same place and entering into an identical experience as the Apostles on the day of Pentecost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our Lord Jesus said to His disciples, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%2024:49')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God promised through the prophet Joel, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Joel%202:28-29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.... Upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My Spirit.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As there is a widespread misconception concerning this receiving of the Holy Spirit, I believe the Lord would have us examine the scriptures on this subject. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You know, beloved, it had to be something on the line of solid facts to move me. I was as certain as possible that I had received the Holy Ghost, and was absolutely rigid in this conviction. When this Pentecostal outpouring began in England I went to Sunderland and met with the people who had assembled for the purpose of receiving the Holy Ghost. I was continuously in those meetings causing disturbances until the people wished I had never come. They said that I was disturbing the whole conditions. But I was hungry and thirsty for God, and had gone to Sunderland because I heard that God was pouring out His Spirit in a new way. I heard that God had now visited His people, had manifested His power and that people were speaking in tongues as on the day of Pentecost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I got to this place I said, &quot;I can not understand this meeting. I have left a meeting in Bradford all on fire for God. The fire fell last night and we were all laid out under the power of God. I have come here for tongues, and I don&#39;t hear them&mdash;I don&#39;t hear anything.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;Oh!&quot; they said, &quot;when you get baptized with the Holy Ghost you will speak in tongues.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;Oh, is that it?&quot; said I, &quot;when the presence of God came upon me, my tongue was loosened, and really I felt as I went in the open air to preach that I had a new tongue.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;Ah no,&quot; they said, &quot;that is not it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;What is it, then?&quot; I asked. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They said, &quot;When you get baptized in the Holy Ghost&mdash;&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;I am baptized,&quot; I interjected, &quot;and there is no one here who can persuade me that I am not baptized.&quot; So I was up against them and they were up against me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I remember a man getting up and saying, &quot;You know, brothers and sisters, I was here three weeks and then the Lord baptized me with the Holy Ghost and I began to speak with other tongues.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &quot;Let us hear it. That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for.&quot; But he would not talk in tongues. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was doing what others are doing today, confusing the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Cor%2012')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">12th of 1 Corinthians</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> with the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%202')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">2nd of Acts.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> These two chapters deal with different things, one with the gifts of the Spirit, and the other with the baptism of the Spirit with the accompanying sign. I did not understand this and so I said to the man, &quot;Let&#39;s hear you speak in tongues.&quot; But he could not. He had not received the &quot;gift&quot; of tongues, but the Baptism. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As the days passed I became more and more hungry. I had opposed the meetings so much, but the Lord was gracious, and I shall ever remember that last day&mdash;the day I was to leave. God was with me so much that last night. They were to have a meeting and I went, but I could not rest. I went to the Vicarage, and there in the library I said to Mrs. Boddy, &quot;I can not rest any longer, I must have these tongues.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She replied, &quot;Brother Wigglesworth, it is not the tongues you need but the Baptism. If you will allow God to baptize you, the other will be all right.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;My dear sister, I know I am baptized,&quot; I said. &quot;You know that I have to leave here at 4 o&#39;clock; please lay hands on me that I may receive the tongues.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She rose up and laid her hands on me and the fire fell. I said, &quot;The fire&#39;s falling.&quot; Then came a persistent knock at the door, and she had to go out. That was the best thing that could have happened, for I was </span><span class="cs53F207AF">ALONE WITH</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> G</span><span class="cs53F207AF">OD</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. Then He gave me a revelation. Oh it was wonderful! He showed me an empty cross and Jesus glorified. I do thank God that the cross is empty, that Christ is no more on the cross. It was there that He bore the curse, for it is written, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Gal%203:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Cor%205:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He became sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and now, there He is in the glory. Then I saw that God had purified me. It seemed that God gave me a new vision, and I saw a perfect being within me with mouth open saying, &quot;Clean, Clean! Clean!&quot; When I began to repeat it I found myself speaking in other tongues. The joy was so great that when I came to utter it my tongue failed, and I began to worship God <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">in other tongues as the Spirit gave me utterance.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was all as beautiful and peaceful as when Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%204:39')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Peace, be still!&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and the tranquility of that moment and the joy surpassed anything I had ever known up to that moment. But, Hallelujah! these days have grown with greater, mightier, more wonderful divine manifestations and power. That was but the beginning. There is no end to this kind of beginning. You will never get an end to the Holy Ghost till you are landed in the glory&mdash;till you are right in the presence of God for ever. And even then we shall ever be conscious of His presence. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What had I received? I had received the Bible evidence. This Bible evidence is wonderful to me. I knew I had received the very evidence of the Spirit&#39;s incoming that the Apostles received on the day of Pentecost. I knew that everything I had had up to that time was in the nature of an anointing bringing me in line with God in preparation, but now I knew I had the Biblical Baptism in the Spirit. It had the backing of the Scriptures. You are always right when you nave the backing of the Scriptures and you are never right if you have not a foundation for your testimony in the Word of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For many years I have thrown out a challenge to any person who can prove to me that he has the Baptism without speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance&mdash;to prove it by the Word that he has been baptized in the Holy Ghost without the Bible evidence, but so far no one has accepted the challenge. I only say this because so many were like I was, they have a rigid idea that they have received the Baptism without the Bible evidence. The Lord Jesus wants those who preach the Word to have the Word in evidence. Don&#39;t be misled by anything else. Have a Bible proof for all you have, and then you will be in a place where no man can move you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was so full of joy that I wired home to say that I had received the Holy Ghost. As soon as I got home, my boy came running up to me and said, &quot;Father; have you received the Holy Ghost?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &quot;Yes, my boy.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He said, &quot;Let&#39;s hear you speak in tongues.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But I could not. Why? I had received the Baptism in the Spirit with the speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence according to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 2.4</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and had not received the gift of Tongues according to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Cor%2012')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">1 Corinthians 12.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I had received the Giver of all gifts. At some time later when I was helping some souls to seek and receive the Baptism of the Spirit, God gave me the gift of Tongues so that I could speak at any time. I could speak, but will not&mdash;no never! I must allow the Holy Ghost to use the gift. It should be so, so that we shall only have divine utterances by the Spirit. I would be very sorry to use a gift, but the Giver has all power to use <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Cor%2012:8-10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the whole nine gifts.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to take you to the Scriptures to prove my position. There are business men here, and they know that in cases of law, where there are two clear witnesses they could win a case before any judge in Australia. On the clear evidence of two witnesses any judge will give a verdict. What has God given us? Three clear witnesses on the Baptism in the Holy Spirit&mdash;more than are necessary in law courts. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The first is in <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 2.4, &quot;They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Here we have the original pattern. And God gave to Peter an eternal word that couples this experience with the promise that went before. &quot;This is that.&quot; And God wants you to have that&mdash;nothing less than that. He wants you to receive the Baptism in the Holy Spirit according to this original Pentecostal pattern. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%2010')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 10</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we have another witness. Peter is in the house of Cornelius. Cornelius had had a vision of an holy angel and had sent for Peter. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A person said to me one day, &quot;You don&#39;t admit that I am filled and baptized with the Holy Ghost. Why, I was ten days and ten nights on my back before the Lord and He was flooding my soul with joy.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &quot;Praise the Lord, sister, that was only the beginning. The disciples were tarrying that time, and they were still, and the mighty power of God fell upon them then and the Bible tells what happened when the power fell.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And that is just what happened in the house of Cornelius. The Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%2010:45')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What convinced these prejudiced Jews that the Holy Ghost had come? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%2010:46')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There was no other way for them to know. This evidence could not be contradicted. It is the Bible evidence. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If some people in this district had an angel come and talk to them as Cornelius had, they would say that they knew they were baptized. Do not be fooled by anything. Be sure that what you receive is according to the Word of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have heard two witnesses, and that is sufficient to satisfy the world. But God goes one better. Let us look at <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%2019:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 19:6, &quot;And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues and prophesied.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> These Ephesians received the identical Bible evidence as the Apostles at the beginning and they prophesied in addition. Three times the Scriptures show us this evidence of the Baptism in the Spirit. I do not magnify tongues. No, by God&#39;s grace, I magnify the Giver of tongues. And I magnify above all Him whom the Holy Ghost has come to reveal to us, the Lord Jesus Christ. He it is who sends the Holy Spirit and I magnify Him because He makes no difference between us and those at the beginning. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But what are the tongues for? Look at the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Cor%202:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">2nd verse of 1 Corinthians 14</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and you will see a very blessed truth. O Hallelujah! Have you been there, beloved? I tell you, God wants to take you there. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Cor%2014:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It goes on to say, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Cor%2014:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Enter into the promises of God. It is your inheritance. You will do more in one year if you are really filled with the Holy Ghost than you could do in fifty years apart from him. I pray that you may he so filled with Him that it will not be possible for you to move without a revival of some kind resulting. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My most precious Bro. Boddy, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Your request to me, to send some reports for your valuable paper from time to time, has never slipped my memory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I now have a dear English brother accompanying me on this trip. He, owing to reading a copy of </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Confidence</span><span class="cs78AB3212">, as led to visit Bro. Mead in Los Angeles. He had just come from Mexico, and was in need of spiritual help. I was staying at Bro. Mead&#39;s at the time, and, being fresh from England, we soon became closely associated. This led to his baptism, and now he is most anxious to please God in any way, and is now writing this letter from me to you for your paper </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Confidence</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I must have seen not less than 1,500 people healed and great numbers baptized into the Holy Spirit since I came into this country. My ministry, as in England, grows very rapidly, and the great cry is, &quot;Do not leave us!&quot; I have heard this cry at every place, only California&#39;s cry has been louder than that in other places I have visited. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I am now going to describe one or two things which may be helpful and useful for your paper, for they prove that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is given in accordance with <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mar%2016:17-18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Mark 16:17-18:</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mar%2016:17-18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;And these signs shall follow them that believe; in My name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.&quot;</span></a></span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Baptism in the Holy Ghost was also clearly revealed to our minds, the gifts being in evidence, according to the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2012')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">12th,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2013')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">13th,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2014')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">14th chapters</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> of the First Epistle to the Corinthians. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At all points, at all places, including Oakland and Los Angeles, the buildings were thickly packed with people eager to hear the Word of God, and one feels now, as never before, that as the Spirit rests upon us, they </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">press</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> to hear the Word of God, as is mentioned in <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%205:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Luke 5:1.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God help me! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was common to see, at the end of the meetings, crowds waiting for the ministry of the health in Christ, and, as in the days of the Acts of the Apostles, as one laid hands on the needy, marvelous changes were instantly wrought. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For instance, at Victoria Hall there came a woman pressed down with cancer of the breast. She was anointed with oil, according to God&#39;s Word. I laid hands on the cancer, cast out the demon, and the cancer which had up to then been bleeding dried up. She received a deep impression through the Spirit that the work was done, and closely watched the healing process together with a lady friend. The cancer began to move from its seat, and in five days dropped out entirely into the protecting bandage. They were much interested and full of joy, and looking into the cavity from whence the tumor had come, they saw to their amazement and surprise that not one drop of blood had been shed at the separation of the cancer. The cavity was sufficiently large to receive a small cup and they noticed that the sides were of a beautiful reddish hue. During the next two days, and whilst they were watching closely they saw the cavity fill up with flesh and a skin formed over it, so that at last there was only a slight scar. At two meetings this lady, filled with enthusiasm, held in her hand a glass vessel containing the cancer, and declared how great things God had done unto her. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is not the only cure I could describe on the cancer line. I will give you others in a further letter. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here is a point well worth the notice of the readers of your valuable paper. At Oakland a fine-looking young man, a slave to alcohol and nicotine, came along with his wife to see if I could heal him. They stated his case, and I said, &quot;Yes. I can heal you in Jesus&#39;s Name.&quot; I told him to put out his tongue, and I cursed the demon power of alcohol and also cast out the demon power of nicotine. The man knew that he was free. He afterwards became an earnest seeker and within 24 hours was baptized with the Holy Spirit, thus clearly confirming <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mar%2016:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Mark 16:17: &quot;In My Name they shall cast out devils.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A preacher, suffering many days from the kick of a horse, walking with great pain and in much distress, made a special call at the hotel in which I was staying, and being led by the Spirit, according to God&#39;s Word, I laid hands on the bruised ankle. A fire broke out with burning and healing power, and from that moment he could walk easily and without pain. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A boy came to a meeting on crutches, suffering from a broken ankle. Prayer was made and hands laid upon him, and I got him to walk across the platform. He declared that he had no pain, that it had all gone, and carried off his crutches under his arm. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At the Los Angeles meetings all descriptions of sickness, lameness, deafness, tumors, cancers, and brokenness of spirit, etc., were healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Truly one could say the vision which Jesus gave was fulfilled: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%2011:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I notice that in your paper you say that I hoped to be home by Christmas. Beyond measure I have been pressed out for duties of preaching and for Conventions, so that I cannot be home by that time. If, however, the seas are free and danger removed, I would strike for home after visiting Rochester January Convention, in order to have my own Convention at Easter in Bradford. Thus I hope to wire you so as to allow time for making it known. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will send a fuller report the next time I write. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God bless you and all the saints in England, especially your dear wife. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Yours in His name and service, S</span><span class="cs53F207AF">MITH</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> W</span><span class="cs53F207AF">IGGLESWORTH</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

(Published 1924.)</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bible Reading: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%206')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 6.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%206:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In the days when the number of disciples began to be multiplied</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> there arose a situation where the twelve had to make a definite decision not to occupy themselves with serving tables, but <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%206:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to give themselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How important it is for all God&#39;s ministers to be continually in prayer, and constantly feeding on the Scriptures of Truth. I often offer a reward to anyone who can catch me anywhere without my Bible or my Testament. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">None of you can be strong in God unless you are diligently and constantly hearkening to what God has to say to you through His Word. You cannot know the power and the nature of God unless you partake of His inbreathed Word. Read it at morn and at night, and at every opportunity you get. After every meal, instead of indulging in unprofitable conversation round the table, read a chapter from the Word and then have a season of prayer. I endeavor to make a point of doing this no matter where or with whom I am staying. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Psalmist said that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Ps%20119:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">he had hid God&#39;s Word in his heart, that he might not sin against Him;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and you will find that the more of God&#39;s Word you hide in your heart, the easier it is to live a holy life. He also testified that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Ps%20119:50')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God&#39;s Word had quickened him;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and, as you receive God&#39;s Word into your being, your whole physical being will be quickened and you will be made strong. As you receive with meekness the Word, you will find faith upspringing within. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And you will have life through the Word.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The twelve told the rest to look out seven men to look after the business end of things. They were to be men of honest report and filled with the Holy Ghost. These were just ordinary men who were chosen, but they were filled with the Holy Spirit, and this infilling always lifts a man to a plane above the ordinary. It does not take a cultured or a learned man to fill a position in God&#39;s church; what God requires is a yielded, consecrated, holy life, and He can make of such <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Heb%201:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a flame of fire.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mat%203:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire!</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The multitude chose out seven men to serve tables. They were doubtless faithful in their appointed tasks, but we see that God soon had a better choice for two of them. Philip was so full of the Holy Ghost that he could have a revival wherever God put him down. Man chose him to serve tables, but God chose him to win souls. O, if I could only stir you up to see that, as you are faithful in performing the humblest office, God can fill you with His Spirit and make you a chosen vessel for Himself, and promote you to a place of mighty ministry in the salvation of souls and in the healing of the sick. There is nothing impossible to a man filled with the Holy Ghost. It is beyond all human comprehension. When you are filled with the power of the Holy Ghost, God will wonderfully work wherever you go. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When you are filled with the Spirit you will know the voice of God. I want to give you one illustration of this. When I was going out to Australia recently, our boat stopped at Aden and Bombay. In the first place the people came round the ship selling their wares, beautiful carpets and all sorts of oriental things. There was one man selling some ostrich feathers. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I was looking over the side of the ship watching the trading, a gentleman said to me, &quot;Would you go shares with me in buying that bunch of feathers?&quot; What did I want with feathers? I had no use for such things and no room for them either. But the gentleman put the question to me again, &quot;Will you go shares with me in buying that bunch?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Spirit of God said to me, &quot;Do it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The feathers were sold to us for three pounds, and the gentleman said, &quot;I have no money on me, but if you will pay the man for them, I will send the cash down to you by the purser.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I paid for the feathers and gave the gentleman his share. He was traveling first, and I was traveling second class. I said to him, &quot;No, please don&#39;t give that money to the purser, I want you to bring it to me personally to my cabin.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to the Lord, &quot;What about these feathers?&quot; He showed me that He had a purpose in my purchasing them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At about 10 o&#39;clock the gentleman came to my cabin and said, &quot;I&#39;ve brought the money.&quot; I said to him, &quot;It is not your money that I want, it is your soul that I am seeking for God.&quot; Right there he opened up the whole plan of his life and began to seek God, and that morning he wept his way through to God&#39;s salvation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You have no conception what God can do through you when you are filled with His Spirit. Every day and every hour you can have the divine leading of God. To be filled with the Holy Ghost means much in every way. I have seen some who have been suffering for years, and when they have been filled with the Holy Ghost everything of their sickness has passed away. The Spirit of God has made real to them the life of Jesus and they have been completely liberated of every sickness and infirmity. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Look at Stephen. He was just an ordinary man chosen to serve tables. But the Holy Ghost was in him and he was <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%206:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">full of faith and power, and did great wonders and miracles among the people.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There was no resisting the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. How important it is that every man shall be filled with the Holy Spirit. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
							<span class="csC18E74A5">[At this point in the service someone (possibly Wigglesworth) spoke in prophetic tongues. The interpretation was: &quot;The divine will is that you shall be filled with God; for the power of the Spirit to fill you with the mightiness of God. There is nothing God will withhold to a man filled with the Holy Ghost.&quot;]</span></h5>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to impress the importance of this upon you It is not healing that I am presenting to you in these meetings&mdash;it is the living Christ. It is a glorious fact that the Son of God came down <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Isa%2061:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to bring liberty to the captives.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And He it is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%203:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">who baptizes with the Holy Ghost and fire,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> who is shedding forth this which we are now seeing and hearing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How is it that the moment you are filled with the Holy Ghost that persecution starts? It was so with the Lord Jesus Himself. We do not read of any persecutions before the Holy Spirit came down like a dove upon Him. Shortly after this we find that after preaching in His home town <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%204:29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">they wanted to throw Him over the brow of a hill.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was the same with the twelve disciples. They had no persecution before the day of Pentecost, but after they were filled with the Spirit they were soon in prison. The devil and the priests of religion will always get stirred when a man is filled with the Spirit and does things in the power of the Spirit. And persecution is the greatest blessing to a church. When we have persecution we will have purity. If you desire to be filled with the Spirit you can count on one thing, and that is persecution. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%2012:51-52')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The Lord came to bring division, and even in your own household you may find three against two.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord Jesus came to bring peace, and soon after you get peace within you get persecution without. If you remain stationary, the devil and his agents will not disturb you much. But when you press on and go the whole length with God the enemy has you as a target. But God will vindicate you in the midst of the whole thing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At a meeting I was holding, the Lord was working and many were being healed. A man saw what was taking place and remarked, &quot;I&#39;d like to try this thing.&quot; He came up for prayer and told me that his body was broken in two places. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I laid my hands on him in the name of the Lord, and said to him, &quot;Now, you believe God.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next night he was at meeting and he got up like a lion. He said, &quot;I want to tell you people that this man here is deceiving you. He laid his hands on me last night for rupture in two places, but I&#39;m not a bit better.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I stopped him and said, &quot;You are healed, your trouble is that you won&#39;t believe it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He was at meeting the next night and when there was opportunity for testimony this man arose. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He said, &quot;I&#39;m a mason by trade. Today I was working with a laborer and he had to put a big stone in place. I helped him and did not feel any pain I said to myself, &#39;How have I done it?&#39; I went away to a place where I could strip, and I found that I was healed.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I told the people, &quot;Last night this man was against the Word of God, but now he believes it. It is true that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%2016:17-18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">these signs shall follow them that believe, they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And all through the power that is in the name of Christ.&quot; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%206:63')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">It is the Spirit who has come to reveal the Word of God, and to make it spirit and life to us.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You people who are seeking the Baptism are entering a place where you will have persecution. Your best friends will leave you&mdash;or those you may esteem your best friends. No good friend will ever leave you. But it is worth while. You enter into a realm of illumination, of revelation by the power of the Holy Ghost. He reveals the preciousness and the power of the blood of Christ. I find by the revelation of the Spirit that there is not one thing in me that the blood does not cleanse. I find that God sanctifies me by the blood and reveals the efficacy of the work by the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Stephen was just an ordinary man clothed with the divine. He was full of faith and power, and great wonders and miracles were wrought by him. Oh, this life in the Holy Ghost! this life of deep, inward revelation, of transformation from one state to another, of growing in grace and in all knowledge and in the power of the Spirit, the life and the mind of Christ being renewed in you, and of constant revelations of the might of His power. It is only this kind of thing that will enable us to stand. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In this life, the Lord puts you in all sorts of places, and then reveals His power. I had been preaching in New York, and sailed one day for England on the </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Lusitania</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. As soon as I got on board I went down to my cabin. Two men were there, and one of them said, &quot;Well, will I do for company?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He took out a bottle and poured out a glass of whiskey and drank it, and then he filled it up for me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;I never touch that stuff,&quot; I said. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;How can you live without it?&quot; he asked. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;How could I live with it?&quot; I asked. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He admitted, &quot;I have been under the influence of this stuff for months, and they say my &#39;inside is all shrivelled up,&#39; and I know that I am dying. I wish I could be delivered, but I just have to keep on drinking. Oh, if I could only be delivered! My father died in England and has given me his fortune, but what will the good of it be to me except to hasten me to my grave.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to this man, &quot;Say the word, and you will be delivered.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He enquired, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &quot;Say the word, show that you are willing to be delivered and God will deliver you.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But it was just as if I was talking to this platform for all the comprehension he showed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to him, &quot;Stand still,&quot; and I laid my hands on his head in the name of Jesus and cursed that drink demon that was taking his life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He cried out, &quot;I&#39;m free! I&#39;m free! I know I&#39;m free!&quot; He took two bottles of whiskey and threw them overboard, and God saved, sobered and healed him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was preaching all the way across. He sat beside me at the table. Previous to this he had not been able to eat, but every meal he went right through the menu. You only have to have a touch from Jesus to have a good time. The power of God is just the same today. To me, He&#39;s lovely. To me, He&#39;s saving health. To me, He&#39;s the lily of the valley. O this blessed Nazarene, this King of Kings! Hallelujah! Will you let Him have your will, will you let Him have you? If you will, all His power is at your disposal. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit by which Stephen spake, and so, full of rage, they brought him to the council. And God filled his face with a ray of heaven&#39;s light. It is worth being filled with the Spirit, no matter what it costs. Read the seventh chapter, the mighty prophetic utterance by this holy man. Without fear he tells them, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%207:51')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%207:54')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And when they heard these things they were cut to the heart.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There are two ways of being cut to the heart. Here they gnashed their teeth and cast him out of the city and stoned him. On the day of Pentecost, when they were cut or pricked at the heart they cried out, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%202:37')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;What shall we do?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> They took the opposite way. The devil, if he can have his way, will cause you to commit murder. If Jesus has His way, you will repent. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%207:55')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> O, this being full of the Holy Ghost! How much it means. I was riding for sixty miles one summer day and as I looked up in the heavens I had an open vision of Jesus all the way. It takes the Holy Ghost to give this. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Stephen cried out, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%207:60')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As he was full of the Spirit he was full of love, and he manifested the very same compassion for his enemies that Jesus did at Calvary. This being filled with the Holy Ghost means much in every way. It means constant filling, quickening, and a new life continually. Oh, it&#39;s lovely! We have a wonderful gospel and a great Saviour! If you will but be filled with the Holy Ghost you will have a constant spring within, yea, as your faith centers in the Lord Jesus, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%207:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">from within you shall flow rivers of living water.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read Ephesians 3 carefully. This is a lovely chapter on Paul&rsquo;s mission to the Gentiles. God has grafted us (Gentiles) in. In other ages it was not made known that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, whereof he was made a minister by the effectual working of His power. This power in Paul wrought a very effectual work; it worked in him to such effect that he said he was the least of all saints; that to him was given this grace of mystery and revelation. It came forth as a living reality of a living substance indwelling him. &ldquo;To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in the heavenly places might be known through the Church the manifold wisdom of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Wisdom.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This wisdom of God is only revealed in the depths of humiliation where the Holy Ghost has full charge. There alone it is that the vision comes to all His saints. We are now in the process of revelation. You must let the Holy Ghost have His perfect office. A new order of breathing. First a calculation of the mind&mdash;&ldquo;I can go no further, I give myself to a new order, the manifold wisdom of God in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him.&rdquo; Boldness brings us into a place of access, confidence, laying hold, taking all off the table and making it ours. The Holy Ghost in the human body unfolding the mystery that we might know and have the revelation according to the will of God. The flesh brought to a place of nonexistence, that in the life of this man should come out the mighty power of God to usward. Paul can get no further. He says&mdash;&ldquo;I bow my knees unto the Father.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Prayer.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jude also speaks of praying in the Holy Ghost. There is no natural line of thought here, not one point in particular upon which the mind can rest, but that which is predicted from the throne of glory, then the tongue, then all the divine attributes are displayed above all, exceedingly above all, that the glory of God may be revealed in the face of Jesus. Ye are His workmanship, created for His glory. God cannot display the greater glory except through those co-equal in the glory. The Holy Ghost is the ideal and brings out the very essence of heaven through the human soul. Oh, the need of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost (Paul was held in the Spirit: may it be so in our case)&mdash;there is no difference; he was willing for all things, bound in the spirit&mdash;here we have the greatest liberty that can come to humanity, all the liberty of heaven open, the family in heaven and earth. I love that thought that the veil is so thin that the tie is closer than ever, Christ with them; they with us. One is on earth; what a loftiness, a reverence, a holiness! A wonderful thing is this wedlock and fellowship in the spirit&mdash;now an infinite mind of fulfilment and glory. &ldquo;Are they not all ministering spirits?&rdquo; Who can help us as those tried with us? As the body is so fitly framed together by the effectual working of His power, we are all one, nothing separates us, but we </span><span class="cs53F207AF">LOOK FOR THE APPEARING OF</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> J</span><span class="cs53F207AF">ESUS</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. He is there in the glory, they are with Him. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, so shall we ever be with the Lord. We can only pray as the Holy Ghost gives utterance. Ver. 16: Here the Holy Ghost gives the highest principles through this prayer that the purposes of salvation are a continuous working and an increasing power all the time. The day that is coming will declare all things. Strengthened by the Spirit according to the riches of His glory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Glory.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What is the Glory? All the glory that ever comes is from Him. You have the glory in the measure that you have the Son of Glory in you. If you are filled with Jesus, you are filled with the glory. When we have the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, there is nothing to hinder the Holy Ghost having the control of the whole being. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. Faith is the production of all things. The Holy Ghost indwelling and enlarging until the whole body is filled with Christ, and we are coming there in a very remarkable way. Did the Holy Ghost ever utter a prayer that no power could answer? In John 17:21 Jesus says &ldquo;That they all may be one as Thou Father art in Me and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us.&rdquo; What works in us through being one with Him, rooted and grounded? Perfect love, and perfect love has justice wrapped up in it, and the day is coming when </span><span class="cs53F207AF">THE SAINTS WILL SAY</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> &ldquo;A</span><span class="cs53F207AF">MEN</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; to the judgments of God. Justice will do it. All the wood, hay and stubble must be destroyed, but, rooted and grounded in the Word, I am a production of what God is forming and I can stay the gates of Hell and laugh in the face of calamity and say, &ldquo;All things work together for good to them that love God;&rdquo; rooted and grounded in love. So-and-so may leave me, but if I am grounded, it is for my good and nothing can be against me but myself. We live for the glory of God. The Lord, it is He that establisheth, strengtheneth and upholdeth, making strong that which is weak and enabling them to stand in the difficulty, and in the day of battle. God is with thee to do far exceeding above all you can ask or think. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">Faith.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Are we children of circumstances, or children of faith? If we are on natural lines, we are troubled at the wind blowing, as it blows it whispers fearfulness; but if you are rooted and grounded you can stand the tests, and it is only then that you prove what is the breadth and length and depth and height, and know the love of Christ. It is an addition sum to meet every missionary&rsquo;s needs, to display God&rsquo;s power, enlarging that which needs to be quickened. Breadth: the whole man seeing God is sufficient in every state. The length of things. God is in everything. Oh, the depths! But God is in the depths! The heights! God is always lifting you, and the revelation of the mind in that verse is enough for any in any circumstances to triumph, able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask or think, not according to the mind of Paul but according to the revelation of the Spirit. Filled unto all the fulness of God. The natural capacity when filled with simplicity has within it an enlargement of itself, but this fulness is an ideal power of God in the human soul; every part of you is enlarged by the Spirit. God is there instead of you to make you full, and you are full as your faith reaches out to the measure. &ldquo;Filled unto all the fulness of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The power of the Lord was present to heal, fulness of power pressed out of them unto others. In Acts 1 we see a power of the Holy Ghost filling Jesus. He became lighter and lighter until H</span><span class="cs53F207AF">E WAS LIFTED BACK</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> to where He was before, in the presence of God. Jesus Christ manifest in the flesh, the power of God in human form. The fulness of the Godhead bodily manifested in Jesus. John, says He was the Light of Life, increasing in fulness until wafted away entirely, in substance the fulness of God. Exceedingly abundantly above all we can ask or think. How can it be fulfilled in me, you say? It is filled there in the glory! But it&rsquo;s a tremendous thing! God will have to do something! Beloved, it is not according to your mind at all, but according to the mind of God, according to the revelation of the Spirit. Above all you could ask or think! The Blood has been poured out. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs12506F1C">The Holy Ghost has been sent down.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Verily, we are not worthy, but He is worthy! It&rsquo;s above all you can ask! How can it be possible? God puts it in your heart! He can do it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have been hearing much about war loan and interest, but if vou will follow on, God will add and enlarge and enlarge and lift you all the time, adding compound interest. Five per cent! No! a thousand per cent, a million per cent! If thou wilt, if holiness is the purpose of your heart, it shall be, for God </span><span class="cs53F207AF">IS</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> in His place. WiII you be in the plan according to the power that worketh, working in you. Whatever you are at any time, it will be by His effectual power, lifting, controlling, carrying you in constant rest and peace; it is according to the Power that worketh in you. Unto Him be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus through all ages, world without end. Amen. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Manningham, Bradford, Nov. 1908. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My Dear Brother, </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After twelve months of this blessed fullness I desire to witness to the truth of the anointing with power for service. There is an affinity and unity with the blessed Holy Spirit as never before, and a fearlessness, or a clothing with a consciousness that the source is His, and the results are His, and I am one channel only. It is now, without fear, a vessel unto honor for the Master&#39;s sake. Then there is the presence of the Holy Spirit abiding&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%202:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the anointing received abideth</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&mdash;as it is an unction from the Holy One, thus <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%204:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">renewing the spirit of our mind.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Thinking about the pure and holy things, the Epistle to the Romans being fulfilled. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Conformed to the image of His Son,&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> growing up into Him our living Head. First it is power with God and then it is power with man. First stripped, then the clothing from above. No longer seeking our own but His. Responsibilities and results are His. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The yoke is on His shoulder; He sees to thee, O son of man. Can the Acts of the Apostles be renewed? Lord, Thou knowest. The given faith stands and says: Let it be so an the workings are mighty. Our position is to see that we are clothed with the Spirit. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%208:26-28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The Spirit led Philip to the wilderness, and the Eunuch was already waiting.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%208:5-8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Samaria also was ready.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The secret was that Philip was in the power of the Spirit. He increases when we decrease; </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">we</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> cannot do both and be fruitful. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">All</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> the glory must be Christ&#39;s, and then it will be the same as of old&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('judg%207:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;the sword of the Lord and Gideon.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Speaking with tongues is an external evidence that God has done something, and it is always done when the motives are pure and the life cleansed. The blood meets the poor, needy soul and it enters through the gate into the city and begins to share in divine privileges of power, of lifting burdens, of weeping with discouraged souls, of bringing health to sick and weary ones, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%204:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;as He is so are we.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As God dwelt in Him and did the work, now He dwells in us and teaches us by the Holy Spirit how to do the work and it is done. We are daily witnessing to the work being done. Demons are cast out, the sick are healed, and sinners turn to Jesus. Saints are becoming more saintly. Speaking with &quot;tongues&quot; brings me into a deeper sense of His abiding presence; it much resembles the Shekinah glory over the Ark. The divine glory is right over me day by day. The messages are with power; never lacking power and zeal. Of a truth God is with us. I admit that the price to pay is much, and you may have to lose as good friends as Elijah, but, praise God, there is a mantle of power just to meet your need. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">David speaks <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2023:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">in the 23rd Psalm of the valley of the shadow of death.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was a day in the life of David of separation. Notice that as soon as he got there <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2023:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the table was spread.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Brothers, it will be a destruction of the flesh&mdash;a real death&mdash;but God has another food, another robe for you, another power, another glorious victory, but it is through the valley, where God spreads the table. He knows best what the spirit life requires, so He spreads the table. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We are getting much blessing, remarkable evidence, and discernment. Faith and charity are right in this work. The mighty things will soon occur&mdash;interpretations are getting much clearer. The power of the Holy Ghost is making the dry bones feel the need. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Everywhere we go with this truth in the power of the spirit we have to deal with sin in believers. The filthy acts of the self-life have to be dealt with, and men cannot always stand the purging. I have never heard or seen God baptizing an unclean or fleshly life. There is only one life, only one way, only one thing. Reality can move the holy wind, and it is crying out for a clean heart. As the blood is applied through separation and holy surrender, the fire falls, the spirit&#39;s clothing comes on to a pure spirit. What I am, what I have been, must be lost in Him. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Boddy,* </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After seven full days of the Glorious Presence of the Glory of God resting upon me, I send you this testimony for the Glory of God. For three months I have been exercised about the full Pentecost. I had the clear witness of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit 14 years ago last July, and this brought a marvelous manifestation of God in special gifts to sick ones, and a constant living and seeking to bring others to Jesus. But from time to time when reading the Acts of the Apostles I always saw that the signs were not following as I am led to believe ought to be after a real Pentecost, according to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%2016')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Mark 16.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The desire more and more increased in my very inner soul, giving me a holy breathing cry after this clear manifestation. I have visited meetings and London, and Sunderland, and other places, but always knew they were not seeking Pentecosts. There seemed a great deal of letter, but very little of the spirit that would give the hungry and needy a Baptism of Fire such as would burn up distinctions and officiousness and appearance of Pride and evidences of social standing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Today I am actually living in the Acts of the Apostles&#39; time, I am speaking with new tongues, the Holy Fire of God&#39;s Presence fills me till my pen moves to the glory of God, and my whole being is filled with the presence of the Holy Ghost. Almost am I led to believe that 20 years is not too long to wait for the Holy Anointing of God the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">On Friday, 25th, we had a special meeting at the Mission Room, Bowland Street, Bradford, and after waiting about two hours the Presence of God came in a wonderful way and gave me a move as at the beginning. I perfectly well understood the glow and Holy Presence. This was felt by others also. On Saturday, I and a friend went on to Sunderland to wait for Pentecost at All Saints&#39;, at Mr. Boddy&#39;s Church. We had heard much about this blessed work and were encouraged, but after arriving at Sunderland found the enemy very busy discouraging believers; this did not disturb me, because I had gone with an open mind and prayed much to be clearly convinced if there was anything there that did not reveal the Glory of God that I would at once have cleared out and protested against it, but God was with me there. But I found the full Presence and Power to restore believers and to heal the sick. My experience is that this does not take place in some kinds of meetings; the reason is that, to a great measure, they do not believe the full Gospel, and it is nothing new to me to find great leaders against the tongues, and I find that, even in these times, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%203:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;they cannot enter in because of their unbelief.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I praise God for Pentecost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">On Sunday morning, Oct. 26th, after waiting much on God, I went to the Salvation Army Meeting, Roker Avenue. God bless the Army. They at once gave me a welcome, and already realizing His Presence in my body I longed for communion, and when after praying the Glory of God covered me. I was conscious at the same time of much the experience I believe <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('dan%2010')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Daniel had in his 10th chapter.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> After this I regained strength to kneel, and continued in this Holy Glow of God all the day still realizing a mightier work to follow. I went to All Saints&#39;, to the Communion Service, and after this was led on to wait in the Spirit, many things taking place in the waiting-meetings that continued to bring me to a hungry feeling for Holy Righteousness. At about 11 a.m., Tuesday morning, at All Saints&#39; Vicarage, I asked a sister to help me to the witness of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. She laid hands on me in the presence of a brother. The fire fell and burned in me till the Holy Spirit clearly revealed absolute purity before God. At this point she was called out of the room, and during her absence a marvelous revelation took place; my body became full of light and Holy Presence, and in the revelation I saw an empty Cross and at the same time the Jesus I loved and adored crowned in the Glory in a Reigning Position. The glorious remembrance of these moments is beyond my expression to give&mdash;when I could not find words to express, then an irresistible Power filled me and moved my being till I found to my glorious astonishment I was speaking in other tongues clearly. After this a burning love for everybody filled my soul. I am overjoyed in giving my testimony, praying for those that fight this truth, but I am clearly given to understand that I must come out of every unbelieving element. I am already witness of signs following. Praise Him. </span></p><p class="cs4170B364"><span class="cs5F6B85C7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs53F207AF">*The Boddys were the pastors of All Saints&#39; Church and publishers of </span><span class="cs419B124">Confidence.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Bowland Street Mission, Bradford, has had many days of God&#39;s right hand, and has won many trophies of the Cross and seen much of the working of the mighty hands of God, but none of the past days resemble those of the present. Thank God, we are in the midst of that which might be called the soul&#39;s awakening. Those that were lifeless and helpless (having to be carried), are now full of life and prepared to carry others </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">from the cold, indifferent, formal life to be red-hot, spirit-filled Saints, speaking and singing in Tongues.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> They have clear witnessing power and discernment, and can be counted upon for any real, active, vigilant work. They are full of love and kindness, desiring, longing, earnestly seeking, and beseeching God to open the Windows of Heaven and pour out a real Revival Power to awaken and shake England and the World. We fully believe we are in the last days, and before the Lord comes we trust to see the mightiest Revival the world has ever seen or witnessed. We have seen demons cast out, and the very devil of disease rebuked, and the continual power and blessing fully resembling <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mar%2016:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Mark 16:17.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> All glory be to God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One of the clear proofs that Pentecost with Tongues is of God is that all the Scribes and Pharisees of the present day condemn it. I have seen many receive the Gift of Tongues and the Baptism of Power, but never among them were there any critics or a fleshly or proud man or woman. The clean and impure cannot dwell together. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%206:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Ye cannot have God and Mammon.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Pentecost with Tongues is a Holy work, and comes upon Holy people for a Holy purpose, being the beginning of greater days of manifestations. We shall see greater things than Jesus did as we abide in the Vine. The Baptism of the Holy Ghost with Signs is the fulfillment of promise to those that wait. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I hold much fellowship with those that speak and sing with new Tongues. All have one story to tell, viz., that the blessing and joy is beyond describing. Why stop at the barren field of justification, when there are waters of God&#39;s Love to swim in? Why live in the experience of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%207')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Romans 7</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, when there is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%209')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Romans 9</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> full of life in the Spirit without condemnation? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Ephesians 3:20.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;My soul is filled with boundless love<br/>Whilst gazing on the precious blood,<br/>I catch the rays of Jesus&#39; face<br/>Transfixed in me, the Throne of Grace.<br/>Wonders beyond the human mind<br/>Rushing into me, a Life Divine;<br/>I feel the Power of the Holy Dove,<br/>And speak in &#39;Tongues&#39; of things above.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, March 19, 1923.</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs5BBBBA19">The remarkable healings herein cited occurred under the ministry of Bro. Smith Wigglesworth of Bradford, England, in Switzerland recently, who says:</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Everything I have seen in Switzerland has taken me down in brokenness before God. At Bern I have stood in a place which has been packed with people, and I have had to get a cleansing by weeping as I have seen the people and then God gave us victory. Hundreds have been saved by the power of God. At Neuch&acirc;tel God worked marvelously and the devil worked in between, but God is greater than all. At my second visit to Neuch&acirc;tel the largest theater was hired and it was packed, and God moved upon the people, and on an average 100 souls were saved each night, and many healed through God&#39;s touch, yet many would not have Pentecostal teaching, and one man actually had meetings in opposition at places, but who is the man who dares to put his hand on the child of God? This man also had prayer meetings to try to prevent people from going to the meetings, but they all turned to confusion. People came to be ministered unto. In all places it has been the same. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one of the places a policeman was sent to ascertain what was going on and it resulted in his coming under the power of God, and he commenced to seek for the healing of his own body. Some of the opposers stated that the oil botlle I used was electrically charged and that I kept putting it into my pocket to get it recharged. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Ghost is preparing us for some wonderful event. I feel a burning in my bones. I preached one night on <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%203')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Ephesians 3</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> for 2&frac12; hours, and so powerful was the Word that the people did not seem inclined to move. I preached and prayed with the sick until 11:30 P.M. Four people brought a man who was paralyzed and blind; the power of God fell upon him and us and he now walks and sees and is praising God. I have not been to one meeting where the power of God has not been upon us. I say this to His glory. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In French Switzerland, where Pentecost was not known, seven different meeting places have been opened, and the work is prospering. At Bern there is a band of praying people. Truly we have seen wonderful things. A girl was brought to me sitting in a chair. I would not minister at first, but told her she must wait and hear the Word of God. Her mother who had come with her was greatly moved as she listened to God&#39;s Word being expounded. I then laid hands on the girl, who had never walked. The power of God worked and she now walks. Another case, where a man had had a cancer taken out of his neck, after which he could no longer eat, not being able to swallow. He told me he could not even swallow the juice of a cherry. He had a pipe inserted in his neck so that food could be poured through it into his stomach. I said to him, &quot;You will eat tonight.&quot; I prayed with him. He came the next day. I saw that the color had come back into his face, and he told me he had been eating, and could swallow comfortably. He had looked for the hole where the pipe had been inserted but could not find it. God had completely healed him. He was well known; he was a tea grower and people said he had come to life again. When the Son of God touches a man he does come to life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has put His hand upon this work in Switzerland. Every afternoon people were baptized in the Holy Ghost, brought down into the dust for the power of God lays a man low. In Lausanne the power was mighty, also at Vevey and Geneva, and God has raised up Spirit-filled leaders in these towns. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man came to me suffering from diabetes. The power of God was upon me and I realized that God was working upon him. I said, &quot;God has healed you.&quot; His address was taken and the case was followed up. He went to the doctor to be examined because he knew he was healed and asked him to examine him. He did so and stated that he was unable to find any trace of the disease whatever. He asked the doctor to give him a certificate which he did and I saw it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A young woman was dying of consumption, and her doctor had given her up. I laid hands on her in the name of Jesus and she knew that the disease had passed away. This girl went to the doctor, who examined her and said, &quot;Whatever has taken place, you haye no consumption now.&quot; She replied, &quot;Doctor I have been prayed over; can I tell the people I am healed?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yes; and that I could not heal you.&quot; &quot;If I am to tell will you put it in black and white?&quot; And he gave her a certificate which I saw. God had healed her. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man was brought into one of the meetings in a wheelchair. He could not walk except by the aid of two sticks, and even then his locomotion was very slow. I saw him in that helpless condition, and told him about Jesus. Oh, that wonderful name! Glory to God! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%201:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;They shall call His name Jesus.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I placed my hands upon his head and said, &quot;In the name of Jesus thou art made whole.&quot; This helpless man cried out, &quot;It is done, it is done. Glory to God, it is done!&quot; And he walked out of the building perfectly healed. The man who brought him in the wheelchair and the children said that father so-and-so is walking. Praise the Lord <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2013:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He is the same yesterday, today and forever.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord made me a great blessing at Zurich last time, and I have promised to be there again on the 30th of October. Seven new places are glorifying God in tongues. I ministered last Sunday in a great theater which was filled, and there was a crying out to God for healing, and when they were healed they shouted for joy. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

(Published 1924.)</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">2 Corinthians 3.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We are told that we are to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%206:1-2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">leave the first principles of the doctrine of Christ and go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and the doctrine of baptisms</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and the other first principles (<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%206')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Hebrews 6</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">). What would you think of a builder who was everlastingly pulling down his house and putting in fresh foundations? Never look back if you want the power of God in your life. You will find out that in the measure you have allowed yourself to look back you have missed that which God had for you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Ghost shows us that we must never look back to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%208:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the law of sin and death</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> from which we have been delivered. God has brought us into a new order of things, a life of love and liberty in Christ Jesus that is beyond all human comprehension. Many are brought into this new life through the power of the Spirit of God, and then, like the Galatians, who ran well at the beginning, they try to perfect themselves on the lines of legalism. They go back from the life in the Spirit to a life on natural lines. God is not pleased with this, for He has no place for the man who has lost the vision. The only thing to do is to repent. Don&#39;t try to cover up anything. If you have been tripped up on any line, confess it out, and then look to God to bring you to a place of stability of faith where your whole walk will be in the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We all ought to have a clear conviction that salvation is of the Lord. It is more than a human order of things. If the enemy can move you from a place of faith, he can get you outside the plan of God. The moment a man falls into sin, divine life ceases to grow, and his life becomes one of helplessness. But this is not God&#39;s thought for any of His children. Read the third chapter of John&#39;s first epistle and take your place as a son of God. Take the place of knowing that you are a son of God, and remember that, as your hope is set in Christ it should have a purifying effect on your life. The Holy Spirit says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%203:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin: for His seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">born of God.</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is life and power in the seed of the Word that is implanted within. God is in that &quot;cannot,&quot; and there is more power in that word of His than in any human objections. God&#39;s thought for every one of us is that we shall reign in life by Jesus Christ. You must come to see how wonderful you are in God and how helpless you are in yourself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God declared Himself more mighty than every opposing power when <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rev%2012:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He cast out the powers of darkness from heaven.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I want you to know that the same power that cast Satan out of heaven dwells in every man that is born of God. If you would but realize this, you would reign in life. When you see people laid out under an evil power, when you see the powers of evil manifesting themselves, always put the question, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%204:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Did Jesus come in the flesh?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I have never seen an evil power answer in the affirmative. When you know you have an evil spirit to deal with you have power to cast it out. Believe it and act on it, for <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1joh%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world&quot; (1 John 4.4).</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God means you to be in a place of overcoming, and has put a force within you whereby you may defeat the devil. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Temptations will come to all. If you are not worth tempting you are not worth powder and shot. Job said: <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('job%2023:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;When He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> In every temptation that comes, the Lord lets you be tempted up to the very hilt, but will never allow you to be defeated if you walk in obedience; for right in the midst of the temptation He will always <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2010:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;make a way of escape.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
							<span class="csC18E74A5">[At this point in the service someone (possibly Wigglesworth) spoke in prophetic tongues. The interpretation was: &quot;God comes forth and with His power sweeps away the refuge of lies and all the powers of darkness, and causes you always to triumph in Christ Jesus. The Lord loveth His saints and covers them with His almighty wings.&quot;]</span></h5>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">May God help us to see it. We cannot be to the praise of His glory until we are ready for trials, and are able to triumph in them. We can not get away from the fact that sin came in by nature, but God comes into our nature and puts it into the place of death, that the Spirit of God may come into the temple in all His power and liberty, that right here in this present evil world Satan may be dethroned by the believer. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Satan is always endeavoring to bring the saints of God into disrepute, bringing against them railing accusations, but the Holy Ghost never comes with condemnation. He always reveals the blood of Christ. He always brings us help. The <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('joh%2015:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Lord Jesus referred to Him as the Comforter who would come.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He is always on hand to help in the seasons of trial and test. The Holy Ghost is the lifting power of the church of Christ. And Paul tells us that we <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, ... written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Holy Ghost begins in the heart, right in the depths of human affections. He brings into the heart the riches of the revelation of Christ, implanting a purity and holiness there, so that out of its depths, praises well up continually. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Holy Ghost will make us epistles of Christ, ever telling out that Jesus our Lord is our Redeemer and God has never put away that revelation. And because of the perfect atonement of that slain Lamb, there is salvation, healing and deliverance for all. Some people think that they have only to be cleansed once, but as we walk in the light the blood of Jesus Christ is ever cleansing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The very life of Christ has been put within us, and is moving within us&mdash;a perfect life. May the Lord help us to see the power of this life. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2090:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The years of a man&#39;s life are threescore years and ten,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and so in the natural order of things, my life will be finished in seven years, but I have begun a new life that will never end. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2090:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;From everlasting to everlasting Thou art God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is the life I have come into, and there is no end to this life. In me is working a power that is stronger than every power; Christ, the power of God, formed within me. I can see why we need to be clothed upon from above, for the life within me is a thousand times bigger than I am outside. There must be a tremendous expansion. I see, and cannot help seeing, that this thing cannot be understood on natural lines; no natural reason can comprehend the divine plan. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;We are not sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you go back, you miss the plan. We leave the old order of things. We can never have confidence in the flesh, we cannot touch that. We are in a new order, a spiritual order. It is a new life of absolute faith in the sufficiency of our God in everything that pertains to our salvation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You could never come into this place and be a Seventh-day Adventist.* The law has no place in you. You are set free from everything. At the same time, like Paul, you are <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%2020:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;bound in the Spirit&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> so that you would not do anything to grieve the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul further tells us that He has made us <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is one thing to read this, and another to have the revelation of it and to see the spiritual force of it. Any man can live in the letter and become dry and wordy, limited in knowledge of spiritual verities, and spend his time everlastingly in splitting hairs; but as soon as he touches the realm of the Spirit, all the dryness goes, all the spirit of criticism leaves. There can be no divisions in a life in the Spirit. The Spirit of God brings such pliability and such love! There is no love like the love in the Spirit. It is a pure, a holy, a divine love that is shed in our hearts by the Spirit. It loves to serve and to honor the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I can never estimate what the Baptism of the Holy Ghost has been to me these past fifteen years. It seems that every year has had three years packed into it, so that I have had forty-five years of happy service since 1907. And it is getting better all the time. It is a luxury to be filled with the Spirit, and at the same time it is a divine command for us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%205:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">not to be filled with wine wherein is excess, but to be filled with the Spirit.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> No Pentecostal person ought to get out of bed without being lost in the Spirit and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> No one should come into the door of an assembly without speaking in tongues or having a psalm, or a note of praise. We emphasize that at the incoming of the Spirit He should so fill us that the last member in the body is yielded to Him, and that no one is baptized in the Spirit without speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance; and I maintain that, with a constant filling, you will speak in tongues morning, noon and night. As you live in the Spirit, when you walk down the steps of the house where you live, the devil will have to go before you. You will be more than a conqueror over the devil. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I see everything a failure except that which is done in the Spirit. But as you live in the Spirit, you move, act, eat. drink, and do everything to the glory of God. Our message is always this, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('eph%205:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Be filled with the Spirit.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is God&#39;s place for you, and it is as far above the natural life as the heavens are above the earth. Yield yourselves for God to fill. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Moses had a tremendous trial with the people. They were always in trouble. But as he went up into the mount, and God unfolded to him the ten commandments, the glory fell. He rejoiced to bring those two tables of stone down from the mount, and his very countenance shone with the glory. He was bringing to Israel that which, if obeyed, would bring life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I think of my Lord coming from heaven. I think all heaven was moved by the sight. The law of the letter was brought by Moses and it was made glorious, but all its glory was dimmed before the excelling glory which Jesus brought to us in the Spirit of life. The glory of Sinai paled before the glory of Pentecost. Those tables of stone with their, &quot;Thou shalt not, thou shalt not,&quot; are done away; for they never brought life to anyone, and the Lord has brought in a new covenant, putting His law in our minds and writing it in our hearts, this new law of the Spirit of life. As the Holy Ghost comes in, He fills us with such love and liberty, and we shout for joy these words of this 11th verse, &quot;Done away! Done away!&quot; Henceforth there is a new cry in our hearts, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2040:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I delight to do Thy Will, O God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He taketh away the first, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that He might establish the second, this ministration of righteousness, this life in the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You ask, &quot;Does a man who is filled with the Spirit cease to keep the commandments?&quot; I simply repeat what the Spirit of God has told us here, that this ministration of death, written and engraven in stones (and you know that the ten commandments were written on stones), is &quot;</span><span class="cs53F207AF">DONE AWAY</span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&quot; The man who becomes a living epistle of Christ, written with the Spirit of the living God, has ceased to be an adulterer, or a murderer or a covetous man; the will of God is his delight. I love to do the will of God, there is no irksomeness to it, it is no trial to pray, no trouble to read the Word of God, it is not a hard thing to go to the place of worship. With the psalmist you say. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%20122:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">How does this new life work out? The thing works out because <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phi%202:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God works in you to will and to do of His own good pleasure (Philippians 2.13).</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is a great difference between a pump and a spring. The law is a pump, the Baptism is a spring. The old pump gets out of order, the parts perish, and the well runs dry. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The letter killeth.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But the spring is ever bubbling up and there is a ceaseless flow direct from the Throne of God. There is life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is written of Christ, &quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2045:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And in this new life in the Spirit, in this new covenant life, you love the things that are right and pure and holy, and shudder at all things that are wrong. Jesus was able to say, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('joh%2014:30')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me,&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and the moment we are filled with the Spirit of God we are brought into like wonderful condition, and, as we continue to be filled with the Spirit, the enemy cannot have an inch of territory in us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you not believe that you can be so filled with the Spirit that a man who is not living right can be judged and convicted by your presence? As we go on in the life of the Spirit, it will be said of us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2015:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;in whose eyes a vile person will be contemned&quot; (Psalm 15.4).</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus lived there and moved in this realm, and His life was a constant reproof to the wickedness around. But He was the Son of God, you say. God, through Him, has brought us into the place of sonship, and I believe that if He has a chance with the material, the Holy Ghost can make something of us, and bring us to the same place. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I don&#39;t want to boast. If I glory in anything it is only in the Lord who has been so gracious to me. But I remember one time stepping out of a railroad carriage to wash my hands. I had a season of prayer, and the Lord just filled me to overflowing with His love. I was going to a convention in Ireland, and I could not get there fast enough. As I returned, I believe that the Spirit of the Lord was so heavily upon me that my face must have shone. (No man can tell himself when the Spirit transforms his very countenance.) There were two clerical men sitting together, and as I got into the carriage again, one of them cried out, &quot;You convince me of sin.&quot; Within three minutes every one in the carriage was crying to God for salvation. This thing has happened many times in my life. It is this ministration of the Spirit that Paul speaks of, this filling of the Spirit, that will make your life effective, so that even the people in the stores where you trade will want to leave your presence because they are brought under conviction. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We must move from everything of the letter. All that we do must be done under the anointing of the Spirit. The trouble has been that we as Pentecostal people have been living in the letter. Believe what the Holy Spirit says through Paul&mdash;that all this ministration of condemnation that has hindered your liberty in Christ is done away. The law is </span><span class="cs53F207AF">DONE AWAY</span><span class="cs78AB3212">! As far as you are concerned, all that old order of things is forever done away, and the Spirit of God has brought in a new life of purity and love. The Holy Ghost takes it for granted that you are finished with all the things of the old life when you become a new creation in Christ. In the life in the Spirit, the old allurements have lost their power. The devil will meet you at every turn, but the Spirit of God will always lift up a standard against him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">O, if God had His way, we would be like torches, purifying the very atmosphere wherever we go, moving back the forces of wickedness. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
							<span class="csC18E74A5">[Again, prophetic tongues. The interpretation was: &quot;The Lord is that Spirit. He moves in your heart. He shows you that the power within you is mightier than all the powers of darkness.&quot;]</span></h5>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Done </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">away!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What do I mean? Will you be disloyal? You will be more than loyal. Will you grumble when you are treated badly? No, you will turn the other cheek. This is what you will always do when God lives in you. Leave yourselves in God&#39;s hands. Enter into rest. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%204:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;He that is entered into His rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from His&quot; (Hebrews 4).</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> O this is a lovely rest! The whole life is a Sabbath. This is the only life that can glorify God. It is a life of joy, and every day is a day of heaven on earth. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a continued transformation in this life. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%203:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Beholding the Lord and His glory, we are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is a continued unveiling, a constant revelation, a repeated clothing upon from above. I want you to promise God never to look back, never to go back to that which the Spirit has said is &quot;done away.&quot; I made this promise to the Lord that I would never allow myself to doubt His Word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is one thing about a baby, it takes all that comes to it. A prudent man lets his reason cheat him out of God&#39;s best. But a baby takes all that its mother brings, and tries to swallow the bottle and all. The baby can&#39;t walk. but the mother carries it, the baby cannot dress itself, but the mother dresses it. The baby can&#39;t even talk. So in the life of the Spirit, God undertakes to do what we cannot do. We are carried along by Him, He clothes us, and He gives us atterance. Would that we all had the simplicity of the babes. </span></p><p class="cs4170B364"><span class="cs5F6B85C7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs53F207AF">*The Adventists that Wigglesworth was familiar with tended to be very legalistic.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

(Published 1924.)</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:1-20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Acts 5.1-20.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Notice this expression that the Lord gives of the Gospel message&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;the words of this life.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is the most wonderful life possible&mdash;the life of faith in the Son of God. This is the life where God is all the time. He is round about and He is within. It is the life of many revelations and of many manifestations of God&#39;s Holy Spirit, a life in which the Lord is continually seen, known, felt and heard. It is a life without death, for <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%203:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;we have passed from death unto life.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The very life of God has come within us. Where that life is within in its fullness, disease cannot exist. It would take me a month to tell out what there is in this wonderful life. Everyone can go in and possess and be possessed by this life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is possible for you to be within the vicinity of this life and yet miss it. It is possible for you to be in a place where God is pouring out His Spirit and yet miss the blessing that God is so willing to bestow. It all comes through shortness of revelation and through a misunderstanding of the infinite grace of God, and of the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%205:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;God of all grace,&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> who is willing to give to all who will reach out the hand of faith. This life that He freely bestows is a gift. Some think they have to earn it and they miss the whole thing. Oh, for a simple faith to receive all that God so lavishly offers. You can never be ordinary from the day you receive this life from above. You become extraordinary, filled with the extraordinary power of our extraordinary God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Ananias and Sapphira were in this thing and yet they missed it. They thought that possibly the thing might fail. So they wanted to have a reserve for themselves in case it did turn out to be a failure. They were in the wonderful revival that God gave to the early church and yet they missed it. There are many people like them today who make vows to God in times of a great crisis in their lives. But they fail to keep their vows and in the end they become spiritually bankrupt. Blessed is the man who will swear to his own hurt and change not, who keeps the vow he has made to God, who is willing to lay his all at God&#39;s feet. The man who does this never becomes a lean soul. God has promised to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2058:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;make fat his bones.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is no dry place for such a man; he is always fat and flourishing, and he becomes stronger and stronger. It pays to trust God with all and to make no reservation. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I wish I could make you see how great a God we have and how small a devil. Ananias and Sapphira were really doubting God and were questioning whether this work that He had begun would go through. They wanted to get some glory for selling their property, but because of their lack of faith they kept back part of the price in reserve in case the work of God should fail. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many are doubting whether this Pentecostal revival will go through. Do you think this Pentecostal work will stop? Never. For fifteen years I have been in constant revival and I am sure that it will never stop. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When John Stephenson made his first engine he took his sister Mary to see it. She looked at it and said to her brother; &quot;John, it&#39;ll never go.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He said to her, &quot;Get in, Mary.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She said again, &quot;It&#39;ll never go.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He said to her, &quot;We&#39;ll see, you get in.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Mary at last got in&mdash;the whistle blew, there was a puff and a rattle, and the engine started off. Then Mary cried out, &quot;John, it&#39;ll never stop! It&#39;ll never stop!!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">People are looking on at this Pentecostal revival and they are very critical and they are saying, &quot;It&#39;ll never go;&quot; but when they are induced to come into the work, they one and all say, &quot;It&#39;ll never stop.&quot; This revival of God is sweeping on and on and there is no stopping the current of life, of love, of inspiration, and of power. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
							<span class="csC18E74A5">[At this point in the service someone (possibly Wigglesworth) spoke in prophetic tongues. The interpretation was: &quot;It is the living Word who has brought this. It is the Lamb in the midst, the same yesterday, today and forever.&quot;]</span></h5>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has brought unlimited resources for every one. Do not doubt. Hear with the ear of faith. God is in the midst. See that it is God who hath set forth that which you see and hear today. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want you to see that in the early church, controlled by the power of the Holy Ghost, it was not possible for a lie to exist. The moment it came into the church, there was instant death. And as the power of the Holy Ghost increases in these days of the Latter Rain, it will be impossible for any man to remain in our midst with a lying spirit. God will purify the church; the Word of God will be in such power in healing and other spiritual manifestations, that great fear will be upon all of those who see the same. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It seems a small thing for Ananias and Sapphira to want to have a little to fall back on, but I want to tell you that you can please God, and you can get things from God only on the line of a living faith. God never fails. God never can fail. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in Bergen, Norway, there came to the meeting a young woman who was employed at the hospital as a nurse. A big cancer had developed on her nose, and the nose was enlarged and had become black and greatly inflamed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She came out for prayer and I said to her, &quot;What is your condition?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She said, &quot;I dare not touch my nose, it gives me so much pain.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to all the people, &quot;I want you to look at this nurse and notice her terrible condition. I believe that our God is merciful and that He is faithful, and that He will bring to naught this condition that the devil has brought about. I am going to curse this disease in the all-powerful name of Jesus. The pain will go. I believe God will give us an exhibition of His grace and I will ask this young woman to come to the meeting tomorrow night and declare what God has done for her.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, the awfulness of sin! Oh, the awfulness of the power of sin! Oh, the awfulness of the consequences of the fall! When I see a cancer I always know it is an evil spirit. I can never believe it is otherwise. The same with tumors. Can this be the work of God? God help me to show you that this is the work of the devil, and to show you the way out. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I do not condemn people that sin. I don&#39;t scold people. I know what is back of the sin. I know that Satan is always going about <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1pet%205:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I always remember the patience and love of the Lord Jesus Christ. When they brought to Him a woman that they had taken in adultery, telling Him that they had caught her in the very act, He simply stooped down and wrote on the ground. Then He quietly said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%208:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I have never seen a man without sin. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%203:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But I read in this blessed Gospel message that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('isa%2053:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God hath laid upon Jesus the iniquity of us all,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and when I see an evil condition I feel that I must stand in my office and rebuke the condition. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I laid my hands on the nose of that suffering nurse and cursed the evil power that was causing her so much distress. The next night the place was packed and the people were jammed together so that it seemed that there was not room for one more to come into that house. How God&#39;s rain fell upon us. How good God is, so full of grace and so full of love. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I saw the nurse in the audience and cried out, &quot;Here&#39;s the woman with the nose.&quot; I asked her to come forward and she came and showed everyone what God had done. He had perfectly healed her. Oh, I tell you He is just the same Jesus. He is just the same today. All things are possible if you dare to trust God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When the power of God came so mightily upon the early church, even in the death of Ananias and Sapphira, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">great fear came upon all the people.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And when we are in the presence of God, when God is working mightily in our midst, there comes a great fear, a reverence, a holiness of life, a purity that fears to displease God. We read that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">no man durst join them,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God added to the church such as should be saved.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I would rather have God add to our Pentecostal church than have all the town join it. God added daily to His own church. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next thing that happened was that people became so assured that God was working that they knew that anything would be possible, and they <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">brought their sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow them.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%205:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Multitudes of sick people and those oppressed with evil spirits were brought to the Apostles and God healed them every one.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I do not believe that it was the shadow of Peter that healed, but the power of God was mightily present and the faith of the people was so aroused that they joined with one heart to believe God. God will always meet people on the line of faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God&#39;s tide is rising all over the earth. I had been preaching at Stavanger in Norway and was very tired and wanted a few hours rest. I went to my next appointment, arriving at about 9:30 in the morning. My first meeting was to be at night. I said to my interpreter, &quot;After we have had comething to eat, let us go down to the fjords.&quot; We spent three or four hours down by the sea and at about 4:30 returned. We found the end of the street, which had a narrow entrance, just filled with autos, wagons, etc., containing invalids and sick people of every kind. I went up to the house and was told that the house was full of sick people. It reminded me of the scene that we read of in the fifth chapter of Acts. I began praying for the people in the street and God began to heal the people. How wonderfully He healed those people who were in the house. We sat down for a lunch and the telephone bell rang and someone at the other end was saying, &quot;What shall we do? The town hall is already full, the police cannot control things.&quot; Beloved, the tide is rising, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%204:35')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the fields are white unto harvest.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God gave us a wonderful revival. I want to be in a mighty revival. I was in one mighty revival in Wales and I long to be in a great revival that will eclipse anything we have ever thought of. I have faith to believe it is coming. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In that little Norwegian town the people were jammed together, and oh, how the power of God fell upon us. A cry went up from everyone, &quot;Isn&#39;t this the revival?&quot; Revival is coming. The breath of the Almighty is coming. The breath of God shows up every defect, and as it comes flowing in like a river everybody will need a fresh anointing, a fresh cleansing of the blood. You can depend upon it that that breath is upon us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one time I was at a meeting in Ireland. There were many sick carried to that meeting and helpless ones were helped there. There were many people in that place who were seeking for the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Some of them had been seeking for years. There were sinners there who were under mighty conviction. There came a moment when the breath of God swept through the meeting. In about ten minutes every sinner in the place was saved. Every one who had been seeking the Holy Spirit was baptized, and every sick one was healed. God is a reality and His power can never fail. As our faith reaches out God will meet us and the same rain will fall. It is the same blood that cleanseth, the same power, the same Holy Ghost, and the same Jesus made real through the power of the Holy Ghost! What would happen if we would believe God? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Right now the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is efficacious to cleanse your heart and bring this life, this wonderful life of God, within you. The blood will make you every whit whole if you dare believe. The healing virtue of the blessed Son of God is right here for you, but so few will touch Him. The Bible is so full of entreaty for you to come and partake and receive the grace, the power, the strength, the righteousness, and the full redemption of Jesus Christ. He never fails to hear when we believe. This same Jesus is in our midst to touch and to loose thee. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one place where I was, a lame man was brought to me who had been in bed for two years, with no hope of recovery. He was brought thirty miles to the meeting and he came up on crutches to be prayed for. His boy was also afflicted in the knees and they had four crutches between the two of them. The man&#39;s face was filled with torture. There is healing virtue in the Lord and He never fails to heal when we believe. In the name of Jesus&mdash;that name so full of virtue&mdash;I put my hand down that leg that was so diseased. The man threw down his crutches and all were astonished as they saw him walking up and down without aid. The little boy called out to his father, &quot;Papa, me; papa, me, me, me!&quot; The little boy who was withered in both knees wanted a like touch. And the same Jesus was there to bring a real deliverance for the little captive. He was completely healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These were legs that were touched. If God will stretch out His mighty power to loose afflicted legs, what mercy will He extend to that soul of yours that must exist forever? Hear the Lord say, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%204:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The Spirit of the Lord </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">is</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captive, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He invites you, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%2011:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Come unto me, all </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">ye</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God is willing in His great mercy to touch thy limbs with His mighty vital power, and if He is willing to do this, how much more anxious is He to deliver thee from the power of Satan and to make thee a child of the King. How much more necessary it is for you to be healed of your soul sickness than of your bodily ailments. And God is willing to give the double cure. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was passing through the city of London one time, and Mr. Mundell, the secretary of the Pentecostal Missionary Union, got to know that I was there. He arranged for me to meet him at a certain place at 3:30 p.m. I was to meet a certain boy whose father and mother lived in the city of Salisbury. They had sent this young man to London to take care of their business. He had been a leader in Sunday school work but he had been betrayed and had fallen. Sin is awful and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%206:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the wages of sin is death.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But there is another side&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%206:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the gift of God is eternal life.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This young man was in great distress; he had contracted a horrible disease and feared to tell anyone. There was nothing but death ahead for him. When the father and mother got to know of his condition they suffered inexpressible grief. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When we got to the house, Brother Mundell suggested that we get down to prayer. I said, &quot;God does not say so, we are not going to pray yet. I want to quote a scripture, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%20107:17-18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&#39;Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted: their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.&#39;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The young man cried out, &quot;I am that fool.&quot; He broke down and told us the story of his fall. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, if men would only repent, and confess their sins, how God would stretch out His hand to heal and to save. The moment that young man repented, a great abscess burst, and God sent virtue into that young man&#39;s life, giving him a mighty deliverance. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God is gracious and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2pet%203:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">not willing that any should perish.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How many are willing to make a clean breast of their sins. I tell you that the moment you do this, God will open heaven. It is an easy thing for Him to save your soul and heal your disease if you will but come and <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2091:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">shelter today in the secret place of the Most High.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He will <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2091:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">satisfy you with long life and show you His salvation.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2016:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In His presence is fullness of joy, at His right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is full redemption for all through the precious blood of the Son of God. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is written of our blessed Lord, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%201:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is the purpose of God that we, as we are indwelt by the Spirit of His Son, should likewise love righteousness and hate iniquity. I see that there is a place for us in Christ Jesus where we are no longer under condemnation but where the heavens are always open to us. I see that God has a realm of divine life opening up to us where there are boundless possibilities, where there is limitless power, where there are untold resources, where we have victory over all the power of the devil. I believe that, as we are filled with the desire to press on into this life of true holiness, desiring only the glory of God, there is nothing that can hinder our true advancement. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Peter commences his second epistle with these words, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2pet%201:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is through faith that we realize that we have a blessed and glorious union with our risen Lord. When He was on earth Jesus told us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2014:11')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I am in the Father and the Father in me.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2014:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And He prayed to His Father, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2017:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">not for His disciples, but for those who should believe on Him through their word,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2017:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Oh what an inheritance is ours when the very nature, the very righteousness, the very power of the Father and the Son are made real in us. This is God&#39;s purpose, and as we by faith lay hold on the purpose we shall be ever conscious of the fact that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1john%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The purpose of all scripture is to move us on to this wonderful and blessed elevation of faith where our constant experience is the manifestation of God&#39;s life and power through us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Peter goes on writing to these who have obtained like precious faith, saying, &lt;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2pet%201:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We can have the multiplication of this grace and peace only as we live in the realm of faith. Abraham attained to the place where <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('jam%202:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">he became a friend of God, on no other line than that of believing God. He believed God and God counted that to him for righteousness.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Righteousness was imputed to him on no other ground than that he believed God. Can this be true of anybody else? Yes. every person in the whole wide world who is saved by faith is blessed with faithful Abraham. The promise which came to him because he believed God was <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2028:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">that in Him all the families of the earth should be blessed.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When we believe God there is no knowing where the blessing of our faith will end. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some are tied up because, when they are prayed for, the thing that they are expecting does not come off the same night. They say they believe, but you can see that they are really in turmoil of unbelief. Abraham believed God. You can hear him saying to Sarah, &quot;Sarah, there is no life in you and there is nothing in me, but God has promised us a son and I believe God.&quot; And that kind of faith is a joy to our Father in heaven. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day I was having a meeting in Bury, in Lancashire, England. A young woman was present who came from a place called Ramsbottom, to be healed of goiter. Before she came she said, &quot;I am going to be healed of this goiter, mother.&quot; After one meeting she came forward and was prayed for. The next meeting she got up and testified that she had been wonderfully healed, and she said, &quot;I shall be so happy to go and tell mother that I have been wonderfully healed.&quot; She went to her home and testified how wonderfully she had been healed, and the next year when we were having the convention she came again. To the natural view it looked as though the goiter was just as big as ever; but that young woman was believing God and she was soon on her feet giving her testimony, and saying, &quot;I was here last year and the Lord wonderfully healed me. I want to tell you that this has been the best year of my life.&quot; She seemed to be greatly blessed in that meeting and she went home to testify more strongly than ever that the Lord had healed her. She believed God. The third year she was at the meeting again, and some people who looked at her said, &quot;How big that goiter has become.&quot; But when the time came for testimony she was up on her feet and testified, &quot;Two years ago the Lord gloriously healed me of goiter. Oh I had a most wonderful healing. It is grand to be healed by the power of God.&quot; That day someone remonstrated with her and said,&quot;People will think there is something the matter with you. Why don&#39;t you look in the glass? You will see your goiter is bigger than ever.&quot; That good woman went to the Lord about it and said, &quot;Lord, you so wonderfully healed me two years ago. Won&#39;t you show all the people that you healed me?&quot; She went to sleep peacefully that night still believing God and when she came down the next day there was not a trace or a mark of that goiter. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God&#39;s word is from everlasting to everlasting. His word cannot fail. God&#39;s word is true and when we rest in the fact of its truth what mighty results we can get. Faith never looks in the glass. Faith has a glass into which it can look. It is the glass of the perfect law of liberty. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('jam%201:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> To the man who looks into this perfect law of God all darkness is removed and he sees his completeness in Christ. There is no darkness in faith. There is only darkness in nature. Darkness only exists when the natural is put in the place of the divine. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Not only is grace multiplied to us through knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, but peace also. As we really know our God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, we will have peace multiplied to us even in the multiplied fires of ten thousand Nebuchadnezzars. It will be multiplied to us even though we are put into the den of lions, and we will live with joy in the midst of the whole thing. What was the difference between Daniel and the king that night when Daniel was put into the den of lions? Daniel knew, but the king was experimenting. The king came around the next morning and cried, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('dan%206:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Oh Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Daniel answered, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('dan%206:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions&#39; mouths.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The thing was done. It was done when Daniel prayed with his windows open toward heaven. All our victories are won before we go into the fight. Prayer links us on to our lovely God, our abounding God, our multiplying God. Oh I love Him! He is so wonderful! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You will note, as you read these first two verses of the first chapter of the second epistle of Peter, that this grace and peace is multiplied through the knowledge of God, but that first our faith comes through the righteousness of God. Note that righteousness comes first and knowledge afterwards. It cannot be otherwise. If you expect any revelation of God apart from holiness you will have only a mixture. Holiness opens the door to all the treasures of God. He must first bring us to the place where we, like our Lord, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%201:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">love righteousness and hate iniquity,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> before He opens up to us these good treasures. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2066:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">When we regard iniquity in our hearts the Lord will not hear us,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and it is only as we are made righteous and pure and holy through the precious blood of God&rsquo;s Son that we can enter into this life of holiness and righteousness in the Son. It is the righteousness of our Lord Himself made real in us as our faith is stayed in Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After I was baptized with the Holy Ghost the Lord gave me a blessed revelation. I saw Adam and Eve turned out of the garden for their disobedience and unable to partake of the tree of life, for the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%203:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">cherubim with flaming sword</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> kept them away from this tree. When I was baptized I saw that I had begun to eat of this tree of life and I saw that the flaming sword was all round about. It was there to keep the devil away. Oh, what privileges are ours when we are born of God. How marvelously He keeps us so that the wicked one touches us not. I see a place in God where Satan dare not come. Hidden in God. And He invites us all to come and share this wonderful hidden place where our lives are hid with Christ in God, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2091:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">where we dwell in the secret place of the Most High and abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God has this place for you in this blessed realm of grace. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Peter goes on to say, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2pet%201:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;According as His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God is calling us to this realm of glory and virtue <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2pet%201:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">where, as we feed on His exceeding great and precious promises, we are made partakers of the divine nature.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2011:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Faith is the substance of things hoped for</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> right here in this life. It is right here that God would have us partake of His divine nature. It is nothing less than the life of the Lord Himself imparted and flowing into our whole beings, so that our very body is quickened, so that every tissue and every drop of blood and our bones and joints and marrow receive this divine life. I believe that the Lord wants this divine life to flow right into our natural bodies, this law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus that makes us free from the law of sin and death. God wants to establish our faith so that we will lay hold on this divine life, this divine nature of the Son of God, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1thes%205:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">so that our spirit and soul and body will be sanctified wholly and preserved unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%205:27-30')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">When that woman was healed of the issue of blood, Jesus perceived that power had gone out of Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The woman&#39;s faith laid hold and this power was imparted and immediately the woman&#39;s being was surcharged with life and her weakness departed. The impartation of this power produces everything you need; but it comes only as our faith moves out for its impartation. Faith is the victory. If thou canst believe, it is thine. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I suffered for many years from piles, till my whole body was thoroughly weak; the blood used to gush from me. One day I got desperate and I took a bottle of oil and anointed myself. I said to the Lord, &quot;Do what you want to, quickly.&quot; I was healed at that very moment. God wants us to have an activity of faith that dares to believe God. There is what seems like faith, an appearance of faith, but real faith believes God right to the end. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What was the difference between Zacharias and Mary? The angel came to Zacharias and told him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%201:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Zacharias was there in the holy place, but he began to question this message, saying, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%201:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I am an old man, my wife is well stricken in years.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Gabriel rebuked him for his unbelief and told him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%201:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But note the contrast when the angel came to Mary. She said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%201:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And Elizabeth greeted Mary with the words, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%201:45')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God would have us to lay hold on His word in like manner. He would have us to come with boldness of faith declaring, &quot;You have promised it, Lord. Now do it.&quot; God rejoices when we manifest a faith that holds Him to His word. Can we get there? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord has called us to this glory and virtue; and, as our faith lays hold on Him, we shall see this in manifestation. I remember one day I was holding an open-air meeting. My uncle came to that meeting and said, &quot;Aunt Mary would like to see Smith before she dies.&quot; I went to see her and she was assuredly dying. I said, &quot;Lord, can&#39;t you do something?&quot; All I did was this, to stretch out my hands and lay them on her. It seemed as though there was an immediate impartation of the glory and virtue of the Lord. Aunt Mary cried, &quot;It is going all over my body.&quot; And that day she was made perfectly whole. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day I was preaching and a man brought a boy who was done up in bandages. The boy was in irons and it was impossible for him to walk and it was difficult for them to get him to the platform. They passed him over about six seats. The power of the Lord was present to heal and it entered right into the child as I placed my hands on him. The child cried, &quot;Daddy, it is going all over me.&quot; They stripped the boy and found nothing imperfect in him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord would have us to be walking epistles of His word. Jesus is the Word and is the power in us, and it is His desire to work in and through us His own good pleasure. We must believe that He is in us. There are boundless possibilities for us if we dare to act in God and dare to believe that the wonderful virtue of our living Christ shall be made manifest through us as we lay our hands on the sick in His name. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The exceeding great and precious promises of the Word are given to us that we might be partakers of the divine nature. I feel the Holy Ghost is grieved with us because, when we know these things, we do not do greater exploits for God. Does not the Holy Ghost show us wide-open doors of opportunity? Shall we not let God take us on to greater things? Shall we not believe God to take us on to greater manifestations of His power? His call for us is to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('phi%203:13-14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">forget the things that are behind, and reach forth unto the things which are before and to press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

One day he said to this boy, &quot;I want to see you in my office.&quot; When the boy was in his office he asked him, &quot;How is it that you can always whistle and be happy?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;I cannot help it,&quot; answered the boy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;Where did you get it?&quot; asked the master. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;I got it at the Pentecostal mission.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;Where is that?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The boy told him, and the next thing was, that the man was attending. The Lord broke him up there, and in a short while he was entirely changed. One day, shortly after this, he found that, instead of being distracted by his business as he formerly had been, he was actually whistling and jumping. His whole position and his whole life had been changed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The shout cannot come out unless it is in. There must first be the inner working of the power of God. It is He who changes the heart, and transforms the life, and before there is any real outward evidence there must be the inflow of divine life. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Sometimes I say to people, &quot;You weren&#39;t at meeting the other night.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They reply, &quot;Oh yes, I was there in spirit.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I say to them, &quot;Well, come next time with your body also. We don&#39;t want a lot of spirits here and no bodies. We want you to come and get filled with God.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When all the people will come and pray and praise as did these early disciples there will be something doing. People who come will catch fire and they will want to come again. But they will have no use for a place where everything has become formal, dry, and dead. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The power of Pentecost as it came at first came to loose men. God wants us free on every line. Men and women are tired of imitations; they want reality; they want to see people who have the living Christ within, and are filled with Holy Ghost power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I received several letters and telegrams about a certain case, but when I arrived I was told I was too late. I said, &quot;That cannot be. God has never sent me too late anywhere.&quot; God showed me when I went that something different would happen to anything I had seen previously. The people I went to were all strangers. I was introduced to a young man who lay helpless, and for whom there was no hope. The doctor had been to see him that morning and had declared that he would not live through the day. He lay with his face to the wall, and when I spoke to him he whispered, &quot;I cannot turn over.&quot; His mother said that they had had to lift him out of bed on sheets for weeks, and that he was so weak and helpless that he had to stay in one position. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The young man said, &quot;My heart is so weak.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I assured him, &quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('psa%2073:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">God is the strength of thy heart and thy portion forever.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you will believe God, it shall be so today.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our Christ is risen. He is a living Christ who indwells us. We must not have this truth merely as a theory, Christ must be risen in us by the power of the Spirit. The power that raised Him from the dead must animate us, and as this glorious resurrection power surges through your being, you will be freed from all your weaknesses and you will become strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. There is a resurrection power that God wants you to have and to have it today. Why not? Receive your portion here and now. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to these people, &quot;I believe your son will rise today.&quot; They only laughed. People do not expect to see signs and wonders today as the disciples saw them of old. Has God changed? Or has our faith waned so that we are not expecting the greater works that Jesus promised? We must not harp on any minor key. Our message must rise to concert pitch, and there must be nothing left out of it that is in the Book. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was winter time, and I said to the parents, &quot;Will you get the boy&#39;s suit and bring it here?&quot; They would not listen to the request, for they were expecting the boy to die. But I had gone to that place believing God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('rom%204:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In Romans 4.17, we read of Abraham, &quot;(I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God help us to understand this. It is time people knew how to shout in faith as they contemplate the eternal power of our God to whom it is nothing to quicken and raise the dead. I come across some who would be giants in the power of God but they have no shout of faith. I find everywhere people who go down even when they are praying simply because they are just breathing sentences without uttering speech, and you cannot get victory that way. You must learn to take the victory and shout in the face of the devil, &quot;It is done!&quot; There is no man who can doubt if he learns to shout. When we know how to shout properly, things will be different, and tremendous things will happen. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In verse 24 we read, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%204:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;They lifted up their voice with one accord.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It surely must have been a loud prayer. We must know that God means us to have life. If there is anything in the world that has life in it, it is this Pentecostal revival we are in. I believe in the Baptism of the Holy Ghost with the speaking in tongues, and I believe that every man who is baptized in the Holy Ghost <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('act%202:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">will speak in other tongues as the Spirit gives him utterance.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I believe in the Holy Ghost. And if you are filled with the Spirit you will be superabounding in life&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%207:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">living waters will flow from you.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At last I persuaded the parents to bring the boy&#39;s clothes and lay them on the bed. From the natural viewpoint, the young man lay dying. I spoke to the afflicted one, &quot;God has revealed to me that, as I lay my hands upon you, the place will be filled with the Holy Ghost, the bed will be shaken, you will be shaken and thrown out of bed by the power of the Holy Ghost, you will dress yourself and be strong.&quot; I said this to him in faith. I laid hands on him in the name of Jesus and instantly the power of God fell and filled the place. I felt helpless and fell flat on the floor. I knew nothing except that a short while after the place was shaken, I heard the young man walking over me and saying, &quot;For Thy glory, Lord! For Thy glory, Lord!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He dressed himself and cried, &quot;God has healed me.&quot; The father fell, the mother tell, and another who was present fell also. God manifested His power that day in saving the whole household and healing the young man. It is the power of the risen Christ we need. That young man is today preaching the gospel. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">For years we have been longing for God to come forth, and, praise Him, He is coming forth. The tide is rising everywhere. I was in Switzerland not long ago, preaching in many places where the Pentecostal message had not been heard, and today there are nine new Pentecostal assemblies in different places going on blessedly for God. All over the world it is the same; this great Pentecostal work is in motion. You can hardly get to a place now where God is not pouring out His Spirit on hungry hearts. God has promised to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, and His promises never fail. Our Christ is risen. His salvation was not a thing done in a corner. Truly He was a man of glory who went to Calvary for us, in order that He might free us from all that would mar and hinder, that He might transform us by His grace, and bring us out from under the power of Satan into the glorious power of God. One touch of our risen Christ will raise the dead. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, this wonderful Jesus of ours! He comes and indwells us. He comes to abide. He it is who baptizes us with the Holy Ghost, and makes everything different. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2015:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">We are to be a kind of firstfruits unto God and are to be like Christ who is </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">the</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> first fruit,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> walking in His footsteps, living in His power. What a salvation this is, having this risen Christ in us. I feel that everything else must go to nothingness, helplessness and ruin. Even the best thought of holiness <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%203:30')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">must be on the decrease in order that Christ may increase,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and we live in another state, and all things are under the power of the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Dare you take your inheritance from God? Dare you believe God? Dare you stand on the record of His Word? What is the record? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('john%2011:40')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">If thou shalt believe thou shalt see the glory of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%2022:31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">You will be sifted as wheat.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You will be tried as though some strange thing tried you. You will be put in places where you will have to put your whole trust in God. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1cor%2010:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">There is no such thing as anyone being tried beyond what God will allow.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There is no temptation that will come, but God will be with you right in the temptation to deliver you, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('job%2023:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and when you have been tried, He will bring you forth as gold.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Every trial is to bring you to a greater position in God. The trial that tries your faith will take you on to the place where you will know that the faith of God will be forthcoming in the next test. No man is able to win any victory save through the power of the risen Christ within him. You will never be able to say, &quot;I did this or that.&quot; You will desire to give God the glory for everything. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If you are sure of your ground, if you are counting on the presence of the living Christ within, you can laugh when you see things getting worse. God would have you settled and grounded in Christ, and it is only as you are filled with the Holy Ghost that you become stedfast and unmoveable in Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%2012:50')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He was assuredly straitened in the way, at Gethsemane, at the judgment hall, and after that, at the cross, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%209:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">where He, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God will take us right on in like manner, and the Holy Spirit will lead every step of the way. God led Him right through to the empty tomb, to the ascension glory, to a place on the throne; and the Son of God will never be satisfied until He has us with Himself, sharing His glory and sharing His throne. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;Only believe! only believe! all things are possible, only believe!&quot; Praise God, He has made all things possible. There is liberty for everyone, whatever the trouble. Our Lord Jesus says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mk%205:36')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Only believe.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He has obtained complete victory over every difficulty, over every power of evil, over every depravity. Every sin is covered by Calvary. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Who are of the tribe of Abraham? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gal%203:29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All who believe in Jesus Christ are the seed of faith, Abraham&#39;s seed.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If we dare come believing, God will heal, God will restore, will lift the burden and wake us up to real overcoming faith. Look up! Take courage! Jesus has shaken the foundations of death and darkness. He fighteth for you and there is none like Him. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('jn%208:58')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He is the great </span><span class="cs5EE81C7D">I AM</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('php%202:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">His name is above every name.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> As we believe we are lifted into a place of rest, a place of conformity to Him. He says to us as He did to Abraham, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('gen%2012:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I will bless thee and thou shalt be a blessing.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He says to us as He did to His people of old, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('jer%2031:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;With loving kindness have I drawn thee.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Hallelujah: </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&quot;He&#39;ll never forget to keep me, He&#39;ll never forget to keep me; my Father has many dear children, but He&#39;ll never forget to keep me.&quot;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Believe it. He will never forget. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">sixth chapter of Acts</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we read of the appointment of seven deacons. The disciples desired to give themselves wholly to prayer and to the ministry of the Word, and they said to the brethren, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And they chose Stephen (a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost) and six others.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We read that Stephen, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and his opponents <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When his opponents brought him before the Sanhedrin, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">all that sat in the Council looked steadfastly on him, and they saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I see many remarkable things in the life of Stephen. One thing moves me, and that is the truth that I must at all costs live by the power of the Spirit. God wants us to be like Stephen, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">full of faith and full of the Holy Ghost</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">. You can never be the same again after you have received this wonderful Baptism in the Holy Spirit. It is important that day by day we should be full of wisdom and faith, and full of the Holy Ghost, acting by the power of the Holy Ghost. God has set us here in the last days, these of apostasy, and would have us be burning and shining lights in the midst of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%202:40')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">an untoward generation.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God is longing for us to come into such a fruitful position as the sons of God, with the marks of heaven upon us, His divinity bursting through our humanity, so that He can express Himself through our lips of clay. He can take clay lips, weak humanity, and make of such an oracle for Himself. He can take frail human nature and by His divine power make our bodies meet to he His holy temple, washing our hearts whiter than snow. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our Lord Jesus says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%2028:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He longs that we should be filled with faith and with the Holy Ghost and declares to us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('jn%2014:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;He that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot; He has gone to the Father. He is in the place of power and He exercises His power not only in heaven but on earth, for <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mat%2028:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He has all power on earth as well as in heaven.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Hallelujah! What an open door to us if we will but believe Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The disciples were men after our standard on the line of the flesh. God sent them forth, joined to the Lord and identified with Him. Peter, John and Thomas, how diverse they were! Impulsive Peter, ever ready to go forth without a stop! John, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('jn%2021:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the beloved, leaning on the Master&#39;s breast,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> how different! Thomas, with hard nature and defiant spirit. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('jn%2020:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I won&#39;t believe, unless I put my finger into the print of the nails and my hands into His side.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> What strange flesh! How peculiar! But the Master could mold them. There was no touch like His. Under His touch even stony-hearted Thomas believed. Ah my God, how Thou hast had to manage some of us. Have we not been strange and very peculiar? But oh, when God&#39;s hand comes upon us, He can speak to us in such a way&mdash;a word, a look, and we are broken. Has He spoken to you? I thank God for His speaking. Back of all His dealings we see the love of God for us. It is not what we are that counts, but what we can be as He disciplines and chastens us and transforms us by His all skillful hands. He sees our bitter tears and our weeping night after night. There is none like Him. He knows. He forgives. We cannot forgive ourselves; we oftentimes would give the world to forget, but we cannot. The devil won&#39;t let us forget. But God has forgiven and forgotten. Do you believe self, or the devil, or God? Which are you going to believe? Believe God. I know the past is under the blood and that God has forgiven and forgotten, for when He forgives He forgets. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! We are baptized to believe and to receive. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In making provision for the serving of tables and the daily ministration, the disciples knew who were baptized with the Holy Ghost. In the early days of the church all who touched the work had to be men full of the Holy Ghost. I am hungry that I may be more full, that God may make choice of me for His service. And I know that the greatest qualification is to be filled with the Spirit. The Holy Spirit has the divine commission from heaven to impart revelation to every son of God concerning the Lord Jesus, to unfold to us the gifts and the fruit of the Spirit. He will take of the things of Christ and show them unto us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Stephen was a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God declares it. God so manifested Himself in Stephen&#39;s body that he became an epistle of truth, known and read of all. Full of faith! Such men never talk doubt. You never hear them say, &quot;I </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">wish</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> it could be so; or if it is God&#39;s will.&quot; No </span><span class="cs53F207AF">IFS</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. They </span><span class="cs53F207AF">KNOW</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. You never hear them say, &quot;Well, it does not always act.&quot; They say, &quot;It is sure to be.&quot; They laugh at impossibilities and cry, &quot;It shall be done!&quot; A man full of faith hopes against hope. He shouts while the walls are up and they come down while he shouts! God has this faith for us in Christ. We must be careful that no unbelief is found in us, no wavering. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Holy Ghost could do mighty things through him because he believed God, and God is with the man who dares to believe His Word. All things were possible because of the Holy Ghost&#39;s position in Stephen&#39;s body. He was full of the Holy Ghost so God could fulfill His purposes through him. When a child of God is filled with the Holy Ghost, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ro%208:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the Spirit maketh intercession through him for the saints according to the will of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He fills us with longings and desires until we are in a place of fervency as of a molten fire. What to do we know not. When we are in this place the Holy Ghost begins to do. When the Holy Ghost has liberty in the body He wafts all utterance into the presence of God according to the will of God. Such prayers are always heard. Such praying is always answered; it is never bare of result. When we are praying in the Holy Ghost, faith is in evidence and as a result the power of God can be manifested in our midst. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When there arose certain of the various synagogues to dispute with Stephen <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which He spake.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When we are filled with the Holy Ghost we will have wisdom. Praise God! One night I was entrusted with a meeting and I was jealous of my position before God. I wanted approval from the Lord. I see that God wants men full of the Holy Ghost, with divine ability, filled with life, a flaming fire. In the meeting a young man stood up, a pitiful object, with a face full of sorrow. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &quot;What is it, young man?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He said he was unable to work, he could scarcely walk. He said, &quot;I am so helpless. I have consumption and a weak heart, and my body is full of pain.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &quot;I will pray for you.&quot; I said to the people, &quot;As I pray for this young man, you look at his face and see it change.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I prayed his face changed and he was in a strange way. I said to him, &quot;Go out and run a mile and come back to the meeting.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He came back and said, &quot;I can now breathe freely.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The meetings were continuing and I missed him. After a few days I saw him again in the meeting. I said, &quot;Young man, tell the people what God has done for you.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I have been to work. I bought some papers and I have made $4.50.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Praise God, this wonderful stream of salvation never runs dry. You can take a drink, it is close to you. It is a river that is running deep and there is plenty for all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In a meeting a man rose and said, &quot;Will you touch me, I am in a terrible way. I have a family of children, and through an accident in the pit I have had no work for two years. I cannot open my hands.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was full of sorrow for this poor man and something happened which had never come before. We are in the infancy of this wonderful outpouring of the Holy Spirit and there is so much more for us. I put out my hand, and before my hands reached his, he was loosed and made perfectly free. I see that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Stephen, full of faith and of power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This same Holy Ghost filling is for us, and right things will be accomplished if we are filled with His Spirit. God will grant it. He declares that the desires of the righteous shall be granted. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Stephen was an ordinary man made extraordinary in God. We may be very ordinary, but God wants to make us extraordinary in the Holy Ghost. God is ready to touch and to transform you right now. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Once a woman rose in the meeting asking for prayer. I prayed for her and she was healed. She cried out, &quot;It is a miracle! It is a miracle! It is a miracle!&quot; That is what God wants to do for us all the time. As sure as we get free in the Holy Ghost something will happen. Let us pursue the best things and let God have His right of way. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%206:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All that sat in the council looked steadfastly on Stephen and saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It was worth being filled with the Holy Ghost for that. The Spirit breaking through. There is a touch of the Spirit where the light of God will verily radiate from our faces. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The seventh chapter of Acts is the profound prophetic utterance that the Spirit spoke through this holy man. The word of God flowed through the lips of Stephen in the form of divine prophecy so that they who heard these things were cut to the heart. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%207:55-56')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and said, &quot;Behold I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Right to the last Stephen was full of the Holy Ghost. He saw Jesus standing. In another part we read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('col%203:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">of Him seated at the right hand of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> That is His place of authority. But here we see that He arose. He was so keenly interested in that martyr Stephen. May the Lord open our eyes to see Him and to know that He is deeply interested in all that concerns us. He is touched with the feeling of our infirmities. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">All things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. That asthma, He knows. That rheumatism, He knows. That pain in the back, that head, those feet, He knows. He wants to loose every captive and to set you free just as He has set me free. I do not know that I have a body today. I am free of every human ailment, absolutely free. Christ has redeemed us. He has power over all the power of the enemy and has wrought out our great victory. Will you have it? It is yours&mdash;a perfect redemption. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('ac%207:59-60')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And they stoned Stephen, who called upon God and said, &quot;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&quot; And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, &quot;Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.&quot; And when he had said this he fell asleep.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Stephen was not only filled with faith but he was also filled with love as he prayed just as his Master prayed, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('luk%2023:34')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Father, forgive them.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is God&#39;s thought <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2cor%205:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to make us a new creation, with all the old things passed away</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and all things within us truly of God, to bring in a new divine order, a perfect love and an unlimited faith. Will you have it? Redemption is free. Arise in the activity of faith and God will heal you as you rise. Only believe and receive in faith. Stephen, full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, did great signs and wonders. May God bless to us this word and fill us full of His Holy Spirit, and through the power of the Holy Ghost more and more reveal Christ in us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Spirit of God will always reveal the Lord Jesus Christ. Serve Him, love Him, be filled with Him. It is lovely to hear Him as He makes Himself known to us. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('heb%2013:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He is the same yesterday, today and forever.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He is willing to fill us with the Holy Ghost and faith just as He filled Stephen. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<h4 class="cs39141F69">
							<span class="cs12506F1C">Preached at Springfield Assembly, Springfield, Mo.<br/>Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, April 14, 1923.<br/></span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Faith that Prevails</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, chapter 7, &ldquo;Present-time blessings.&rdquo;</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read with me the first twelve verses of Matthew 5, these verses that we generally call the &ldquo;Beatitudes.&rdquo; Some tell us that Matthew 5 is a millennial chapter and that we cannot attain to these blessings at the present time. I believe that everyone who receives the Baptism in the Spirit has a real foretaste and earnest of millennial blessing, but that here the Lord Jesus is setting forth present-day blessings that we can enjoy here and now. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is a great joy for me to be speaking to baptized believers. We have not reached the height of God&rsquo;s mind, but my personal conviction is that we are nearer by far than we were fourteen years ago. If anyone had told me that I should be happier today than I was fourteen years ago when the Lord baptized me in the Spirit, I would not have believed him. But I see that God has more ahead for us, and that, so far, we have only touched the fringe of things. As we let the truth lay hold of us, we will press on for the mark ahead and enter more fully into our birth-right&mdash;all that God says. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It seems to me that every time I open my Bible I get a new revelation of God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s Spirit takes man to a place of helplessness, and then reveals God as his all in all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; This is one of the richest places into which Jesus brings us. The poor have a right to everything in heaven. &ldquo;Theirs is.&rdquo; Dare you believe it? Yes, I dare. I believe, I know, that I was very poor. When God&rsquo;s Spirit comes in as the ruling, controlling power of the life, He gives us God&rsquo;s revelation of our inward poverty, and shows us that God has come with one purpose, to bring heaven&rsquo;s best to earth, and that with Jesus He will indeed &ldquo;freely give us all things.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">An old man and an old woman had lived together for seventy years. Someone said to them, &ldquo;You must have seen many clouds during those days.&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;Where do the showers come from? You never get showers without clouds.&rdquo; It is only the Holy Ghost who can bring us to the place of realization of our poverty; but, every time He does it, He opens the windows of heaven and the showers of blessing fall. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But I must recognize the difference between my own spirit and the Holy Spirit. My own spirit can do certain things on natural lines, can even weep and pray and worship, but it is all on a human plan, and we must not depend on our own human thoughts and activities or on our own personality. If the Baptism means anything to you, it should bring you to the death of the ordinary, where you are no longer putting faith in your own understanding; but, conscious of your own poverty, you are ever yielded to the Spirit. Then it is that your body becomes filled with heaven on earth. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.&rdquo; People get a wrong idea of mourning. Over in Switzerland they have a day set apart to take wreaths to graves. I laughed at the people&rsquo;s ignorance and said, &ldquo;Why are you spending time around the graves? The people you love are not there. All that taking of flowers to the graves is not faith at all.&rdquo; Those who died in Christ are gone to be with Him, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; Paul said, &ldquo;is far better.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My wife once said to me, &ldquo;You watch me when I&rsquo;m preaching. I get so near to heaven when I&rsquo;m preaching that some day I&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo; One night she was preaching and when she had finished, off she went. I was going off to Glasgow and had said goodbye to her before she went to meeting. As I was leaving the house, the doctor and policeman met me at the door and told me that she had fallen dead at the Mission door. I knew she had got what she wanted. I could not weep, but I was in tongues, praising the Lord. On natural lines she was everything to me; but I could not mourn on natural lines, but just laughed in the Spirit. The house was soon filled with people. The doctor said, &ldquo;She is dead, and we can do no more for her.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I went up to her lifeless corpse and commanded death to give her up, and she came back to me for a moment. Then God said to me, &ldquo;She is Mine; her work is done.&rdquo; I knew what He meant. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They laid her in the coffin, and I brought my sons and my daughter into the room and said, &ldquo;Is she there?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They said, &ldquo;No, father.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &ldquo;We will cover her up.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If you go mourning the loss of loved ones who have gone to be with Christ, I say it in love to you, you have never had the revelation of what Paul spoke of when he showed us that it is better to go than to stay. We read this in Scripture, but the trouble is that people will not believe it. When you believe God, you will say, &ldquo;Whatever it is, it is all right. If Thou dost want to take the one I love, it is all right, Lord.&rdquo; Faith removes all tears of self-pity. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">But there is a mourning in the Spirit. God will bring you to a place where things must be changed, and there is a mourning, an unutterable groaning until God comes. And the end of all real faith always is rejoicing. Jesus mourned over Jerusalem. He saw the conditions, He saw the unbelief, He saw the end of those who closed their ears to the Gospel. But God gave a promise that He should see the travail of His soul and be satisfied, and that He should see His seed. What happened on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem was an earnest of what will be the results of His travail, to be multiplied a billionfold all down the ages in all the world. And as we enter in the Spirit into travail over conditions that are wrong, snch mourning will ever bring results for God, and our joy will be complete in the satisfaction that is brought to Christ thereby. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.&rdquo; Moses was headstrong in his zeal for his own people, and it resulted in his killing a man. His heart was right in his desire to correct things, but he was working on natural lines, and when we work on natural lines we always fail. Moses had a mighty passion, and that is one of the best things in the world when God has control and it becomes a passion for souls to be born again; but apart from God it is one of the worst things. Paul had it to a tremendous extent, and, breathing out threatenings, he was hailing men and women to prison. But God changed it, and later we find him wishing himself accursed from Christ for the sake of his brethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh. God took the headstrong Moses and molded him into the meekest of men. He took the fiery Saul of Tarsus and made him the foremost exponent of grace. Oh, brothers, God can transform you in like manner, and plant in you a divine meekness and every other thing that you lack. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In our Sunday school we had a boy with red hair. His head was as red as fire and so was his temper. He was such a trial. He kicked his teachers and the superintendent. He was simply uncontrollable. The teachers had a meeting in which they discussed the matter of expelling him. They thought that God might undertake for that boy and so they decided to give him another chance. One day he had to be turned out, and he broke all the windows of the mission. He was worse outside than in. Some time later we had a ten-days revival meeting. There was nothing much doing in that meeting and people thought it a waste of time, but there was one result&mdash;the red-headed lad got saved. After he was saved, the difficulty was to get rid of him at our house. He would be there until midnight crying to God to make him pliable and use him for His glory. God delivered the lad from his temper and made him one of the meekest, most beautiful boys you ever saw. For twenty years he has been a mighty missionary in China. God takes us just as we are and transforms us by His power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I can remember the time when I used to go white with rage, and shake all over with temper. I could hardly hold myself together. I waited on God for ten days. In those ten days I was being emptied out and the life of the Lord Jesus was being wrought into me. My wife testified of the transformation that took place in my life, &ldquo;I never saw such a change. I have never been able to cook anything since that time that has not pleased him. Nothing is too hot or too cold, everything is just right.&rdquo; God must come and reign supreme in your life. Will you let Him do it? He can do it, and He will if you will let Him. It is no use trying to tame the &ldquo;old man.&rdquo; But God can deal with him. The carnal mind will never be subjected to God, but God will bring it to the cross where it belongs, and will put in its place, the pure, the holy, the meek mind of the Master. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.&rdquo; Note that word. &ldquo;</span><span class="cs53F207AF">SHALL</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> be filled.&rdquo; If you ever see a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the Bible make it yours. Meet the conditions and God will fulfil His word to you. The Spirit of God is crying, &ldquo;Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money: come ye, buy and eat: yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.&rdquo; The Spirit of God will take of the things of Christ and show them to you in order that you may have a longing for Christ in His fullness, and when there is that longing, God will not fail to fill you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">See that crowd of worshipers who have come up to the feast. They are going away utterly unsatisfied, but on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stands up and cries, &ldquo;If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Jesus knew that they were going away without the living water, and so He directs them to the true source of supply. Are you thirsty today? The living Christ still invites you to Himself, and I want to testify that He still satisfies the thirsty soul and still fills the hungry with good things. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In Switzerland, I learned of a man who met with the assembly of the Plymouth Brethren. He attended their various meetings, and one morning, at their breaking of bread service, he arose and said, &ldquo;Brethren, we have the Word, and I feel that we are living very much in the letter of it, but there is a hunger and thirst in my soul for something deeper, something more real than we have, and I cannot rest until I enter into it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next Sunday this brother rose again and said, &ldquo;We are all so poor here, there is no life in this assembly, and my heart is hungry for reality.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He did this for several weeks until it got on the nerves of those people and they protested, &ldquo;Sands, you are making us all miserable. You are spoiling our meetings, and there is only one thing for you to do, and that is to clear out.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That man went out of the meeting in a very sad condition. As he stood outside, one of his children asked him what was the matter, and he said, &ldquo;To think that they should turn me out from their midst for being hungry and thirsty for more of God!&rdquo; I did not know anything of this until afterward. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some days later someone rushed up to Sands and said, &ldquo;There is a man over here from England, and he is speaking about tongues and healing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Sands said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix him. I&rsquo;ll go to the meeting and sit right up in the front and challenge him with the Scriptures. I&rsquo;ll dare him to preach these things in Switzerland. I&rsquo;ll publicly denounce him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So he came to the meetings. There he sat. He was so hungry and thirsty that he drank in every word that was said. His opposition soon petered out. The first morning he said to a friend, &ldquo;This is what I want.&rdquo; He drank and drank of the Spirit. After three weeks he said, &ldquo;God will have to do something now or I&rsquo;ll burst.&rdquo; He breathed in God and the Lord filled him to such an extent that he spoke in other tongues as the Spirit gave utterance. Sands is now preaching, and is in charge of a new Pentecostal assembly. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God is making people hungry and thirsty after His best. And everywhere He is filling the hungry and giving them that which the disciples received at the very beginning. Are you hungry? If you are, God promises that you shall be filled. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Preached at Springfield Assembly, Springfield, Mo.<br/>Published in the Pentecostal Evangel, May 12, 1923.<br/></span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Ever Increasing Faith</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, chapter 6. (Published 1924.)</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read Matthew 8:1-17. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here we have a wonderful word. All the Word is wonderful. This blessed Book brings such life and health and peace, and such an abundance that we should never be poor any more. This Book is my heavenly bank. I find everything I want in it. I want to show you how rich you may be, that in everything you can be enriched in Christ Jesus. He has abundance of grace for you and the gift of righteousness and through His abundant grace all things are possible. I want to show you that you can be a living branch of the living Vine, Christ Jesus, and that it is your privilege to be right here in this world what He is. John tells us, &ldquo;As He is, so are we in this world.&rdquo; Not that we are anything in ourselves, but Christ within us is our all in all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord Jesus is always wanting to show forth His grace and love in order to draw us to Himself. God is willing to do things, to manifest His Word, and let us know in measure the mind of our God in this day and hour. There are many needy ones, many afflicted ones, but I do not think any present are half as bad as this first case that we read of in Matthew 8. This man was a leper. You may be suffering with consumption or cancers or other things, but God will show forth His perfect cleansing, His perfect healing, if you have a living faith in Christ. He is a wonderful Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This leper must have been told about Jesus. How much is missed because people are not constantly telling what Jesus will do in this our day. Probably someone had come to that leper and said, &ldquo;Jesus can heal you.&rdquo; And so he was filled with expectation as he saw the Lord coming down the mountain side. Lepers were not allowed to come within reach of people, they were shut out as unclean. And so in the ordinary way it would have been very diflicult for him to get near because of the crowd that surrounded Jesus. But as He came down from the mount He met this poor leper. Oh, this terrible disease! There was no help for him humanly speaking, but nothing is too hard for Jesus. The man cried, &ldquo;Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.&rdquo; Was Jesus willing? You will never find Jesus missing an opportunity of doing good. You will find that He is always more willing to work than we are to give Him an opportunity to work. The trouble is we do not come to Him, we do not ask Him for what He is more than willing to give. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And Jesus put forth His hand, and touched him, saying, &ldquo;I will; be thou clean.&rdquo; And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. I like that. If you are definite with Him you will never go away disappointed. The divine life will flow into you and instantaneously you will be delivered. This Jesus is just the same today, and He says to you. &ldquo;I will; be thou clean.&rdquo; He has an overflowing cup for thee, a fulness of life. He will meet you in your absolute helplessness. All things are possible if you will only believe. God has a real plan. It is so simple. Just come to Jesus. You will find Him just the same as He was in days of old. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next case we have in this chapter is that of the centurion coming and beseeching Jesus on behalf of his servant who was sick of the palsy and grievously tormented. This man was so in earnest that he came seeking for Jesus. Notice this, that there is one thing certain, there is no such thing as seeking without finding. He that seeketh findeth. Listen to the gracious words of Jesus, &ldquo;I will come and heal him.&rdquo; Most places that we go to there are so many people that we cannot pray for. In some places there are 200 or 300 who would like us to visit them, but we are not able to do so. But I am so glad that the Lord Jesus is always willing to come and heal. He longs to meet the sick ones. He loves to heal them of their afflictions. The Lord is healing many people today by means of handkerchiefs as you read that He healed people in the days of Paul. You can read of this in Acts 19:12. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A woman came to me in the city of Liverpool and said, &ldquo;I would like you to help me. I wish you would join with me in prayer. My husband is a drunkard and every night comes into the home under the influence of drink. Won&rsquo;t you join me in prayer for him?&rdquo; I said to the woman, &ldquo;Have you a handkerchief?&rdquo; She took out a handkerchief and I prayed over it and told her to lay it on the pillow of the drunken man. He came home that night and laid his head on the pillow in which this handkerchief was tucked. He laid his head on more than the pillow that night. He laid his head on the promise of God. In Mark 11:24, we read, &ldquo;What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next morning the man got up and caJled at the first saloon that he had to pass on his way to work and ordered some beer. He tasted it and said to the bartender, &ldquo;You have put some poison in this beer.&rdquo; He could not drink it, and went on to the next saloon and ordered some more beer. He tasted it and said to the man behind the counter, &ldquo;You put some poison in this beer. I believe you folks have agreed to poison me.&rdquo; The bartender was indignant at being thus charged. The man said, &ldquo;I will go somewhere else.&rdquo; He went to another saloon and the same thing happened as in the two previous saloons. He made such a fuss that they turned him out. After he came out from work he went to another saloon to get some beer, and again he thought he had been poisoned and he made so much disturbance that he was thrown out. He went to his home and told his wife what had happened and said, &ldquo;It seems as though all the fellows have agreed to poison me.&rdquo; His wife said to him, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the hand of the Lord in this, that He is making vou dislike the stuff that has been your ruin?&rdquo; This word brought conviction to the man&rsquo;s heart and he came to the meeting and got saved. The Lord has still power to set the captives free. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in Australia a lady came to me who was much troubled about her son who was so lazy. I prayed over a handkerchief which was placed on the boy&rsquo;s pillow. He slept that night on the handkerchief and the next morning he got up and went out and secured a position and went to work. Oh, praise the Lord, you can&rsquo;t shut God out, but if you will only believe He will shut the devil out. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus was willing to go and heal the sick one but the centurion said, &ldquo;Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.&rdquo; Jesus was delighted with this expression and said to the man, &ldquo;Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.&rdquo; And his servant was healed the self-same hour. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in Australia a man came up to me. He was leaning on a big stick and said, &ldquo;I would like you to help me. It will take you half an hour to pray for me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Believe God and in one moment you will be whole.&rdquo; His faith was quickened to receive an immediate healing and he went away glorifying God for a miraculous healing. The word of the Lord is sufficient today. If you will dare to believe God&rsquo;s Word you will see a performance of His Word that will be truly wonderful. Here we have with the centurion an audacity of faith, a faith that did not limit God. Failures come when we limit the Holy One of Israel. I want to encourage you to a living faith to believe God&rsquo;s Word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next healing we read of here is the healing of Peter&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother who was sick of a fever. Luke tells us that Jesus rebuked the fever. The fever could hear. The moment it could hear it went. Jesus had a new method. Today there are a lot of folks who try to sweat out a fever. You can&rsquo;t sweat the devil out. He can stand all the heat that you can apply to him. But if thou canst believe, deliverance is as sure and certain for you as it was for Peter&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I received a telegram once urging me to visit a case about 200 miles from my home. As I went to this place I met the father and mother and found them broken hearted. They lead me up a staircase to a room and I saw a young woman on the floor and five people were holding her down. She was a frail young woman but the power in her was greater than all those young men. As I went into the room the evil powers looked out of hcr eyes and they used her lips saying, &ldquo;We are many, you can&rsquo;t cast us out.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Jesus can.&rdquo; He is equal to every occasion. He is waiting for an opportunity to bless. He is ready for every opportunity to deliver souls. When we receive Jesus it is true of us, &ldquo;Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.&rdquo; He is greater than all the powers of darkness. No man can meet the devil in his own strength, but any man filIed with the knowledge of Jesus, filled with His presence, filled with His power, is more than a match for the powers of darkness. God has called us to be more than conquerors through Him that loved us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The living Word is able to destroy Satanic forces. There is power in the name of Jesus. I would that every window in the street had the name of Jesus written large upon it. His name, through faith in His name, brought deliverance to this poor, bound soul, and thirty-seven demons came out giving their names as they came forth. The dear woman was completely delivered and they were able to give her back her child. That night there was heaven in that home and the father and mother and son and his wife were all united in glorifying Christ for His infinite grace. The next morning we had a gracious time in the breaking of bread. All things are wonderful with our wonderful Jesus. If you would dare rest your all upon Him, things would take place and He would change the whole situation. In a moment, through the name of Jesus, a new order of things can be brought in. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the world they are always having new diseases and the doctors cannot locate them. A doctor said to me, &ldquo;The science of medicine is in its infancy, and really we doctors have no confidence in our medicine. We are always experimenting.&rdquo; But the man of God does not experiment. He knows, or ought to know, redemption in its fulness. He knows, or ought to know, the mightiness of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is not, or should not be, moved by outward observation, but should get divine revelation of the mightiness of the name of Jesus and the power of His blood. If we exercise our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ He will come forth and get glory over all the powers of darkness. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At eventide they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils; and He cast out the spirits with His word and healed all that were sick: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, &ldquo;Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.&rdquo; The work is done if you only believe it. It is done. Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses. If you can only see the Lamb of God as He went to Calvary! He took our flesh that He might take upon Himself the full burden of all our sin and all the consequences of sin. There on the cross God laid upon Him the iniquities of us all. There on the cross of Calvary the results of sin were also dealt with. &ldquo;As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time subject to bondage.&rdquo; Through His death there is deliverance for you today. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, 13 May 1933.</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">What would happen to us and to the needy world if we should get to the place where we really believed God? May God give us the desire to get to this place. Faith is a tremendous power, an inward mover. I am convinced that we have not yet seen all that God has for us, but if we shall only move on in faith we shall see the greater works. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was a little boy I remember asking my father for a pennyworth of something or other. He did not give it to me, so I sat down by his side and every now and again I would just quietly say, &quot;Father!&quot; He would appear to take no notice of me, but now and again I would touch him ever so gently and say, &quot;Father!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My mother said to him, &quot;Why don&#39;t you answer the child?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My father replied, &quot;I have done so, but he won&#39;t accept my answer.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Still I sat on, and occasionally I would touch him and say ever so quietly, &quot;Father!&quot; If he went out into the garden I followed him and occasionally I would touch his sleeve and say, &quot;Father! Father!!&quot; Do you think I ever went away without the accomplishment of my desire? No, not once. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We need the same importunity as we go to God. We have the blessed assurance <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1John%205:14-15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">that if we ask anything according to His will He heareth us, and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Do you go to Him for heart purity? It is His will that you should receive, and if you ask in faith you can know that you have the petition that you desire of Him. Do you desire that Christ should dwell in your heart by faith? That is in accordance with His will. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%2016:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Ask and ye shall receive.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Do you desire that the might of God&rsquo;s Spirit shall accompany your ministry? That is according to the will of God. Continue in the presence of your heavenly Father, quietly reminding Him that this is what you desire, and He will not fail to give you the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Eph%203:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">exceeding abundantly above all you ask or think.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He will fill you with rivers&mdash;the blessed rivers of the Spirit&mdash;and flowing from the midst of you they will be blessings to all that are around. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the introduction to his second epistle Peter addresses <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Pet%201:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;them that have obtained </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">like precious faith</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4"> with us.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is written, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Psa%20125:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Have you this faith of divine origin springing up in your heart? It will make you steadfast and unmovable. This faith, this confidence, this trust in God, will have a transforming power; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Thes%205:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">changing and transforming spirit, soul, and body, sanctifying the entire being.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Rom%2010:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is God coming in by His Word and laying the solid foundation. Faith is like dynamite which bursts up the old life and nature by the power of God, and brings the almighty power of God into the life. This substance will diffuse through the whole being, bringing everything else into insignificance. The Word of God is formed within the temple. Jeremiah spoke of the Word as a <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Jer%2020:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;fire within.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is a power stronger than granite that is able to resist the mightiest pressure the devil can bring against it. Faith counts on God&#39;s coming forth to confound the enemy. Faith counts on the display of God&#39;s might, when it is needful for Him to come forth in power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In these eventful days we must not be content with a mere theory of faith, but must have this almighty and precious faith within us so that we may move from the ordinary into the extraordinary. We must expect Him to come forth in power through us for the deliverance of others. Peter spoke of it as <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Pet%201:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;like precious faith.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is a like kind to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Rom%204:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">that which Abraham had</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&mdash;the very faith of God. When Peter and John said to the lame man, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%203:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Such as we have we give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> there was a manifestation of the same faith that Abraham had. It is this like precious faith God wants us to have. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the former days the prophets received the Holy Spirit in a certain measure, but <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%203:34')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the Holy Spirit was given to the Lord Jesus Christ without measure.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Did not He give the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost in this same measureless measure? That is His thought for you and me. Since I received the mighty Baptism in the Holy Spirit God has flooded my life with His power. From time to time there have been wonderful happenings&mdash;to Him be all the glory. Faith in God will bring the operation of the Spirit and we&rsquo;ll have the divine power flooding the human vessel and flowing out in blessing to others. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Faith is made in hard places when we are at wit&#39;s-end corner, and there seems no way out of our adversity. David said at one time, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Psa%2018:4-5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. The sorrows of hell compassed me about.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He tells us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Psa%2018:6,%209')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple... he bowed the heavens... and came down.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Faith cries to God in the place of testing. It is in these places that God. enlarges us and brings us forth into a large place, to prove Himself the God of deliverances, the One who is indeed our helper. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I remember in the year 1920 after a most distressing voyage I went straight from the ship on which I had been traveling, to a meeting. As I entered the building a man fell down across the doorway in a fit. The Spirit of the Lord was upon me and I commanded the demon to leave. Some years later I visited this same assembly, and I ventured to ask if anyone remembered the incident. A man stood up and I told him to come to the platform. He told me that on that day he had been delivered by the name of Jesus and had not had a fit since. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read in Acts 10.38 that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%2010:38')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;God hath anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God wants us to have this same anointing and same power. through the indwelling Christ and through a living faith. It was the Lord Himself who told us before He went away, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%2016:17-18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;These signs shall follow them that believe. In my name they shall cast out demons... they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God is waiting to manifest His divine power through believers. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I remember a man coming to me suffering with cancer, who said he had been twelve years in pain. The power of the Lord was present to heal, and that night he came back to the meeting with all his sores dried up. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In this second epistle of Peter we further read, &lt;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Pet%201:3-4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;According to his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">partakers of the divine nature</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Believe the record. His divine power has provided this life and godliness and virtue. Believe for the virtue of the Lord to be so manifested through your body that as men touch you they are healed. Believe for the current to go through you to others. It is amazing what can happen when some necessity arises when there is no time to pray, only to act. It is in such times of necessity that the Holy Ghost comes forth to act. We must so live in God that the Spirit of God can operate through us. I remember being in one place where there were 6,000 people outside the building where we were preaching. Many of them were in chairs, waiting for hands to be laid on them and the prayer of faith to be offered. Oh for the virtue that flowed from Christ to touch the needy everywhere! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A woman said to Christ one time, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%2011:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But he answered, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%2011:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Yea rather, blessed are they hath hear the word of God, and keep it.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Rom%2010:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">It is through the hearing of the Word of God that faith comes,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and faith brings the omnipotence of God to helpless souls and brings the virtue of Christ to the sick and to the needy. Do you remember how they asked the Lord, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%206:28-29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;What shall we do that we might work the works of God?&quot; Jesus answered and said unto them, &quot;This is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He further said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%2014:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The works that I do shall ye do also: and greater works than these shall ye do; because I go unto my Father.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2017:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">There is nothing impossible to faith.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in Orebro 12 years ago I ministered to a girl who was twelve years old, and blind. When I last went to Orebro they told me that she had had perfect sight from that day. The Lord Himself challenges us to believe Him when He says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%2011:22-23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Have faith in God. Verily, I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Did you get that? &quot;</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">He shall have whatsoever he saith.</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot; When you speak in faith your desire is an accomplished thing. Our Lord further said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%2011:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In one place a man said to me, &quot;You helped a good many today, but you have not helped me.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said, &quot;What is the trouble?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He said, &quot;I cannot sleep, and I am losing my reason.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to him, &quot;Believe.&quot; And then I told him to go home and sleep, and I told him I would believe God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He went home and his wife said to him, &quot;Well, did you see the preacher?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">And he said, &quot;He helped everyone but me.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">However, he fell asleep. His wife said, &quot;I wonder if it is all right.&quot; Morning, noon, and night he was still asleep, but he woke bright and happy, rested and restored. What had brought about this restoration?

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:14-15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have in this precious word a real basis for the truth of healing. In this scripture God gives very definite instructions to the sick. If you are sick, your part is to call for the elders of the church; it is their part to anoint and pray for you in faith, and then the whole situation rests with the Lord. When you have been anointed and prayed for, you can rest assured that the Lord will raise you up. It is the word of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe that we all can see that the church cannot play with this business. If any turn away from these clear instructions they are in a place of tremendous danger. Those who refuse to obey, do so to their unspeakable loss. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">James tells us in connection with this, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:19-20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his ways shall save a soul from death.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Many turn away from the Lord, as did <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Chr%2016:12')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">King Asa, who sought the physicians in his sickness and consequently died;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and I take it that this passage means that if one induces another to turn back to the Lord, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">he will save such from death and God will forgive a multitude of sins</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> that they have committed. This scripture can also have a large application on the line of salvation. If you turn away from any part of God&#39;s truth, the enemy will certainly get an advantage over you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Does the Lord meet those who look to Him for healing and obey the instructions set forth in James? Most assuredly. Let me tell you a story to show how He will undertake for the most extreme case. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day I had been visiting the sick, and was with a friend of mine, an architect, when I saw a young man from his office coming down the road in a car, and holding in his hand a telegram. It contained a very urgent request that we go immediately to pray for a man who was dying. We went off in an auto as fast as possible and in about an hour and a half reached a large house in the country where the man who was dying resided. There were two staircases in that house, and it was extremely convenient, for the doctors could go up and down one, and my friend and I could go up and down the other, and so we had no occasion to meet. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I found on arrival that it was a case of this sort. The man&#39;s body had been broken, he was ruptured, and his bowels had been punctured in two places. The discharge from the bowels had formed abscesses, and blood poisoning had set in. The man&#39;s face had turned green. Two doctors were in attendance, but they saw that the case was beyond their power. They had telegraphed to London for a great specialist, and, when we arrived, they were at the railway station awaiting his arrival. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The man was very near death and could not speak. I said to his wife, &quot;If you desire, we will anoint and pray for him.&quot; She said, &quot;That is why I sent for you.&quot; I anointed him in the name of the Lord and asked the Lord to raise him up. Apparently there was no change. God often hides what He does. From day to day we find that God is doing wonderful things, and we receive reports of healings that have taken place that we heard nothing about at the time of our meetings. Only last night a woman came into the meeting suffering terribly. Her whole arm was filled with poison, and her blood was so poisoned that it was certain to bring her to her death. We rebuked the thing, and she was here this morning and told us that she was without pain and had slept all night, a thing she had not done for two months. To God be all the praise. You will find He will do this kind of thing all along. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As soon as we anointed and prayed for this brother we went down the back staircase and the three doctors came up the front staircase. As we arrived downstairs, I said to my friend who had come with me, &quot;Friend, let me have hold of your hands.&quot; We held each other&#39;s hands, and I said to him, &quot;Look into my face and let us agree together, according to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2018:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Matthew 18:19</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, that this man shall be brought out of this death.&quot; We laid the whole matter before God, and said, &quot;Father, we believe.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Then the conflict began. The wife came down to us and said, &quot;The doctors have got all their instruments out and they are about to operate.&quot; I cried, &quot;What? Look here, he&#39;s your husband, and I tell you this, if those men operate on him, he will die. Go back and tell them you cannot allow it.&quot; She went back to the doctors and said, &quot;Give me ten minutes.&quot; They said, &quot;We can&#39;t afford to, the man is dying and it is your husband&#39;s only chance.&quot; She said, &quot;I want ten minutes, and you don&#39;t touch his body until I have had them.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They went downstairs by one staircase and we went up by the other. I said to the woman, &quot;This man is your husband, and he cannot speak for himself. It is now the time for you to put your whole trust in God and prove Him wholly true. You can save him from a thousand doctors. You must stand with God and for God in this critical hour.&quot; After that, we came down and the doctors went up. The wife faced those three doctors and said, &quot;You shan&#39;t touch this man&#39;s body. He is my husband. I am sure that if you operate on him he will die, but he will live if you don&#39;t touch him.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Suddenly the man in bed spoke. &quot;God has done it,&quot; he said. They rolled back the bedclothes and the doctors examined him, and the abscesses were cut clear away. The nurse cleaned the place where they had been. The doctors could see the bowels still open and they said to the wife, &quot;We know that you have great faith, and we can see that a miracle has taken place. But you must let us unite these broken parts and put in silver tubes, and we know that your husband will be all right after that, and it need not interfere with your faith at all.&quot; She said to them, &quot;God has done the first thing and He can do the rest. No man shall touch him now.&quot; And God healed the whole thing. And that man is well and strong today. I can give his name and address to any who want it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you ask by what power this was done? I would answer in the words of Peter, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%203:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;His name, </span><span class="cs449DA3AB">through faith in His name, made this man strong.</span><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The anointing was done in the name of the Lord. And it is written, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The LORD shall raise him up.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And He provides the double cure; even if sin has been the cause of the sickness, His Word declares, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;If he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You ask, &quot;What is faith?&quot; Faith is the principle of the Word of God. The Holy Spirit, who inspired the Word, is called the Spirit of Truth, and, as we receive with meekness the engrafted Word, faith springs in our heart&mdash;faith in the sacrifice of Calvary; faith in the shed blood of Jesus; faith in the fact that He took our weakness upon Himself, has borne our sicknesses and carried our pains, and that He is our life today. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has chosen us to help one another. We dare not be independent. He brings us to a place where we <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Eph%205:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">submit ourselves to one another.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If we refuse to do this, we get away from the Word of God and out of the place of faith. I have been in this place once and I trust I shall never be there again. I went one time to a meeting. I was very, very sick, and I got worse and worse. I knew the perfect will of God was for me to humble myself and ask the elders to pray for me. I put it off and the meeting finished. I went home without being anointed and prayed with, and everyone in the house caught the thing I was suffering with. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">My boys did not know anything else but to trust the Lord as the family Physician, and my youngest boy, George, cried out from the attic, &quot;Dadda, come.&quot; I cried, &quot;I cannot come. The whole thing is from me. I shall have to repent and ask the Lord to forgive me.&quot; I made up my mind to humble myself before the whole church. Then I rushed to the attic and laid my hands on my boy in the name of Jesus. I placed my hands on his head and the pain left and went lower down; he cried again, &quot;Put your hands still lower.&quot; At last the pain went right down to the feet and as I placed my hand on the feet he was completely delivered. Some evil power had evidently gotten hold and as I laid my hands on the different parts of the body it left. (We have to see the difference between anointing the sick and casting out demons.) God will always be gracious when we humble ourselves before Him and come to a place of brokenness of spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was at a place one time ministering to a sick woman, and she said, &quot;I&#39;m very sick. I become all right for an hour, and then I have another attack.&quot; I saw that it was an evil power that was attacking her, and I learned something in that hour that I had never learned before. As I moved my hand down her body in the name of the Lord that evil power seemed to move just ahead of my hands and as I moved them down further and further the evil power went right out of her body and never returned. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was in Havre in France and the power of God was being mightily manifested. A Greek named Felix attended the meeting and became very zealous for God. He was very anxious to get all the Catholics he could to the meeting in order that they should see that God was graciously visiting France. He found a certain bed-ridden woman who was fixed in a certain position and could not move, and he told her about the Lord healing at the meetings and that he would get me to come if she wished. She said, &quot;My husband is a Catholic and he would never allow anyone who was not a Catholic to see me.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She asked her husband to allow me to come and told him what Felix had told her about the power of God working in our midst. He said, &quot;I will have no Protestant enter my house.&quot; She said, &quot;You know the doctors cannot help me, and the priests cannot help, won&#39;t you let this man of God pray for me?&quot; He finally consented and I went to the house. The simplicity of this woman and her child-like faith were beautiful to see. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I showed her my oil bottle and said to her, &quot;Here is oil. It is a symbol of the Holy Ghost. When that comes upon you, the Holy Ghost will begin to work, and the Lord will raise you up.&quot; And God did something the moment the oil fell upon her. I looked toward the window and I saw Jesus. (I have seen Him often. There is no painting that is a bit like Him: no artist can ever depict the beauty of my lovely Lord.) The woman felt the power of God in her body and cried, &quot;I&#39;m free, my hands are free, my shoulders are free, and oh, I see Jesus! I&#39;m free! I&#39;m free!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The vision vanished and the woman sat up in bed. Her legs were still bound, and I said to her, &quot;I&#39;ll put my hands over your legs and you will be free entirely.&quot; And as I put my hands on those legs covered with bedclothes, I looked and saw the Lord again. She saw Him too and cried, &quot;He&#39;s there again. I&#39;m free! I&#39;m free!&quot; She rose from her bed and walked round the room praising God, and we were all in tears as we saw His wonderful works. The Lord shall raise them up when conditions are met. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was a young man I always loved the fellowship of old men, and was always careful to hear what they had to say. I had a friend, an old Baptist minister who was a wonderful preacher. I spent much of my time with him. One day he came to me and said, &quot;My wife is dying.&quot; I said, &quot;Brother Clark, why don&#39;t you believe God? God can raise her up if you will only believe Him.&quot; He asked me to come to his house, and I looked for someone to go with me. I went to a certain rich man who was very zealous for God, and spent much money in opening up rescue missions, and I asked him to go with me. He said, &quot;Never you mind me. You go yourself, but I don&#39;t take to this kind of business.&quot; Then I thought of a man who could pray by the hour. When he was on his knees he could go round the world three times and come out at the same place. I asked him to go with me and said to him, &quot;You&#39;ll have a real chance this time. Keep at it, and quit when you&#39;re through.&quot; (Some go on after they are through.) </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Brother Nichols, for that was his name, went with me and started praying. He asked the Lord to comfort the husband in his great bereavement and prayed for the orphans and a lot more on this line. I cried, &quot;O my God, stop this man.&quot; But there was no stopping him and he went on praying and there was not a particle of faith in anything he uttered. He did stop at last, and I said, &quot;Brother Clark, it&#39;s now your turn to pray. He started, &quot;Lord, answer the prayer of my brother and comfort me in this great bereavement and sorrow. Prepare me to face this great trial.&quot; I cried out, &quot;My God, stop this man.&quot; The whole atmosphere was being charged with unbelief. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I had a glass bottle full of oil and I went up to the woman and poured the whole lot on her in the name of Jesus. Suddenly Jesus appeared, standing at the foot of the bed. He smiled and vanished. The woman stood up, perfectly healed, and she is a strong woman today. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have a big God. We have a wonderful Jesus. We have a glorious Comforter. God&#39;s canopy is over you and will cover you at all times, preserving you from evil. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Psa%2091:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Under His wings shalt thou trust.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Word of God is living and powerful and in its treasures you will find eternal life. If you dare trust this wonderful Lord, this Lord of life, you will find in Him everything you need. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So many are tampering with drugs, quacks, pills and plasters. Clear them all out and believe God. It is sufficient to believe God. You will find that if you dare trust Him, He will never fail. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the LORD shall raise him up.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Do you trust Him? He is worthy to be trusted. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was one time asked to go to Weston-super-mare, a seaside resort in the West of England. I learned from a telegram that a man has lost his reason and had become a raving maniac, and they wanted me to go to pray for him. I arrived at the place, and the wife said to me, &quot;Will you sleep with my husband?&quot; I agreed, and in the middle of the night an evil power laid hold of him. It was awful. I put my hand on his head and his hair was like a lot of sticks. God gave deliverance&mdash;a temporary deliverance. At 6 o&#39;clock the next morning, I felt that is was necessary that I should get out of the house for a short time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The man saw me going and cried out, &quot;If you leave me, there is no hope.&quot; But I felt that I had to go. As I went out I saw a woman with a Salvation Army bonnet on and I knew that she was going to their 7 o&#39;clock prayer meeting. I said to the Captain who was in charge of the meeting, when I saw he was about to give a hymn, &quot;Captain, don&#39;t sing. Let&#39;s get to prayer.&quot; He agreed, and I prayed my heart out, and then I grabbed my hat and rushed out of the hall. They all thought they had a madman in their prayer meeting that morning. I saw the man I had spent the night with, rushing down toward the sea, without a particle of clothing on, about to drown himself. I cried, &quot;In the name of Jesus, come out of him!&quot; The man fell full length on the ground and that evil power went out of him never to return. His wife came rushing after him, and the husband was restored to her in a perfect mental condition. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There are evil powers, but Jesus is greater than all evil powers. There are tremendous diseases, but Jesus is healer. There is no case too hard for Him. The Lion of Judah shall break every chain. He came to relieve the oppressed and to set the captive free. He came to bring redemption, to make us as perfect as man was before the fall. People want to know how to be kept by the power of God. Every position of grace into which you are led&mdash;forgiveness, healing, deliverance of any kind&mdash;will be contested by Satan. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Jude%201:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He will contend for your body.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> When you are saved, Satan will come round and say, &quot;See, you are not saved.&quot; The devil is a liar. If he says you are not saved, it is a sure sign that you are. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You will remember <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%2011:24-26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the story of the man who was swept and garnished.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The evil power had been swept out of him. But the man remained in a stationary position. If the Lord heals you, you dare not remain in a stationary position. The evil spirit came back to that man and found the house swept, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%2011:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and took seven others worse than himself, and the last state of that man was worse than the first.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Be sure to get filled with God. Get the Occupier. Be filled with the Spirit. God has a million ways of undertaking for those who go to Him for help. He has deliverance for every captive. He loves you so much that He even says, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Isa%2065:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Before they call, I will answer.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Don&#39;t turn Him away. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, October 17, 1942.</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ said to His disciples just before He ascended, &ldquo;Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto Me.&rdquo; On the day of Pentecost He sent the power, and the remainder of the Acts of the Apostles tells of the witnessing of these Spirit-filled disciples, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord Jesus is just the same today. The anointing is just the same. The Pentecostal experience is just the same, and we are to look for like results as set forth in Luke&rsquo;s record of what happened in the days of the early church. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">John the Baptist said concerning Jesus, &ldquo;He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s ministers are to be a flame of fire&mdash;a perpetual flame, a constant fire, a continual burning, burning and shining lights. God has nothing less for us than to be flames. We must have a living faith in God, a faith that God&rsquo;s great might and power may flame through us until our whole life is energized by the power of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I realize that when the Holy Ghost comes, He comes to enable us to show forth Jesus Christ in all His glory, to make Him known as the One who heals today as in the days of old. The Baptism in the Spirit is to enable us to preach as they did at the beginning, through the power of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven and with the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit. Oh, if we would only let the Lord work in us, melting us until a new order arises, moved with His compassion! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was traveling from Egypt to Italy. God was wonderfully on that ship with me, and every hour I was conscious of His blessed presence. A man on the ship suddenly collapsed and his wife was terribly alarmed, and everybody else seenied to be. Some said that he was about to expire. But I saw it was just a glorious opportunity for the power of God to be manifested. Oh, what it means to be a flame of fire, to be indwelt by the living Christ! We are a back number if we have to pray for power when an occasion like that comes, or if we have to wait until we feel a sense of His presence. The Lord&rsquo;s promise was, &ldquo;Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you,&rdquo; and if we will believe, the power of God will be always manifested when there is a definite need. When you exercise your faith, you will find that there is a greater power than there is in the world. Oh, to be awakened out of unbelief into a place of daring for God on the authority of His blessed Book! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">So right there on board that ship, in the name of Jesus I rebuked the devil, and to the astonishment of the man&rsquo;s wife and the man himself, he was able to stand. He said, &ldquo;What is this? It is going all over me. I have never felt anything like this before.&rdquo; From the top of his head to the soles of his feet the power of God shook him. God has given us authority over all the power of the devil. Oh, that we may live in the place where we realize this always! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Christ, who is the express image of God, has come to our human weaknesses, to change them and us into divine likeness, to be partakers of the divine nature, so that by the power of His might we may not only overcome, but rejoice in the fact that we are more than conquerors. God wants you to know by experience what it means to be </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">more</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> than a conqueror. The Baptism in the Holy Spirit has come for nothing less than to empower us, to give the very power that Christ Himself had, so that you, a yielded vessel, may continue the same type of ministry that He had when He walked this earth in the days of His flesh. He purposes that we should come behind in no gift. There are gifts of healing and the working of miracles, but we must apprehend these. There is the gift of faith by the same Spirit which we are to receive. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The need in the world today is that we should be burning and shining lights to reflect the glory of Christ. We cannot do it with a cold indifferent experience, and we never shall. His servants are to be flames of fire. Christ came that we might have life, and life more abundantly. And we are to give that life to others, to be ministers of the life and power and healing virtue of Jesus Christ wherever we go. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some years ago I was in Ceylon. In one place the folk complained, &ldquo;Four days is not much to give us.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but it is a good share.&rdquo; They said to me, &ldquo;We are not touching the people here at all.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Can you have a meeting early in the morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; They said they would. So I said, &ldquo;Tell all the mothers who want their babies to be healed to come, and all the people over seventy to come, and after that we hope to give an address to the people to make them ready for the Baptism in the Spirit.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It would have done you good to see the four hundred mothers coming at eight o&rsquo;clock with their babies, and then to see the hundred and fifty old people, with their white hair, coming to be healed. We need to have something more than smoke to touch the people; we need to be a burning fire for God. His ministers must be flames of fire. In those days there were thousands out to hear the Word of God. I believe there were about three thousand persons crying for mercy at once. It was a great sight. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">From that first morning on the meetings grew to such an extent that I would estimate every time some 5,000 to 6,000 gathered; and I had to preach in a temperature of 110 degrees. Then I had to pray for these people who were sick. But I can tell you, a flame of fire can do anything. Things change in the fire. This was Pentecost. But what moved me more than anything else was this: there were hundreds who tried to touch me, they were so impressed with the power of God that was present. And many testified that with the touch they were healed, It was not that there was any virtue in me&mdash;the people&rsquo;s faith was exercised as it was at Jerusalem when they said Peter&rsquo;s shadow would heal them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You can receive something in three minutes that you can carry with you into glory. What do you want? Is anything too hard for God? God can meet you now. God sees inwardly, He knows all about you. Nothing is hidden from Him, and He can satisfy the soul and give you a spring of eternal blessing that will carry you right through. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

(Published 1924.)</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:1-24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">John 5:1-24.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe the word of God is so powerful that it can transform any and every life. There is power in God&rsquo;s word to make that which does not appear to appear. There is executive power in the word that proceeds from His lips. The psalmist tells us, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Ps%20107:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;He sent His word and healed them&quot;;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and do you think that word has diminished in its power? I tell you nay, but God&rsquo;s word can bring things to pass today as of old. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The psalmist said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Ps%20119:67')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept Thy word.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And again, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Ps%20119:71')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn Thy statutes.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And if our afflictions will bring us to the place where we see that we <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">cannot live by bread alone</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, but must partake of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%204:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> they will have served a blessed purpose. But I want you to realize that there is a life of purity, a life made clean through the word He has spoken, in which, through faith, you can glorify God with a body that is free from sickness, as well as with a spirit set free from the bondage of Satan. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Here they lay, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, around the pool, waiting for the moving of the water.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Did Jesus heal everybody? He left many around that pool unhealed. There were doubtless many who had their eyes on the pool and who had no eyes for Jesus. There are many today who have their confidence all the time in things seen. If they would only get their eyes on God instead of on natural things, how quickly they would be helped. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The question arises, is salvation and healing for all? It is for all who will press right in and get their portion. You remember the case of that Syrophenician woman who wanted the devil cast out of her daughter. Jesus said to her, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%207:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children&#39;s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Note, healing, and deliverance are here spoken of by the Master as &ldquo;the children&#39;s bread&quot;; so, if you are a child of God, you can surely press in for your portion. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Syrophenician woman purposed to get from the Lord what she was after, and she said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%207:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children&#39;s crumbs.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus was stirred as He saw the faith of this woman, and He told her, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%207:29')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Today there are many children of God refusing their blood-purchased portion of health in Christ and are throwing it away, while sinners are pressing through and picking it up from under the table, as it were, and are finding the cure not only for their bodies, but for their spirits and souls as well. The Syrophenician woman went home and found that the devil had indeed gone out of her daughter. Today there is bread, there is life, and there is health for every child of God through his all-powerful Word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Word can drive every disease away from your body. It is your portion in Christ, Him who is our bread, our life, our health, our all in all. And though you may be deep in sin, you can come to Him in repentance, and he will forgive and cleanse and will receive them. There is a promise in the last verse in Joel, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Joel%203:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This is as much as to say He will provide new life within. The life of Jesus Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, can so purify men&#39;s hearts and minds that they become entirely transformed, spirit, soul and body. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There they are round the pool; and this man had been there a long time. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">His infirmity was of thirty-eight years standing.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Now and again an opportunity would come, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">as the angel stirred the waters,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but his heart would be made sick as he saw <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">another step in</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and be healed before him. But one day Jesus was passing that way, and seeing him lying there in that sad condition, enquired, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Wilt thou be made whole?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus said it, and His word is from everlasting to everlasting. This is His word to you, poor, tried and tested one today. You may say, like this poor impotent man, &ldquo;I have missed every opportunity up till now.&rdquo; Never mind about that&mdash;</span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Wilt thou be made whole?</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I visited a woman who had been suffering for many years. She was all twisted up with rheumatism and had been two years in bed. I said to her, &ldquo;What makes you lie here?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I have <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Cor%2012:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">a thorn in the flesh.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;To what wonderful degree of righteousness have you attained that you have to have a thorn in the flesh? Have you had <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Cor%2012:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">such an abundance of divine revelations that there is danger of your being exalted above measure?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> She said, &ldquo;I believe it is the Lord who is causing me to suffer.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You believe it is the Lord&#39;s will for you to suffer, and you are trying to get out of it as quickly as you can. There are doctor&#39;s bottles all over the place. Get out of your hiding place and confess that you are a sinner. If you&#39;ll get rid of your self- righteousness, God will do something for you. Drop the idea that you are so holy that God has got to afflict you. Sin is the cause of your sickness and not righteousness. Disease is not caused by righteousness, but by sin.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is healing through the blood of Christ and deliverance for every captive. God never intended His children to live in misery because of some affliction that comes directly from the devil. A perfect atonement was made at Calvary. I believe that Jesus bore my sins, and I am free from them all. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%2013:39')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">I am justified from all things if I dare believe.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%208:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and if I dare believe, I can be healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">See this poor, helpless man at the pool. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Wilt thou be made whole?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But there is a difficulty in the way. The man has one eye on the pool and one eye on Jesus. There are many people getting cross-eyed this way these days; they have one eye on the doctor and one on Jesus. If you will only look to Christ and put both your eyes on Him you can be made every whit whole, spirit, soul and body. It is the word of the living God that they that believe should be justified, made free from all things. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%208:36')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And whom the Son sets free is free indeed.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">You say, &ldquo;Oh, if I only could believe!&rdquo; He understands. Jesus knew he had been a long time in that case. He is full of compassion. He knows that kidney trouble, He knows those corns, and He knows that neuralgia. There is nothing he does not know. He only wants a chance to show Himself merciful and gracious to you. But He wants to encourage you to believe Him. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%209:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">If thou canst only believe,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> thou canst be saved and healed. Dare to believe that Jesus <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Isa%2053:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">was wounded for your transgressions, was bruised for your iniquities, was chastised that you might have peace, and that by His stripes there is healing</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> for you right here and now. You have failed because you have not believed Him. Cry out to Him even now, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%209:24')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was in Long Beach, California one day, and with a friend, was passing a hotel. He told me of a doctor there who had a diseased leg; that he had been suffering from it for six years, and could not get out. We went up to his room and found four doctors there. I said, &ldquo;Well, doctor, I see you have plenty on, I&#39;ll call again another day.&rdquo; I was passing at another time, and the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Go join thyself to him.&rdquo; Poor doctor! He surely was in a bad condition. He said, &ldquo;I have been like this for six years, and nothing human can help me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You need God Almighty.&rdquo; People are trying to patch up their lives; but you cannot do anything without God. I talked to him for a while about the Lord, and then prayed for him. I cried, &ldquo;Come out of him, in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; The doctor cried, &ldquo;It&#39;s all gone!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, if we only knew Jesus! One touch of His mightiness meets the need of every crooked thing. The trouble is to get people to believe Him. The simplicity of this salvation is so wonderful. One touch of living faith in Him is all that is required, and wholeness is your portion. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was in Long Beach about six weeks later, and the sick were coming for prayer. Among those filling up the aisle was the doctor. I said, &ldquo;What is the trouble?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Diabetes, but it will be all right tonight. I know it will be all right.&rdquo; There is no such thing as the Lord not meeting your need. There are no ifs or may&rsquo;s; His promises are all shall&rsquo;s. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('mark%209:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All things are possible to him that believeth.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Oh, the name of Jesus! There is power in that name to meet every condition of human need. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At that meeting there was an old man helping his son to the altar. He said, &ldquo;He has fits&mdash;many every day.&rdquo; Then there was a woman with a cancer. Oh, what sin has done! We read that, when God brought forth His people from Egypt, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Ps%20105:37')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;there was not one feeble person among their tribes.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> No disease! All healed by the power of God! I believe that God wants a people like that today. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I prayed for the sister who had the cancer and she said, &ldquo;I know I&#39;m free and that God has delivered me.&rdquo; Then they brought the boy with the fits, and I commanded the evil spirits to leave, in the name of Jesus. Then I prayed for the doctor. At the next night&#39;s meeting the house was full. I called out, &ldquo;Now, doctor, what about the diabetes?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It has gone.&rdquo; Then I said to the old man, &ldquo;What about your son?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;He hasn&#39;t had any fits since.&rdquo; We have a God who answers prayer. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus meant this man at the pool to be a testimony forever. When he had both eyes on Jesus, He said to him, &ldquo;Do the impossible thing. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Jesus called on the man with the withered hand to do the impossible&mdash;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%206:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to stretch forth his hand.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The man did the impossible thing&mdash;he stretched out his hand, and it was made every whit whole. And so with this impotent man&mdash;he began to rise, and he found the power of God moving within. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He wrapped up his bed and began to walk off. It was the Sabbath day,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and there were some of those folks around who think much more of a day than they do of the Lord; and they began to make a fuss. When the power of God is in manifestation, a protest will always come from some hypocrites. Jesus knew all about what the man was going through, and met him again; and this time He said to him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a close relationship between sin and sickness. How many know that their sickness is a direct result of sin? I hope that no one will come to be prayed for who is living in sin. But if you will obey God and repent of your sin and quit it, God will meet you, and neither your sickness nor your sin will remain. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise Him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Faith is just the open door through which the Lord comes. Do not say, &ldquo;I was healed by faith.&rdquo; Faith does not save. God saves through that open door. Healing comes the same way. You believe, and the healing comes the same way. You believe, and the virtue of Christ comes. Healing is for the glory of God. I am here because God healed me when I was dying; and I have been all around the world preaching this full redemption, doing all I can to bring the glory to the wonderful name of Jesus, through whom I was healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord told us in one place about an evil spirit going out from a man. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2012:44')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The house that he left got all swept and garnished,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but it received no new occupant. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2012:45')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And that evil spirit, with seven other spirits more wicked than himself, went back to that unoccupied house, and the last stage of the man was worse than the first.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord does not heal you to go to a baseball game or to a race meet. He heals you for His glory and that from henceforth your life shall glorify Him. But this man remained stationary. He did not magnify God. He did not seek to be filled with the Spirit. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2012:45')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">And his last state became worse than the first.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord would so cleanse the motive and desires of our hearts that we will seek but one thing only, and that is, His glory. I went to a certain place one day and the Lord said, &ldquo;This is for My glory.&rdquo; A young man had been sick for a long time confined to his bed in an utterly hopeless condition. He was fed only with a spoon, and was never dressed. The weather was damp, and so I said to the people of the house, &ldquo;I wish you would put the young man&#39;s clothes by the fire to air.&rdquo; At first they would not take any notice of my request, but because I was persistent, they at last got out his clothes, and, when they were aired, I took them into his room. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Lord said to me, &ldquo;You will have nothing to do with this;&rdquo; and I just lay out prostrate on the floor. The Lord showed me that He was going to shake the place with His glory. The very bed shook. I laid my hands on the young man in the name of Jesus, and the power fell in such a way that I fell on my face to the floor. In about a quarter of an hour the young man got up and walked up and down praising God. He dressed himself and then went out to the room where his father and mother were. He said, &ldquo;God has healed me.&rdquo; Both the father and mother fell prostate to the floor as the power of God surged through that room. There was a woman in that house who had been in an asylum for lunacy, and her condition was so bad that they were about to take her back. But the power of God healed her, too. The power of God is just the same today as of old. Men need to be taken back to the old paths, to the old-time faith, to believe God&rsquo;s Word and every &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord&rdquo; therein. The Spirit of the Lord is moving in these days. God is coming forth. If you want to be in the rising tide, you must accept all God has said. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%205:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Wilt thou be made whole?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is Jesus who asks it.

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, 21 April 1945.</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read in the Word that </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">by faith</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain; </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">by faith</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Enoch was translated that he should not see death; </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">by faith</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Noah prepared an ark to the saving of his house; </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">by faith</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed. There is only one way to all the treasures of God, and that is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">the way of faith</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. All things are possible, the fulfilling or all promises, to </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">him that believeth</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. And it is all by grace. &ldquo;By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not or yourselves: it is the gift of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There will be failure in our lives if we do not build on the base, the Rock Christ Jesus. He is the only way. He is the truth. He is the life. And the Word He gives us is life-giving. As we receive the Word of life, it quickens, it opens, it fills us, it moves us, it changes us; and it brings us into a place where we dare to say Amen to all that God has said. Beloved, there is a lot in an &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; You never get any place until you have the Amen inside of you. That was the difference between Zacharias and Mary. When the word came to Zacharias he was filled with unbelief until the angel said, &ldquo;Thou shalt be dumb... because thou believest not my words.&rdquo; Mary said, &ldquo;Be it unto me according to thy word.&rdquo; And the Lord was pleased that she believed that there would be a performance. When we believe what God has said, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">there shall be a performance</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read the 12th chapter of Acts, and you will find that there were people waiting all night and praying that Peter might come out of prison. But there seemed to be one thing missing despite all their praying, and that was faith. Rhoda had more faith than all the rest of them. When the knock came at the door, she ran to it for she was expecting an answer to her prayers; and the moment she heard Peter&rsquo;s voice, she ran back and announced to them that Peter was standing at the door. And all the people said, &ldquo;You are mad. It isn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo; That was not faith. When she insisted that he was there, they said, &ldquo;Well, perhaps God has sent his angel.&rdquo; But Rhoda insisted, &ldquo;It is Peter.&rdquo; And Peter continued knocking. And they went out and found it so. What Rhoda had believed for had become a glorious fact. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Beloved, we may do much praying and groaning, but we do not receive from God because of that; we receive because we believe. And yet sometimes it takes God a long time to bring us through the groaning and the crying before we can believe. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I know this, that no man by his praying can change God&mdash;for you cannot change Him. Finney said, &ldquo;Can a man who is full of sin and all kinds of ruin in his life, change God when he starts to pray?&rdquo; No, it is impossible. But when a man labors in prayer, he groans and travails because his tremendous sin is weighing him down, and he becomes broken in the presence of God; and when properly melted he comes into perfect harmony with the divine plan of God, and then God can work in that clay. He could not before. Prayer changes hearts, but it never changes God. He is the same yesterday, and today, and for ever&mdash;full of love, full of compassion, full of mercy, full of grace, and ready to bestow this and communicate that to us as we come in faith to Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Believe that when you come into the presence of God you can have all you came for. You can take it away, and you can use it, for all the power of God is at your disposal in response to your faith. The price for all was paid by the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary. Oh, He is the living God, the One who has power to change us! &ldquo;It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.&rdquo; And He purposes to transform us so that the greatness of His power may work through us. Oh, beloved! God delights in us, and when a man&rsquo;s ways please the Lord, then He makes all things to move according to His own blessed purpose. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read in Hebrews 11.5, &ldquo;By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death.... Before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.&rdquo; I believe it is in the mind of God to prepare us for translation. But remember this, translation comes only on the lines of holy obedience and a walk according to the good pleasure of God. We are called to walk together with God through the Spirit. It is delightful to know that we can talk with God and hold communion with Him. Through this wonderful Baptism in the Spirit which the Lord gives us, He enables us to talk to Himself in a language that the Spirit has given, a language which no man understands but which He understands, a language of love. Oh, how wonderful it is to speak to Him in the Spirit, to let the Spirit lift, and lift and lift us until He takes us into the very presence of God! I pray that God by His Spirit may move all of us so that we walk with God, even as Enoch walked with Him. But beloved, it is a walk by faith and not by sight, a walk of believing the Word of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe there are two kinds of faith. All people are born with a natural faith, but God calls us to a supernatural faith which is a gift from Himself. In the 26th chapter of Acts Paul tells us of his call, how God spoke to him and told him to go to the Gentiles, &ldquo;to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">by faith that is in Me.</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo; The faith which was in Christ was by the Holy Spirit to be given to those who believed. Henceforth, as Paul yielded his life to God, he could say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo;&mdash;the faith of the Son of God communicated by the Spirit to the one who puts his trust in God and in His Son. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to show you the difference between our faith and the faith of Jesus. Our faith is limited and comes to an end. Most people have experienced coming to the place where they have said, &ldquo;Lord, I can go no further. I have gone so far, and I cannot go on.&rdquo; But God can help us and take us beyond this. I remember one night, being in the north of England and going around to see some sick people, I was taken into a house where there was a young woman lying on her bed, a very helpless case. Her reason was gone and many things were manifested that were absolutely Satanic, and I knew it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">She was a beautiful young woman. Her husband was quite a young man. He came in with a baby in his arms, leaned over and kissed his wife. The moment he did so she threw herself over on the other side of the bed, just as a lunatic would do, with no consciousness of the presence of her husband. It was heart-breaking, The husband took the baby and pressed the baby&rsquo;s lips to the mother. Again there was a wild frenzy. I said, to the sister who was attending her, &ldquo;Have you anybody to help?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;We have done everything we could.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Have you no spiritual help?&rdquo; Her husband stormed and said, &ldquo;Spiritual help? Do you think we believe in God after we have had seven weeks of no sleep and this maniac condition? If you think we believe in God, you are mistaken. You have come to the wrong house.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There was a young woman about eighteen who grinned at me as she passed out of the door, as much as to say, &ldquo;You cannot do anything.&rdquo; But this brought me to a place of compassion for this poor young woman. And then with what faith I had I began to penetrate the heavens. I was soon out on the heights, and I tell you I never saw a man get anything from God who prayed on the earth level. If you get anything from God you will have to pray right into heaven, for all you want is there. If you are living an earthly life, all taken up with sensual things, and expect things from heaven, they will never come. God wants us to be a heavenly people, seated with Him in the heavenlies, and laying hold of all the things in heaven that are at our disposal. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I saw there, in the presence of that demented girl, limitations to my faith; but as I prayed there came another faith into my heart that could not be denied, a faith that grasped the promises, a faith that believed God&rsquo;s Word. I came from the presence of the glory back to earth. I was not the same man. I confronted the same conditions I had seen before, but in the name of Jesus. With a faith that could shake hell and move anything else, I cried to the demon power that was making this young woman a maniac, &ldquo;Come out of her, in the name of Jesus!&rdquo; She rolled over and fell asleep, and awakened in fourteen hours, perfectly sane and perfectly whole. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Enoch walked with God. During those many years of his life he was penetrating the heavens, laying hold of and believing God, living with such co-operation and such a touch of God upon him, that things moved on, earth and things moved in heaven. He became such a heavenly being that it was not possible for him to stay here any longer. Oh, hallelujah! I believe God wants to bring all of us into line with His will, so that we shall penetrate into the heavenlies and become so empowered that we shall see signs and wonders and divers gifts of the Holy Spirit in our midst. These are wonderful days&mdash;these days of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. You ask me, &ldquo;When would you have liked to come to earth?&rdquo; My answer is, &ldquo;Just now. It suits me beautifully to know that I can be filled with the Holy Spirit, that I can be a temple in which He dwells, and that through this temple there shall be a manifestation of the power of God that will bring glory to His name.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Enoch conversed with God. I want to live in constant conversation with God. I am so grateful that from my youth up, God has given me a relish for the Bible. I find the Bible food for my soul. It is strength to the believer. It builds up our character in God. And as we receive with meekness the Word of God, we are being changed by the Spirit from glory to glory. And by this Book comes faith, for faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. And we know that &ldquo;without faith it is impossible to please Him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe that all our failures come because of an imperfect understanding of God&rsquo;s Word. I see that it is impossible to please God on any other line but by faith, and everything that is not of faith is sin. You say, &ldquo;How can I obtain this faith?&rdquo; You see the secret in Hebrews 12.2, </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">&ldquo;Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.&rdquo;</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He is the author of faith. Oh, the might of our Christ who created the universe and upholds it all by the might of His power! God has chosen Him and ordained Him and clothed Him, and He who made this vast universe will make us a new creation. He spoke the word and the stars came into being, can He not speak the word that will produce a mighty faith in us? Ah, this One who is the author and finisher of our faith comes and dwells within us, quickens us by His Spirit, and molds us by His will. He comes to live His life of faith within us and to be to us all that we need. And He who has begun a good work within us will complete it and perfect it; for He not only is the author but the finisher and perfecter of our faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;The Word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.&rdquo; How the Word of God severs the soul and the spirit&mdash;the soul which has a lot of carnality, a lot of selfishness in it, a lot of evil in it! Thank God, the Lord can sever from us all that is earthly and sensual, and make us a spiritual people. He can bring all our selfishness to the place of death, and bring the life of Jesus into our being to take the place of that earthly and sensual thing that is destroyed by the living Word. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The living Word pierces right to the very marrow. When I was in Australia, so many people came to me with double curvature of the spine; but the word of the Lord came right down to the very marrow of their spines, and instantly they were healed and made straight, as I laid hands on them in the name of Jesus. The divine Son of God, the living Word, through His power, moved upon those curvatures of the spine and straightened them out. Oh, thank God for the mighty power of the Word! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Word of God comes in to separate us from everything that is not of God. It destroys. It also gives life. He must bring to death all that is carnal in us. It was after the death of Christ that God raised Him up on high, and as we are dead with Him we are raised up and made to sit in heavenly places in the new life that the Spirit gives. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has come to lead us out of ourselves into Himself, and to take us from the ordinary into the extraordinary, from the human into the divine, and make us after the image of His Son. Oh, what a Savior! What an ideal Savior! It is written, &ldquo;Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.&rdquo; But even now, the Lord wants to transform us from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the living God. Have faith in God, have faith in the Son, have faith in the Holy Spirit; and the Triune God will work in you, working in you to will and to do all the good pleasure of His will. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

Six people went into the house of a sick man to pray for him. He was an Episcopal vicar, and lay in bed utterly helpless, without even strength to help himself. He had read a little tract about healing and had heard about people praying for the sick, and sent for these friends, who, he thought, could pray the prayer of faith. He was anointed according to <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('James%205:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">James 5:14,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but, because he had no immediate manifestation of healing, he wept bitterly. The six people walked out of the room, somewhat crestfallen to see the man lying there in an unchanged condition. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When they were outside, one of the six said, &ldquo;There is one thing we might have done. I wish you would all go back with me and try it.&rdquo; They went back and all got together in a group. This brother said, &ldquo;Let us whisper the name of Jesus.&rdquo; At first when they whispered this worthy name nothing seemed to happen. But as they continued to whisper, &ldquo;Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!&rdquo; the power began to fall. As they saw that God was beginning to work, their faith and joy increased, and they whispered the name louder and louder. As they did so the man arose from his bed and dressed himself. The secret was just this, those six people had gotten their eyes off the sick man, and they were just taken up with the Lord Jesus Himself, and their faith grasped the power that there is in His name. O, if people would only appreciate the power that there is in this name, there is no telling what would happen. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I know that through His name and through the power of His name we have access to God. The very face of Jesus fills the whole place with glory. All over the world there are people magnifying that name, and o, what a joy it is for me to utter it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day I went up into the mountain to pray. I had a wonderful day. It was one of the high mountains of Wales. I heard of one man going up this mountain to pray, and the Spirit of the Lord met him so wonderfully that his face shone like that of an angel when he returned. Every one in the village was talking about it. As I went up to this mountain and spent the day in the presence of the Lord, His wonderful power seemed to envelop and saturate and fill me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Two years before this time there had come to our house two lads from Wales. They were just ordinary lads, but they became very zealous for God. They came to our mission and saw some of the works of God. They said to me, &ldquo;We would not be surprised if the Lord brings you down to Wales to raise our Lazarus.&rdquo; They explained that the leader of their assembly was a man who had spent his days working in a tin mine and his nights preaching, and the result was that he had collapsed, gone into consumption, and for four years he had been a helpless invalid, having to be fed with a spoon. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">While I was up on that mountain top I was reminded of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Mark%209:2-8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the transfiguration scene,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and I felt that the Lord&rsquo;s only purpose in taking us into the glory was to fit us for greater usefulness in the valley. </span></p><h5 class="cs39141F69">
							<span class="csC18E74A5">[At this point in the service someone (possibly Wigglesworth) spoke in prophetic tongues. The interpretation was: &ldquo;The living God has chosen us for His divine inheritance, and He it is who is preparing us for our ministry, that it may be of God and not of man.&rdquo;]</span></h5>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As I was on the mountain top that day, the Lord said to me, &ldquo;I want you to go and raise Lazarus.&rdquo; I told the brother who accompanied me of this, and when we got down to the valley, I wrote a postcard: &ldquo;When I was up on the mountain praying today, God told me that I was to go and raise Lazarus.&rdquo; I addressed the postcard to the man in the place whose name had been given to me by the two lads. When we arrived at the place we went to the man to whom I had addressed the card. He looked at me and said, &ldquo;Did you send this?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Do you think we believe in this? Here, take it.&rdquo; And he threw it at me. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The man called a servant and said, &ldquo;Take this man and show him Lazarus.&rdquo; Then he said to me, &ldquo;The moment you see him you will be ready to go home. Nothing will hold you.&rdquo; Everything he said was true from the natural viewpoint. The man was helpless. He was nothing but a mass of bones with skin stretched over them. There was no life to be seen. Everything in him spoke of decay. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to him, &ldquo;Will you shout? You remember that at Jericho <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Josh%206:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the people shouted while the walls were still up.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God has like victory for you if you will only believe.&rdquo; But I could not get him to believe. There was not an atom of faith there. He had made up his mind not to have anything. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is a blessed thing to learn that God&rsquo;s word can never fail. Never hearken to human plans. God can work mightily when you persist in believing Him in spite of discouragements from the human standpoint. When I got back to the man to whom I had sent the postcard, he asked, &ldquo;Are you ready to go now?&rdquo; I am not moved by what I see. I am </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">moved only by what I believe.</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> I know this: No man looks at appearances if he believes. No man considers how he feels if he believes. The man who believes God has it. Every man who comes into the Pentecostal condition can laugh at all things and believe God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is something in the Pentecostal work that is different from anything else in the world. Somehow, in Pentecost, you know that God is a reality. Wherever the Holy Ghost has right of way, the gifts of the Spirit will be in manifestation; and where these gifts are never in manifestation, I question whether He is present. Pentecostal people are spoiled for anything else than Pentecostal meetings. We want none of the entertainments that the churches are offering. When God comes in He entertains us Himself. </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">Entertained by the King of kings and Lord of lords!</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Oh, it is wonderful. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There were difficult conditions in that Welsh village, and it seemed impossible to get the people to believe. &ldquo;Ready to go home?&rdquo; I was asked. But a man and a woman there asked us to come and stay with them. I said, &ldquo;I want to know how many of you people can pray.&rdquo; No one wanted to pray. I asked if I could get seven people to pray with me for the poor man&rsquo;s deliverance. I said to the two people who were going to entertain us, &ldquo;I will count on you two, and there is my friend and myself, and we need three others.&rdquo; I told the people that I trusted that some of them would awaken to their privilege and come in the morning and join us in prayer for the raising of Lazarus. It will never do to give way to human opinions. If God says a thing, you are to believe it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I told the people that I would not eat anything that night. When I got to bed it seemed as if the devil tried to place on me everything that he had placed on that poor man in the bed. When I awoke I had a cough and all the weakness of a tubercular patient. I rolled out of bed on to the floor and cried out to God to deliver me from the power of the devil. I shouted loud enough to wake everybody in the house, but nobody was disturbed. God gave victory, and I got back into bed again as free as ever I was in my life. At 5 o&rsquo;clock the Lord awakened me and said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break bread until you break it round My table.&rdquo; At six o&rsquo;clock He gave me these words, &ldquo;And I will raise him up.&rdquo; I put my elbow into the fellow who was sleeping with me. He said, &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; I put my elbow into him again and said, &ldquo;Do you hear? The Lord says that He will raise him up.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At 8 o&rsquo;clock they said to me, &ldquo;Have a little refreshment.&rdquo; But I have found prayer and fasting the greatest joy, and you will always find it so when you are led by God. When we went to the house where Lazarus lived there were eight of us altogether. No one can prove to me that God does not always answer prayer. He always does </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">more</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> than that. He always gives the <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Eph%203:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">exceedingly abundant above all we ask or think.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I shall never forget how the power of God fell on us as we went into that sick man&rsquo;s room. O, it was lovely! As we circled round the bed I got one brother to hold one of the sick man&rsquo;s hands and I held the other; and we each held the hand of the person next to us. I said, &ldquo;We are not going to pray, we are just going to use the name of Jesus.&rdquo; We all knelt down and whispered that one word, &ldquo;Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!&rdquo; The power of God fell and then it lifted. Five times the power of God fell and then it remained. But the person who was in the bed was unmoved. Two years previous someone had come along and had tried to raise him up, and the devil had used his lack of success as a means of discouraging Lazarus. I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the devil says; if God says he will raise you up it must be so. Forget everything else except what God says about Jesus.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The sixth time the power fell and the sick man&rsquo;s lips began moving and the tears began to fall. I said to him, &ldquo;The power of God is here; it is yours to accept it.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I have been bitter in my heart, and I know I have grieved the Spirit of God. Here I am helpless. I cannot lift my hands, nor even lift a spoon to my mouth.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Repent, and God will hear you.&rdquo; He repented and cried out, &ldquo;O God, let this be to Thy glory.&rdquo; As he said this the virtue of the Lord went right through him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I have asked the Lord to never let me tell this story except as it was, for I realize that God cannot bless exaggerations. As we again said, &ldquo;Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!&rdquo; the bed shook, and the man shook. I said to the people that were with me, &ldquo;You can all go down stairs right away. This is all God. I&rsquo;m not going to assist him.&rdquo; I sat and watched that man get up and dress himself. We sang the doxology as he walked down the steps. I said to him, &ldquo;Now tell what has happened.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It was soon noised abroad that Lazarus had been raised up and the people came from Llanelly and all the district round to see him and hear his testimony. And God brought salvation to many. This man told right out in the open air what God had done, and as a result many were convicted and converted. All this came through the name of Jesus, through faith in His name, yea, the faith that is by Him gave this sick man perfect soundness in the presence of them all. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Peter and John were helpless, were illiterate, they had no college education. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%204:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">They had been with Jesus.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> To them had come a wonderful revelation of the power of the name of Jesus. They had handed out the bread and fish after Jesus had multiplied them. They had sat at the table with him and John had often gazed into His face. Peter had often to be rebuked, but Jesus manifested His love to Peter through it all. Yea, He loved Peter, the wayward one. O, He&rsquo;s a wonderful lover! I have been wayward, I have been stubborn, I had an unmanageable temper at one time, but how patient He has been. I am here to tell you that there is power in Jesus and in his wondrous name to transform anyone, to heal anyone. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">If you will see Him as God&rsquo;s Lamb, as God&rsquo;s beloved Son <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Isa%2053:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">who had laid upon Him the iniquity of us all,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> if only you will see that Jesus paid the whole price for our redemption that we might be free, you can enter into your purchased inheritance of salvation, of life and of power. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Poor Peter, and poor John! <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%203:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">They had no money!</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> But they had faith, they had the power of the Holy Ghost, they had God. You can have God even though you have nothing else. Even though you have lost your character you can have God. I have seen the worst men saved by the power of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was one day preaching about the name of Jesus and there was a man leaning against a lamppost, listening. It took a lamppost to enable him to keep on his feet. We had finished our open-air meeting, and the man was still leaning against the post. I asked him, &ldquo;Are you sick?&rdquo; He showed me his hand and I saw beneath his coat, he had a silver handled dagger. He told me that he was on his way to kill his unfaithful wife, but that he had heard me speaking about the power of the name of Jesus and could not get away. He said that he felt just helpless. I said, &ldquo;Get you down.&rdquo; And there on the square, with people passing up and down, he got saved. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I took him to my home and put on him a new suit. I saw that there was something in that man that God could use. He said to me the next morning, &ldquo;God has revealed Jesus to me; I see that all has been laid upon Jesus.&rdquo; I lent him some money, and he soon got together a wonderful little home. His faithless wife was living with another man, but he invited her back to the home that he had prepared for her. She came: and, where enmity and hatred had been before, the whole situation was transformed by love. God made that man a minister wherever he went. There is power in the name of Jesus everywhere. God can save to the uttermost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There comes before me a meeting we had in Stockholm that I shall ever bear in mind. There was a home for incurables there and one of the inmates was brought to the meeting. He had palsy and was shaking all over. He stood up before 3,000 people and came to the platform, supported by two others. The power of God fell on him as I anointed him in the name of Jesus. The moment I touched him he dropped his crutch and began to walk in the name of Jesus. He walked down the steps and round that great building in view of all the people. There is nothing that our God cannot do. He will do everything if you will dare to believe. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Someone said to me, &ldquo;Will you go to this Home for Incurables?&rdquo; They took me there on my rest day. They brought out the sick people into a great corridor and in one hour the Lord set about twenty of them free. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The name of Jesus is so marvelous. Peter and John had no conception of all that was in that name; neither had the man, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%203:2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">lame from his mother&rsquo;s womb, who was laid daily at the gate;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> but they had faith to say, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%203:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&ldquo;In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And as Peter <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%203:7-9')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">took him by the right hand, and lifted him up, immediately his feet and anklebones received strength, and he went into the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How can it be done? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%203:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Through His name, through faith in His name, through faith which is by Him.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

(Published 1924.)</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Read Luke 4:1-20. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Our precious Lord Jesus has everything for everybody. Forgiveness of sin, healing of diseases and the fullness of the Spirit all come from one source&mdash;from the Lord Jesus Christ. Hear Him who is the same yesterday, today and forever as He announces the purpose for which He came: &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus had been baptized by John in Jordan, and the Holy Spirit had descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him. Being full of the Holy Ghost, He had been led by the Spirit into the wilderness, there to come off more than conqueror over the arch enemy. Then He returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee and preached in the synagogues, and at last He came to His old home town&mdash;Nazareth, where He announced His mission in the words I have just quoted. For a brief while He ministered on the earth, and then gave His life a ransom for all. But God raised Him from the dead. And before He went to the glory He told His disciples that they too should receive the power of the Holy Ghost upon them. Thus, through them, His gracious ministry would continue. This power of the Holy Ghost was not only for a few apostles, but even for them that are afar off, even as many as our God should call even for us in this twentieth century. Some ask, &ldquo;But was not this power just for the privileged few in the first century?&rdquo; No. Read the Master&rsquo;s great commission as recorded by Mark, and you will see it is for </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">them that believe</span><span class="cs78AB3212">. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After I had received the Baptism of the Holy Ghost (and I know that I received; for the Lord gave me the Spirit in just the same way as He gave Him to the disciples at Jerusalem), I sought the mind of the Lord as to why I was baptized. One day I came home from work and went into the house and my wife asked me, &ldquo;Which way did you come in?&rdquo; I told her that I had come in at the back door. She said, &ldquo;There is a woman upstairs and she has brought an old man of eighty to be prayed for. He is raving up there and a great crowd is outside the front door, ringing the door-bell and wanting to know what is going on in the house.&rdquo; The Lord quietly whispered, &ldquo;This is what I baptized you for.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I carefully opened the door of the room where the man was, desiring to be obedient to what my Lord would say to me. The man was crying and shouting in distress, &ldquo;I am lost! I am lost! I have committed the unpardonable sin. I am lost! I am lost!&rdquo; My wife said, &ldquo;Dad, what shall we do?&rdquo; The Spirit of the Lord moved me to cry out, &ldquo;Come out, thou lying spirit.&rdquo; In a moment the evil spirit went, and the Lord said to me, &ldquo;This is what I baptized you for.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a place where God, through the power of the Holy Ghost, reigns supreme in our lives. The Spirit reveals, unfolds, takes the things of Christ and shows them to us, and prepares us to be more than a match for satanic forces. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When Nicodemus came to Jesus he said, &ldquo;We know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Nicodemus was impressed by the miracles wrought; and Jesus pointed out the necessity of a miracle being wrought with every man who would see the kingdom. When a man is born of God, is brought from darkness to light, a mighty miracle is wrought. Jesus saw every touch by God as a miracle, and so we may expect to see miracles wrought today. It is wonderful to have the Spirit of the Lord upon us. I would rather have the Spirit of God on me for five minutes than to receive a million dollars. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you see how Jesus mastered the devil in the wilderness? He knew He was the Son of God and Satan came along with an &ldquo;if.&rdquo; How many times has Satan come along to you this way? He says, &ldquo;After all, you may be deceived. You know you really are not a child of God.&rdquo; If the devil comes along and says that you are not saved, it is a pretty sure sign that you are. When he comes and tells you that you are not healed, it may be taken as good evidence that the Lord has sent His word and healed you. The devil knows that if he can capture your thought life, he has won a mighty victory over you. His great business is injecting thoughts, but if you are pure and holy you will instantly shrink from them. God wants us to let the mind that was in Christ Jesus, that pure, holy, humble mind of Christ, be in us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I come across people everywhere I go who are held bound by deceptive conditions, and these conditions have come about simply because they have allowed the devil to make their minds the place of his stronghold. How are we to guard against this? The Lord has provided us with weapons that are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds of the enemy, and by means of which every thought shall be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. The blood of Jesus Christ and His mighty name are an antidote to all the subtle seeds of unbelief that Satan would sow in your minds. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the first chapter of Acts, we see that Jesus gave commandment to the disciples that they should wait for the promise of the Father, and He told them that not many days hence they would be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Luke tells us that he had written his former treatise concerning all that Jesus began both former treatise concerning all that Jesus began both to do and teach. The ministry of Christ did not end at the cross, but the Acts and the epistles give us accounts of what He continued to do and teach through those whom He indwelt. And our blessed Lord Jesus is still alive, and continues His ministry through those who are filled with His Spirit. He is still healing the broken-hearted and delivering the captives through those on whom He places His Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was traveling one day in a railway train in Sweden. At one station there boarded the train an old lady with her daughter. The old lady&rsquo;s expression was so troubled that I enquired what was the matter with her. I heard that she was going to the hospital to have her leg taken off. She began to weep as she told that the doctors had said there was no hope for her except through having her leg amputated. She was seventy years old. I said to my interpreter, &ldquo;Tell her that Jesus can heal her.&rdquo; We stopped at another station and the carriage filled up with people. There was a rush of men to board that train and the devil said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re done.&rdquo; But I knew I had the best proposition, for hard things are always opportunities to get to the Lord </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">more glory</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> when He manifests His power. Every trial is a blessing. There have been times when I have been pressed through circumstances and it seemed as if a dozen road engines were going over me, but I have found that the hardest things are just lifting places into the grace of God. We have such a lovely Jesus. He always proves Himself to be such a mighty Deliverer. He never fails to plan the best things for us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The train began moving and I crouched down, and in the name of Jesus commanded the disease to leave. The old lady cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m healed. I know I&rsquo;m healed.&rdquo; She stamped her leg and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to prove it.&rdquo; So when we stopped at another station she marched up and down and shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to the hospital.&rdquo; Once again our wonderful Jesus had proven Himself a Healer of the broken-hearted, a Deliverer of one that was bound. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one time I was so bound that no human power could help me. My wife was looking for me to pass away. There was no help. At that time I had just had a faint glimpse of Jesus as the Healer. For six months I had been suffering from appendicitis, occasionally getting temporary relief. I went to the mission of which I was pastor, but I was brought to the floor in awful agony, and they brought me home to my bed. All night I was praying, pleading for deliverance, but none came. My wife was sure it was my home call and sent for a physician. He said that there was no possible chance for me&mdash;my body was too weak. Having had the appendicitis for six months, my whole system was drained, and, because of that, he thought that it was too late for an operation. He left my wife in a state of broken-heartedness. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">After he left, there came to our door a young man and an old lady. I knew that she was a woman of real prayer. They came upstairs to my room. This young man jumped on the bed and commanded the evil spirit to come out of me. He shouted, &ldquo;Come out, you devil; I command you to come out in the name of Jesus!&rdquo; There was no chance for an argument, or for me to tell him that I would never believe thart there was a devil inside of me. The thing had to go in the name of Jesus, and it went, and I was instantly healed. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I arose and dressed and went downstairs. I was still in the plumbing business, and I asked my wife, &ldquo;Is there any work in? I am all right now, and I am going to work.&rdquo; I found there was a certain job to be done and I picked up my tools and went off to do it. Just after I left, the doctor came in, put his plug hat down in the hall, and walked up to the bedroom. But the invalid was not there. &ldquo;Where is Mr. Wigglesworth? he asked. &ldquo;Oh, doctor, he&rsquo;s gone out to work,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see him alive again,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll bring him back a corpse.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Well, I&rsquo;m the corpse. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Since that time, in many parts of the world, the Lord has given me the privilege of praying for people with appendicitis; and I have seen a great many people up and dressed within a quarter of an hour from the time I prayed for them. We have a living Christ who is willing to meet people on every line. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A number of years ago I met Brother D.W. Kerr and he gave me a letter of introduction to a brother in Zion City named Cook. I took his letter to Brother Cook, and he said, &ldquo;God has sent you here.&rdquo; He gave me the addresses of six people and asked me to go and pray for them and meet him again at 12 o&rsquo;clock. I got back at about 12:30 and he told me about a young man who was to be married the following Monday. His sweetheart was in Zion City dying of appendicitis. I went to the house and found that the physician had just been there and had pronounced that there was no hope. The mother was nearly distracted and was pulling her hair, and saying, &ldquo;Is there no deliverance!&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;Woman, believe God and your daughter will be healed and be up and dressed in fifteen minutes.&rdquo; But the mother went on screaming. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">They took me into the bedroom, and I prayed for the girl and commanded the evil spirit to depart in the name of Jesus. She cried, &ldquo;I am healed.&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;Do you want me to believe that you are healed? If you are healed, get up.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;You get out of the room and I&rsquo;ll get up.&rdquo; In less than ten minutes the doctor came in. He wanted to know what had happened. She said, &ldquo;A man came in and prayed for me, and I&rsquo;m healed.&rdquo; The doctor pressed his finger right in the place that had been so sore, and the girl neither moaned nor cried. He said, &ldquo;This is God.&rdquo; It made no difference whether he acknowledged it or not, I knew that God had worked. Our God is real in saving and healing power today. Our Jesus is just the same, yesterday, and today, and forever. He saves and heals today just as of old, and He wants to be your Savior and your Healer. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Oh, if you would only believe God! What would happen? The greatest things. Some have never tasted the grace of God, have never had the peace of God. Unbelief robs them of these blessings. It is possible to hear and yet not conceive the truth. It is possible to read the Word and not share in the life it brings. It is necessary for us to have the Holy Ghost to unfold the Word and bring to us the life that is Christ. We can never fully understand the wonders of this redemption until we are full of the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was once at an afternoon meeting. The Lord had been graciously with us and many had been healed by the power of God. Most of the people had gone home and I was left alone, when I saw a young man who was evidently hanging back to have a word. I asked, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I wonder if I could ask you to pray for me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you smell?&rdquo; The young fellow had gone into sin and was suffering the consequences. He said, &ldquo;I have been turned out of two hospitals. I am broken out all over. I have abcesses all over me.&rdquo; And I could see that he had a bad breaking out at the nose. He said, &ldquo;I heard you preach, and could not understand about this healing business, and was wondering if there was any hope for me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I said to him, &ldquo;Do you know Jesus?&rdquo; He did not know the first thing about salvation, but I said to him, &ldquo;Stand still.&rdquo; I placed my hands on his head and then on his loins and cursed that terrible disease in the name of Jesus. He cried out, &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m healed. I can feel a warmth and a glow all over me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Your prayers.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No, it was Jesus!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Was it He? Oh, Jesus! Jesus! Jesus, save me.&rdquo; And that young man went away healed and saved. Oh, what a merciful God we have! What a wonderful Jesus is ours! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Are you oppressed? Cry out to God. It is always good for people to cry out. You may have to cry out. The Holy Ghost and the Word of God will bring to light every hidden, unclean thing that must be revealed. There is always a place of deliverance when you let God search out that which is spoiling and marring your life. That evil spirit that was in the man in the synagogue cried out, &ldquo;Let us alone!&rdquo; It was a singular thing that the evil spirit had never cried out like that until Jesus walked into the place where he was. Jesus rebuked the thing, saying, &ldquo;Hold thy peace and come out of him,&rdquo; and the man was delivered. He is just the same Jesus, exposing the powers of evil, delivering the captives and letting the oppressed go free, purifying them and cleansing their hearts. Those evil spirits that inhabited the man who had the legion did not want to be sent to the pit to be tormented before their time, and so they cried out to be sent into the swine. Hell is such an awful place that even the demons hate the thought of going there. How much more should men seek to be saved from the pit? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God is compassionate and says, &ldquo;Seek ye the Lord while He may be found.&rdquo; And He has further stated, &ldquo;Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; Seek Him now, call on His name right now, and there is forgiveness, healing, redemption, deliverance, and everything you need for you right here and now, and that which will satisfy you throughout eternity. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

							<span class="cs12506F1C">Published in the </span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Pentecostal Evangel</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, August 25, 1923.<br/></span><span class="cs92EAF8D3">Ever Increasing Faith</span><span class="cs12506F1C">, chapter 16. (Published 1924.)</span></h4>
						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Co%2012:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">1 Corinthians 12.10, speaking of the diversities of gifts by the same Spirit, Paul writes, &quot;To another prophecy.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We see the importance of this gift from <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Co%2014:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">1 Corinthians 14.1, where we are told to follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that we may prophesy.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> We see also that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Co%2014:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">he that prophesieth speaketh unto man to edification, and exhortation and comfort.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How important it is then that we should have this gift in manifestation in the church in order that the saints might be built up and made strong and filled with the comfort of God. But with this as all other gifts we should see that it is operated by the Spirit&#39;s power and brought forth in the unction of the Spirit; so that everyone who shall hear prophecy, as it is brought forth by the Spirit of God, shall know that it is </span><span class="cs53F207AF">GOD</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> who is bringing forth that which is for the edification of those who hear. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Co%202:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">It is the Spirit of God who takes of the deep things of God and reveals them,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and unctionizes the prophet to give forth that which is a revelation of the things of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Utterance in prophecy has a real lifting power and gives real light on the truth to those who hear. Prophecy is never a mind reflection, it is something far deeper than this. By means of prophecy we receive that which is the mind of the Lord; and as we receive these blessed, fresh utterances through the Spirit of the Lord the whole assembly is lifted into the realm of the spiritual. Our hearts and minds and whole bodies receive a quickening through the Spirit-given word. As the Spirit brings forth prophecy we find there is healing and salvation and power in every line. For this reason it is one of the gifts that we ought to covet. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">While we appreciate true prophecy, we must not forget that the Scriptures warn us in no uncertain manner concerning that which is false. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Jo%204:1')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In 1 John 4.1 we are told, &quot;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And John tells us how we can tell the difference between the true and the false, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Jo%204:2-3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God but this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> There are voices which seem like prophecy and some have got into terrible darkness and bondage through listening to these counterfeits of the true gift of prophecy. True prophecy is always Christ-exalting, magnifying the Son of God, exalting the blood of Jesus Christ, encouraging the saints to praise and worship the true God. False prophecy deals with things that do not edify and is designed to puff up its hearers and to lead them into error. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Many picture Satan as a great, ugly monster with great ears, eyes and a tail; but the Scriptures give us no such picture of him. He was a being of great beauty and his heart became lifted up. He is manifesting himself everywhere today as an <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('2Co%2011:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">angel of light.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He is full of pride, and if you don&#39;t watch he will try to make you think you are somebody. This is the weakness of most preachers and most men&mdash;the idea of being somebody! There are none of us who are anything, and the more we know we are nothing, the more God can make us a channel of His power. May the dear Lord save us from all these pride side-lines&mdash;they are the devil&#39;s traps. True prophecy will show you that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Co%2015:28')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Christ is all in all,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and that you are in yourself less than nothing and vanity. False prophecy will not magnify Christ but will make you think that after all you are going to be some great one. You may be sure that such is inspired by <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Job%2041:34')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;the chief of the sons of pride.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to warn you against the foolishness of continually seeking to hear voices. Look in the Bible. Here we have the voice of God, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Heb%201:1-2')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">who at sundry times and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, and hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Don&#39;t run away with anything else. If you hear the voice of God it will be on the line of the Scriptures of truth given in the inspired Word. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Rev%2022:18-19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">In Revelation 22.18-19 we see the danger of attempting to add to or take from the prophecy of this Book.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> True prophecy, as it comes forth in the power of the Spirit of God, will neither take from nor add to the Scriptures, but will intensify and quicken that which already has been given to us of God. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%2014:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The Holy Ghost will bring to our remembrance all the things that Jesus said and did.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> True prophecy will bring forth things new and old out of the Scriptures of truth and will make them living and powerful to us. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Some may ask, &quot;If we have the Scriptures, why do we need prophecy?&quot; The Scriptures themselves answer this question. God has said that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Acts%202:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">in the last days He will pour out of His Spirit upon all flesh, &quot;and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> The Lord knew that in these last days prophecy would be a real means of blessing to us, and that is why we can count on Him giving us, by means of the Spirit, through His servants and His handmaids, true prophetic messages. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I want to give you a warning concerning listening to voices. I was at a meeting in Paisley in Scotland and came in touch with two young women. One of them wore a white blouse but it was smeared with blood. They were in a great state of excitement. These two girls were telegraph operators and were precious young women, having received the Baptism in the Spirit. They were both longing to be missionaries. But whatever our spiritual state is we are subject to temptations. An evil power came to one of these young women and said, &quot;If you will obey me, I will make you one of the most wonderful missionaries that ever went out.&quot; This was just the devil or one of his agents acting as an angel of light. One of these young women was captured immediately and she became so excited that her sister saw there was something wrong and asked the overseer to allow them to be free for a time. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">As she took her into a room, the power of Satan, endeavoring to imitate the Spirit of God, manifested itself in a voice, and led this young woman to believe that the missionary enterprise would be unfolded that night if she would obey. This evil spirit said, &quot;Don&#39;t tell anybody but your sister.&quot; I reckon that everything of God can be told to everybody. (If you cannot preach what you live, your life is wrong. If you are afraid of <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%2012:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">telling what you do in secret, some day it will be told from the housetop.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Don&#39;t think you will get out of it. That which is pure cometh to the light. &quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%203:21')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">) </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The evil power went on to say to this girl, &quot;You go to the railroad station tonight, and there will be a train coming in at 7:32. Buy a ticket for yourself and your sister. Then you will have six pence left. You will find a woman in a carriage dressed as a nurse, and opposite her will be a gentleman who has all the money you need.&quot; She bought her ticket and had just six pence left. The first thing came right. Next, the train came in at exactly 7:32. But the next thing did not come. They ran from the top to the bottom of that railroad train before it moved out and nothing turned out as they had been told. As soon as the train moved out the same voice came and said, &quot;Over on the other platform.&quot; All that night until 9:30 these two young women were rushed from platform to platform. As soon at it was 9:30 this same evil power said, &quot;Now that I know you will obey me, I will make you the greatest missionaries.&quot; Always something big! They might have known it was all wrong. This evil power said, &quot;This gentleman will take you to a certain bank at a certain corner in Glasgow where he will put all that money in for you.&quot; Banks are not open at that time of night in Glasgow. If she had gone to the street this evil spirit mentioned, therc probably would not have been a bank there. All they needed was a little common sense and they would have seen that it was not the Lord. If you have your heart open for these kind of voices you will soon get into a trap. We must ever remember that there are many evil spirits in the world. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Were these two people delivered? Yes, after terrible travail with God, they were perfectly delivered. Their eyes were opened to see that this thing was not of God but of the devil. These two sisters are now laboring for the Lord in China and doing a blessed work for Him. If you do get into error on these lines, praise God there is a way out. I praise God that He will break us down till all pride leaves us. The worst pride we can save is the pride of exaltation of self. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Paul wrote at the commandment of the Lord, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1Co%2014:29-31')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you are not humble enough to allow your prophecy to be judged, it is as surely wrong as you are wrong. Prophecy has to be judged. A meeting such as this one that Paul suggests would certainly be the greatest meeting you ever had. Praise God, the tide will rise to this. It will all come into perfect order when the church is bathed and lost in the great ideal of only glorifying Jesus. Then things will come to pass that will be worth while. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Coupled with prophecy you will have <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Gal%205:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the fruit of the Spirit that is goodness.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> They were holy men who spoke in prophecy in days of old as the Holy Ghost prompted them, and so today the prophet who can he trusted is a man that is full of goodness, that goodness which is the fruit of the Spirit. But when he gets out of this position, and rests upon his own individuality, he is in danger of being puffed up and becoming an instrument for the enemy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I knew some people who had a wonderful farm, very productive, in a very good neighborhood. They listened to voices telling them to sell everything and go to Africa. These voices so unhinged them that they had scarcely had time to sell out. They sold their property at a ridiculous price. The same voice told them of a certain ship they were to sail on. When they got to the port they found there wasn&#39;t a ship of that name. The difficulty was this, to get them not to believe these false voices. They said perhaps it was the mind of the Lord to give them another ship, and the voice soon gave them the name of another ship. When they reached Africa they knew no language that was spoken there. But the voice did not let them stop. They had to come back, broken-hearted, shaken through, and having lost all confidence in everything. If these people had had sense to go to some men of God who were filled with the Spirit and seek their counsel, they would soon have been persuaded that these voices were not of God. But listening to these voices always brings about a spiritual pride that makes a man or woman think that they are superior to their brethren, and that they are above taking counsel of men who they think are not so filled with the Spirit as they are. If you hear any voices that make you think that you are superior to those whom God has put in the church to rule the church, watch out, that is surely the devil. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We read in the Revelation that <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Rev%2019:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> You will find that true prophetic utterance always exalts the Lamb of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">No prophetic touch is of any good unless there is fire in it. I never expect to be used of God till the fire burns. I feel that if I ever speak, it must be by the Spirit. At the same time remember that the prophet must prophecy according to the measure of faith. If you rise up in your weakness, but rise up in love because you want to honor God, and just begin, you will find the presence of the Lord upon you. Act in faith and the Lord will meet you. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">May God take us on and on into this glorious fact of faith that we may be so in the Holy Ghost that God will work through us on the line of the miraculous and on the lines of prophecy, where we will always know that it is no longer we but <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Philip%202:13')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He who is working through us, bringing forth that which is in His own divine good pleasure.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

Then Jesus uttered these words, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:8')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;O ye of little faith!&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> He had been so long with them, and yet they were still a great disappointment to Him because of their lack of comprehension and of faith. They could not grasp the profound spiritual truth He was bringing to them and could only think about having brought no bread. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:8-10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;O ye of little faith! Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you keep in memory how God has been gracious in the past? God has done wonderful things for all of us. If we keep these things in memory we shall become strong in faith. We should be able to defy Satan in everything. Remember all the way the Lord has led. When Joshua passed over Jordan on dry land he told the people <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Josh%204:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">to pick up twelve stones and pitch them in Gilgal,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> and these were to keep the children of Israel in constant memory that they came over Jordan on dry land. How many times had Jesus shown to His disciples the mightiness of His power, and yet they failed in faith right here. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">At one time Jesus said to Peter, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2017:25')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Peter said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2017:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Of strangers.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Then Jesus said, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2017:26-27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Then are the children free. Nevertheless, lest we should offend them. go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them, for me and thee.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Peter had been at the fishing business all his life but he never had caught a fish with any silver in its mouth. But the Master does not want us to reason things out&mdash;for carnal reasoning will always land us in a bog of unbelief&mdash;but just to obey. &ldquo;This is a hard job,&rdquo; Peter must have said, as he put the bait on his hook, &ldquo;but since You told me to do it, I&#39;ll try,&rdquo; and he cast his line into the sea. There were millions of fish in the sea, but every fish had to stand aside and leave that bait alone, and let that fish with the piece of money in his mouth come up and take it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Do you not see that the words of the Master are the instruction of faith? It is impossible for anything to miss that Jesus says. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%206:63')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All His words are spirit and life.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> If you will only have faith in Him you will find that every word that God gives is life. You cannot be in close touch with Him, and you cannot receive His Word in simple faith without feeling the effect of it in your body as well as in your spirit and soul. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A woman came to me in Cardiff, Wales, who was filled with ulceration. She had fallen in the streets twice through this trouble. She came to the meeting and it seemed as if the evil power within her purposed to kill her right there, for she fell and the power of the devil was rending her sore. She was helpless, and it seemed as if she had expired. I cried, &ldquo;O God, help this woman.&rdquo; Then I rebuked the evil power in the name of Jesus, and instantly the Lord healed her. She rose up and made a great to-do. She felt the power of God in her body and wanted to testify all the time. After three days she went to another place and began to testify about the Lord&#39;s power to heal. She came to me and said, &ldquo;I want to tell everyone about the Lord&#39;s healing power. Have you no tracts on this subject?&rdquo; I handed her my Bible and said, &ldquo;Matthew, Mark, Luke and John&mdash;they are the best tracts on healing. They are full of incidents about the working and power of Jesus. They will never fail to accomplish the work of God if people will but read and believe them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">That is where men lack. All lack of faith is due to not feeding on God&#39;s Word. You need it every day. How can you enter into a life of faith? Feed on the living Christ of whom this Word is full. As you get taken up with the glorious fact and the wondrous presence of the living Christ, the faith of God will spring up within you. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Rom%2010:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He gives life, not leaven. God has separated us from the leaven of denominationalism, and we dare not go back to it again. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Beware of the unbelief and worldliness that has gotten into and is corrupting all the denominations. God has made us a separated people, and we must keep separated if we are to retain our power. You cannot go back without being corrupted. If we go back, we will lose our power. If we go on, satisfied with being <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Exo%2033:7')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">without the camp, even as He was,</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> we will see more of the power and glory of God in our midst. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus asked His disciples what men were saying about Him. They told Him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:14')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Then He put the question, to see what they thought about it, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:15')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;But whom say ye that I am?&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Peter answered, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> And Jesus said to him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It is so simple. Whom do you say He is? Who is He? Do you say with Peter, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:16')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God&quot;?</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> How can you know this. He is to be revealed. Flesh and blood does not reveal this. It is an inward revelation. God wants to reveal His Son within us and make us conscious of an inward presence. Then you can cry, &ldquo;I know He&rsquo;s mine. He is mine! He is mine!&rdquo; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2011:27')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Seek God until you get from Him a mighty revelation of the Son, until that inward revelation moves you on to the place where you are always stedfast, unmoveable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is a wonderful power in this revelation. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:18-19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> Was Peter the rock? No. A few minutes later he was so full of the devil that Christ had to say to him, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:23')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offense unto me.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> This rock was Christ. He is the Rock and there are many scriptures to confirm this. And to every one that knows that He is the Christ He gives the key of faith, the power to bind and the power to loose. Stablish your hearts with this fact. God wants you to have the inward revelation of this truth and of all the power contained in it. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I had been preaching on tnis line in Toronto, endeavoring to show that the moment a man believes with all his heart God puts into him a reality, a substance, a life; yea, God dwells in him, and with the new birth there comes into us a mighty force that is mightier than all the power of the enemy. A man ran out of the meeting, and when I got home that night he was there with a big, fine, tall man. This man said to me, &ldquo;Three years ago my nerves became shattered. I can&rsquo;t sleep. I have lost my business. I have lost everything. I am not able to sleep at all and my life is one of misery.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Go home, and sleep, in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; He turned round and seemed reluctant to go: but I said to him, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; and shoved him out of the door. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The next morning he rang up on the telephone. He said to my host, &ldquo;Tell him I slept all night. I want to see him at once.&rdquo; He came and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a new man. I feel I have got a new life. And now can you get me my money back?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Tell me how.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Come to the meeting tonight and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; The power of God was mightily present in that evening meeting, and he was greatly under conviction. He made for the altar but fell before he got there. The Lord changed him and changed everything in him. He is now a successful business man. All his past failures came through a lack of the knowledge of God. No matter what troubles you, God can shake the devil out, and completely transform you. There is none like Him. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2016:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;Upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God is pleased when we stand upon this Rock and believe that He is unchangeable. If you will dare to believe God. you can defy all the powers of evil. There have been times in my experience when I have dared to believe Him and I have had the most remarkable experiences. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">One day I was traveling in a railway train, and there were two people in the car that were very sick, a mother and her daughter. I said to them, &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ve something in this bag that will cure every case in the world. It has never been known to fail.&rdquo; They became very much interested, and I went on telling them more and more about this remedy that never failed to remove disease and sickness. At last they summoned up courage to ask for a dose. So I opened my bag, took out my Bible, and read them that verse, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Exo%2015:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">&quot;I am the Lord that healeth thee.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> It never fails. He will always heal you if you dare believe Him. Men are searching everywhere today for things with which they can heal themselves, and they ignore the fact that the Balm of Gilead is within easy reach. As I talked about this wonderful Physician, the faith of both mother and daughter went out toward Him, and He healed them both right in the train. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">God has made His Word so precious that, if I could not get another copy, I would not part with my Bible for all the world. There is life in the Word. There is virtue in it. I find Christ in it; and He is the One I need for spirit, soul, and body. It tells me of the power of His name and of the power of His blood for cleansing. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Psa%2034:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">The lions may lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man came to me at one time, brought by a little woman. I said, &ldquo;What&#39;s up with him?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;He gets situations, but he fails every time. He is a slave to alcohol and nicotine poison. He is a bright, intelligent man in most things, but he goes under to these two things.&rdquo; I was reminded of the words of the Master, giving us power to bind and loose, and I told him to put out his tongue. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I cast out the evil powers that gave him the taste for these things. I said to him, &ldquo;Man, you are free today.&rdquo; He was unsaved, but when he realized the power of the Lord in delivering him, he came to the services, publicly acknowledged that he was a sinner, and the Lord saved and baptized him. A few days later I asked, &ldquo;How are things with you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I&#39;m delivered.&rdquo; God has given us the power to bind and the power to loose. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In another place a woman came to me and said, &ldquo;I have not been able to smell for twenty years; can you do anything for me?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You shall smell tonight.&rdquo; Could I give anybody that which had been lost for twenty years? Not of myself, but I remembered the Rock on which God&#39;s church is built, the Rock Christ Jesus, and His promise to give power to His own to bind and loose. We can dare to do anything if we know we have the Word of God behind us. In the name of the Lord Jesus I loosed this woman. She ran all the way home. The table was full of good things, but she would not touch a thing. She said, &ldquo;I am having a feast of smelling!&rdquo; Praise the Lord for the fact that He himself backs up His own Word and proves the truth of it in these days of unbelief and apostasy. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Another person came and said, &ldquo;What can you do for me? I have had sixteen operations and have had my ear drums taken out.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;God has not forgotten how to make ear drums.&rdquo; I anointed her and prayed, asking the Lord that the ear drums should be replaced. She was so deaf that I do not think she would have heard if a cannon had gone off. She was as deaf as it was possible to be afterwards. But she saw other people getting healed and rejoicing. Had God forgotten to be gracious? Was His power just the same? She came the next night and said, &ldquo;I have come to believe God tonight.&rdquo; Take care you do not come any other way. I prayed for her again and commanded her ears to be loosed in the name of Jesus. She believed, and the moment she believed she heard. She ran and jumped upon a chair and began to preach. Later I let a pin drop and she heard it fall. God can give drums to ears. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Matt%2019:26')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">All things are possible with God.</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212"> God can save the worst. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Discouraged one, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Psa%2055:22')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">cast your burden on the Lord.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">These are days when we need to have our faith strengthened, when we need to know God. God has designed that the just shall live by faith. Any man can be changed by faith, no matter how he may be fettered. I know that God&rsquo;s word is sufficient. One word from Him can change a nation. His word is from everlasting to everlasting. It is through the entrance of this everlasting Word, this incorruptible seed, that we are born again, and come into this wonderful salvation. Man cannot live by bread alone, but must live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. This is the food of faith. Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Everywhere men are trying to discredit the Bible and take from it all the miraculous. One preacher says, &ldquo;Well, you know, Jesus arranged beforehand to have that colt tied where it was, and for the men to say just what they did.&rdquo; I tell you God can arrange everything without going near. He can plan for you, and when He plans for you, all is peace. All things are possible if you will believe. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Another preacher said, &ldquo;It was an easy thing for Jesus to feed the people with five loaves, The loaves were so big in those days that it was a simple matter to cut them into a thousand pieces each.&rdquo; But He forget that one little boy brought those five loaves all the way in his lunch basket. There is nothing impossible with God. All the impossibility is with us when we measure God by the limitations of our unbelief. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have a wonderful God, a God whose ways are past finding out, and whose grace and power are limitless. I was in Belfast one day and saw one of the brethren of the assembly. He said to me, &ldquo;Wigglesworth, I am troubled. I have had a good deal of sorrow during the past five months. I had a woman in my assembly who could always pray the blessing of heaven down on our meetings. She is an old woman, but her presence is always an inspiration. But five months ago she fell and broke her thigh. The doctors put her into a plaster cast, and after five months they broke the cast. But the bones were not properly set and so she fell and broke the thigh again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">He took me to her house, and there was a woman lying in a bed on the right hand side of the room. I said to her, &ldquo;Well, what about it now?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;They have sent me home incurable. The doctors say that I am so old that my bones won&rsquo;t knit. There is no nutriment in my bones and they could never do anything for me, and they say I shall have to lie in bed for the rest of my life.&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;Can you believe God?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Yes, ever since I heard that you had come to Belfast my faith has been quickened. If you will pray, I will believe. I know there is no power on earth that can make the bones of my thigh knit, but I know there is nothing impossible with God.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Do you believe He will meet you now?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is grand to see people believe God. God knew all about this leg and that it was broken in two places. I said to the woman, &ldquo;When I pray, something will happen.&rdquo; Her husband was sitting there; he had been in his chair for four years and could not walk a step. He called out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe. I won&rsquo;t believe. You will never get me to believe.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and laid my hands on his wife in the name of the Lord Jesus. The moment hands were laid upon her the power of God went right through her and she cried out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m healed.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to assist you to rise. God will do it all.&rdquo; She arose and walked up and down the room, praising God. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The old man was amazed at what had happened to his wife, and he cried out, &ldquo;Make me walk, make me walk.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;You old sinner, repent.&rdquo; He cried out, &ldquo;Lord, You know I never meant what I said. You know I believe.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think he meant what he said; anyhow the Lord was full of compassion. If He marked our sins, where would any of us be? If we will meet the conditions, God will always meet us, if we believe all things are possible. I laid my hands on him and the power went right through the old man&rsquo;s body, and those legs, for the first time for four years received power to carry his body, and he walked up and down and in and out. He said, &ldquo;O what great things God has done for us tonight!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&rdquo;What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&rdquo; Desire toward God and you will have desires from God and He will meet you on the line of those desires when you reach out in simple faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A man came to me in one of my meetings who had seen other people healed and wanted to be healed, too. He explained that his arm had been fixed in a certain position for many years and he could not move it. &ldquo;Got any faith?&rdquo; I asked. He said that he had a lot of faith. After prayer he was able to swing his arm round and round. But he was not satisfied and complained, &ldquo;I feel a little bit of trouble just there,&rdquo; pointing to a certain place. I said, &ldquo;Do you know what is the trouble with you?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Imperfect faith.&rdquo; What things soever ye desire when ye pray. believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Did you believe before you were saved? So many people would be saved, but they want to feel saved first. Them was never a man who felt saved before he believed. God&rsquo;s plan is always this, if you will believe, you shall see the glory of God. I believe God wants to bring us all to a definite place of unswerving faith and confidence in Himself. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus here uses the figure of a mountain. Why does He say a mountain? If faith can remove a mountain, it can remove anything. The plan of God is so marvelous, that if you will only believe, all things are possible. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">There is one special phrase to which I want to call your attention, &rdquo;And shall not doubt in his heart.&rdquo; The heart is the mainspring. See that young man and that young woman. They have fallen in love at first sight. In a short while there is a deep affection, and a strong heart love, the one toward the other. What is a heart of love? A heart of faith. Faith and love are kin. In the measure that that young man and that young woman love one another they are true. One may go to the North and the other to the South, but because of their love they will be true to one another. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is the same when there is a deep love in the heart toward the Lord Jesus Christ. In this new life into which God has brought us, Paul tells us that we have become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that we should be married to another, even to Him who is raised from the dead. God brings us into a place of perfect love and perfect faith. A man who is born of God is brought into an inward affection, a loyalty to the Lord Jesus that shrinks from anything impure. You see the purity of a man and woman when there is a deep natural affection between them; they disdain the very thought of either of them being untrue. I say that in the measure that a man has faith in Jesus he is pure. He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ overcometh the world. It is a faith that worketh by love. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Just as we have heart fellowship with our Lord, our faith cannot be daunted. We cannot doubt in our hearts, There comes, as we go on with God, a wonderful association, an impartation of His very life and nature within. As we read His Word and believe the promises that He has so graciously given to us, we are made partakers of His very essence and life. The Lord is made to us a Bridegroom, and we are His bride. His words to us are spirit and life, transforming us and changing us, expelling that which is natural and bringing in that which is divine. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">It is impossible to comprehend the love of God as we think on natural lines. We must have the revelation from the Spirit of God. God giveth liberally. He that asketh, receiveth. God is willing to bestow on us all things that pertain to life and godliness. Oh, it was the love of God that brought Jesus. And it is this same love that helps you and me to believe. In every weakness God will be your strength. You who need His touch, rememher that He loves you. Look, wretched, helpless, sick one, away to the God of all grace, whose very essence is love, who delights to give liberally all the inheritance of life and strength and power that you are in need of. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When I was in Switzerland the Lord was graciously working and healing many of the people. I was staying with Brother Reuss of Goldiwil and two policemen were sent to arrest me. The charge was that I was healing the people without a license. Mr. Reuss said to them, &ldquo;I am sorry that he is not here just now, he is holding a meeting about two miles away, but before you arrest him I would like to show you something.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Brother Reuss took these two policemen down to one of the lower parts of that district, to a house with which they were familiar, for they had often gone to that place to arrest a certain woman who was constantly an inmate of the prison because of continually being engaged in drunken brawls. He took them to this woman and said to them, &ldquo;This is one of the many cases of blessing that have come through the ministry of the man you have come to arrest. This woman came to our meeting in a drunken condition. Her body was broken, for she was ruptured in two places. While she was drunk, the evangelist laid his hands on her and asked God to heal her and deliver her.&rdquo; The woman joined in, &ldquo;Yes, and God saved me, and I have not tasted a drop of liquor since.&rdquo; The policemen had a warrant for my arrest, but they said with disgust, &ldquo;Let the doctors do this kind of thing.&rdquo; They turned and went away and that was the last we heard of them. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">We have a Jesus that heals the broken-hearted, who lets the captives go free, who saves the very worst. Dare you, dare you, spurn this glorious Gospel of God for spirit, soul and body? Dare you spurn this grace? I realize that this full Gospel has in great measure been hid, this Gospel that brings liberty, this Gospel that brings souls out of bondage, this Gospel that brings perfect health to the body, this Gospel of entire salvation. Listen again to this word of Him who left the glory to bring us this great salvation, &rdquo;Verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, ... he shall have whatsoever he saith.&rdquo; Whatsoever! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I realize that God can never bless us on the lines of being hard-hearted, critical or unforgiving. This will hinder faith quicker than anything. I remember being at a meeting where there were some people tarrying for the Baptism&mdash;seeking for cleansing, for the moment a person is cleansed the Spirit will fall. There was one man with eyes red who was weeping bitterly. He said to me, &ldquo;I shall have to leave. It is no good my staying without I change things. I have written a letter to my brother-in-law, and filled it with hard words, and this thing must first be straightened out.&rdquo; He went home and told his wife, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write a letter to your brother and ask him to forgive me for writing to him the way I did.&rdquo; &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;this thing is between God and me, and it has got to be cleared away.&rdquo; He wrote the letter and came again, and straightway God filled him with the Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I believe there are a great many people who would be healed, but they are harboring things in their hearts that are as a blight. Let these things go. Forgive, and the Lord will forgive you. There are many good people, people that mean well, but they have no power to do anything for God. There is just some little thing that came in their hearts years ago, and their faith has been paralyzed ever since. Bring everything to the light. God will sweep it all away if you will let Him. Let the precious blood of Christ cleanse from all sin. If you will but believe, God will meet you and bring into your lives the sunshine of His love. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

						<p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Let us read in the fourteenth chapter of John, verses 12 to 14. Jesus said, &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Greater works than these shall he do.&quot; What a word! Is it true? He said to the Father, &ldquo;Thy Word is truth.&rdquo; When you take up God&rsquo;s Word you get the truth. God is not a man that He should lie; neither is He the author of confusion or error; but He enlightens and reveals truth unto us as clear as the noonday. By it we are changed. We enter into fellowship, into communion, into assurance, into the likeness of God when we see the truth and believe. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. Faith is an operative power. It opens the understanding so that God can show us things we never would have known had not our hearts been opened. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">No greater words can be found than those in Romans 4:16&mdash;&ldquo;Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace.&rdquo; Grace is God&rsquo;s benediction coming right down to you. When, by an act of faith, you open the door to Him, He does that which needs to be done. It is of faith, that it might be by grace. You are the one to open the way, by faith. God is the One to supply your need, by grace. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Jesus says, &ldquo;You have seen the work I do, and how I do it. You shall do the same work.&rdquo; Did anyone ever work as He did? I do not mean His carpentering; I mean His ministry to the people. The people came to Him with their needs, their depressions, and He relieved them all. This Royal Visitor, who came from heaven to express the Father&rsquo;s love, talked to men, ate with them, probably slept in their homes, and communicated the life and power of God unto them. And He says, &ldquo;You have seen the work I do&mdash;healing the sick, relieving the oppressed, casting out demons. The works that I do shall ye do also.&rdquo; Will you dare to believe? Will you take up the work He left and carry it on? </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;He that believeth on me,&rdquo; He says. What does this mean? How can mere believing bring such things to pass? Why should there be any virtue in our believing? It is because He said it. If we will meet the simple condition, the promise will be fulfilled in our lives. &ldquo;He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also.&rdquo; But unbelief has hindered our progress, both in spiritual blessing and in physical healing. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Put away all doubt. Open your heart to God&rsquo;s grace, and God will come and place in you an active faith. He wants His mighty power to move through you. No matter what obstruction may come across your path, He wants you to rise with divine power to rebuke and destroy it. Jesus has a life force to put in us that will change everything that we dare to believe it will change. &ldquo;Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?&rdquo; Because we believe that Jesus is the Son of God, we have within us the essence of divine life, which causes a separation between us and the world. We have no room for sin. We delight in doing that which is right. As with sin, so with sickness and afflictions. He that believes, he that dares to trust, overcomes sickness and afflictions. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">I will give you an instance. A needy creature came to me in a meeting. He was withered and wasted, in a hopeless condition; death lay in his eyes. He was so helpless he had to have someone on each side to bear him up. He said to me in a whisper, &ldquo;Can you help me?&rdquo; Let Jesus answer: &ldquo;He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I give you power over all the power of the enemy.&rdquo; Those are the words of Jesus. If you believe on Him, the power of the enemy cannot stand, however evil the nature. God&rsquo;s word is against him. If we have the words of Jesus abiding in us, those words are spirit and they are life. They make us supernatural. It is not just the faith of Jesus&mdash;it is the words of Jesus. We need more than mere faith. We need words added to our faith. Whatever we desire, if we believe we can declare that we are going to have it. We can begin to say, and what we dare to say shall be done. Of the one who believes, Jesus says, &ldquo;He shall have whatsoever he </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">saith</span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This afflicted man, standing before me so helpless, so withered, had had cancer of the stomach. The physicians had taken away the cancer from his stomach, but in removing it they had taken away the man&rsquo;s swallowing power. The cancer was removed, and seemingly his life was spared, but he could not swallow. In order to keep him from starving, they had made an opening in his stomach and inserted a tube about nine inches long, with a cup at the top, and he fed himself with liquids. For three months he had managed to keep alive, walking about like a skeleton. Here he was asking whether I could help him. What should I say? I remembered the promise, &ldquo;If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">The Word must be true. Jesus is with the Father, and therefore even greater works than His can be done if we believe. So I believed, and therefore I spoke. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&ldquo;Go home and have a good supper,&rdquo; I said. The poor fellow replied, &ldquo;I cannot swallow.&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;On the authority of the Word of God I say it. It is the promise of Jesus. Go home in the name of Jesus, and have a good supper.&quot; He went home. Supper was prepared. Many times before this he had taken food in his mouth and had been forced to put it out again. But I had believed God. (I am here to inspire you.) I am a natural man, just as you are, but I dared to believe that he would swallow that night. So after he had filled his mouth with food, he chewed it, and then it went right down. He ate until he was quite satisfied. He and his family went to bed filled with joy. The next morning when they arose they were filled with the same joy. Life had begun again, it seemed. The man looked down to see the opening which the physicians had made into his stomach, but it was gone. He did not need two openings, so when God opened the natural passage He closed the other. That is what God is like all the time. He brings things to pass when we believe. God wants you to realize this truth. Dare to believe, then dare to speak, and you shall have whatsoever you say. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A woman came up to me one night and asked, &ldquo;Can I hear again?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I have had several operations, and the drums of my ears have been taken away. Is it possible for me ever to hear again?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If God has not forgotten how to make drums for ears you can hear again.&rdquo; Do you think God has forgotten? There is one thing God does forget&mdash;He forgets our sins when He forgives us&mdash;but He has not forgotten how to make drums for ears. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">A woman told me that her lungs were in ribbons, and that she could part with a pint of pus at any time. But when I invited people to receive divine healing, she dared to believe God, and she was completely healed in that very meeting. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">Not long ago I was in a meeting and the power of God was present in a remarkable way. I told the people that they could be healed without coming to the platform. I said that if they would rise and stand wherever they were, I would pray and the Lord would heal them. There was a man who put up his hands. I said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t that man rise?&rdquo; They said he could not, so they lifted him up. We prayed, and that man was healed then and there. His ribs had been broken and were not joined, but God healed him completely. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">When it was evident that the man was healed, there was such faith throughout the congregation that a little girl said, &ldquo;Please, gentleman, come to me.&rdquo; I could not see her, she was so small. The mother said, &ldquo;My little girl wants you to come.&rdquo; So I went over to her. The girl was about fourteen years old, and she was a cripple. With tears running down her face, she asked, &ldquo;Will you pray for me?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Will you dare to believe?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; I prayed, and placed my hands on her head, in the name of Jesus. The girl said, &ldquo;Mother, I am being healed. Take those things off&mdash;take them all off.&rdquo; The mother loosed the straps and bands on the girl&rsquo;s legs. There was an iron on her foot about 3&frac12; inches deep. She said, &ldquo;Mother, I am sure I am healed. Take it </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">all</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> off.&rdquo; So her mother unstrapped the iron and took it off, and that girl began to walk. There were not many dry eyes in that place as the people saw that girl walk about with legs quite as true as when she was born. God had healed her right away. What did it? She dared to believe, and trusted God. &ldquo;Please, gentleman, come to me,&rdquo; she had said. Her longing had been coupled with faith. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">This is the faith we need. God wants us to be as children. He has hidden these things from the wise and prudent, but revealed them unto babes. &ldquo;All things are possible to him that believeth.&rdquo; Canst thou believe? Whatever there is in your life that is bound, the name of Jesus, through faith in His name, shall break it loose. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">In our Scripture reading in John 14, we find that Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;When I do what you ask, the Father will be pleased for it will glorify Him,&rdquo; God will be glorified in Jesus when you dare to believe and receive the life from Jesus through your faith. </span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">Posted by K.W.

The greatest power is <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Gal%205:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">the faith that worketh by love</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">. Love, mercy and grace are bound eternally to faith. Fear is the opposite to faith, but <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1%20John%204:18')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">there is no fear in love</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and those whose hearts are filled with a Divine faith and love have no question in their hearts as to being caught up when Jesus comes. The world is filled with fear, torment, remorse and brokenness, but faith and love are sure to overcome. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1%20John%205:5')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&quot; God has established the earth and humanity on the lines of faith. As you come into line, fear is cast out, the Word of God comes into operation and you find bed rock. All the promises are yea and amen to those who believe. When you have real faith in Christ the love of God is so real that you feel that you could do anything for Jesus. They that believe, love. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1%20John%204:19')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">We love Him because He first loved us</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&quot; When did He love us? When we were in the mire. What did He say? &quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Luke%205:20')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Thy sins are forgiven thee</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&quot; Why did He say it? Because He loved us. What for? <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('Heb%202:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">That He might bring many sons to glory</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">. His object? That we might be with Him for ever. All the pathway is an education for this high vocation and calling. How glorious is this hidden mystery of love to us the undeserving! </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1%20John%205:4')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&quot; To believe is to overcome. I am heir to all the promises because I believe. A great heritage! I overcome because I believe the truth, <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%208:10')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">and the truth makes me free</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">. Christ is the root and source of our faith, and because He is in it what we believe for will come to pass. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">No wavering! This is the principle. He who believes is definite. A definite faith will bring a definite experience and a definite utterance. There is no limit to the power that God will cause to come upon those who cry to Him in faith, for God is </span><span class="cs5BBBBA19">rich</span><span class="cs78AB3212"> to all who will call upon Him. Lay in your claim for your children, your families, your co-workers, that many sons may be brought to glory. As your prayer rests on the simple principle of faith, nothing shall be impossible to you. The root principle of all this Divine overcoming faith in the human heart is Christ, and when you are grafted deeply into Him you may win thousands of lives to the faith. <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('John%2014:6')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, the secret to every hard problem in your heart. </span></p><p class="cs39141F69"><span class="cs78AB3212">&quot;<a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1%20John%204:17')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as He is: so are we in this world</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">.&quot; <a class="cs52854C63" href="javascript:vs('1%20John%203:3')"><span class="cs7EFBB8F4">He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself</span></a></span><span class="cs78AB3212">, and God confirms this faith in us that we may be refined in the world, having neither spot nor blemish nor any such thing. It is the Lord who purifies and brings to the place where the fire burns up the dross, and then anoints us with fresh oil, that at all times we may be ready for His appearing. God is separating us for Himself just as He separated Enoch to a walk with Himself, and because of a divinely implanted faith, he had the testimony before his translation that he pleased God. As the day of the Lord hastens on, we too need to walk by faith, until, overcoming all things through our simple belief in Jesus Christ our Lord, we walk right into the glory. </span></p><p class="cs584AA170"><span class="cs9FF1B611">&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr>

While he was not the catalyst for breakthrough revivals such as the one in Wales led by Evan Roberts in 1904 or that of the Azusa Street Mission in 1906 that was led by William Seymour, it was Smith Wigglesworth&rsquo;s steady faith and staying power that made the Pentecostal revival the most significant Christian movement of the twentieth century. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Where other Pentecostal ministers would emerge overnight and then disappear from the public scene almost as quickly, Smith Wigglesworth traveled widely from after the death of his wife in 1913 until not long before his death in 1947. During these decades his ministry of faith and miracles changed the face of Christianity and set the stage for the Charismatic Renewal that would restore the ministry of the Holy Spirit to the modern church.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">An Early Call To Evangelism</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>Smith was born in a small village near Menston, Yorkshire in England on June 8, 1859. Smith&rsquo;s younger years were marked by a hunger for God, even though his parents were not Christians at the time. His grandmother was an old-time Wesleyan, and she always made sure that Smith attended meetings with her when she could. When he was eight, he joined in with the singing at one of these meetings, and as he began, &ldquo;a clear knowledge of the new birth&rdquo; came to him. He realized in that moment just what the death and resurrection of Jesus meant for him, and he embraced it with his whole heart. From that day forth, he never doubted that he was saved. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Soon he began operating as the evangelist, which would be most of his life&rsquo;s focus. His first convert was his own mother. When his father realized what was happening, he started taking the family to an Episcopal church. Although his father was never born again, he enjoyed the parson, who just happened to frequent the same pub as he did, and remained a faithful church-goer through Smith&rsquo;s youth.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">When he was thirteen, his family moved from Menston to Bradford, where Smith became deeply involved with the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Even though he couldn&rsquo;t read, it was at this time that Smith began the habit of always having a copy of the New Testament with him wherever he went. Then in 1875 when Smith was about sixteen, the Salvation Army opened a mission in Bradford, and Smith found a powerful ally in his desire to see people come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. In the meetings he attended with the Salvationists, he soon learned there was great power behind prayer and fasting.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">At seventeen, Smith met a Godly man at a mill who took him in as an apprentice and taught him the plumbing trade. He also told Smith about what the Bible taught on water baptism, and soon afterwards Smith gladly obeyed and was baptized in water. During this time, he also learned more about the second coming of Christ and strongly believed that Jesus would come at the turn of the century. This made him ever more vigilant to &ldquo;change the course&rdquo; of everyone he met.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">The Favor of God</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>In 1877 at the age of nearly eighteen, Smith decided it was time to set out on his own. He went to the home of a plumber and asked for a job. When the plumber told him he had no need for any help, Smith thanked him, apologized for using his time, and turned to walk away. Immediately, the man called him back. He said, &ldquo;There is something about you that is different. I just cannot let you go.&rdquo;&dagger; At that, the man hired him on the spot.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">By the time Smith was about twenty, the man he worked for could not keep him busy anymore&mdash;he just worked too efficiently! So Smith moved to Liverpool to find more work. There he began to minister to the children of the city. Ragged and hungry children came to the dock shed, where he preached the Gospel to them and did his best to feed and clothe them from what he made as a plumber in the area. He also visited the hospitals and ships, praying and fasting all day on Sunday, asking God for converts. As a result, he never saw fewer than fifty people saved each time he ministered. He was also frequently invited by the Salvation Army to speak at their meetings, but though he saw great results, he was never eloquent. He often broke down and cried before the people because of his burden for souls, and it was this brokenness that brought people to the altar by the hundreds.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">Smith Meets Polly</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>It was also around this time that Smith watched with great interest as a young, socially affluent woman came forward in one of the Salvation Army meetings and fell to her knees. She refused to pray with any of the workers until the speaker known as &ldquo;Gypsy&rdquo; Tillie Smith came and prayed with her. When they were done, the young woman jumped to her feet, threw her gloves in the air, and shouted, &ldquo;Hallelujah! It is done!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">The next night as she gave her testimony, Smith felt as if she belonged to him. As Smith later said, &ldquo;It seemed as if the inspiration of God was upon her from the very first.&rdquo;&Dagger; The young woman&rsquo;s name was Mary Jane Featherstone, but everyone called her &ldquo;Polly.&rdquo; She eventually received a commission as an officer in the Salvation Army from General William Booth. Smith did what he could to work near her, and in the coming years a romance bloomed between them.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">As Smith and Polly grew closer, Polly eventually faced the difficult decision of choosing either to continue with the Salvation Army or her love for Smith. Even though Smith never officially joined the Salvation Army, he was considered a private in their ranks, and Polly was an officer. There were strict regulations against officers and lower ranks having romantic relationships, so even though they always remained true friends of the Salvationists, Polly retired from their ranks and took up mission work with the Blue Ribbon Army. Those in her Methodist church also recognized her calling and asked her to help evangelize their churches. Hundreds were converted as a result. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">A Divine Partnership</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>Polly had from the beginning the eloquence Smith longed for but couldn&rsquo;t learn. When in 1882, Smith returned to Bradford, he and Polly wed. Polly was twenty-two years old and Smith was twenty-three. In their thirty years of marriage, the Wigglesworths had five children: Alice, Seth, Harold, Ernest, and George. Before each child was born, Smith and Polly prayed over them that they would faithfully serve God throughout their lives.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Smith and Polly had a burden for a part of Bradford that had no church, so they soon opened the Bradford Street Mission and began ministering together. Polly did most of the speaking, because she was the stronger and more accomplished of the two as an orator, and Smith oversaw the needs of the rest of the work. While she preached, he was at the altar praying for more to come to Christ. Of this relationship, Smith later said, &ldquo;Her work was to put down the net; mine was to land the fish. This latter is just as important as the former.&rdquo;&sect; </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">A Cold Winter</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>The winter of 1884 was very severe in Bradford, and plumbers were in high demand. As a result, a time of intense work began for Smith that would last for the next two years, and he became literally consumed by his natural occupation. His church attendance declined and slowly but surely his fire for God began to grow cold. In the light of Polly&rsquo;s increasing faithfulness, Smith&rsquo;s backsliding seemed all the more pronounced to the point that her diligence began to wear on him. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Then one night, this came to a head when she came home from church a little later than usual. Smith confronted her: &ldquo;I am master of this house, and I am not going to have you coming home at so late an hour as this!&rdquo; Polly quietly replied, &ldquo;I know that you are my husband, but Christ is my Master.&rdquo;** At this, Smith forced her out the back door, then closed and locked it. However, in his annoyance, he had forgotten to lock the front door, so Polly simply walked around the house and came in through the main entrance, laughing. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">When Smith finally saw what he had done, he caught her laughter and realized how silly he had been. Together they laughed about the matter, but to Smith it was also a revelation of how cold he had grown in the things of God. Shortly afterward, he spent ten days praying and fasting in repentance, and God gloriously restored him. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">Smith Meets &ldquo;The Lord that Healeth Thee&rdquo;</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>On a trip to Leeds for plumbing supplies, Smith heard of a meeting where divine healing was to be ministered. He attended and was amazed at what he saw. What others saw as fanaticism, Smith recognized as sincere and of God. On his return to Bradford, he would search out the sick and pay for their way to attend the Leeds healing meetings. When his wife grew ill once, he told her about the meetings, somewhat afraid that she would think he had finally gone off the deep end. Instead, she accepted it and agreed to go to the meetings with him. When the prayer of faith was offered for her in Leeds, she received an instant manifestation of healing.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">They both became passionate about the message of divine healing and their meetings began to grow, causing them to need a larger mission space. Soon they obtained a building on Bowland Street and opened the Bowland Street Mission. Across the wall behind the pulpit they hung a large scroll which read: &ldquo;I Am the Lord That Healeth Thee.&rdquo;&dagger;&dagger; Not many years after this, in the first years of the 1900s, Smith received prayer for healing a hemorrhoid condition he had battled since childhood. He was soon fully healed and never had a problem with this condition for the rest of his life.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">Embracing Divine Healing</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>Over the years that followed, the healing available through God increasingly became a part of Smith&rsquo;s sermons and ministry, though healings were not frequent nor truly spectacular at first. Then those in the Leeds Healing Home recognized Smith&rsquo;s faith and asked him to speak while they were away at a convention. Smith accepted only because he felt he could get someone else to do it once he was in charge of the meeting, but all others refused, insisting they felt God wanted him to speak. Smith ministered his sermon hesitantly, but at the close of the service fifteen people came forward for prayer, and all of them were healed! One of them had hobbled forward on crutches and began dancing around the room without them after Smith prayed for him. He had been instantly healed! No one was more surprised by the results of his prayers than Smith himself.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">Desiring More of the Spirit</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>In 1907, Pentecost had reached Sunderland, and Smith heard that people there were being baptized in the Holy Spirit and speaking in other tongues. Smith felt he had to see this for himself. Smith was among those who believed that sanctification and the baptism in the Holy Spirit were the same, so he felt he already had this baptism. Others warned him that these people in Sunderland were not receiving the Holy Spirit, but demons instead. Other friends with whom he prayed urged him to follow his own leadings.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">When he arrived at the meeting in Sunderland, which was being led by Vicar Alexander Boddy (who had attended some of Evan Roberts&rsquo; meetings in Wales during the Welsh Revival), he was surprised at the dryness of it in contrast to the moves of the Spirit he had experienced elsewhere, especially among the Salvationists. In fact, he grew so frustrated at this, he interrupted the meeting, saying, &ldquo;I have come from Bradford, and I want this experience of speaking in tongues like they had on the day of Pentecost. But I do not understand why our meetings seem to be on fire, but yours do not seem to be so.&rdquo;&Dagger;&Dagger; Smith was so disruptive that they disciplined him outside of the building.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">Smith Receives the Baptism</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>He soon decided he needed to return to Bradford, but before doing so decided to go to Vicar&rsquo;s home and say, &ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo; There he met Mrs. Boddy and told her he was returning home without speaking in tongues. She told him, &ldquo;It is not tongues you need, but the baptism.&rdquo;&sect;&sect; Smith asked her to lay hands on him before he left. She agreed, praying a simple but powerful prayer, and walked out of the room. It was then that the fire fell, and Smith had a vision of the empty cross with Jesus exalted at the right hand of the Father. Smith opened his mouth to praise God and began instantly speaking in tongues. He knew immediately that what he had received of God now was much fuller than what he had received when praying and fasting and asking God to sanctify him. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Instead of going home, Smith went to the church where Vicar Boddy was conducting the service and asked to speak. Vicar Boddy agreed. Smith then spoke as he never had before, and at the end of his &ldquo;sermon&rdquo; fifty people were baptized in the Holy Spirit and spoke in other tongues. Even the local paper, the Sunderland Daily Echo, picked up the story and headlined the meeting and what Smith had experienced. Smith telegraphed home about what had happened.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Not My Smith!&rdquo;</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>Upon arriving home in Bradford, Smith found a new challenge to what he had experienced. Polly met him at the door and firmly stated, &ldquo;I want you to know that I am just as baptized in the Holy Spirit as you are and I don&rsquo;t speak in tongues. . . . Sunday, you will preach for yourself, and I will see what there is in it.&rdquo;*** When Sunday came, Polly did see what there was in it, as Smith preached with a power and assurance she had never heard in him before. She squirmed in her seat thinking, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my Smith, Lord. That&rsquo;s not my Smith!&rdquo; At the end of the sermon a worker stood to say he wanted the same experience Smith had received, and when he sat back down, he missed his chair and fell to the floor! </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Smith&rsquo;s eldest son had the same experience. In a very short while there were eleven people on the floor, laughing in the Spirit. Then the entire congregation was absorbed in holy laughter, as God poured even more of His Spirit out upon them. In the coming weeks, hundreds in Bradford would receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit and speak with other tongues&mdash;one of whom was Polly. The couple soon began traveling throughout the country, answering calls to speak and minister. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">This experience also caused Smith to pursue God more than ever through prayer and fasting. He answered every request he could of those asking for divine healing. Sometimes he took a train to the nearest city and then borrowed a bicycle to ride another ten miles to reach the person. Soon he had no more time for his plumbing work, so he vowed before the Lord that if he were ever in severe need again in his life, he would return to plumbing; otherwise, he would serve as a minister for the rest of his days. The Lord made sure Smith never returned to plumbing.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">Polly Goes Home to Be with the Lord</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>Not long after this, while waiting at a train station to leave for Scotland, Smith received word that his beloved wife, Polly, had collapsed at the Bowland Street Mission from a heart attack. He rushed to her bedside only to discover her spirit had already departed. But Smith rebuked death, and she came back. Smith had just a short time to visit with his wife again, and then he was impressed that it was time for her to go home to be with her Lord and Savior, so he released her again. Polly passed away on January 1, 1913, and it was as if her dedication and spiritual power went with her husband after that and multiplied the effects of his ministry.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Immediately, Smith started to minister again throughout the country, traveling with his daughter, Alice, and her husband, James &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Salter. Smith continued to preach a simple Gospel of &ldquo;only believe.&rdquo; In a time when other ministers seemed frail and failing despite the enormous revivals that had come through their ministries, Smith soon rose to prominence in Pentecostal circles because of the undeniable power in his ministry and the uncompromising stability with which he operated. His convictions would never change in the next four decades, and Smith remained a growing force for God and Pentecostalism right up until his death in 1947.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">The Apostle of Faith and His Worldwide Ministry</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>In the months following Polly&rsquo;s passing, Smith&rsquo;s fame in England grew, and in 1914 he began traveling abroad to minister. By the 1920s and 1930s there was no more sought-after speaker in Pentecostalism. Although he never accepted the cloak, his acknowledgement as the &ldquo;Apostle of Faith&rdquo; made the Pentecostal world look to him as one of its greatest patriarchs, even though he had never been involved in any of the revivals that started the movement. Miracles, healings, the dead being raised, and other signs and wonders followed his ministry as he continued in the uncompromising and blunt style that no one could ever emulate. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">Truth be told, Smith just never seemed to feel the need to be polite when chasing out sickness, disease, and other works of the devil. His sentiment was also that if the Spirit were not moving, then he would move the Spirit. This was not arrogance, but confidence in the work God wanted done on the earth. Smith would create an atmosphere of uncompromising faith in the Word of God, and the Holy Spirit would never fail to show up.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">In 1922 Smith traveled to New Zealand and Australia, among other places, and in a few short months saw thousands saved and several Pentecostal churches birthed in the greatest spiritual renewals either nation had ever seen. In 1936 he traveled to South Africa and delivered to David du Plessis a profound prophecy of the upcoming revival of the Charismatic Renewal that would not even start until after Wigglesworth&rsquo;s death. By this time Smith was in his seventies and probably the most well-known Pentecostal in the world. </span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csC8027E7F">Going Home</span><span class="csD26B8138"><br/>Then on March 12, 1947, while attending the funeral of a fellow minister, Smith bowed his head in the midst of a conversation and went home to be with the Lord without any pain or struggle at the age of 87.</span></p><p class="cs68082062"><span class="csD26B8138">While Smith would never form his own denomination or write a book, let alone a systematic set of doctrines and theology, his simple faith still impacts believers today. His relationship with God produced power that had not been seen on the earth for many centuries. For this reason, God also showed him things that others only dreamed of seeing. He never wanted to be put on a pedestal and worshipped, but be instead, an example of what every Christian can experience if they would &ldquo;only believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs43CF9549"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
