He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you (John 16:13, 14).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">An American, with an Englishman, was viewing Niagara Falls. Taking his friend to the foot of the gigantic cataract, he exclaimed, &quot;There is the greatest unused power in the world!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&quot;Ah, no, my brother; you are mistaken,&quot; was the quick reply. &quot;The greatest unused power in the world is the Holy Spirit of the living God.&quot; Is the Holy Spirit using us, guiding us? The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, and He will guide us into all truth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">We were visiting the great Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. How beautiful and wonderful they were - one marvel after another as we threaded our way through twisting and turning passageways, galleries rooms, grottoes, on past the Rock of Ages to the great Throne Room itself. However, we could never have found our way through the labyrinthine ways without our guide, who led us step by step to reveal the marvels and glories to us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The truth is like that - like a vast cavern. But we must have a guide or we shall lose our way. The Spirit of truth leads us step by step, room by room, passageway by passageway; and He always takes us by the Rock of Ages, the Lord Jesus, into the great Throne Room of the final revelation of God. The Holy Spirit inspired the Holy Scriptures, for &quot;holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost&quot; (2 Peter 1:21). Therefore all that He speaks directly to the heart is in harmony with what is written in the Holy Book. He guides us into &quot;all truth,&quot; so that we shall not be one-sided and out of balance. The Holy Spirit glorifies Jesus. How? By receiving the things of Christ and showing them to us. The Holy Spirit is the One who makes real in me what Jesus did for me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">MEDITATION PRAYER: &quot;Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths&quot; (Ps. 25:4). </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs3E284CF">&quot;The Biggest Promise&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs8C9D0446">He that spared not his Son, but deliver him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs8C9D0446">(Romans 8:32).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">If not a promise in form, this is certainly a promise in fact. It is a mighty sea of promises.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Dr. William Spurgeon of Wales was lecturing in Scotland, and after the lecture an old gentleman approached him and said, &quot;Dr. Spurgeon, I&#39;m glad to meet you.

Our unsparing God &quot;spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.&quot; All things belong to Him, and when God gave Jesus to us, with this gift He gave us all things.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">One who has ever heard Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman preach will never forget it. In his service one night a man rose and gave this remarkable testimony: &quot;I got off the train at the Pennsylvania Station as a tramp, and for a year I begged in the streets for a living. One night I touched a man on the shoulder and said, &#39;Please, Mister give me a dime.&#39; As soon as I saw his face I recognized my own father. &quot;Father, don&#39;t you know me?&#39; I asked. Throwing his arms around me, he cried: &#39;I have found you! I have found you!&nbsp; All I have is yours.&quot; Just think of it--I, a tramp, stood begging my father for ten cents, when for eighteen years he had been looking for me to give me all he possessed.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">We do not have to beg God or urge Him frantically to give us what we need. In Christ He has given us not only salvation but &quot;all things to enjoy&quot; (1 Timothy 6:17), and has given them freely. Our text today is really a checkbook of faith.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">MEDITATION PRAYER: &quot;Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to usward: . . . they are more than can be numbered&quot; (Psalms 40:5).</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs3E284CF">&quot;Real Love&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs8C9D0446">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to seperate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord(Romans 8:38, 39).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The apostle knew it. The love of God is greater than the measure of man&#39;s mind. It is higher, deeper, broader, than all things and all thinking; and nothing can seperate us from it, ever.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">A starry-eyed young woman, having written a number of poems, went to an editor and told him she wished to have her poems published in his magazine. &quot;What are they about?&quot; asked the editor. &quot;All about love,&quot; was the prompt reply. &quot;Well, what is love?&quot; questioned the editor. &quot;Love,&quot; said the young woman, &quot;Is gazing upon a lily pond at night, with the shimmering moonbeams, when the lilies are in full bloom, and ------&quot; &quot;Stop, stop! cried the editor, sternly. &quot;You are all wrong. I&#39;ll tell you what love is. It&#39;s getting up cheerfully at two o&#39;clock in the morning to fill the hot-water bottle for a sick child. That&#39;s real love. I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t think I can use your poems.&quot; The editor was right. Real love is doing something for somebody who needs our help no matter how hard it is for us to give it. And &quot;God so loved.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Nothing tha happens in life, not even death itself, can seperate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus. The inspired apostle John beheld the height, the depth, the breadth, of the Father&#39;s love toward us. Failing to find suitable language to express it, he called upon the world to behold it. &quot;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the son of God&quot; (1John 3:1).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&quot;God is love&quot; is written on every opening bud, on every blushing flower, on all the beauties of nature.

Did you have any trouble with it? Were you afraid that the sharp-eyed Government auditors would find some flaw in it? It is quite a task for many people to make out a simple and accurate statement of their financial affairs, but it would be still more difficult for them to make out a complete report of their lives--thoughts, words, and actions-- that would pass the scrutiny of a holy and righteous and divine judge.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Notice the word in this promise is not may, could, should, but shall. &quot;Every one of us shall give account of himself to God.&quot; If we must go to judgement we need a lawyer, an advocate, someone to represent us at court. Let me recommend an advocate who has never lost a case. &quot;We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous&quot; (1 John 2:1). He appeared in Pilate&#39;s judgement hall, and from there He went to the cross. Then He appeared in the presence of God to make intercession for us. Last of all, to those who look for Him He shall &quot;appear the second time without sin {that is, not dealing with sin} unto salvation&quot; (Hebrew 9:28).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">A lady of prominence once needed legal counsel and was advised to consult an eminent attorney. She kept putting it off until finally she could wait no longer, for the court was about to convene. She went to the attorney and began to state her case, but he stopped her, saying: &quot;Madam, you&#39;re too late. Yesterday I would have been glad to take your case and appear before the court as your advocate, but now I cannot, for I have just been appointed to be your judge.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">God hath committed all judgement unto the Son&quot; because He is the Son of God (John 5:22).

Both were silently looking into fire, enjoying each other&#39;s company. Suddenly the Quaker said, &quot;I will tell thee what I have been thinking about. It is of a rule given by the Author of the Christian religion, which from its excellence we call the Golden Rule.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&quot;Stop,&quot; said the chief; &quot;don&#39;t praise it to me.

It cannot be done,&quot; replied Tedyuskung. Silence again reigned. The chief arose and walked nervously about the room. Stopping before his friend, he said, &quot;Brother, I have been thoughtful of what you told me. If the Great Spirit that made man would give him a new heart, he could do as you say, but not else.&quot; And Tedyuskung was right. Only the regenerated heart can please God. More often we should hear the prayer and pray the prayer, &quot;Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me&quot; (Psalms 51:10).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&quot;I fell like a contemptible fine lady--all outside and no inside,&quot; said Elizabeth Fry before she was converted.

Here is the proof of it. &quot;Return,&quot; He says, &quot;and I will heal your backslidings.&quot; God Himself is the only physician who can do that. A backslider is only a Christian grown cold.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">In a great bronze foundry, lying side by side, were two heads made of metal. One was perfect, with all the features of a noble, manly face clear and distinct. In the other hand, hardly a feature was discernible. The reason for this was that the metal had been allowed to grow a little too cool. And that&#39;s the way it is in the Christian life. Many a believer who might be stamped with the image is marred, the likeness blurred.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">How about it, friend; is the metal growing cold? Return - return to God. Sit down and read the fifteenth chapter of Luke, which was written especially for you. It has been called the greatest short story ever written, the story of the prodigal son and the forgiving father. When that boy &quot;came to himself&quot; he said, &quot;I will arise and go to my father.&quot; Friend, haven&#39;t you come to yourself today? Won&#39;t you arise and come back home? &quot;Return,&quot; God says,&quot;and I will heal your backslidings.&quot; Won&#39;t you make part of our text your response to Him, &quot;Behold, we come unto thee&quot;?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The symptoms of backsliding are like those attending a physical decline: loss of appetite, disrelish for food. When you find yourself not enjoying prayer and the reading of the Bible, beware! Begin to pray as never before, feed on the Word of God, exercise in Christian work.

She may, but it&#39;s unnatural.

A true woman may resist many things, but no woman with a mother&#39;s heart can resist the cry of her own child. How many thousands of mothers have sacrificed their lives for their babies!

He knocks at the door, He listens, He waits; but there is no sign of movement from within. One critic called the artist&#39;s attention to the missing latch, and was told that it was on the inside of the door.

Robert Louis Stevenson tells the story of a ship caught in a storm off a rocky coast. When the terror of the people was at its highest, one man braver than the rest made his perilous way to the pilot house. There he saw the pilot lashed to his post with his hands on the wheel and a smile on his face. The passenger rushed back to the deck below shouting, &quot;All is well. We shall be saved. I saw the pilot and he smiled at me.&quot; That smiling face averted panic and converted despair into hope.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">So if by faith we see the face of the Pilot of Galilee, the despair of life disappears, and the soul is filled with peace and hope. To see God&#39;s face in Christ brings peace to us. Our Saviour is the &quot;Prince of Peace&quot; (Isaiah 9:6), and He says to all who trust in Him, &quot;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid&quot; (John 14:27). Do we have His peace?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The ancients used to inscribe by the tombs of their dead, &quot;Non est {He is not}.&quot; The difference that Jesus makes is found in Bunyan&#39;s sweet words: &quot;The Pilgrim they laid in a . . . chamber, whose window opened toward the sun-rising; the name of the chamber was Peace, where he slept till break of day.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">When the mind is stayed on God, there is everlasting strength, and therefore peace. As Herbert Hoover said, &quot;Peace is not made in documents, but in the hearts of men.&quot; This inner peace comes to us when we really trust in God, who will fill us &quot;with all joy and peace in believing&quot; (Romans 15:13).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">MEDITATION PRAYER: &quot;Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them&quot; (Psalms 119:165).</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs3E284CF">&quot;Repentance&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs8C9D0446">But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die (Ezekiel 18:21).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">According to our text today the wicked are those who have sinned. The Scriptures declare that &quot;all have sinned&quot; (Romans 3:23), so this promise is to all. Death has passed upon all men, because all have sinned (Romans 5:12); but &quot;if the wicked will turn from all his sins . . . , and do that which is . . . right, he shall surely live.&quot; This is a universal promise to fill a universal need.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">We have all sinned, and except we repent we &quot;shall all likewise perish&quot; (Luke 13:3). There are two kinds of repentance. One is that of Judas, the other that of Peter. One is the ice broken; the other, the ice melted. Judas was sorry for the results of his sin; Peter was sorry for his sin. After his repentance, Judas went and hanged himself; but Peter, after his repentance, went to Pentecost. Real repentance is to turn from our sins and to walk in the ways of obedience; in other words, to &quot;do that which is lawful and right.&quot; The&nbsp; thought here us, Obey and live; disobey and perish. The truth of this is seen in the history of civilization, of nations, of individuals. But even obedience is a gift from God, for it is of Him and through Him and by Him that we both will do His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">There is no worse imprisonment,&quot; says George Albert Coe, &quot;than inability to repent.&quot; The time to turn from our sins is now, before the groove of habit becomes so deep that we shall never care, or be able, to get out of it. The only difference between a groove and a grave is in depth. Let us turn from sin today, repent today, begin to walk in the path of obedience today; and we shall have God&#39;s promise of life, eternal life. &quot;The Lord is . . . not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance&quot; (2 Peter 3:9).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">MEDITATION PRAYER: &quot;I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin&quot; (Psalms 32:5). </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs3E284CF">&quot;Be Not Afraid&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs8C9D0446">Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

Prince Galitzin was appointed one of the official rulers of the church, and he purchased a Bible secretly in order to acquaint himself with the first principles of Christianity. It changed his whole life. Then Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Russia, and all St. Petersburg prepared either to fight or to flee. Galitzin alone remained unmoved and continued work on his palace as though his country were in the midst of profound peace.

The prince opened it to the ninety-first psalm; &quot;He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.&quot; The czar was profoundly impressed amd wemt to the cathedral for worship before leaving for his campaign. The pastor began to read this same psalm. &quot;Did Galitzin tell you to select that psalm? asked the czar after the service. &quot;No, I prayed the Lord to be guided in my choice.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The czar went a day&#39;s march with his army.

Full rewards are not given in this life, but there is a judgement day coming. In Hebrews 2:2 we read that every trangression will receive &quot;a just recompence of reward&quot; (Hebrews 10:35). But the greatest reason why we should never worry or be troubled is that the Lord Himself promises to come and save us. He will come to us in Christ at His second coming, but He comes to us now by His Spirit. In fact, He is never far from any one of us, as the great apostle Paul tells us in Acts 17:27.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Years ago I heard Bishop William Alfred Quayle preach, and I shall never forget the words of that great Cornishman.

I&#39;ll sit up the rest of the night.&quot; The Lord had not forsaken him. He was there and knew what to do. He will come and save us, too, if we will let Him.

Then the adversaries will not be able to root us out of Emmanuel&#39;s land, the providence of God, &quot;the Canaan of His covenant love,&quot; as Spurgeon puts it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">But, more than that, someday the whole earth will be given to God&#39;s people. &quot;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth&quot; (Matthew 5:5). The Lord puts a &quot;verily&quot; in our promise text for today. In the land of promise, here and hereafter, His children shall be fed. They may not be fed by ravens or by an angel, by an Obadiah or by a widow, but &quot;verily&quot; they shall be fed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;When we walk with the Lord</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of His word,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; What a glory He sheds on our way!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; While we do His good will,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; He abides with us still,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; And with all who will trust and obey.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; --Rev.

It&#39;s quite clear from this that the righteous will have trouble, and it will be so severe they will cry out. They will not only desire help, long for it, but will cry out. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">We were fortunate in having a number of children in our home, but when they were little they got into trouble. If possible, they would run home to Mother or Father, get as close as possible to the source of help, and let their needs be known in loud voices. What a lesson for us! When we are in trouble we should get close to the Lord and cry out to Him for help. He will hear us and deliver us from our troubles.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Sometimes our troubles come from our own sins. In such cases we must forsake our sins if we wish to be free from the trouble. Sometimes our troubles will last longer than we think they should, but when it is best for us, we shall be delivered out of them. By God&#39;s grace, let us not suffer from troubles before they arrive. Dean W. R. Inge has said, &quot;Worry is interest paid on trouble before it comes due.&quot; And remember, it is those who cry out for help who will be heard.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;More things are wrought by Prayer</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Than this world dreams of.

Not wishing to disturb him, the young man started to leave. Pasteur looked up and the student said, &quot;I thought you were praying.&quot; Turning again to his microscope, the great but humble man of science replied, &quot;I was.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Prayer consists not only of words spoken, but of a constant attitude in the life of the true Christian. His desire is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. This desire is imparted by the Holy Spirit, therefore God will answer it. God-fearing men desire to be holy, to be useful to God, to be a blessing to others. They desire help in time of need, guidance in times of perplexity, deliverance in trouble. Sometimes these desires are so strong that they cry out in agony as a child might to his father or mother. Then the Lord hears and answers wondrously. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Like Daniel, we are to be men of desires, and God will help us to realize them. If we fear God, we have nothing else to fear, for then our salvation will certain, and that will be our chief desire. The Lord will hear our cry and will save us. Let us often have this great threefold promise upon our tongues. It will bless us as long as we live. &nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Prayer is the soul&#39;s sincere desire,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unmuttered or expressed;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The motion of a hidden fire</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That trembles in the breast.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Prayer is the burden of a sigh,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The falling of a tear,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The upward glancing of an eye</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When none but God is near.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; --James Montgomery</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">MEDITATION PRAYER: &quot;Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing&quot; (Psalms 145:16).</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs3E284CF">&quot;The Double Promise&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs8C9D0446">The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therin for ever (Psalms 37:29).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Notice, this is a double promise. First, &quot;the righteous shall inherit the land&quot;; second, they shall &quot;dwell therein for ever.&quot; They do not buy it, discover it, merely take possession of it, claim it, see it, hope for it; but they inherit it, and their dwelling in it is never to be disturbed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">What is the land that they inherit? God promised Abraham the land of Canaan (Genesis 13:14-17), a land that He would afterward show him. But this land of Canaan was a type, a symbol, of the entire world, for we read in Romans 4:13 that the promise to Abraham was &quot;that he should be the heir of the world,&quot; and that this promise came through faith. This promise was not only to Abraham and his seed, but to all those who are of faith through Christ. So the promise is by grace. &quot;Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all&quot; (Romans 4:16).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">So all Christians have inherited the right to a part of Abraham&#39;s farm, or to a part in all of it. They are heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17) to the inheritance of the land, the entire world. With this promise we remember the words of Christ, &quot;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth&quot; (Matthew 5:5). This is really a parallel to our promise text for today.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The usurper still claims authority in this world, but Jesus came that &quot;he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.&quot; (Hebrews 2:14). The earth will be renewed and brought back to its Edenic beauty as the eternal home of the saved. It is by faith that we become citizens of God&#39;s spiritual kingdom now and are assured a place in His kingdom of glory soon to come.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">MEDITATION PRAYER: &quot;Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed&quot; (Psalms 74:2).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
