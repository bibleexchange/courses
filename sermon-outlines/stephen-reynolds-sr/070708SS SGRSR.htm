<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Natural Reasoning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Matthew 16:13-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Natural Reasoning Opposes Truth, the Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mt 16:13</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he
asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist:
some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The natural mind with its reasoning &amp; ‘good logic’
cannot grasp the spiritual. Jesus taught His disciples not to depend on their
natural thinking. We do not want to misjudge, misunderstand, the Master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt 16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mt 16:17 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou,
Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it. {Peter: this name signifies a rock} </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DEPEND ON THE POWER OF GOD. Renewed and Transformed you will
see the order of Heaven. Seeing what is done in Heaven, you will see done in
earth. God will grant by His Word and its authority this power to every
believer that will obey Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Matthew 16:23</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>But he turned, and said unto Peter, <b>Get thee behind me,
Satan</b>: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that
be of God, but those that be of men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mt 16:22 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it
far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter depending on his own reasoning is being inspired by
the devil. The devil is a foe and is an enemy. If you deny yourself and you
oppose your reasoning and surrender yourself to God and you yield yourself to
God’s Spirit you will find the devil is no match.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Ro 12:2 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,
and perfect, will of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The transforming power of God is the only way. Every attack
of the devil is nothing for the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mt 16:24 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Denying self has a lot to do with denying your natural
reasoning. What I think must be denied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How can a man deny himself? Start with denying your natural
reasoning.</p>
