If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;41 &nbsp;Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;44 &nbsp;The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;47 &nbsp;Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;50 &nbsp;Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee&#39;s children.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus&#39; disciple:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;65 &nbsp;Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</span></p></body>
