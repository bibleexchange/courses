Ike Vs Thorpe in Football, Real Life</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Veteran sports fans still talk about the November 9th, 1912, football game between Army and tiny Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Carlisle&#39;s Boys only went to the twelfth grade, but since many of their players were too rough for high school games, they played major colleges.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before the November 9th game, Army was ranked second in the nation. But that was before Jim Thorpe and the Carlisle team trounced them with a 27-6 score.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For his athletic prowess Thorpe was known as &quot;the greatest at almost any feat except controlling himself.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thorpe died in 1953. His death ended a long nightmare of drinking, bumming about the country, family troubles, injuries and illnesses.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And the Army halfback who played against Thorpe in the 1912 game? He became a general in the U.S. Army, and president of the United States in 1952, one year before Thorpe died.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">His name: Dwight David Eisenhower.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2504. Spurgeon: &quot;Don&#39;t Trifle&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The famous preacher Charles Spurgeon said that whenever he looked at the portrait of Henry Martyn, these words seemed to ring in his heart: &quot;Don&#39;t trifle! Don&#39;t trifle!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The reason the minister felt this way is easy to understand. Martyn had graduated from Cambridge with honors in both mathematics and the classics, and had the prospect of a brilliant academic career.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But he chose to serve the Lord in India. He was almost 25 when he arrived there, and at the age of 31 died. Yet in those 6 years he translated the New Testament into three languages&mdash;Hindustani, Arabic, and Persian.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">12861. Diplomatic Words</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Pop,&quot; said Edgar, looking up from the book he was reading, &quot;what is meant by &#39;diplomatic phraseology&#39;?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Well,&quot; replied the father, &quot;if you were to say to a homely girl, &#39;Your face would stop a clock,&#39; that would be uncomplimentary and inappropriate; but if you said to her, &#39;When I look into your eyes, time stands still,&#39; that would be diplomatic phraseology.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">13322. Talent and Tact Compared</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Talent,&quot; says a writer, &quot;knows what to do, and tact knows how to do it; talent makes a man respectable, tact will make him respected. For all the practical purposes of life, tact has it over talent ten to one. Talent has many a compliment from the bench, but tact touches fees from attorneys and clients. Talent speaks learnedly and logically, tact triumphantly. Talent makes the world wonder that it gets on no faster, tact excites astonishment that it gets on so fast.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
