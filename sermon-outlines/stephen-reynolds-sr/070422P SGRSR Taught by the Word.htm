<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: Taught by the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Isaiah 54:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>ISAIAH 54:13</u></b> ‘And all thy children shall be
taught of the Lord…’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Lord is going to speak, he is going to teach, have that
in your spirit, in your heart. The devil is going to fight that and divide that
and destroy that. The devil would like you to doubt and fear, but God is going
to teach us. Teaching does not come without training. With training comes a
task. What is it that God wants us to do? What would the Lord have us to do? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a lot of things we could do, but our
responsibility is to follow God, do his will, serve Him, love Him. IT is the
Lord that is teaching us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is peace in knowing that we are serving Him and loving
Him. It is not just these hands that He wants working, but He wants our heart
working. I NEED TO BE TAUGHT BY HIM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>JOHN 6:45</u></b> There is something that God wants to
do in these last days that He has not taught to or spoken to other people
before. Things we have never known and things the prophets have never known.<b><u>
We need to be taught of the Lord.</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Matthew 4:4 Man shall not live by bread alone but by every
word that proceedsd out of the mouth of God. (Luke 4:4)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deuteronomy 8:3 &lt;that which was given to the prophets
something was added in the spirit of the Word&gt; <i>And he humbled thee, and
suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not,
neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that <u>man doth not
live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
LORD</u> doth man live.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Egress window <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span>
do I have opening ‘big enough’ for God to get into?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God’s Word opens up our heart. Deuteronomy 8:3<span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span>a man’s heart prepared to receive the
word of God. </p>

word SPOKEN revealed by the Spirit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God knows best. Like an Ezekiel prophesying to the wind, an
exceeding great army came up. God is teaching beyond us, our ability. There is
a problem in the hearts of men that too little is know and too little is given,
so that gives so <u>little room for God to work</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Word of God can put something in my heart that cannot be
destroyed.</p>
