I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 20 But </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things</span><span class="csA521DC07">. 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father</span><span class="csA521DC07">. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">25 And </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">this is the promise</span><span class="csA521DC07"> that he hath promised us, </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">even eternal life</span><span class="csA521DC07">. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">ye need not that any man teach you</span><span class="csA521DC07">: but as </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth</span><span class="csA521DC07">, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">1Co 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Isa 25:8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Isa 5:13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ho 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Pr 1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Proverbs 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Pr 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Pr 15:14 &para; The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Pr 17:27 &para; He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</span></p></body>
