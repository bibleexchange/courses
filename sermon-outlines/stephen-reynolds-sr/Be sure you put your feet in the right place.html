His heart has to be both tough and tender, hard and compassionate, disciplined and soft. In addition to this, the shepherd has to spend a great deal of time alone out in the countryside with the sheep. he must utilize the time to develop his thought processes and to draw near God. The shepherd always has the opportunity to use his time to become a man of great devotion and prayer.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Moses had spent forty years developing the heart of a true shepherd </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">God was ready to call him to be the shepherd of God&#39;s people</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><a name="link370"><span class="csA521DC07">Moses was a man of faith, a man who believed the miracles of God, the impossible acts of God (</span></a><span class="csA521DC07"><a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ex+3%3A2"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Exodus 3:2</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).
