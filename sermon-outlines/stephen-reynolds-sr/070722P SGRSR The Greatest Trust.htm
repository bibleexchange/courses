<p class=MsoNormal>TITLE: The Greatest Trust</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEXT: Luke 18:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The greatest trust has to do with your faith working by
love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everybody can receive from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr 10:17 ¶ And when he was gone forth into the way, there
came one <b>running</b>, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what
shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man comes interested, but the Lord is going to take him
further in his interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thou knowest the commandments,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know it, you’ve done it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is something missing, Jesus tells him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he answered and said unto him, Master, <b>all these have
I observed</b> from my youth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, <b>One
thing thou lackest:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>v.17 What lack I yet?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some have love and no faith. Others have faith, but no real
love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he
had great possessions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Luke 18:18,22</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what
shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without eternal life it is all in vain. Great ministry, what
is it worth if in the end the minister does not have eternal life? ALL MUST
HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet
lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor,
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do not leave this place unsaved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The greatest trust is that your faith work by love, that you
can have eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faithfulness in our love and obedience that we may ENDURE TO
THE END. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mt 10:22 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
that endureth to the end shall be saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are upon the evening shadows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yield our life to you and when we yield to you we find
eternal life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let there be a stirring in our heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The children responded specially to Jesus, the touch of God.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Get beyond the shallowness of a movement, feeling,
excitement os that we do not go away ‘exceedingly sorrowful.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rich ruler was VERY RICH, having so much that we could
sell and give away and it wouldn’t bother him one bit. But Jesus says sell <b>ALL.</b>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are going to know about the kingdom of God you have
to sell it ALL. Leaving no credit for self. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EVERY PART OF SIN REJECT AND BE SICK TOWARDS ITS PRESENCE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mt 19:17</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is
none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
commandments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can’t just call Christ Good, you must also acknowledge
He is God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The greatest trust is when you surrender your life
completelty to him, you take what he gives you from His hands. All that I have
put it on the altar and put myself trusting Him. He will give that back which
pertains to eternal life, but there are also rewards of obedience and faith for
they bring great rewards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ruler was blinded to who Jesus was and so was blinded to
what He could do. The ruler had ideas for his money but no idea what God could
do with his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God has need of you!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lu 19:30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in
the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man
sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Lu 19:31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus
shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trust &amp; Hope</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith works by the Love of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christ taught us by example. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is not looking for jus the coming and running but the
SURRENDER. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith is a gift from God, but love is His very nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IT is not ‘Reynolds’ Church’, but the Lord has need of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am nothing as long as I think I am something. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Isa 26:3 </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Thou wilt keep him in perfect
peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD
JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m gonna trust Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unless God has given it to you, you need to get rid of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
