He has committed both his life and his death into the hands of Christ, surrendering all he is to Christ. While he lives He is the Lord&#39;s, and when he dies he is the Lord&#39;s. No matter where the believer is or what he is doing, he is the Lord&#39;s. The Lord is his Lord, for the believer has placed his life and death under the care and keeping of the Lord.

He is the Lord of all believers whether they are living on this earth or deceased and passed on into heaven. The true believer has been purchased by the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. The believer does not belong to himself: he must not act selfishly and sinfully in making decisions about behavior.

And, very simply, if some behavior or activity is thought to be unclean, we are not to do it. Scripture gives us a great principle in these three verses, a principle that could revolutionize the behavior of believers and much of society if we would just do what God says.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Note the words, &quot;there is nothing unclean of itself.&quot; The immediate situation of the early church was dealing with eating certain foods and keeping special holy days. However, the fact is applicable to the questionable functions faced by every generation of believers. In its pure and natural form, all of God&#39;s creation is acceptable to God. It is what man does with things that make them impure.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;The grape is pure, but man takes it and makes an intoxicating drink out of it that damages the human body and leads to immoral behavior.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellowship is pure; but man takes it and turns it into a loose, partying atmosphere that leads to exposure of the human body, suggestive thoughts and conversation, and immoral behavior.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vegetation and forest plants are pure, but man takes them and makes all kinds of harmful and intoxicating drugs, drinks, and foods that harm the human body and lead to immoral and unjust behavior.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">The point is this: because of what man does with the things and activities of the earth, believers must watch the things which men make unclean and the things which other believers think are unclean. We must not do anything that would cause a brother to stumble.</span></p></body>
