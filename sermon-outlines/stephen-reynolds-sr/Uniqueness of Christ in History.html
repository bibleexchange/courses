The proud arm of Rome, with all its boast of justice, was to be but a dirty dagger in the pudgy hand of priests!<br/><br/>I was waiting in the room I used for court, officially enthroned, with clerk and guards, when they led Him in. Well, Gaius, don&#39;t smile at this, as you value your jaw, but I&#39;ve had no peace since He walked into my judgment hall that dawn! It has been years, man, but these scenes I&#39;ll read from the back of my eyelids every night. You&#39;ve seen Caesar when he was young inspect the legions. His air of command was child play compared with the manner of this Nazarene! He didn&#39;t have to strut, you see. He walked toward my throne, arms bound, with a stride of mastery and control that by its very audacity silenced the room for an instant and left me trembling with an insane desire to stand and salute!<br/><br/>The clerk began reading the absurd list of charges, the priestly delegation punctuating these with the palm-rubbings and the beard-strokings and the eye-rollings and the pious gutturals I had learned to ignore. But I more felt it than heard it. I questioned mechanically. He answered very little. But what He said and the way He said! It was as if His level gaze had pulled my nacked soul right up into my eyes and was probing it there. And a voice kept singing in my ear, &quot;Why, you&#39;re on trial, Pilate!&quot; And the Man wasn&#39;t listening to the charges. You&#39;d have sworn He had just come in out of friendly interest to see what was going to happen to me. And the very pressure of His standing there had grown unbearable, when a slave rushed in all atremble at interrupting court, bringiing a message from Claudia. She had stabbed at the stylus in that childish way she has when she&#39;s distraught. &quot;Don&#39;t judge this amazing Man,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I was haunted by Him this night!&quot;<br/><br/>Gaius, I tried to free Him. From that moment on I tried, and I&#39;ll always think He knew it. I declared Him out of my jurisdiction, being a Galilean. But the native king Herod discovered He was born in Judaea and sent Him back to me. I appealed to the crowd that had gathered in the streets, hoping they were His sympathizers. But Ciaphas had stationed agitators to whip up the beasts and cry for blood, and you know how any citizen loves, just after breakfast, to cry for another&#39;s blood. I had Him beated, a thorough barracks-room beating. I&#39;m not sure why. To appease the crowd, I guess. But do we Romans need a reason for beatings? That&#39;s the code, isn&#39;t it, for anything we don&#39;t understand?<br/><br/>Well, it didn&#39;t work. The crowd roared like some slavering beast when I brought Him back. If only you could have watched Him! They had thrown some rags of mock purple over His pulped and bleeding shoulders. They had jammed a chaplet of thorns down over His forehead. And it fitted! It all fitted! He stood there watching them from my balcony, swaying from weakness by now, but royal, I tell you! In the teeth of that mob, not just pain but pity shining from His eyes and seaming His face. And I kept thinking, somehow this is monstrous; somehow it&#39;s upside down. That purple is real! that crown is real! Somehow, these animal noises the crowd is shrieking should be praise! And then Caiaphas played his master-stroke on me. Announced there in public that this Jesus claimed a crown that was treason to Caesar. And the guards began to glance at one another. And that mob of spineless silth began to shout &quot;Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!&quot; And I knew I was beaten. And I gave the order. And I couldn&#39;t look at Him. And I did that childish thing, I called for water and there on the balcony I washed my hands of the whole affair. But as they led Him away I did look up, and He turned and looked at me. No smile, no pity, just glanced at my hands, and I&#39;ll feel the weight of His eyes on them from now on.<br/><br/>But you&#39;re yawning, Gaius. I&#39;ve kept you up. And as active a man as you are needs his rest on holidays. Claudia will be asleep by now. rows of lighted lamps near her couch. She can&#39;t sleep in the dark any more. Not since that afternoon. you see the sun went out when my guards executed Him. That&#39;s what I said! I don&#39;t know how or what. I only know I was there, that though it was midday it turned as black as the tunnels of hell in that miserable city, while I tried to compose Claudia, and explain how I&#39;d been trapped, and she railed at me with her dream. She&#39;s had the dream ever since when she sleeps in the dark. Some form of it. That there was to be a new Caesar, and that I killed Him.<br/><br/>Oh, we&#39;ve been to Egypt, to their seers and magicians. We&#39;ve listened by the hour to oracles in the musty temples of Greece, chattering their inanities. We&#39;ve called it an oriental curse that we&#39;re under, and we&#39;ve tried to break it a thousand ways. But there&#39;s no breaking it. Except - and even that might not, you see.<br/><br/>but do you know why I&#39;ve kept going? deeper than the curse is the haunting, driving certainity that He&#39;s still somewhere near. That I&#39;ve unfinished business with Him. That&#39; now and then, as I walk by the lake He&#39;s followiing me. And much as that strikes terror, I wonder if that isn&#39;t the only hope. You see, if I could walk up to Him and this time salute! Tell Him I know now, whoever He is, He was the only Man worth the name in all Judaea that day. Tell Him I know I wasn&#39;t trapped, that I trapped myself. Tell Him here&#39;s one Roman who wishes He were Caesar! I believe that would do it. I believe He&#39;d listen, and know I meant it, and that at last I&#39;d see Him smile!<br/><br/>Yes, quiet tonight, isn&#39;t it, Gaius? Not a breeze stirring down by the lake. Yes good night. You had better run along. No, no, I think - will you waken the slave outside the door and tell him to bring me a cloak, my heavy one. I believe I&#39;ll walk by the lake. Yes, it is dark there, but I won&#39;t be alone. I guess I never really have been alone. Yes, goodnight, Gaius!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csEF0D56D5"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csEF0D56D5"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

				<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4711DACD">This review is from: <a class="csFC02DFA1" href="http://www.amazon.com/Christianity-World-Religions-Norman-Anderson/dp/0877849811/ref=cm_cr_dp_orig_subj"><span class="cs651C2180">Christianity and World Religions (Paperback)</span></a></span><span class="cs3D00DF28"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs15323895">This book, along with Dissonant Voices by Harold A. Netland (which I have also reviewed), is among the best Christian books I have read on the relation of Christianity to the world&#39;s other major religions. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">The main thrust of this work is the uniqueness of the Gospel. There are three major chapters dealing with the uniqueness question: A unique proclamation? A unique salvation? A unique disclosure? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">The two other chapters: No other name? Proclamation, dialogue, or both? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">&quot;A unique proclamation?&quot; discusses the idea that the New Testament argues that God-in-manhood (i.e. Jesus Christ) has died in human history and has been physically resurrected as well; these are unique historical events. Anderson contrasts this with major differences found in other religions. The mystery religions of the early Christian era (c. 0-200 A.D.) are myth based whereas Christianity is based on events in a specific place and a specific time. Anderson also notes the mythological basis of Hinduism (he also discusses the Hindu doctrine of avatars which is quite DIFFERANT from the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation). As for religions with a historical basis, he discusses Islam and Judaism (and includes Buddhism under this category, but I don&#39;t agree. Buddhism could exist if the historical Buddha was mythological.) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">&quot;A unique salvation?&quot; discusses the ultimate goal or purpose of human existence, as understood from Christianity and other religions. For the Christian, this would be Heaven and the forgiveness of sins etc... However, this stands in sharp contrast to other religions, which have, for example, release from reincarnation as their &quot;salvation.&quot; Anderson than classifies religions into two categories; those that are &quot;this worldy&quot; and those that are Hereafter oriented. The &quot;this-worldly&quot; religions/ideologies discussed are: Communism, Fascism, Theravada Buddhism, and Zen Buddhism. Then there are the religions where salvation is &quot;primarily in terms of eternity&quot; (e.g. Hinduism, Bhaki Hinduism, Mahayana Buddhism etc...). He notes that Christianity is among the very few with the dual emphasis both on eternity and the present world. Then, Anderson looks at the question of how salvation is to be attained in various different religions and the differences that are entailed here. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">&quot;A unique disclosure?&quot; contrasts the Christian revelation of the nature and character of God to other religions. Anderson addresses the so-called, &quot;evolutionary theory of religions,&quot; which asserts that religions start as animism, then polytheism and lastly monotheism. Anderson presents contrary evidence to this, in that there have been several tribes discovered which are either at the level of monotheism (and this development could not be attributed to outside influences) or henotheism (which is belief in or worship of one God while admitting or not denying the existence of other Gods; i.e. the notion of a &quot;Supreme&quot; God). Anderson looks at the problem of evil, the character of God and some other ideas in the rest of this chapter.</span></p></td></tr>

He notes that the New Testament records the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as &quot;once for all.&quot; One of the great passages in the book, is here: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">&quot;Inevitably, then the Christian faith is either itself false or `casts the shadow of falsehood, or at least of imperfect truth, on every other system. This Christian claim&#39; as Stephen Neill insists, ` is naturally offensive to the adherents of every other religious system... But we must not suppose that this claim to universal validity is something that can be quietly removed from the Gospel without changing it into something entirely different from what it is... For the human sickness there is one specific remedy, and this is it. There is no other.&#39;&quot; (page 140). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">Anderson then proceeds to examine various different situations such as the pre-Christian era, those today who have never heard the Gospel, the Jews since the advent of Christ. I was very surprised that Anderson did not mention or discuss Hebrews 8:13; such a passage would seem to have decisive to say about the case of Judaism. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">The last chapter is about the relation between proclamation and dialogue. Proclamation is the announcement of the Gospel and declaring what God has done in Jesus. Entering into discussion with the adherent of another religion, does not require, giving up one&#39;s commitments, embracing relativism etc... both rather committing to respect the dignity and accord the other person the respect the deserve as a person. Anderson takes as a text, the encounter between Cornelius and the Apostle Peter in Acts 10 where both gained something in the meeting. I am not sure what to make of this chapter; the whole issue of what dialogue is (in contrast to evangelism or theological argument) has not been clearly defined in a widely accepted way. There are some informal forms of dialogue with adherents of other religions, which may eventually change into a presentation of the Gospel; this would seem to be the ideal situation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675"><img src="Uniqueness%20of%20Christ%20in%20History_files/image0.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675"><img src="Uniqueness%20of%20Christ%20in%20History_files/image1.png" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 54.15pt;"><span class="csA7555675">	</span></p></body>
