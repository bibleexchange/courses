		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF42C4B08">Introduction</span><span class="csA521DC07">: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest problem man faces today is how to be a friend of God. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">A friend is a person who holds affection and respect for another person. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">The affection and respect attaches them together. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">If they have feelings and respect for one another, they become attached; they become friends.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">If they do not have affection and respect for one another, they are not friends; they are enemies.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">This is the problem man has with God. Man does not hold affection and respect for God, not enough to become attached to God, not enough to become a close, intimate friend with God.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Man just does not care and respect God enough to subject himself to God, to elevate God to the position He rightly holds: the Creator and Sustainer of life, the Sovereign Lord and Master of the universe. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">As Christ said: &quot;Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you&quot; (John 15:14). </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">But man is not willing to do what Christ commanded, not willing to love and serve God nor to keep His commandments. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Man breaks God&#39;s commandments and rebels against God. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Man stands up against God and refuses to obey Him. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Thus man stands as an opponent of God, as an enemy of God.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">However, this is not true of every single person upon earth. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Some persons want to be friends with God.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;They have the deepest affection and respect for God, and they are forever seeking a deeper friendship. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">In fact, some are seeking the deepest and most intimate friendship possible with God. Such a passion should burn within the heart of every person. It did within Abraham. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">This is what this passage is all about: </span><span class="csD3860DFD">Abraham Was Visited by God Himself </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="link231"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Ge 18:1 &para; And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</span></a></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Conquer unbelief. Note three significant things.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">1.&nbsp;The causes of unbelief are clearly seen in this experience of Sarah.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csA521DC07">a.&nbsp;Sarah and Abraham were looking at an impossible situation, humanly speaking. They were both beyond childbearing </span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;Abraham was one hundred years old and Sarah was ninety years old.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csA521DC07">b.&nbsp;Sarah allowed negative thoughts to enter her mind. </span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;she had heard the Lord&#39;s promise to Abraham, but she knew the impossible circumstances. The whole situation just seemed laughable to Sarah, and she actually laughed to herself, somewhat mockingly and skeptically. She murmured silently to herself, &quot;How can I who am so old bear a child, and Abraham also being so old&mdash;impossible! Sarah was responding to God&#39;s promise in unbelief: she just did not believe God&#39;s promise, did not believe it was possible. It was physically impossible to her. </span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csA521DC07">she was thinking of the circumstances, not thinking of God and His promise and power.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">2.&nbsp;The answer to unbelief is twofold (Genesis 18:13-14).</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csA521DC07">a.&nbsp;</span><span class="csD3860DFD">God&#39;s omniscience</span><span class="csA521DC07">, His knowing all things.

God can do anything, no matter how impossible it seems. He clearly said that He would give Sarah a child despite the deadness of her womb Ro 4:19</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee (Job 42:2).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">But Jesus beheld [them], and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible (Matthew 19:26).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">For with God nothing shall be impossible&quot; (Luke 1:37).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The conquest of unbelief (Genesis 18:15). Sarah lied: she denied that she had laughed, for she feared a severe rebuke from the Lord and perhaps from Abraham. But the Lord made it clear: she did laugh&mdash;laughed in unbelief&mdash;and He knew all about her failure to believe the promise of the promised seed. Moreover, she was now lying about the matter.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">What the Lord was doing was telling Sarah that she needed to confess, repent, stop the deceit and lying, and believe the promise. God could perform the miracle, overcome the circumstances of life, no matter how impossible they might appear. God could fulfill His promise. Sarah could conquer unbelief only if she confessed, repented, and believed the promise of the promised seed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Unbelief will always keep us from being a friend of God. The friend of God believes God; he never disbelieves. We must, therefore, conquer unbelief:</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;We must not look at circumstances as though they are impossible for God.</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;We must not allow negative thoughts to surround the promises of God, questioning His promises.</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;We must believe that God knows all things and can do all things</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;We must confess and repent of our sin of unbelief, of distrusting the promises of God.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="csA521DC07">This is the only way to conquer unbelief.
