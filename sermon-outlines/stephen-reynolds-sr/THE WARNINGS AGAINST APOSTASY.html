What is it? The danger of false teaching. If a believer swallows false teaching, he dooms himself. Any person who denies that God sent His Son into the world to save man&mdash;who denies that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world&mdash;will never be accepted by God. He is doomed to spend eternity cut off from God. Why? Because he has not believed in the name of God&#39;s Son. Time and time again, God warns believers of apostasy. This is the very reason for the books of Jude and Second Peter being written. Strong warnings against false teachers are also issued by Paul in Galatians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy, and Titus. There are severe warnings all throughout Hebrews. And Christ Himself gave strong warnings time and again throughout all the gospels. (See <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=735&amp;tocpath=POSB%20NT%20Master%20Subject%20Index\F\FALSE%20TEACHERS"><span class="cs92015F65">Teachers, False&mdash;Master Subject Index</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.)</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No matter who the person is&mdash;no matter how well liked and influential and attractive his teachings may be&mdash;if he denies Jesus Christ and God&#39;s Word, he is a false teacher.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Here is the thrust of the letter of Jude, the very purpose for which Jude writes. Here is one of the most horrifying pictures in all the Bible, a picture of the characteristics and judgment of false teachers. (Note: this passage may need to be divided into several sections.

class="csCF6BBF71">: believers are to contend for the faith against false teachers. Note that Jude had planned to write the believers, but he had never planned to write this particular letter. He had planned to write about the great subject of salvation. But he was not able to. The believers were being attacked, but not by persecutors. They were being attacked by false teachers and their false beliefs. Jude is forced to snatch up his pen to expose the heretical teachers. He was forced to warn believers of the horrible danger of apostasy. He wanted to write a pastoral letter, to encourage them to grow in Christ, but now he must warn them and exhort them: they must go to war, to spiritual war. They must earnestly contend and fight for the faith. They must be diligent and strive unceasingly in the fight against false teaching. They must not buckle under any whatsoever in standing up for the faith that has been delivered to the saints. The faith must not be twisted, added to, or taken away from. It must be kept pure and free from all error. Note why: certain men had </span><span class="csC382D2BB">unknowingly crept into the church</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and were teaching false doctrine. The characteristics and judgment of false teachers show how horrible false teaching is to God.

They do not teach the truth of God&#39;s love and purity demonstrated in Christ. They profane God and the truth of His love and godliness.</span></a></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ro+1%3A18"><span class="cs835A930E">Romans 1:18</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+4%3A18"><span class="cs835A930E">1 Peter 4:18</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; and spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Pe+2%3A4-5"><span class="cs835A930E">2 Peter 2:4-5</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Pe+3%3A7"><span class="cs835A930E">2 Peter 3:7</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jude+1%3A4"><span class="cs835A930E">Jude 4</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="link491"><span class="cs3D5B4455">5. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(v. 4) </span><span class="csA657E9A2">Grace&mdash; Lasciviousness</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: they turn the grace of God into licentiousness (</span><span class="cs42F4DD0A">aselgeian</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=L\#2299: Lasciviousness"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;2299</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).

There were over six-hundred thousand men alone who broke away from the enslavements of Egypt and began the journey to the promised land. This means that including the women and children there were well over two million who stepped out to follow God to the promised land (cp. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ex+12%3A37"><span class="cs92015F65">Exodus 12:37</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Nu+1%3A46"><span class="cs92015F65">Numbers 1:46</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).

How many actually turned away from the fleshly desires aroused by the delicious foods, drinks, and bodily stimulations of Egypt and the world? How many actually disciplined their bodies, subjected their desires, and kept their eyes and hearts upon the promised land? How many were faithful and steadfast, unmoveable and always abounding in the work of the Lord until they reached the promised land?

Why? Because Abel was a believer. Abel believed God, that he was to worship God exactly like God said, by the blood of a sacrificial animal. Cain did not accept such a belief. He felt that if he brought the fruit of his own hands to God, then God would accept him because of his hard work and because he worshipped and gave offerings to God. God accepted Abel&#39;s worship and offering. It was evident in his life by the way God blessed him and took care of him. But God rejected Cain&#39;s offering. Cain did not have a real sense of God&#39;s care or blessing upon his life. Therefore, he became jealous and envious of Abel, and he killed Abel. Three things are being said about false teachers.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;False teachers do not believe God&mdash;that a person has to worship God exactly like God says, by the blood of Jesus Christ.

They were fellowship meals that the church celebrated after the services on the Lord&#39;s Day. Each family brought what food they could. This, of course, meant that the wealthy brought plenty and the poor brought little or nothing. Remember that many of the believers were slaves in that day, so some of them would not be able to bring any food whatsoever. Some churches had the most joyful fellowship around the love feasts. It provided a time when the believers could share the warmth of their hearts and grow in fellowship together. It was a time when the Holy Spirit could draw the hearts of believers together in love and joy and care and sharing. It was a time that the Holy Spirit could use to bind believers together in feelings for one another and in warmth and tenderness.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The point is this: fellowship among believers is a most wonderful time, a unique opportunity to grow and share together.

They dirty and soil the name of Christ and the testimony of the church. They profess to be believers and are even teachers of God&#39;s Word, but they are not pure. Their false teaching disturbs genuine believers and causes division within the fellowship of the church. Those who are not rooted in Christ and in God&#39;s Word follow and support the false teacher; those who are rooted in Christ and in God&#39;s Word reject the false teacher. False teachers always spot and dirty the fellowship of the church because they cause division among the people and destroy the Spirit of Christ among them.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;False teachers are reefs or submerged rocks that wreck the fellowship of the church.

There is no fear of God nor thought about the damage they are doing to the fellowship of the church. Their interest is to boost themselves forward; to be recognized as an excellent teacher or preacher, a person of unusual gfts, a teacher with new insights, a teacher who is progressive, who is a notch above others.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="csA657E9A2">Thought 1</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The fellowship of believers is spiritual. It is not a social fellowship based upon emotional feelings for one another. It is fellowship wrought by the Spirit of God. Feelings are involved; but beyond that there is godly love, joy, peace, and purpose, meaning, and significance&mdash;all centered around Jesus Christ. When false teaching is present, all this is disrupted. Therefore, false teaching must never be allowed in the true church.
