Set aside some time each day like Daniel did: Dan 6:10</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">D. Use a prayer list unless you have a perfect memory</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">E. Use cue cards as you pray for each A.C.T.S. category of prayer</span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">1. Write out several verses on 3x5 cue cards from each category</span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">2. Select a cue card from each category &amp; place them in order you choose</span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">3. Begin praying &amp; read each of the four cue cards at the appropriate time.</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">F. Paul placed great emphasis on praying for people.</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">G. Don&#39;t let your mind wander, prayer is work: Col 4:12</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">H. Get away from distractions: Mt 14:23; 6:6</span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">1. If it&#39;s not the phone ringing, the door knocking, the bird chirping, the cat meowing, the kids crying, then it&#39;s your mind wandering over all the things you have to do or didn&#39;t do.</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">I. Pray out loud- it will become conversational &amp; coherent</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">J. Chose a posture that will keep you alert: (laying down/soft chair can make you drowsy)</span></p><p class="cs3C6E64C"><span class="csA521DC07">K. Pray using the &quot;prayer chain method&quot; with one or more Christians: </span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">1. Every one gives their prayer requests which are divided up by those leading the prayers</span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">2. Different individuals are assigned a different element of the A.C.T.S of prayer</span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">3. When each is finished they don&#39;t close prayer with amen, but name the next one to pray.</span></p><p class="csED0EB83E"><span class="csA521DC07">4.

				<td class="cs1C2CDC1D" valign="top" width="834"><p class="csFA03AB67"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Out of the Mouths of Babes</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">This was written by an 8 year old, Danny Dutton of Chula Vista, CA, for his third grade homework assignment. The assignment was to explain God. </span></p><p class="csFA03AB67"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Explanation Of God </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;One of God&#39;s main jobs is making people. He makes them to replace the ones that die, so there will be enough people to take care of things on earth. He doesn&#39;t make grown-ups, just babies. I think because they are smaller and easier to make. That way He doesn&#39;t have to take up His valuable time teaching them to talk and walk. He can just leave that to mothers and fathers.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;God&#39;s second most important job is listening to prayers. An awful lot of this goes on, since some people, like preachers and things, pray at times beside bedtime. God doesn&#39;t have time to listen to the radio or TV because of this. Because He hears everything, there must be a terrible lot of noise in His ears, unless He has thought of a way to turn it off.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;God sees everything and hears everything and is everywhere which keeps Him pretty busy. So you shouldn&#39;t go wasting His time by going over your Mom and Dad&#39;s head asking for something they said you couldn&#39;t have.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;Atheists are people who don&#39;t believe in God. I don&#39;t think there are any in Chula Vista. At least there aren&#39;t any who come to our church.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;Jesus is God&#39;s Son. He used to do all the hard work like walking on water and performing miracles and trying to teach the people who didn&#39;t want to learn about God. They finally got tired of Him preaching to them and they crucified Him. But He was good and kind, like His Father and He told His Father that they didn&#39;t know what they were doing and to forgive them and God said O.K.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;His Dad (God) appreciated everything that He had done and all His hard work on earth so He told Him He didn&#39;t have to go out on the road anymore. He could stay in heaven. So He did. And now He helps His Dad out by listening to prayers and seeing things which are important for God to take care of and which ones He can take care of Himself without having to bother God. Like a secretary, only more important.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;You can pray anytime you want and they are sure to help you because they got it worked out so one of them is on duty all the time.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;You should always go to church on Sunday because it makes God happy, and if there&#39;s anybody you want to make happy, it&#39;s God. Don&#39;t skip church or do something you think will be more fun like going to the beach. This is wrong. And besides the sun doesn&#39;t come out at the beach until noon anyway.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;If you don&#39;t believe in God, besides being an atheist, you will be very lonely, because your parents can&#39;t go everywhere with you, like to camp, but God can. It is good to know He&#39;s around you when you&#39;re scared in the dark or when you can&#39;t swim and you get thrown into real deep water by big kids.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;But...you shouldn&#39;t just always think of what God can do for you. I figure God put me here and He can take me back anytime He pleases. And...that&#39;s why I believe in God.&quot;</span></p><p class="csC8FE76E0"><span class="csA521DC07">Danny Dutton</span></p></td></tr>
