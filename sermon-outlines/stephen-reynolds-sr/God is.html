Man is not perfect, but imperfect and unrighteous. Therefore, man by his very nature cannot live in God&#39;s presence, for God is perfect and the very embodiment of righteousness. How then can man ever become acceptable to God and be allowed to live in God&#39;s presence? Jesus Christ is the answer, for He is the righteousness of God; that is, God sent Jesus Christ to earth to live the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">perfect, ideal</span><span class="csA521DC07">, and </span><span class="csD3860DFD">sinless</span><span class="csA521DC07"> life.

The man is not righteous; he and everyone else knows it. But God counts his faith and belief as righteousness. Why would God do such an incredible thing? Because God loves His Son that much and God loves man that much. God loves so much that He will take any man who honors His Son by believing in Him and count that man&#39;s faith as though it were the real thing: righteousness. Very simply stated: Jesus Christ is the righteousness of God. He is the only way a man can become righteous and acceptable to God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him&quot; (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Co+5%3A21"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin&quot; (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+4%3A15"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Hebrews 4:15</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

When a man believes </span><span class="csD3860DFD">in</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Jesus Christ, God takes that man&#39;s faith and counts it for the man&#39;s sanctification.

God puts the Spirit of Christ&mdash;the very life and energy and </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">power of Christ&mdash;into the heart and life of the believer. God sends the Spirit of Christ, who is the Holy Spirit, to actually live in the body of the believer. Therefore, the believer has a supernatural power to live for God. As he follows in the footsteps of Christ, living more and more like Christ did, he becomes more and more sanctified&mdash;set apart unto God, living a more holy life than the day before.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&quot; (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Co+3%3A16"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Flee fornication.

He died as the Perfect and Ideal Man, as the Substitute and Representative Man for all men. As the Ideal and Perfect Man, He was able to bear the punishment for every man&#39;s sins.
