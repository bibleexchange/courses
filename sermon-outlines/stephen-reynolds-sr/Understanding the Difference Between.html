It is a completed death.&nbsp; Note the terminology of Scripture:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csFDF5A3F9">Dead to sin, have crucified the flesh, I am crucified, you are dead, etc.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">These describe a fact accomplished.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Crucifixion is experienced when the believer by faith accepts the provision of Christ&rsquo;s death. When faith is exercised the Spirit affects in the believer this unearned blessing of grace.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">By crucifixion the body is delivered &ldquo;from&rdquo; the old master&mdash;sin.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Crucifixion deals with the old man and a body that is enslaved to sin. The Spirit applies the atonement provision and breaks the hold (addictions) that sin has on the body. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">In crucifixion one dies to the flesh. Flesh is crucified as a ruling principle and the Spirit is enthroned as ruler.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs2C663CEE">Scriptures:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Romans 6:1-12; 7:1-6; Galatians 2:19-20; 5:24; Colossians 2:20-3:3; 1 Peter 4:1-3.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs5A8D6493">Crucifixion</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs5A8D6493">Discipline</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs2C663CEE">Scriptures:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Romans 6:13:23; 12:1-2; 1 Corinthians 9:24-27; 15:31-32; 2 Corinthians 4:7-18.

Flesh is disciplined as a servant. The Spirit guides and produces the fruit of temperance.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Discipline deals with the new man and a body that is weakened by sin. The Spirit quickens the mortal body helping the believer obey God and develop habits of holiness. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">By discipline the body is delivered &ldquo;to&rdquo; the new master&mdash;Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Discipline is accomplished by daily obedience to the Spirit and application of Scripture truth. The Spirit helps the saint in the discipline process, but does not do it for him. The saint must practice daily yielding and buffeting the body.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Discipline is a daily process and habit that must be repeated daily. It is a living death. Note the terminology of Scripture:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csFDF5A3F9">A living sacrifice, yield your members, I die daily, always bearing in the body the dying of the Lord, etc.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">These describe a lifestyle practiced.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Discipline tempers natural, normal appetites and prevents the flesh from resurrecting and ruling.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs90779611">Discipline makes crucifixion fruitful.</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">1: Always Act In Love</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">2: Never Punish When You Are Angry Or Not In Control Of Yourself</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">3: Explain Why The Punishment Is Being Given And How It Can Be Avoided In The Future</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">4: Explain Why The Action That Led To The Punishment Is Not Acceptable, And Show Your Child How That Action Is Not In The Child&rsquo;s Best Interest when God is displeased.</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">5: Always Make The Punishment &lsquo;Age Appropriate&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">6: Use Spanking And Never Be Cruel In Your Choice Of Punishments</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">7: Be Consistent In Your Expectations and Consequences</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">8: Don&rsquo;t Punish A Child If They Didn&rsquo;t Know Their Action Was Wrong; Teach Them Instead</span></p><p class="csA279866"><span class="cs15323895">9: Never Punish A Child For </span><span class="csC8D810D9">Doing Something That You Do Yourself</span><span class="cs15323895">.
