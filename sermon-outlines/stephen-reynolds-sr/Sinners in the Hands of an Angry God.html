Men&#39;s hands cannot be strong when God rises up. The strongest have no power to resist him, nor can any deliver out of his hands. -- He is not only able to cast wicked men into hell, but he can most easily do it. Sometimes an earthly prince meets with a great deal of difficulty to subdue a rebel, who has found means to fortify himself, and has made himself strong by the numbers of his followers. But it is not so with God. There is no fortress that is any defence from the power of God. Though hand join in hand, and vast multitudes of God&#39;s enemies combine and associate themselves, they are easily broken in pieces. They are as great heaps of light chaff before the whirlwind; or large quantities of dry stubble before devouring flames. We find it easy to tread on and crush a worm that we see crawling on the earth; so it is easy for us to cut or singe a slender thread that anything hangs by: thus easy is it for God, when he pleases, to cast his enemies down to hell. What are we, that we should think to stand before him, at whose rebuke the earth trembles, and before whom the rocks are thrown down?</span></li></ol>

Yea, God is a great deal more angry with great numbers that are now on earth: yea, doubtless, with many that are now in this congregation, who it may be are at ease, than he is with many of those who are now in the flames of hell. So that it is not because God is unmindful of their wickedness, and does not resent it, that he does not let loose his hand and cut them off. God is not altogether such an one as themselves, though they may imagine him to be so.

Sin is the ruin and misery of the soul; it is destructive in its nature; and if God should leave it without restraint, there would need nothing else to make the soul perfectly miserable. The corruption of the heart of man is immoderate and boundless in its fury; and while wicked men live here, it is like fire pent up by God&#39;s restraints, whereas if it were let loose, it would set on fire the course of nature; and as the heart is now a sink of sin, so if sin was not restrained, it would immediately turn the soul into fiery oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

The manifold and continual experience of the world in all ages, shows this is no evidence, that a man is not on the very brink of eternity, and that the next step will not be into another world. The unseen, unthought-of ways and means of persons going suddenly out of the world are innumerable and inconceivable.

All the means that there are of sinners going out of the world, are so in God&#39;s hands, and so universally and absolutely subject to his power and determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than if means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Almost every natural man that hears of hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it; he depends upon himself for his own security; he flatters himself in what he has done, in what he is now doing, or what he intends to do. Every one lays out matters in his own mind how he shall avoid damnation, and flatters himself that he contrives well for himself, and that his schemes will not fail. They hear indeed that there are but few saved, and that the greater part of men that have died heretofore are gone to hell; but each one imagines that he lays out matters better for his own escape than others have done. He does not intend to come to that place of torment; he says within himself, that he intends to take effectual care, and to order matters so for himself as not to fail.</span></p><p class="csFEE8EB43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But the foolish children of men miserably delude themselves in their own schemes, and in confidence in their own strength and wisdom; they trust to nothing but a shadow.

If we could speak with them, and inquire of them, one by one, whether they expected, when alive, and when they used to hear about hell, ever to be the subjects of misery: we doubtless, should hear one and another reply, &quot;No, I never intended to come here: I had laid out matters otherwise in my mind; </span></p><p class="csBC7AAE25"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I thought I should contrive well for myself -- I thought my scheme good.

God hath had it on his heart to show to angels and men, both how excellent his love is, and also how terrible his wrath is. Sometimes earthly kings have a mind to show how terrible their wrath is, by the extreme punishments they would execute on those that would provoke them. Nebuchadnezzar, that mighty and haughty monarch of the Chaldean empire, was willing to show his wrath when enraged with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and accordingly gave orders that the burning fiery furnace should be heated seven times hotter than it was before; doubtless, it was raised to the utmost degree of fierceness that human art could raise it. But the great God is also willing to show his wrath, and magnify his awful majesty and mighty power in the extreme sufferings of his enemies. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rom.9.html#Rom.9.22"><span class="cs1305A01">Rom. 9:22</span></a></span><a name="_Rom_9_22_0_0"></a><span class="csCF6BBF71">. &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; </span></p><p class="cs40B78F2D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And seeing this is his design, and what he has determined, even to show how terrible the unrestrained wrath, the fury and fierceness of Jehovah is, he will do it to effect. </span></p><p class="cs40B78F2D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There will be something accomplished and brought to pass that will be dreadful with a witness.

When you look forward, you shall see a long for ever, a boundless duration before you, which will swallow up your thoughts, and amaze your soul; and you will absolutely despair of ever having any deliverance, any end, any mitigation, any rest at all. You will know certainly that you must wear out long ages, millions of millions of ages, in wrestling and conflicting with this almighty merciless vengeance; and then when you have so done, when so many ages have actually been spent by you in this manner, you will know that all is but a point to what remains. </span></p><p class="cs628522C2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So that your punishment will indeed be infinite. Oh, who can express what the state of a soul in such circumstances is!

Oh that you would consider it, whether you be young or old! There is reason to think, that there are many in this congregation now hearing this discourse, that will actually be the subjects of this very misery to all eternity. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We know not who they are, or in what seats they sit, or what thoughts they now have. It may be they are now at ease, and hear all these things without much disturbance, and are now flattering themselves that they are not the persons, promising themselves that they shall escape.

How might all the rest of the congregation lift up a lamentable and bitter cry over him! But, alas! instead of one, how many is it likely will remember this discourse in hell? </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And it would be a wonder, if some that are now present should not be in hell in a very short time, even before this year is out. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And it would be no wonder if some persons, that now sit here, in some seats of this meeting-house, in health, quiet and secure, should be there before tomorrow morning. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Those of you that finally continue in a natural condition, that shall keep out of hell longest will be there in a little time! your damnation does not slumber; it will come swiftly, and, in all probability, very suddenly upon many of you. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You have reason to wonder that you are not already in hell. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is doubtless the case of some whom you have seen and known, that never deserved hell more than you, and that heretofore appeared as likely to have been now alive as you. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Their case is past all hope; they are crying in extreme misery and perfect despair; but here you are in the land of the living and in the house of God, and have an opportunity to obtain salvation. What would not those poor damned hopeless souls give for one day&#39;s opportunity such as you now enjoy!</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">a day wherein many are flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many are daily coming from the east, west, north and south; many that were very lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How awful is it to be left behind at such a day! </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To see so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see so many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit! How can you rest one moment in such a condition? Are not your souls as precious as the souls of the people at Suffield, where they are flocking from day to day to Christ?</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Are there not many here who have lived long in the world, and are not to this day born again? and so are aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and have done nothing ever since they have lived, but treasure up wrath against the day of wrath? </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Oh, sirs, your case, in an especial manner, is extremely dangerous. Your guilt and hardness of heart is extremely great. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Do you not see how generality persons of your years are passed over and left, in the present remarkable and wonderful dispensation of God&#39;s mercy? You had need to consider yourselves, and awake thoroughly out of sleep. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You cannot bear the fierceness and wrath of the infinite God. -- And you, young men, and young women, will you neglect this precious season which you now enjoy, when so many others of your age are renouncing all youthful vanities, and flocking to Christ? </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You especially have now an extraordinary opportunity; but if you neglect it, it will soon be with you as with those persons who spent all the precious days of youth in sin, and are now come to such a dreadful pass in blindness and hardness. -- And you, children, who are unconverted, do not you know that you are going down to hell, to bear the dreadful wrath of that God, who is now angry with you every day and every night? </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Will you be content to be the children of the devil, when so many other children in the land are converted, and are become the holy and happy children of the King of kings? </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And let every one that is yet out of Christ, and hanging over the pit of hell, whether they be old men and women, or middle aged, or young people, or little children, now hearken to the loud calls of God&#39;s word and providence. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will doubtless be a day of as remarkable vengeance to others. Men&#39;s hearts harden, and their guilt increases apace at such a day as this, if they neglect their souls; and never was there so great danger of such persons being given up to hardness of heart and blindness of mind. God seems now to be hastily gathering in his elect in all parts of the land; and probably the greater part of adult persons that ever shall be saved, will be brought in now in a little time, and that it will be as it was on the great out-pouring of the Spirit upon the Jews in the apostles&#39; days; the election will obtain, and the rest will be blinded. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If this should be the case with you, you will eternally curse this day, and will curse the day that ever you was born, to see such a season of the pouring out of God&#39;s Spirit, and will wish that you had died and gone to hell before you had seen it. Now undoubtedly it is, as it was in the days of John the Baptist, the axe is in an extraordinary manner laid at the root of the trees, that every tree which brings not forth good fruit, may be hewn down and cast into the fire. Therefore, let everyone that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from the wrath to come. The wrath of Almighty God is now undoubtedly hanging over a great part of this congregation. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Let everyone fly out of Sodom: &quot;Haste and escape for your lives, look not behind you, escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csB43E0A4E">We appreciate your interest</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csB43E0A4E">&nbsp;in the Word of God.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csB43E0A4E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csB43E0A4E">More publications are available upon request.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs53F207AF">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csF13FD03A">CONTACT US</span><span class="cs78AB3212">:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">Deliverance Center</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">1008 Congress St.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">Portland, Maine 04102</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csF13FD03A">Visit us on the Web at</span><span class="cs78AB3212">:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="http://www.thedleiverancecenter.com"><span class="csF13FD03A">www.thedleiverancecenter.com</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs78AB3212">Email:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212"><a class="cs52854C63" href="mailto:info@thedeliverancecenter.com"><span class="csF13FD03A">info@thedeliverancecenter.com</span></a></span><div style="margin:0pt 9pt 0pt 9pt;width:153pt;height:236.45pt;">
