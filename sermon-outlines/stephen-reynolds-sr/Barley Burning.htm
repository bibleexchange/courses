would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not
come.</span></p>

Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he
hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field
on fire. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> 31
Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> 32
And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that
I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had
been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's
face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Absalom had
fled from Jerusalem under fear of David's anger; he was after a time permitted
to return, but he was not admitted into the presence of the king. Earnestly
desiring to be restored to his former posts of honour and favour, he besought
Joab to come to him, intending to request him to act as mediator. Joab, having
lost his liking for the young prince, refused to come; and, though he was sent
for repeatedly, he declined to attend at his desire. Absalom therefore thought
of a most wicked, but most effective plan of bringing Joab into his company. He
bade his servants set Joab's field of barley on fire. This brought Joab down in
high wrath to ask the question, &quot;Wherefore have thy servants set my field
on fire?&quot; This was all that, </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Absalom
wanted; he wished a hearing,</span></p>

of the barley-field brought Joab into his presence, and Absalom's ends were
accomplished. </span></p>

our gracious God with the wisest and best design. Often he sendeth for us, not
for his profit, but for ours; he would have us come near to him and receive a
blessing at his hands, but we are foolish, and cold-hearted and wicked, and we
will not come. He, knowing that we will not come by any other means, sendeth a
serious trial—he sets our barley-field on fire, which he has a right to do,
seeing our barley-fields are far more his than they are ours. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>in God's case

choice delight, upon which we have set out heart, and then we enquire at, his

mother's prayers sought to woo you to a Saviour's love, and your godly father's
first instructions were as so many meshes of the net in which it was desired
that you should be taken; but you have broken through all these and lived to
sin away early impressions and youthful promises.</span></p>

<h4><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Burning the barley field</span></h4>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Now, just as
Absolem dealt with Joab in order to bring him unto him, so God uses discipline
very often in order to bring wayward hearts to Himself. Many a reader may have
had his barley-field set on fire; there are some even now whose fields are
wrapped in flames or are covered with the ashes of extinguished hopes. With
backsliders this method is often God's last resorts. He sees that the wayward
wanderers care more for their earthly possessions than they do for His honour
or His service. So He touches them in the tenderest spot, and sweeps away the
objects they love so well. They have become idolaters, and He sternly dashes
their idols to atoms.</span></p>

<h4><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Compulsory measures</span></h4>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>For two whole
years Joab paid no attention to the returned son of David, but the moment his
barley-field was set on fire he paid Absalom a visit of inquiry. It was crafty
on the part of Absalom. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Perhaps he
looked upon it as a last resort </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>But there is a
spiritual use of this incident which is well worth considering. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Is it not so
that when we will not go to God lovingly, voluntarily, He sets our barley-fields
on fire, saying, Now they will pray? We desert His Church, we abandon His book,
we release ourselves from all religious responsibilities; God calls, and we
will not hear; then He sets all the harvest in a blaze, and we become religious
instantaneously. We are richer if we have lost a barley-field, and found the
God of the harvest. He will make up the barley-field to us, if so be we accept
the providence aright, and say, &quot;This is God's thought concerning
us.&quot; </span></p>
