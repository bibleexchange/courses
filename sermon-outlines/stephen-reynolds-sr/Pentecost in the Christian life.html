Israel&#39;s sins had cut the nation off from God (Isaiah 59:2). No Savior had yet come to cleanse the people of sin. Neither had the Spirit of God been given to enlighten and empower human minds.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Isa 59:2 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 2:21 &para; And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">De 29:4 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ps 126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The clear meaning of Pentecost. God gave His Son and He offered Himself as a sacrifice for sin, Pentecost shows us that we can serve God and keep His law through the power of the Holy Ghost.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Pentecost in the Christian life</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Before the day of Pentecost, it was not possible to understand that character grows out of the spiritual war taking place in the converted mind. People simply did what came &quot;naturally.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Since Pentecost described in Acts 2, those called by God have come to see that a fierce struggle does indeed rage in the converted mind. The good news, however, is that we win. Through the Spirit of God, humans can master and defeat sin.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Before Pentecost, men and women simply did not have the desire or power to mount an effective campaign against sin. Not even God&#39;s law given on tablets of stone during that ancient Pentecost at Mount Sinai could help in the struggle. But all that changed when the Holy Ghost came on Pentecost </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Ro 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: &nbsp;4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Sin should not have dominion or control over the converted Christian. By the power of God&#39;s Spirit we can put to death the sinful deeds of the natural mind (verse 13). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Ro 8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Php 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The message of Pentecost is that we are the firstfruits of God&#39;s creation and that we &quot;may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust&quot; (II Peter 1:4).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Eph 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Our eyes are on Christ, &quot;who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us&quot; (Ephesians 3:20) - the power of God&#39;s Holy Spirit!</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csA521DC07">Moved by God&rsquo;s Spirit to Travail for Souls</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Isa 66:8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The secret of success is an all-consuming zeal and an all subduing travail for souls. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">As soon as the voice of the gospel put the church of the Jews into her travail, in Christ&#39;s and the Apostles time, it brought forth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
