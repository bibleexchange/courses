The Apostle Paul says, &ldquo;</span><span class="cs3103DFCD">For we wrestle</span><span class="cs4EEB067A">&hellip; against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">&rdquo; Every time that the Lord does something for us, or reveals truth to us, the devil will contend for it. He will attack from every angle and cause you to doubt (if possible) that which God is doing. This is especially so in this end-time. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Rev. 12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Many are giving up truth in this day because of the battle, the struggle, the conflict, to take the way of least resistance; supposedly the easy way is the right way. However, I want you to know there is </span><span class="csDC0FC69">an awful awakening </span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">coming to the Church in the Tribulation Hour. </span></p><p class="csC50EB3C9"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">The Church comes to this awakening after the Bride (the Man-Child; the Overcomer) has been caught up to God and to His throne, and they have been left behind to go into the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">There have been many battles, but </span><span class="csDC0FC69">this is war</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">, the last great conflict, when the devil is cast out of heaven. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Rev. 12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. </span></p><p class="csA5DE72D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2"> There was a battle in Eden when the devil deceived Eve and man lost his position with God. </span></p><p class="csA5DE72D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2"> There was a battle in hell when Christ fought and overcame the hosts of hell.

They are astonished that reasonable men could believe in such an event and pass it off as mere fiction. I am personally astonished that reasonable, thinking men cannot believe the truth as it is recorded in God&rsquo;s holy, infallible, immutable and eternal Word. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Others believe that this is a mere poetical and exaggerated account of certain moral conflicts in the history of the Church on earth. Again, we must believe the Bible to be the Word of God that is free from error and exaggeration. Otherwise, if it has even the slightest hint of exaggeration or error, it is not worth the paper upon which it is written. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">II Tim. 3: 16 </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">&ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">The meaning of the word &ldquo;</span><span class="cs4EEB067A">inspiration&rdquo; </span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">means &ldquo;God breathed.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">II Pet. 1: 21 </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">&ldquo;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Rev. 12: 9 </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">&ldquo;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world:&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">There are some that teach we are not to believe this was an actual event, but a sort of a summary of the prolonged battle between good and evil. There are several things that we need to remember in understanding this great event. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">First, this is not a record of history. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">This is a book of prophecy with events that will take place after the recording of the Revelation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">It is a divinely inspired record that John received while he was in the Spirit on the Lord‟s Day. &ldquo;</span><span class="cs4EEB067A">The Lord&rsquo;s Day</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">&rdquo; has to do with end-time events and the judgment of God. This is not a prolonged battle between good and evil. All these events take place in a relatively short period of time, approximately seven years. </span></p><p class="csC50EB3C9"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Rev. 22: 18, 19 </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">&ldquo;For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">It is best to take heed to this warning. Remember, this is a divinely inspired revelation that states very clearly, &ldquo;</span><span class="cs4EEB067A">And there was war in heaven.</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">&rdquo; If the Bible states infallibly, &ldquo;</span><span class="cs4EEB067A">And there was war in heaven,</span><span class="csF8E5A0D2">&rdquo; then we have no choice but to believe it as stated. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">This is a literal war fought in the heavenly realm between the dragon (satan; the devil) and the &ldquo;Man-Child&rdquo; who is supported by Michael and his angels. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Heb. 1: 14 </span><span class="cs4EEB067A">&ldquo;Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB0E2188C">I.

The Dragon. Satan can&nbsp;manifest himself in many different forms. In the garden with Adam and Eve he manifested himself through a subtle and charming&nbsp;serpent. God allowed him to speak in the garden of Eden and tempt Adam and Eve. Up till now God has allowed the devil to manifest as a serpent but in these last days he is going to manifest himself in all his power against God&#39;s own people. He stands before, not against the Church. His&nbsp;focus is on what the Church (Sun Clothed Woman) is producing. The man-child is the Dragons greatest prize since the man-child is God&#39;s greatest work. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs9653D193">The War In Heaven</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csFCF3C564">The Dragon&#39;s anger is not against the Church, at this time. His anger is against those in the Church, that are the greatest threat to him and his kingdom. The Dragon and his angels will try to stop the man-child from gaining access to the Throne of God to take their lawful positions. Their will be all out war in the Heavenlies against the Man-child. Michael and his angels will assist the&nbsp;overcomer, man-child company&nbsp;in accessing the Throne.&nbsp;Once the man-child is caught up to God and to His throne, the Church which is the Woman that produced&nbsp;and gave birth to the man-child, will flee into the wilderness where she has a place prepared of God and be&nbsp;protected from the face of the serpent. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs9653D193">Satan The Dragon&nbsp;Is Defeated and&nbsp;Cast Down</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csFCF3C564">Satan is going to manifest himself in all his deception and wrath once the man-child has overcome him! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csFCF3C564">Satan has only used deception however once he is cast down he will not only be manifesting as the subtle serpent through charm and&nbsp;flattery, he will also be manifesting as the&nbsp;Great&nbsp;Dragon with great wrath against those that are of the seed of Christ. Satan is not human. He is a spirit. He is diabolical in nature. He does not show any mercy. He is just the opposite of God. God manifests His Love and Anger whereas Satan only is evil and hateful. We see a foretaste of Satan manifesting himself as the Dragon during the holocaust when millions of Jews were savagely and brutally murdered under the influence and direction&nbsp;of the Dragon. This was just a foretaste of what would come in these last days! We are living in the last days? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csFCF3C564">Conclusion:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csFCF3C564">This is War! This is not a game. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csFCF3C564">This is a War between two Seeds. Christ&#39;s Seed and the Serpent&#39;s Seed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csFCF3C564">ALL those that are not born again of the incorruptible Seed of Christ who is the Word are the seed of Satan which is the Serpent and the Dragon. Jesus called them children of the Devil. This is war, Light against Darkness! Good against Evil! Love against Hate! Holy against Unclean, filthy and detestable. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCBA1F57C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Re 19:11 &para; And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
