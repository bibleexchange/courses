		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Apostle Paul left Corinth, Ephesus, then Jerusalem to attend an approaching feast, his stay at Ephesus was necessarily brief. He reasoned with the Jews in the synagogue, and so favorable was the impression made upon them that they entreated him to continue his labors among them. His plan to visit Jerusalem prevented him from tarrying then, but he promised to return to them, &quot;if God will.&quot; Aquila and Priscilla had accompanied him to Ephesus, and he left them there to carry on the work that he had begun. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">It was at this time that &quot;a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.&quot; He had heard the preaching of John the Baptist, had received the baptism of repentance, and was a living witness that the work of the prophet had not been in vain. The Scripture record of Apollos is that he &quot;was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">While in Ephesus, Apollos &quot;began to speak boldly in the synagogue.&quot; Among his hearers were Aquila and Priscilla, who, perceiving that he had not yet received the full light of the gospel, &quot;took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.&quot; Through their teaching he obtained a clearer understanding of the Scriptures and became one of the ablest advocates of the Christian faith. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Apollos was desirous of going on into Achaia, and the brethren at Ephesus &quot;wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him&quot; as a teacher in full harmony with the church of Christ. He went to Corinth, where, in public labor and from house to house, &quot;he mightily convinced the Jews . . . showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.&quot; Paul had planted the seed of truth; Apollos now watered it. The success that attended Apollos in preaching the gospel led some of the believers to exalt his labors above those of Paul. This comparison of man with man brought into the church a party spirit that threatened to hinder greatly the progress of the gospel. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">During the year and a half that Paul had spent in Corinth, he had purposely presented the gospel in its simplicity. 1Cor. 2:1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> </span><span class="csC05134DD">4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man&#39;s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. </span></p><h5 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="csC05134DD">Paul had necessarily adapted his manner to teaching to the condition of the church. 1Co 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</span></h5>
		<h5 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="csC05134DD">Many of the Corinthian believers had been slow to learn the lessons that he was endeavoring to teach them. Their advancement in spiritual knowledge had not been proportionate to their privileges and opportunities. When they should have been far advanced in Christian experience, and able to comprehend and to practice the deeper truths of the word, they were standing where the disciples stood when Christ said to them, &quot;I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.&quot; John 16:12. Jealousy, evil surmising, and accusation had closed the hearts of many of the Corinthian believers against the full working of the Holy Spirit, which &quot;searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.&quot; 1 Corinthians 2:10. However wise they might be in worldly knowledge, they were but babes in the knowledge of Christ. &nbsp;The same condition was found in Mat.13:15; Eph. 4:14; Heb.5:11; 2Pe 3:16</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">It had been Paul&#39;s work to instruct the Corinthian converts in the principles, the very beginning, of the Christian faith. He had been obliged to instruct them as those who were ignorant of the operations of divine power upon the heart. At that time they were unable to comprehend the mysteries of salvation; 1Co 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul endeavored to sow the seed, which others must water. Those who followed him must carry forward the work from the point where he had left it, giving spiritual light and knowledge in due season, as the church was able to bear it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">When the apostle took up his work in Corinth, he realized that he must introduce most carefully the great truths he wished to teach. He knew that among his hearers would be proud believers in human principles, and advocates of false systems of worship, who were groping with blinds eyes, hoping to find in the books of natural theories that would contradict the reality of the spiritual and immortal life as revealed in the Scriptures. He also knew that critics would endeavor to contradict the Christian interpretation of the revealed word, and that skeptics would treat the gospel of Christ with scoffing and disrespect. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">As he endeavored to lead souls to the foot of the cross, Paul did not venture to rebuke, directly, those who were licentious, or to show how heinous was their sin in the sight of a holy God. Rather he set before them the true object of life and tried to impress upon their minds the lessons of the divine Teacher, which, if received, would lift them from worldliness and sin to purity and righteousness. He dwelt especially upon practical godliness and the holiness to which those must attain who shall be accounted worthy of a place in God&#39;s kingdom. </span><span class="csD04A7434">He longed to see the light of the gospel of Christ piercing the darkness of their minds</span><span class="csC05134DD">, that they might see how offensive in the sight of God were their immoral practices. Therefore the burden of his teaching among them was Christ and Him crucified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul sought to show them that their most earnest study and their greatest joy must be the wonderful truth of salvation through repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7412659"><span class="csC05134DD">The philosopher turns aside from the light of salvation, because it puts his proud theories to shame; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jn.3:19,20; Eph.5:13</span></li><li class="cs7412659"><span class="csC05134DD">The worldling refuses to receive it, because it would separate him from his earthly idols. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		2Co 6:17; Col 2:21; 1Th 1:9; I Jn.5:21</span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul saw that the character of Christ must be understood before men could love Him or view the cross with the eye of faith. Here must begin that study which shall be the science and the song of the redeemed through all eternity. In the light of the cross alone can the true value of the human soul be estimated. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The refining influence of the grace of God changes the natural disposition of man. Heaven would not be desirable to the carnal-minded; their natural, unsanctified hearts would feel no attraction toward that pure and holy place.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The predispositions that control the natural heart must be subdued by the grace of Christ before fallen man is fitted to enter heaven and enjoy the pure, holy angels. When man dies to sin and is quickened to new life in Christ, divine love fills his heart; his understanding is sanctified; he drinks from an inexhaustible fountain of joy and knowledge, and the light of an eternal day shines upon his path, for with him continually is the Light of life. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul sought to impress upon the minds of brethren the fact that he and the ministers associated with him were but men commissioned by God to teach the truth and that they were all engaged in the same work, and that they were dependent upon God for success in their labors. The discussion that had arisen in the church regarding the relative merits of different ministers was not in the order of God, but was the result of cherishing the attributes of the natural heart instead of crucify the flesh.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">1Cor. 3:4 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">It was Paul who had first preached the gospel in Corinth, and who had organized the church there. This was the work that the Lord had assigned him. Later, by God&#39;s direction, other workers were brought in, to stand in their lot and place. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The seed sown must be watered, and this Apollos was to do. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">He followed Paul in his work, to give further instruction, and to help the seed sown to develop. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">He won his way to the hearts of the people, but it was God who gave the increase. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">It is not human, but divine power that works transformation of character. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Those who plant and those who water do not cause the growth of the seed; they work under God, as His appointed workers, workers together with God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">To God be the Glory, to the Master Worker belongs honor and glory that comes with success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&#39;s servants do not all possess the same gifts, but they are all His workmen.

There is a diversity of gifts, but all the workers are to blend in harmony, controlled by the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit. As they make known the gospel of salvation, many will be convicted and converted by the power of God. The human instrumentality is hid with Christ in God, and Christ appears as the chiefest among ten thousand, the One altogether lovely. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">1Cor. 3:8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God&#39;s husbandry, ye are God&#39;s building. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The apostle compares the church to a cultivated field, in which the husbandmen labor, caring for the vines of the Lord&#39;s planting; and also to a building, which is to grow into a holy temple for the Lord. God is the Master Worker, and He has appointed to each man his work. All are to labor under His supervision, letting Him work for and through His workmen. He gives them tact and skill, and if they heed His instruction, crowns their efforts with success. God&#39;s servants are to work together, blending in kindly, courteous order, &quot;in honor preferring one another.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Ro 12:10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">There is to be no unkind criticism, no pulling to pieces of another&#39;s work; and there are to be no separate parties. Every man to whom the Lord has entrusted a message has his specific work. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Each one has an individuality of his own, which he is not to sink in any other man. Yet each is to work in harmony with his brethren. In their service God&#39;s workers are to be essentially one. No one is to set himself up as a standard, speaking disrespectfully of his fellow workers or treating them as inferior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under God each is to do his appointed work, respected, loved, and encouraged by the other laborers. Together they are to carry the work forward to completion. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The apostle refers to &quot;the ministers of Christ&quot; as &quot;stewards of the mysteries of God,&quot; and of their work he declares: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">1Co 4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;2 &nbsp;Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man&#39;s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. {know: or, I am not conscious of any fault}</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">It is not given to any human being to judge between the different servants of God. The Lord alone is the judge of man&#39;s work, and He will give to each his just reward. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The Apostle Paul referred directly to the comparisons that had been made.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">1Cor. 4:6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul plainly set before the church the perils and the hardships that he and his associates had patiently endured in their service for Christ. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">1Cor. 4:11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">God is dishonored when there is a strong attachment to a favorite minister and an unwillingness to accept the labors of some other teacher. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The Lord sends help to His people, not always as they may choose, but as they need; for men are shortsighted and cannot discern what is for their highest good.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;Seldom one minister has all the qualifications necessary to perfect a church in all the requirements of Christianity; therefore God often sends to them other ministers, each possessing some qualifications in which the others were deficient. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">The church should gratefully accept these servants of Christ, even as they would accept the Master Himself. They should seek to derive all the benefit possible from the instruction which each minister may give them from the word of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Truths servants of God bring are to be accepted and appreciated in the meekness of humility, but no minister is to be idolized. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Through the grace of Christ, God&#39;s ministers are made messengers of light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By earnest, persevering prayer obtain the power of the Holy Spirit and go forth with wisdom and burden of a soul, heart filled zeal to extend the triumphs of the cross, they will see fruit of their labors. Purposefully refusing to display human wisdom or to exalt self, they accomplish a work that will withstand the assaults of Satan. Many souls will be turned from darkness to light, and many churches will be established. Men will be converted, not to the human instrumentality, but to Christ. Self will be crucified; Christ will be preached, Jesus, the Son of the living God,exalted. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Those who are working for Christ today may reveal the same distinguishing excellencies revealed by those who in the apostolic age that proclaimed the gospel. God is just as ready to give power to His servants today as He was to give power to Paul and Apollos, to Silas and Timothy, to Peter, James, and John. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">In the apostles&#39; day there were some misguided souls who claimed to believe in Christ, yet refused to show respect to His ambassadors. They declared that they followed no human teacher, but were taught directly by Christ without the aid of the ministers of the gospel. They were independent in spirit and unwilling to submit to the voice of the church. Such men were in grave danger of being deceived. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">God has placed in the church, as His appointed helpers, men of varied talents, that through the combined wisdom of many the mind of the Spirit may be met. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Men who move in accordance with their own strong traits of character, refusing to yoke up with others who have had a long experience in the work of God, will become blinded by self-confidence, unable to discern between the false and the true. It is not safe for such ones to be chosen as leaders in the church; for they would follow their own judgment and plans, regardless of the judgment of their brethren. It is easy for the enemy to work through those who, themselves needing counsel at every step, undertake the guardianship of souls in their own strength, without having learned the lowliness of Christ. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Impressions alone are not a safe guide to duty. The enemy often persuades men to believe that it is God who is guiding them, when in reality they are following only human impulse. But if we watch carefully, and take counsel we shall be given an understanding of the Lord&#39;s will; for the promise is, &quot;The meek will He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach His way.&quot; Psalm 25:9. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">In the early Christian church there were some who refused to recognize either Paul or Apollos, but held that Peter was their leader. They affirmed that Peter had been most intimate with Christ when the Master was upon the earth, while Paul had been a persecutor of the believers. Their views and feelings were bound about by prejudice. They did not show the liberality, the generosity, the tenderness, which reveals that Christ is abiding in the heart. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">There was danger that this party spirit would result in great evil to the church, and Paul instructed by the Lord uttered words of earnest admonition and solemn protest. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">1Co 1:12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? 1Co 3:21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;23 And ye are Christ&#39;s; and Christ is God&#39;s.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul and Apollos were in perfect harmony. Apollos was disappointed and grieved because of the dissension in the church at Corinth; he took no advantage of the preference shown to himself, nor did he encourage it, but hastily left the field of strife. When Paul afterward urged him to revisit Corinth, he declined and did not again labor there until long after the church reached a better spiritual state. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs14A0D1DD">The decision to appropriate the blessing of Jesus as your Lord and Saviour comes with the responsibility to grow in the knowledge of God. You already have the seed of salvation planted in your heart, just the same way the natural seed need the soil, water and sunlight to grow everyone in the family of God are required to grow into the image of God. <br/><br/></span><span class="cs2260E59E">The Soil:</span><span class="cs14A0D1DD"> The &#39;incorruptible seed&#39; of the Word of God received must be nurtured the same way the natural seed receive nutrients to ensure maximum yield. You must nurture your spiritual seed by reading the Bible, communing with God daily by praying, attending a Bible believing church where the Word of God is preached so you can draw strength from God and the strength of fellowship with other Christians.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs2260E59E">The Water:</span><span class="cs14A0D1DD"> The natural seeds will need water to grow. The believer gets the supply of water by taking two steps: one by been fully immersed in water which is called water baptism signifying identification with the sacrifice of Jesus in His death, burial, resurrection and ascension into heaven. The second being the baptism of the Holy Spirit so you can be empowered to live a victorious life. This can happen by praying alone in faith or with a fellow believer (Romans 6:3-14. John 14:16-18)<br/><br/></span><span class="cs2260E59E">The Sunlight</span><span class="cs14A0D1DD">: This depicts two aspects of growth in the life of the believer. One, it illustrates God as the source of strength, wisdom and hope for the everyday life and the believer will grow constantly as long as focus is kept on Jesus (Malachi 4:2). Secondly the believer just like the natural plants creates their food through the sun&#39;s energy to live a fruitful life, so the power for fruitfulness rest on them and cause the believer to share their firsthand experience of Jesus with others (Matthew 28:18-20)</span></p></body>
