Emphasize the Bible Truth of the doctrine.....to build faith.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">Joel 2:28-29; Acts 2:16-18; Mark 16:17; John 7:38-39</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">2. Show from the Bible the five instances in the Acts and explain. </span><span class="csD86CCB16">The Experience</span><span class="csAA420484">, Acts 2:4; 8:14-119; 9:17; 10:44-47: 19:1-7</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">3.

Explain the </span><span class="csD86CCB16">Biblical Truth </span><span class="csAA420484">of speaking with other tongues.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">1 Cor. 14:2, 22, 24</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">Mark 16:17</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">Acts 2:4</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">5. Explain the necessity of faith in receiving.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">Eg. Saved by faith, healed by faith, filled by faith Heb.11:6, 2Cor.5:7, Galatians. 3:2</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">6. Emphasize the seeking for the person of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not an it. He is a person, the third person of the God-Head. (John 14:26)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">7. The purpose of the infilling of the Holy Spirit is to receive power. (Acts 1:8; 1 Thess.1:5)</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD86CCB16">Some helpful thoughts</span><span class="csAA420484">:</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csAA420484">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">We must be as specific and definite about this as about salvation. If a man is willing to meet God&rsquo;s conditions, God will fill him now.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">1. Does the seeker realize that the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is for all believers? (Acts 1:4,38-39) It is not the same as salvation but subsequent to it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">2. Is he willing to receive the gift on God&rsquo;s terms of cleansing, surrender and faith?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">3. After prayer for the Baptism in the Holy Spirit talk to the seeker again......Does he believe that God has heard him and answered that prayer now?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">If in doubt, use Luke 11:13. Point out that God gives to them that ask....the seeker has already asked.....could God fail to give?.....If the seeker</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">believes this verse, then, as a proof of this faith, let him thank God heartily that according to His Word he has answered his prayer......remember that</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD86CCB16">feeling is not important at this point.....faith is not feeling</span><span class="csAA420484">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">4. Before further prayer, instruct the seeker:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">To quit asking God for the Baptism at this point.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">To keep praising God as joyfully as he wants for filling him and for Jesus Christ Himself.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">To be ready to speak the word or syllable that will come to his mind in an unknown language (unknown tongue). Speaking in tongues is therefore</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">a humbling of self which is rejected by so many.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs82CF7A24">X Refilling with the Holy Spirit</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">Every Holy Spirit filled believer should use the gift that is within him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">Some respond to an altar call because they want to be refilled with the Holy Spirit. This is good......often the problem is devotional and you can use</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">the scriptures.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">However the need for refilling is legitimate......the person may no longer speak with tongues.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">He needs to be shown:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">1. The necessity of speaking in tongues often.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">2.

Establish the need - then proceed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">2. Know your Bible and use it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAA420484">3.
