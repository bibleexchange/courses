<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Help each vessel to search their heart for persecution is
just around the corner for this church the deliverance Center. And not only
this church but every church of God. It has been prophesied over and over
again. Help us to hear and help us to respond properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tonight we are dealing with persecution. Great persecution
against the church. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have some phone calls. One by one they are leaving us. At
this time Stephen’s life was taken from him by stoning. What an awful death to
die. Just one stone would be quite painful. This stoning brought extreme pain.
Just because he preached Jesus does not mean that God would just take away the
pain. I don’t know what will be the end for me. Only God knows. But He has
given us some promises to lay hold off that even in death we can rise again and
not become a martyr. We don’t have to be defeated by death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many that didn’t get relief from the pain and
Christ was one like Stephen that was not released from the pain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                                                              </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have one last final chance for the Jews to receive
the Gospel but they chose to destroy the messenger. They stood against Stephen
and stoned him, Hitting him in his head, mouth, nose, back, arms, all over his
body. Christ felt EVERY stripe of the 39 he received before climbing Golgotha.
The soldiers were taught to bring a man within an inch of his life. Isaiah 53
–a man of sorrows bearing OUR stripes which meant our HEALING.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need to know the written word. I need to study. I need to
have the Word in my heart. 2 Timothy 2:15. We need to STUDY &amp; Labor in the
Word of God. Hebrews 4:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have seen many men stand up against dad in this city and
raise up their voice against him and against what he is sharing that he
received from God in a closet. And they stand for the traditions of men
ainstead listenging to the Holy Ghost. Find out what is said under the uncitno
fo the Holy Ghost in the Word of God. People in this generation do not even
care what the Spirit is saying. They are looking fo the way of least
resistance. We need to listen to what the Word of God is saying and we need to
go deeper applying it to our life. Over and over again the Revelations says
HEAR what the spirit is sayhing to the churches. God’s spirit will lead us and
guide us in the way that we should go. We have three things we have the written
Word to search out and study. Not only do we study the written word but we need
to have an ear to hear the Spirit of God. Hearing His voice. Above studying the
written Word we need to hear the voice of God. We need to have a heart to study
the Word of God, but hard study and laborious intellectual search is cold and
vain uniless God speaks to us and the Holy Ghost inspires us. We NEED God to
speak to us. If we rely on the pastor as our sole to return and give to us the
Word of God we are no better off than a wandering Israel in the wilderness who
never developed an ear to hear what the spirit was saying. Your flesh wil doubt
just as much as the next guy but that is no excuse to sin that is no excuse to
give in. Over and Over again God has raised us up and made us strong, but if I
should go down tomorrow and lke a Stephen stoned to death the Gospel is till
real. The Gospel is still powerful. Stephen was full of faith and wisdom and
full of the Holy Ghost. Miracles were taking place. We need that kind of men
and with that kind of ministry but let that voice be silenced and that voice be
stopped but that does not change the Gospel any. Soomme people pull and push
the vehicle up the top of the hill and the other man was just walking beside
him pulling out his hankercheif occasionally as if he had been doing and when
they got to the top and he said at the top SOMOE push and the mann that did all
the work responded yeah, and some DON”T. They know they are not doing anything
and ye thtey pretend and act like they are doing just as much. His words is a
sharp twoedged sword that pierces your heart. The spoken Word of God bring life
and victory. The word of God always prevails. The men heard the prophets speak.
We are talkinb about dead dry bones in the valley with not possible for them to
ever live again. But God spoke saying PROPHESY to the winds. And as the bones
and wind they came to life. They stood upon their feet and exceeding great
army! Lord, give us that again. You are not even dead! You are not dead you are
alive!!! They were beyond and unable to read a Bible bones dry and bleached by
the sun but God brough it together. And it was the SPOKEN Word of God that the
bones Came together. As important as reading your Bible and studying it it is
your responsibility not to talk it lightyly it is so important but it is more
important that we hear the voice of God. Thirdly we need to understand His way.
It is another thing to understand His way. Moses was a man that knew the voice
of God. God told himm to put his rod over the water and it turned dto Blood.
Ten plagues took place as Moses held the rod. As Moses smote the rock water
came out of the rock. Another time Isreal complained and complained about a
problem God had just worked a miracle over. As the prophet smote the rock the
rock gave forth water and all were satisfied. God does thigns a certain way.
The way he did it last time was to listen to his voice and they way he said it
do it that way. HOW He is going to do it we have read how that he is going to
bring water out of the rock and he is going to be there for him instead of
listening to His voice as to the HOW they began to cmplain again. I am asking
you tongith and you may not be used to hearing the voice of God but you need to
be detgermined as God is dealing with you right now. They stoned Stephen, hear
the message. Read yuour Bible. Listen for the voice of God and as you hear the
voice of God listen and understand His way. “I know what God wants to do
because he used me LAST TIME” Remember we must do God’s will God’s will and it
is those that know God’s way and listens to Him every time that will be used by
God more and more and Moses smote the rock twice and God said to SPEAk to it
out of his anger. Th Lore had a plan and purpose for His Son to Come. Jesus is
that rock and he is to come and take the beating and meet the proviciosn but
once and not twice. In this lastday men are goin gto rise up with evil minds.
You are going to have to do it each time because of the mocking and great
persecuation before th etribulation hour is going to be a beginning of sorrows.
You can be an overcomer. You can be filled with the Holy Ghost and you don’t
have to go through the tribulation hour. Half way there is not enough. Many
have testified how that they aere saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
and ready for rapture. Saul of Tarsus was a man that with every breath I Hate
Christians. I got a phone call today they were talking about a precious lady in
our church like she was an animal. Theya re just looking for a chance and an
opportunity to get something on you and get something about it you and it is
not just people but it is a devil that hates this Gospel and we have a
responsibility to stay sensitve to the voice of God and as we hear his voice we
must learn his ways. Lord pull my arm and pull my foot this way God does not
want us to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a need for smiting there is a need for stripes to
be born. Smite me Lord. We learn from that that Moses was literally smiting the
rock. The Lord said they he was going to be on the rock but we know that he had
to be smitten to provide healing for us and some many people are angery and
don’t understand what we are doing it is in obedience that the Lord bring the
healing and if ewe water it down then it won’t work. Moses they are complaining
again you are going to have to speak to the rock. It is almost like I did
something there is the water no he was bearing stripes on the back of his own
he bore our stripes for our healing. I want to pray four hours I want to fast
sixty days. If I want to exercise my faith do it when he says it. Wait on God
and get into a place to hear his voice you are listening to the wrong voices
when bad words come out of your mouth you are reading the wrong bible and
listening to wrong voice. Let his ways change you</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When was the last time did you set aside from scheduled to
read your Bible through in a year or six months to read it through?  Understand
the principles how God works. His word is His will. His will reveals His way.
But he must reveal it. I have watched God heal many people and others expect
God to heal them the SAME way. A lot of people die early deaths because they do
not study the Bible. How much persecution do we have to suffer? That is up to
God, but I Corinthians 13:10 says that he will not allow us to suffer that
which we can bear it and will with the temptation provide a way of escape.
God’s word is best. God always does what is right. God makes those not feel so
good things work together for good in our lives. Men become scattered abroad
under great persecution. Acts 8:1 except the apostles who were rooted and grounded
in the word. It pays to read your Bible and to develop an ear to hear what He
is saying for in great persecution while others are dragged away and harassed,
hailed, dragged off, to prison. Are you ready for prison? I visited a prison
just a couple of weeks ago and thinking how I could be on the other side of the
window so easy in this generation. I had the hopes to get out of there, but he
did not at least not right then. It is just a matter of time and how much will
God allow and how much will God use? It is going to strong take strong
persecution to learn his ways, if I don’t listen to his voice. Don’t go the way
of the school of hard knocks find out tonight. I am going to set a course. I am
going to read my Bible. At a time set to listen to the voice of God and find
out His ways. If you don’t mark it out and do it you won’t be disciplined. You
might hear his voice but not understand what he is saying. </p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Read your Bible. (Set a plan and schedule to read it
     through.)</li>

 <li class=MsoNormal>Understand God’s Ways. (His judgments and chastening that
