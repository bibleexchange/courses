Too often the daily activities and duties of the ministry are allowed to become routine and mundane. Purpose and zeal&mdash;the very reason for which God called the minister&mdash;are allowed to fade from memory. Lethargy, complacency, routineness, and professionalism are allowed to slip into the life of the minister and the spirit of fervency is dimmed. There is little zeal to help and reach people for Christ. The present passage speaks strongly to this problem: the call of God to the minister is to be consistent and enduring.</span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link482"><span class="cs6C232F6B">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul&#39;s great concern was consistency&mdash;to offend in nothing (v.3).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link483"><span class="cs6C232F6B">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In much endurance&mdash;the supreme quality of consistency (v.4).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link484"><span class="cs6C232F6B">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;In physical sufferings and mental stress (v.4-5).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link485"><span class="cs6C232F6B">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In moments of overwork, sleepiness, and hunger (v.5).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link486"><span class="cs6C232F6B">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;In spiritual growth and behavior (v.6-7).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link487"><span class="cs6C232F6B">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In disregarding the world&#39;s reaction (v.8).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link488"><span class="cs6C232F6B">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;In social abuse and persecution (v.9).</span></a></span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="about:blank#link489"><span class="cs6C232F6B">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;In being content&mdash;always (v.10).</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

The pressure may come from some lustful temptation or from some strong trial, but no matter, he is to stedfastly endure all pressing afflictions.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul endured &quot;necessities&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">anagkais</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=N\#2654: Necessities"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;2654</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">): inescapable hardship, difficulties, &nbsp;pain of life. A minister is called upon to face the necessities of life: he has to eat and drink, clothe and shelter himself and his family; and he has to face the sorrows and struggles and pains of life, including death itself&mdash;sometimes beyond what the average citizen has to face. Only one thing can carry the minister through the necessities and experiences of life: endurance. He must stedfastly endure for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and His ministry.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul endured &quot;distresses&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">stenochōriais</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=D\#1120: Distresses"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;1120</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">): straits, calamities, tight places, inescapable situations. It is the picture of being cornered and being unable to escape; a picture of having no room or place to turn, of being forced to confront the situation or else being utterly devastated and defeated. When the minister is cornered by temptation or trial&mdash;when there seems to be no escape&mdash;his only resource is endurance. He must stedfastly endure lest he offend the gospel and become a stumbling block to others.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul endured &quot;stripes&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">plēgais</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=S\#3811: Stripes"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;3811</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">): scourgings, beatings, lashings, whippings. This was a savage, excruciating punishment. The whip (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">phagellow</span><span class="csC05134DD">) was made of leather straps with two small balls attached to the end of each strap. The balls were made of rough lead or sharp bones or spikes, so that they would cut deeply into the flesh. Paul&#39;s hands were tied to a post above his head and he was scourged. It was the custom for the prisoner to be lashed until he was judged near death by the presiding centurion (Jewish trials allowed only forty lashes.) The criminal&#39;s back was, of course, nothing more than an unrecognizable mass of torn flesh.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Paul was scourged at least eight times&mdash;just imagine!

Tragically, believers all over the world are sometimes whipped and abused because of their testimony for the Lord Jesus.

The early church Christian, Clement of Rome (A.D. 96), says that Paul was imprisoned seven times throughout the whole span of his ministry. When the believer, minister or layman, faces imprisonment for Christ, the call of the hour is for consistency: he must endure despite the threat. He must not weaken lest he become an offense to the name of Christ and to the ministry.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul endured &quot;tumults&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">akatastasiais</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=T\#4088: Tumults"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;4088</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">): mob uprisings and attacks.

Mob uprisings present one of the most difficult and frightening situations imaginable for a believer, for a mob cannot be controlled by reason. The believer is unable to be heard, so speech is useless. Believers often face the abuse and ridicule of crowds because of the righteous lives they live and because they refuse to join in the worldly pleasures and indulgences of life. At such times the believer must be consistent in his testimony&mdash;no matter the temptation to go along with the crowd. The true believer, layman and minister alike, must stedfastly endure.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs821257DA">Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+5%3A11"><span class="csE9323467">Matthew 5:11</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs821257DA">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name&#39;s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+10%3A22"><span class="csE9323467">Matthew 10:22</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+10%3A39"><span class="csE9323467">Matthew 10:39</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names&#39; sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+19%3A29"><span class="csE9323467">Matthew 19:29</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me....for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name&#39;s sake&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ac+9%3A15-16"><span class="csE9323467">Acts 9:15-16</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Php+1%3A29"><span class="csE9323467">Phil. 1:29</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Ti+4%3A10"><span class="csE9323467">1 Tim. 4:10</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Ti+3%3A12"><span class="csE9323467">2 Tim. 3:12</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs1BDEA2E2"><span class="cs821257DA">&quot;Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience&quot; (<a class="csE14719AD" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jas+5%3A10"><span class="csE9323467">James 5:10</span></a></span><span class="cs821257DA">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><a name="link485"><span class="cs821257DA">4. </span><span class="csC05134DD">(</span></a><span class="csC05134DD"><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Co+6%3A5"><span class="cs6C232F6B">6:5</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">) </span><span class="cs87110596">Ministry&mdash; Labor&mdash; Faithfulness</span><span class="csC05134DD">: Paul was consistent and enduring in moments of </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">overwork, sleepiness, and hunger</span><span class="csC05134DD">.

As we study the life of Paul, one striking characteristic about Paul&#39;s ministry becomes clear: he never stopped preaching, teaching, or ministering until he just had to have rest. He was not lazy, lethargic, slothful, or complacent. He got up in the mornings and put his hand to the plow: praying, studying, ministering, and witnessing&mdash;just as God had called him.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul endured &quot;watchings&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">agrupniais</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=W\#4289: Watchings"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;4289</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">), that is, </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">sleepless nights</span><span class="csC05134DD">. As stated, the record of his life indicates that he arose early and rested only as he needed. He spent nights in prayer, and sometimes found the weight of the churches on his mind so much that he could sleep little if any. The point to see is Paul&#39;s great concern for people and their needs: concern so great that it would keep him awake at nights praying and figuring out how to better reach and help people for Christ. Paul was stedfast in the ministry, even enduring sleepless nights for the cause of Christ.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul endured &quot;fastings&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">nēsteiais</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=F\#1448: Fastings"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;1448</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">).
