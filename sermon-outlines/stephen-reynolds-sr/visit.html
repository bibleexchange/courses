		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">Spiritual patience is an active, fighting endurance that confronts trials and temptations and that sets out to conquer them. Gaining the victory is the very purpose for patiently confronting and standing fast against them. The believer patiently confronts them to conquer them, we cannot to be defeated by them nor divided by them.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

				<li class="csB2924952"><span class="csA521DC07">When the believer faces some trial or temptation, the Holy Spirit arouses the desire to combat the situation and to conquer it. </span></li><li class="csB2924952"><span class="csA521DC07">The inspiration is by the Spirit of God. </span><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">This kind of patience is a spiritual patience&mdash;a work of the Holy Spirit&mdash;and it can be had only by trusting the Spirit of God. Therefore, the believer must trust the Spirit of God to stir his heart to stand fast against the temptation and trial, and then he must exert his own will and energy to conquer the situation. When the Holy Spirit does His part, the believer is to do his part. The believer is to patiently combat the temptation or trial when the Spirit of God arouses his heart. The believer is to stand fast and not to give in to the sin of the temptation or to the discouragement of the trial. He is to struggle and fight, persevere and endure&mdash;patiently suffer on and on against the temptation or trial&mdash;and all the while, he is to keep his eyes fixed on the goal and the end: the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. Keeping his eyes fixed upon the return of his wonderful Lord will stir the believer to follow the leadership and power of the Holy Spirit in combating all temptations and trials.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ro 8:37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
