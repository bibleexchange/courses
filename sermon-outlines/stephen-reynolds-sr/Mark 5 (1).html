The woman had been hemorrhaging for twelve years; it was uncontrollable. No one could touch her nor anything she had touched. By law she was considered unclean, (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+15%3A25-27"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Leviticus 15:25-27</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). She was to be totally cut off from society and religious worship. This particular woman had tried all she knew.

When there is no hope anywhere else, there is hope in Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;	There is no need to reach the point of hopelessness; no need to reach the </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">end of our ropes</span><span class="csC05134DD">; no need to become utterly depressed. Circumstances should never be allowed to destroy us, not to the point of utter hopelessness. Nevertheless, many reach that point. The one thing to remember is that Jesus does care and will never turn away from the hopeless.

The woman worked her way through the crowd and came up behind Jesus. She wanted to touch Jesus without being seen or noticed. Why? She was embarrassed and felt unworthy. Her hemorrhaging was a personal, intimate matter for her, something she did not want to be known and discussed. She was considered unclean; therefore, she felt unworthy to approach Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;	</span><span class="cs87110596">T</span><span class="csC05134DD">he sense of unworthiness and hopelessness touches the heart of Jesus; it is not being shy and fearing embarrassment. Being shy and fearing embarrassment are only the attitudes that create a sense of unworthiness and hopelessness. Jesus accepts any of the hopeless who come to Him, no matter what causes their sense of unworthiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9B8A48D3"><span class="csC05134DD">Embarrassing matters, personal matters, secret matters&mdash;all are understood by Christ.

These sometimes cause problems for us, serious problems that drive us to the point of hopelessness.

She feared that somehow her healing might be reversed if she did not confess that she had touched Him. So &quot;knowing what was done in her, [she] came and fell down before Him, and told Him all the truth.&quot; It was difficult and embarrassing, but she did it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Matthew 10:32&mdash;</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke 12:8&mdash;</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF1BA8D25">Romans 10:9&mdash;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is glorious.
