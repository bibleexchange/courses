He it was that put the bitter cup into his hand, and obliged him to drink it (Joh 18:11), having laid upon him our iniquity. He it was that made him sin and a curse for us, and turned to ashes all his burnt-offering, in token of the acceptance of it, Ps 20:3. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">It is well to pause at the cross before we march onward to battle, and with the psalmist cry &quot;Selah.&quot; We are too much in a hurry to make good haste. &nbsp;A little pausing might greatly help our speed.
