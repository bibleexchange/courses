He has just said that the endurance and comfort necessary to live for God comes from the Scriptures. Now he says they come from God. In fact, he says that God is the God of patience (endurance) and consolation (comfort). Therefore, the believer secures his strength or endurance and comfort from both the Scriptures and God. If he desires to endure to the end&mdash;he must study the Scriptures and pray, asking God to give him strength and endurance, comfort and consolation</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">If we know the endurance and comfort of God, then we are bearing the weaknesses of each other; we are constantly supporting and helping and caring for each other.

God longs for our worship and praise. It is the very reason He created us and saved us. A divided church cannot worship God. This is exactly what is being said. A church has to be of one mind and mouth to worship God. If a people are not of one mind and mouth, God is not glorified; He is not worshipped.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Every one of us must work for the harmony of the church so that we may be of one mind and fulfill the very purpose for our existence: to glorify God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;1 Cor. 1:10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">2 Cor. 13:11 Finally, brethren, farewell.

Christ received us, that God may be glorified. Therefore, we must receive each other so that God may be glorified through our lives and church.
