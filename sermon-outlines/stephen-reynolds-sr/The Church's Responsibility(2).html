It is our duty as well-instructed Christians to learn what the Church is, what distinguishes it, its Authority, Orders, Organization and Government, that we may know our privileges and improve our labors, and so attain through the Kingdom of Grace, a glorious entrance into the Kingdom of Glory.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">A better knowledge of the Church would help us in understanding our Responsibilities.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">God in man, rather man himself, becomes man&#39;s Teacher, Guide and Saviour.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The uninstructed are asked to sit in judgment on questions for solutions of which spiritual abilities are necessary. </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Such destructive theories are closely connected with the loss or the forgetfulness of the true idea of the Church. They can best be corrected by restoring to the Church its true position and its rightful authority in all matters concerning faith. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The word [</span><span class="csD3860DFD">ecclesia</span><span class="csA521DC07"> or church] means,</span><span class="csD3860DFD"> </span><span class="csA521DC07">a body, &nbsp;called out of the world, a selected assembly or people called out of heathenism, from worldly things engrossments, from the slavery of sin, and who are born into the Christ-Kingdom, Christ as Lord and Head, receiving Him personally as Redeemer and Saviour, giving Him full allegiance, obeying His teaching, relying on His promises. They are born and called into this, prevenient grace. Preparing you to be baptized into the body of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;In Covenant with God through Christ the Mediator, on the ground of His Redemptive work, through the human instrumentality of His Ministry. Responsive to His grace\ the Spiritual gifts conferred by the laying on of Apostles&#39; hands. participation of the life of Christ crucified, of growth into Him, of nurture and sanctification. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Perfection of &nbsp;being in union with Christ, and at last the Redemption of body, soul and spirit </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The organized body of Christ&#39;s followers thus baptized into Him is the Church. It may be considered as local&mdash;a single congregation. It is a Church as having the Ministry, the preaching of the pure word of God. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">This is the Kingdom which John Baptist announced as immediately at hand, which Jesus Himself began to preach in Galilee Mark i, 14, and which He, its founder, compared to a grain of mustard seed, in His parables. it is set forth and illustrated in varied language. It is the Body of Christ. It is a living Temple built up on the foundation of His doctrine. It is a vine with fruit-bearing branches. It is an army fighting and conquering under Jesus our King and the Captain of our Salvation. It is the institution built by Christ against which the gates of hell cannot prevail Matt. xvi, 18. It is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the Truth.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">All the references to it in Holy Scripture prove that it is Divine and intended to be permanent. I am not speaking now of the Jewish Church of which the Christian is the antitype, the continuation, the development, and which every one who receives the OldTestament believes to have been Divine in its origin and divinely guided in its history. I am speaking of the Church of the New Covenant. It is founded by Christ. It is purchased by His Blood. It is vitalised and energised by His Spirit. He ordained and appointed and qualifies its Ministry, and provides for their succession and perpetuation. He instituted its Sacraments, and gave for its guidance the Word of Truth. He intended it as the Spiritual House, the School for training, the Church as His Body should represent Him in the world, should be and show through the Word His life, should continue the work which He began to do and to teach (Acts i, 1), and of which He laid the foundation in His Death, Resurrection, Ascension and Pentecostal gifts; the regeneration of the world.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">First, it is </span><span class="cs75A07D5F">one</span><span class="csA521DC07">. Christ, the Head, has not many Bodies, but one Body. It has many members, and all have not the same office, but they all contribute to the increase and usefulness of the Body. So the Vine is one. The Temple is one. Indeed, all the Scripture representations of the Church involve its Unity. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Since the Church has been broken into many schisms and as we see it to-day to be sadly divided, a distinction has been drawn between the Church, visible and invisible; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Triumphant in Glory. With some, that secret, elect number known only to God, who will persevere unto the end, and who may be conceived of as one with the Church. They are a Church within the Church. They are those whose names are written in Heaven. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">2. The Holiness of the Church needs but a word of explanation. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The Church is Holy in purpose and end. It is Holy because its Head is Holy. Its life is from the only Source of Holiness. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The </span><span class="csF42C4B08">Holy</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Spirit is its vital breath and inspiration. It is One in Christ in Whom it lives and Who is in it the hope of glory. The Scripture passages which directly and indirectly assert the Holiness of the visible Church are numerous and must be familiar to students of the Bible.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">1Ti 1:5 &para; Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">Mt 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The crime </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">breaking the Unity of the Church</span><span class="csA521DC07"> lies chiefly at the door of lukewarmness.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">4. The Church is shown to be continuing steadfastly in the Apostle&#39;s Doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in the prayers (Acts ii, 43).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csA521DC07">The glory of a christian is in being like Jesus&hellip; You belong to a Church which has every mark of the true Church of Christ.
