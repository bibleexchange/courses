And there were also with him other little ships.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Mr 5:1 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 But </span><span class="csF42C4B08">when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him</span><span class="csA521DC07">,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;18 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and </span><span class="csF42C4B08">hath had compassion on thee</span><span class="csA521DC07">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Lu 8:22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;36 &nbsp;They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;39 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
