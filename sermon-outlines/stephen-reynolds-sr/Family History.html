				<td class="csC27D7714" valign="top" width="624"><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E"><br/>The following are notes I took one day while visiting with Aunt Evelyn in Florida a few years ago. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t date the notes but I do know that it was a time when Jean and Charlie had their new RV set up next to Mom &amp; Dad (Marion &amp; Cliff!) at Clerbrook.<br/><br/>I would really love more of this kind of information... more meaningful than just the family tree info (but I also want that if you want to share!) If you get the time please think about some of the stories you have heard about the Reynolds, Yorks, Tenneys and others that could be included in our family story! I would really love to have this family history for my family and will share whatever I get with others!<br/><br/>Thanks to all who help!<br/><br/>Love, Candy<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/>Nanna&rsquo;s parents:<br/>Mary J. O&rsquo;Malley &amp; Martin J. Murphy came from Ireland<br/><br/>They went to Ellis Island and then to Portland.<br/><br/>Nanna&rsquo;s dad was a long shoreman<br/><br/>Nanna was five when her mother died<br/><br/>The children were:<br/>Mary (Nanna)<br/>Katie (Catherine)<br/>Martin<br/>Willie<br/>John (youngest)<br/><br/>When their mother died Nanna &amp; Katie were sent to the orphanage on High St. in Portland<br/><br/>John and Willie went back to Ireland and didn&rsquo;t return to the US until they were grown men. They came back to the Boston area and worked on and off ships<br/><br/>Later Nanna went to live with Patrick Murphy to take care of his children on Munjoy Hill.<br/><br/>Aunt Estelle (Fred Reynold&rsquo;s sister) was a dressmaker for the Murphys. She was the one who taught Nanna to sew. She told Fred about the pretty redhead taking care of the Murphy children. Fred was working in Pittsburgh, NH as a house painter.<br/><br/>Nanna went by train to Pittsburgh, NH. Fred was working painting a house when he heard the train. He came down and ran, picking flowers to meet her at the train. (From my baby book I know that Fred&rsquo;s parents were Eliza Golt and Oremandel Reynolds!)<br/><br/>They were probably married soon after that.<br/><br/>The brothers, Fred, Gurney &amp; Carl went to Buxton and bought a big farm. Their sister Cecilia helped buy the farm. (Same road as cemetery where Nanna is buried.)<br/><br/>The brothers ended up going their separate ways.<br/><br/>Carl returned to NH and became a sporting guide.<br/><br/>Gurney had the cows and Fred was the house painter.<br/><br/>Aunt Evelyn and Aunt Ruth were born in NH before the family moved to Buxton.<br/><br/>Aunt Katie met Uncle Gurney in Buxton.<br/><br/>Aunt Evelyn is not sure where Uncle Frederick was born.<br/><br/>Uncle Gurney kept the original farm in Buxton.<br/><br/>Nanna &amp; Fred moved to another part of Buxton and rented the Dunn Farm. Aunt Evelyn says Uncle Frederick was probably born there.<br/><br/>Dorothy &amp; Gordon were born at the Dunn Farm. Aunt Estelle came to help deliver Gordon. <br/><br/>Nanna raised chickens<br/><br/>Later Uncle Gurney ended up buying a farm in another part of Buxton called &ldquo;Egypt.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The children would be sent there when a baby was about to be born.<br/><br/>Nanna would fix up the houses they lived in and Grampa would paint them . They would end up having to move due to rent being raised because of the improvements.<br/><br/>Grampa had oxen and a hay wagon that was used when they moved from one place to another.<br/><br/>Aunt Evelyn isn&rsquo;t sure but thinks Marion was born either at the Dunn Farm or the Mason house. She was a very weak baby. Nanna couldn&rsquo;t nurse her. Aunt Evelyn and Aunt Ruth were sent to Buxton Ctr (they walked - lived about half way between Buxton Ctr and West Buxton!) to buy Mellin&rsquo;s baby food (a powder that was mixed with water.) <br/><br/>(I, Candy, have at least two antique jars that say Mellin&rsquo;s on them!!!) <br/><br/>Grampa would usually go hunting in the winter unless he got an inside painting job.<br/><br/>Some of the &ldquo;rich&rdquo; Murphy&rsquo;s came to visit and wanted to take Nanna and the children away because they didn&rsquo;t approve of Fred&rsquo;s lifestyle. They came in a big black car. One of the lady&rsquo;s had a purple satin dress. Nanna wouldn&rsquo;t go and they never came back. Gordon ws still a baby!<br/><br/>Fred was very jealous of Nanna and didn&rsquo;t like the fact that other men liked her. Aunt Evelyn says the brothers were all in love with Nanna!<br/><br/>Aunt Evelyn also says that Nanna never said anything bad against Fred.<br/><br/>One time Fred beat Aunt Evelyn so bad she couldn&rsquo;t stand up without peeing so she couldn&rsquo;t go to school.<br/><br/>Mary was born only about 9 months to a year before Dorothy.<br/><br/>Uncle Jim ws born at the Grafham Farm. Aunt Evelyn was 12 yrs. old. She didn&rsquo;t know that Nanna was pregnant until the kids at school told her Nanna would die because she had so many children.<br/><br/>Uncle Gordon was very shy and often his his face.<br/><br/>When the family moved to Falmouth Aunt Evelyn worked in the hospital (which one??? ________________) diet kitchen making special meals. She was 17 yrs. old. Nanna went with Aunt Evelyn to interview at the hospital. They wanted to hire Nanna. Aunt Evelyn worked there until she got married. Aunt Ruth then took Aunt Evelyn&rsquo;s hospital job.<br/><br/>Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Ivan went to Medway. (How did they meet?_______________?)<br/><br/>Grampa Fred also had another brother, Maynard, who had sporting camps in Pittsburgh, NH. First Connecticut Lake !?!?<br/><br/>Katie&rsquo;s son is Philip.<br/><br/>Fred, Nanna and the family worked on the farm in Falmouth. The owner gave Grampa the choice of a piece of land to build a house. He didn&rsquo;t get the deed and Nanna finally got one many years later but not for the whole piece of land that was originally given to them.<br/><br/>Little Mary died when she was 7.<br/><br/>Uncle Gordon and Aunt Evelyn paid for the stone for Mary&rsquo;s grave just a few years ago. Uncle Gordon had found a piece of granite that they paid to have polished.<br/><br/>Grampa Fred&rsquo;s mother was an Indian from New Hampshire.<br/><br/>Grampa Murphy (Nanna&rsquo;s father) came to live with them for awhile while they were in Buxton. Aunt Evelyn thinks he went to live with Martin after that.<br/><br/>Both Carl and Gurney went into World War I.<br/><br/><br/></span></p></td></tr>
