The net is 11 feet above the court and has an 18&rdquo; diameter. These standards ensure that the game of basketball is played amidst the standards set forth by the NBA, NCAA, Olympics, and other governing sport bodies. Without these standards the game would be changed and would not have the same credibility, honor, or prestige that the NBA Championship, or Team USA has enjoyed within the sport. Standards can be raised, but more often than not they are lowered. This would put the court out of regulation, and would limit the game or players on the court. </span></p><p class="csB1A306E6"><span class="csA521DC07">God has a standard. He has a goal. His Son is that goal. Yet many men have lowered His standard and then congratulated themselves for being able to dunk the ball. The results of a low standard on the court affect many more people than just the men playing. They affect us all. They start locally, spread regionally, grow nationally, and destroy culture around the world. Just look around our homes, churches, communities, and globe to discover that men &ndash; maybe even most men &ndash; have missed the goal to live as God fearing men. </span></p><p class="csB1A306E6"><span class="cs75A07D5F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB1A306E6"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Christ is </span><span class="csA521DC07">the standard of God.

Nothing has changed. In all the organizations I have observed, managers commit several transgressions when making demands of their people (see the sidebar &ldquo;The Seven Deadly Sins of Setting Demands&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="cs2E6BF322"><span class="cs11E305A8">The Seven Deadly Sins of Setting Demands</span></p><p class="cs8DC3E283"><span class="csA7555675">Here&rsquo;s an example: A large iron mining and processing company was receiving many angry complaints about quality from its largest customer. The CEO met those complaints with apologies and vague promises, and strongly reprimanded the general manager of the guilty operation. The GM in turn held management meetings and communicated with employees about quality&mdash;month after month&mdash;but there was no discernible improvement. He would have been affronted by the suggestion that his expectation setting was faulty, even though he&rsquo;d never established specific goals or explicit plans for achieving them.</span></p><p class="cs8DC3E283"><span class="csA7555675">Another common offense is to describe what must be done and then signal, albeit unintentionally, &ldquo;if you possibly can do it&rdquo;&mdash;as in, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve lost some people, Stan, but you have to give it a go; we really need to increase sales in your territory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs8DC3E283"><span class="csA7555675">Such problems are especially insidious because senior managers often lack insight into their own behavior. I vividly remember watching the world-renowned head of a major media company wave his financial reports in the air at officer meetings and refer to them as &ldquo;confusing junk,&rdquo; much to the consternation of his CFO. When I quietly suggested that he was reinforcing the CFO&rsquo;s behavior by not explaining clearly what improvements he wanted to see, he brushed me off. His dramatics continued with no impact whatsoever on the quality of the reports.</span></p><p class="csB1A306E6"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
