		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">David is very positive. He does not say, I hope, but, I shall be. And this is not wonderful, for the subject of this psalm is the ever living God. Now, on this confidence of David, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">I.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> It was a confidence full of meaning.

To anoint a man with oil was a token of his welcome to your house. His feet were washed that he might be refreshed, and then the guest worthy of especial honour was anointed with perfumed nard. David had the favour of God as a shepherd boy, he found it anew as a warrior, and he had yet other tokens when he became King of Israel. </span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="csA521DC07">Every favour received is a pledge of more to follow. </span></p><p class="cs21D06E57"><span class="cs75A07D5F">3.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> David was anointed three times. </span></p><p class="cs46C5E20B"><span class="csA521DC07">First of all by Samuel, in prospect of his ultimately becoming king; </span></p><p class="cs859CAFA9"><span class="csA521DC07">a second time by the men of Judah, when he reigned over a part of the nation; </span></p><p class="cs46C5E20B"><span class="csA521DC07">and a third time at Hebron, when the whole nation came together, when he was solemnly elected to be their king, </span></p><p class="cs218F8948"><span class="csA521DC07">Looking upon these various anointings as confirmations of his kingly state, he felt that God would yet further confirm him with fresh oil. </span></p><p class="cs218F8948"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs218F8948"><span class="csA521DC07">There were many rebellions against him, but they were all futile.

This was the meaning of the anointing whether of king or priest. This is a very sweet confidence for us. If you are a minister of the Gospel, you will have a thousand reasons for feeling yourself to be incompetent, and you might well throw down the staff of your calling, if you were not sure that your sufficiency is of God.</span></p><p class="cs218F8948"><span class="csA521DC07">2Co 3:5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</span></p><p class="cs21D06E57"><span class="cs75A07D5F">5.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Anointing was intended to give pleasure. </span></p><p class="cs218F8948"><span class="csA521DC07">Men used of old would anoint the heads of their guests to give them pleasure,; and the Lord intends that His people should have the richest pleasure in their souls.

We which have believed do enter into rest, and in that rest we discover new joys each day. The banks of the river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, are not dark with weeping willows, or dreary with a jungle of thorns and thistles, but they are lovely with the rose of Sharon and the lilies of the valley, and among its shady groves the righteous lie down at peace.

Such are all those who are destitute of faith. The present may please you for the present, but there are evil times coming. It is a blessed thing to be so rich that there is no end to your wealth, and nobody can say that but a Christian. It is a blessed thing to have a stream at your foot, which will never fail; and nobody has such a river but a Christian. O the utter, poverty of the man who lives and dies without Christ. God grant it may not be so for us. </span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">

Great is the change made in the individual who is the subject of such consecration. The disciple who declares to the servant-maid, &quot;I know not the man,&quot; is hard to identify with him who, on the temple steps, exclaims, &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&quot; The result of such an anointing upon our Churches would be incalculable good; the growth of holy enjoyment, and the increase of holy usefulness, would elicit from all quarters of the land the joyful shouts proclaiming a present God, and wonders wrought by His power.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">III.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Christian gladness is the anointing of the Spirit (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+45%3A7"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Ps 45:7</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">; <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+1%3A9"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Heb 1:9</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). Gladness is the inheritance of the saints, and, in regard to it, we often need to be &quot;anointed with fresh oil.&quot; Exhortations to joy are frequent in both the Old and New Testament. Joy is one of the foundations of the kingdom of grace in the heart, which is righteousness, joy, and peace. This holy gladness rests on the twofold basis of a firm, constant belief in the all-pervading providence of God, and a confident assurance of participation in His forgiving mercy, manifested in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">IV.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Christian graces are the anointing of the Spirit (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Gal+5%3A22-23"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Gal 5:22, 23</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).

			<span class="cs75A07D5F">Freshness</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">I.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Its excellency.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">1.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> In our devotions.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">2.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> In our feelings. Whether it be exultation or depression, let it be true, not superficial or simulated.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">3.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> In utterance Nature, pure and unsophisticated, is the best instrument for grace.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">4.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> In labour. We ought to serve the Lord to-day with just as much novelty in it as there was ten years ago. I may even venture to say thirty years ago. Talk of Jesus as if you were telling news. Is it not always glad tidings, fresh from heaven?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">II.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> The fear of its departure.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">1.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Christian people can lose the freshness of their own selves by imitating one another. By adopting as our model some one form of the Christian life, other than that which is embodied in the person of our Lord, we shall soon manufacture a set of paste gems, but the diamond flash and glory will be unknown.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">2.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Another way of spoiling your freshness is by repression. The feebler sort of Christians dare not say, feel, or do, until they have asked their leader&#39;s leave.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">3.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> If we want to keep up our freshness, however, the main thing is never to fall into neglect about our souls. Do you know what state the man is generally in when you are charmed by his freshness? Is he not in fine health?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs75A07D5F">III.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Hope of its renewal. Let us not think that we must grow stale and heavenly things grow old with us.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">1.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> For, first, our God in whom we trust renews the face of the year. He is beginning His work again in the fair processes of nature. The dreary winter has passed away. The time of the singing of birds is coming on, and the sweet flowers are peeping out from their graves, enjoying a resurrection of glory and beauty. Now, this is the God whom we serve; and if we have been passing through our winter-time, let us look out for our spring, if any of you have been growing cold of late&mdash;if any of you have grown stale and mechanical, and have fallen into ruts, come, took up: look up, and pray the great Renewer to visit you.</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">2.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Moreover, there is an excellent reason why you may expect to have all your freshness coming back again: it is because Christ dwells in you. Do you not know it? Christ is formed in you the hope of glory; and, if so, your glory will be fresh about you, for He never grows stale. It is God that said of Him, &quot;Thou hast the dew of Thy youth.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs5D2D209"><span class="cs75A07D5F">3.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> Then there is the other grand doctrine of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. If your bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost, shall He not be always to you a fountain of new life&mdash;a spring of fresh delights? Why, it must be so.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675"><br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Heb 11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">But without faith it is impossible to please him: </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ps 132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ps 132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Eph 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ro 10:14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
