Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Ephraim had confronted Gideon in the same spirit of pride and jealousy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephraim &nbsp;wanted to share in the glory, but were not willing to undertake the task.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

They were set on challenging this new commander, accusing him of ignoring them and of not sharing the glory of the fight against the Ammonites with them. They complained that Jephthah had not called them to join in the struggle, they threatened him, suggesting that they were going to burn down his house upon his very head. They demonstrated utter disrespect for Jephthah, and by doing this, they were sealing their own fate before this commander who had been anointed by God (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jdg+12%3A1"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">12:1</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation given by Jephthah shows that he remained calm and cool under the verbal attacks, despite the fact of having just been threatened (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jdg+12%3A2-3"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">12:2-3</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). But he was not going to back down: he was straightforward and direct, laying out the facts as they really were: </span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;the Ephraimites had not helped during the long eighteen years of oppression</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;when the time to throw off the oppression had come, he had summoned them and they had refused to help</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;he was forced to fight the enemy alone&mdash;a perilous, dangerous fight</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;the credit for victory belonged to the Lord, not to him or to anyone else</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;the Ephraimites had no reason to complain</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation was hopeless, for the negotiations slipped into insults, name-calling, and slurs. The result was tragic: civil war broke out. The leaders of Ephraim cast the ultimate insult against Jephthah and the men of Gilead by calling them fugitives, renegades of Israel. They were denouncing the tribes of East Jordan because they lived on the other side of the Jordan River and not in the main territory of the promised land. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">Jephthah mobilized his army and routed the Ephraimites (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jdg+12%3A4"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">12:4</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). As the soldiers fled, Jephthah came up with a clever strategy to identify the fleeing Ephraimites (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jdg+12%3A5-6"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">12:5-6</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). He posted soldiers at the fords of the Jordan River and forced every soldier who crossed the river to say &quot;shibboleth.&quot; The soldiers were able to identify the Ephraimites because they could not pronounce the word correctly. Instead of saying &quot;shibboleth,&quot; they said &quot;sibboleth.&quot; In trying to pronounce the &quot;</span><span class="csD3860DFD">h</span><span class="csA521DC07">&quot; in shibboleth, they were </span><span class="csD3860DFD">tongue-tied</span><span class="csA521DC07"> because of their dialect. They were easily identified and slain at the fords of the Jordan. The results of the civil war were devastating. Forty-two thousand Ephraimite soldiers were killed (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jdg+12%3A6"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">12:6</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Pride caused the civil war within Israel. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Pride always causes division, contention, and strife. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">An evil pride exalts a person above others as though he were better than others. This attitude causes division between that person and those he considers to be underneath him. If the prideful person is out to subject others or to take something of value away from them, then strife and struggle take place. Pride or self-exaltation is forbidden by God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">There was the heroic faith of Jephthah (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jdg+11%3A1-12%3A7"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Judges 11:1-12:7</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).

He was the son of a harlot, but he was taken and reared by his father. However, he was apparently rejected, taunted, and abused by his family and neighbors all during his childhood. He was finally driven away from his home into the desert in exile (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jdg+11%3A1-3"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Judges 11:1-3</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">).

He was also a man of great humility who humbled himself to help save and rule the people in their great crisis. Jephthah was a man of heroic faith.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Throughout the world, many a child has been born to a prostitute or out of wedlock. And the child is known to be illegitimate. there are millions of children who are reared by a single or divorced parent. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">There are children who face all kinds of problems such as poverty, abuse, deformity, unattractiveness, lack of education, and a host of other hardships that cause a child to feel or sense rejection. And in many cases, they are rejected. Then they grow into adults either feeling despised or actually being scorned or rejected. There are adults as well as children all around us who deeply sense this rejection or alienation, feeling like outcasts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">This was the experience of Jephthah, who had been born as an illegitimate child to a prostitute. But here he was being appointed by God and the leaders of Gilead to become the commander of the armed forces, and once the war had been won, to become the head of the nation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The lesson for us is clear. God rejects no person, not for any reason. The rejected and the outcast can come to the Lord, for He reaches out to help them and receive them and meet any need they have.</span></p></body>
