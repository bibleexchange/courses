		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">Time is running out for the Hadzabe. &quot;Our voices will never be heard,&quot; said Gonga. &quot;Tell the world we are dying. Tell the world we want to live.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without help, there will be no shadows in the bush for much longer.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of their souls? Missionaries have made attempts over the past century to bring Christianity to the Hadza. But they all failed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribe worship their own God ?</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csC05134DD">To the dismay of anthropologists and champions of the Earth&#39;s remaining tribal people, two wealthy Arab princes, who have made billions from oil and gas in the United Arab Emirates, are negotiating with the Tanzanian government to buy the Hadzabe&#39;s ancient lands to use as their own private hunting grounds.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">To them, it&#39;s just another commercial deal ? and a chance to kill wild animals. But to the (Stone Age) tribesmen, it would spell the end.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Crown Prince Hamdan bin Zayed (the UAE&#39;s deputy prime minister) </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (deputy supreme commander of the air force) want the Hadza evicted from the area to prevent them competing for game.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">As bait, they are offering to pay the impoverished East African country a reported &pound;30mil/50mil US, and have offered to build private homes, hospitals and schools for the displaced tribe.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">The Tanzanian government supports the plan and, for years, has considered the Hadzabe an embarrassment? &#39;a backward people who should be living decently in proper houses&#39;.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">But apart from removing one of the world&#39;s last tribes, the Arabs will likely bring their ruthless hunting habits to the bush.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">For these men, money is the main weapon. But for tribesman Gonga, hunting in an area 200 miles from the nearest village, his weapon of choice is a wooden bow with a string made from giraffe tendons, which he raises to his eye while crouched behind the twisted roots of an ancient baobab tree.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">Pulling back the string, he held the 100lb tension for ten seconds, making sure of his aim before firing. The arrow sped away, striking a bird (a Crested Francolin ? similar to a grouse) 30 yards away. As it twitched and fluttered, he ran to collect it and cut off its head.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">I think it is very cruel and selfish of rich Kings to try and hunt them out of their land just for their greed and pleasure. As for missionaries trying to convert them, I think the souls of the Hadzabe tribe are more pure than the missionaries will ever be.</span><span class="csA7555675"><br/></span></p></body>
