		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There was the rape of Tamar by the oldest son of David, Amnon, who was heir to the throne, the crown prince of Israel. David&#39;s sin of adultery with Bathsheba influenced and made an impression upon his son, and his son walked in the footsteps of his father, committing a fateful act of immorality. This is a striking lesson on lust and immorality, showing just how despicable and reprehensible lust and immorality can be.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The craving lust of Amnon for Tamar was despicable, reprehensible (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A1-2"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:1-2</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Tamar was his half-sister who had been born to David&#39;s wife Maacah, the daughter of Talmai who was the king of Geshur (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+3%3A3"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:3</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Note that Tamar was the full sister of Absalom. Amnon lusted so much after Tamar that he became ill, for he could not figure out a way to have her sexually. Why? Because Tamar was faithful to the Lord, obeying His commandments and living a pure, righteous life.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil scheme suggested by a friend and cousin, Jonadab, was also despicable and reprehensible (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A3-5"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:3-5</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Note that Jonadab is said to be a subtle, shrewd, or crafty man. He noticed and questioned why Amnon looked so dejected and troubled. After Amnon shared his infatuation and craving for Tamar, his friend Jonadab suggested a scheme to lure Tamar into his bedroom (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A5"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:5</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The crown prince Amnon was to pretend to be ill and go to bed. When his father David came to see him, the crown prince was to ask if his sister Tamar could prepare and feed him one of her special meals.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil scheme was carried out with Amnon going to bed while pretending to be ill (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A6-10"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:6-10</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). When his father, King David, visited him, he followed through with the scheme by requesting David to ask Tamar to prepare and feed him one of her special meals. David agreed and ordered Tamar to do as Amnon had requested (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A7"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). In obedience to her father, Tamar went to Amnon&#39;s house and baked a special bread for him. But note what he did while she was cooking: he lay down close by her, watching and lusting after her.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After Tamar had finished cooking the bread, she took it to him. But the crown prince pretended to be so sick he could not eat, so sick in fact that he wanted no one around him except Tamar (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A9"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:9</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Ordering everyone else to leave, he immediately asked Tamar to bring the food to him in the privacy of his bedroom and to feed him there (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A10"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:10</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Being a compassionate, concerned sister and being totally unaware of Amnon&#39;s wicked motive, Tamar did just as the crown prince requested. She brought the food to him in the privacy of his bedroom with no one present but him and her.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The incest committed by the crown prince Amnon was abominable. He raped Tamar, his half-sister (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A11-14"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:11-14</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). As she began to feed him, he grabbed her and pulled her into bed, begging her to have sex with him. But Tamar strongly resisted (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A12-13"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:12-13</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). She immediately shouted out either &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Do not&quot; several times. In struggling to resist his lustful advances, Tamar made four appeals to the crown prince:</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;She reminded him that rape was a crime and that such a thing should not be done in Israel (nor in any other nation).</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;She appealed to his conscience, emphasizing that rape was a wicked evil.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;She begged him to think of their reputations: she would be disgraced and his reputation would be ruined, for people would look upon him as a wicked fool.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;&nbsp;She appealed for him to control his urges and to ask permission to marry her if he was burning with lust.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But the crown prince refused to listen. Being stronger, he raped his half-sister, committing incest with her.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rape and incest exposed the appalling shortcomings of the crown prince as a person. Once he had committed the reprehensible evil, his emotions immediately turned from attraction to hate (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A15-17"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:15-17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Suddenly realizing the seriousness and possible repercussions of his wicked action, the crown prince ordered Tamar out. But she refused, for they now needed to be married. Because she had been violated, she could not legally be offered to any other man, not by her father, King David (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A16"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:16</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). But Amnon refused to listen to her appeal for marriage. He called his personal servant to evict her and to bolt the door after her (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A17"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the shameful rape, four tragic results soon took place (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A18-22"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:18-22</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). First, Tamar suffered deep anguish and grief (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A18-19"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:18-19</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). As she ran out of the house of the crown prince, she deliberately tore her robe, the distinctive robe worn by the virgin daughters of the king. Then as quickly as she could find ashes, she put the ashes on her head, as was the custom of that day, weeping and covering her face as she ran to her room.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Second, Tamar was emotionally broken and forced to live the life of a desolate woman (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A20"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:20</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). A woman who was shamed and raped in the culture of that day was as good as dead. Raped women stood little chance of ever being married and having a family. For this reason, as soon as Absalom found out about the rape, he moved his sister into his own house to care for her and to provide a sense of security.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Third, when David heard about the incestuous rape, he was furious (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A21"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:21</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). But the king did nothing. He could have insisted that Amnon marry Tamar and take care of her, giving her a family and providing security for her (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ex+22%3A16"><span class="cs92015F65">Exodus 22:16</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Dt+22%3A29"><span class="cs92015F65">Deut. 22:29</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). But he failed to correct and discipline his son, indulging and giving license to his wicked immorality. Being lenient and condoning the sinful behavior of his sons would eventually lead to the death of Amnon and to the revolts of Absalom and Adonijah. The consequences of David&#39;s sin were continuing to fall upon his own family.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fourth, Tamar&#39;s brother Absalom grew bitter and hated Amnon (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=2Sa+13%3A22"><span class="cs92015F65">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:22</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). But he remained silent, saying nothing to anyone. For as we will see, he was secretly plotting and waiting for a convenient time to take revenge upon Amnon.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The lesson for us is clear: we must guard against lust and immorality, all forms of immorality such as adultery, premarital sex, homosexuality, bestiality, fornication, and lasciviousness. Sex is to be pure and holy, set apart for one man and one woman. This is the clear teaching of God&#39;s Holy Word. And anything short of sexual purity and holiness is impure&mdash;despicable and reprehensible, shameful and disobedient to God&#39;s Holy Word.</span></p><p class="csC9D7C422"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As we walk through life, we see the sights and scenes of this world. In looking, our eyes often fall upon some enticing, seductive sight. It may be the seduction of pornographic literature or a person who is dressed immodestly or else dressed to attract attention. We cannot help the first look, but we can control the second look. It is the second look and the thoughts that follow the second look that lead to lust. And when lust has conceived in the human heart, it becomes sin. Scripture declares that a man who looks at a woman with lust in his heart is guilty of committing adultery. With all diligence and control, we must guard against lust and immorality.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart&quot; (<a class="cs9E44F72A" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mt+5%3A28"><span class="cs835A930E">Matthew 5:28</span></a></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span></p><p class="cs1BE3A2E7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Flee fornication.
