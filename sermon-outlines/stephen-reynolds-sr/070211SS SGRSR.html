God is going to judge the idolater. They who govern their own selves. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Habakkuk says, no matter what happens I will serve you Lord, heed your call, obey you. Lord give us that testimony! </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We have a lesson here this morning of God calling us even through grief. The call of God is even through strong grief. The men in the Bible who were called through suffering and grievous times they responded like Habakkuk no matter what I will fallow the Lord.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How am I answering the grief that is in my life now? Are there hard times that people are going through. Sometimes people need to be pinched. When the body suffers we need to suffer with them. When one rejoices, rejoice, when one weeps, weep. JOY COMES IN THE MORNING! Habakkuk says that he will rejoice in the God of his salvation. The call of God is not just a time to enjoy and just be happy and just be lukewarm and be at ease. But is for the prayer warrior and as Jesus though in agony prayed as though great drops of blood he sweat. Agonizing prayer, intense prayer. Salvation to come to the lost is going to come by only a tremendous prize. UNDERSTAND THE GRIEVING.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">My life is easy and good in comparison to the lives and hardships of many. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Habakkuk 3:17-19 is a challenge to everyone of us to understand that the call of God is grieving time. Not easy. You must KNOW God that if you knock seven times and they still say NO we smut know that we heard from God to knock again. Grieving hurts and is anguish. Jesus was in agony and being in agony He prayed more earnestly. We need to strengthened on the inner man. We need to be tough skin and a tender heart. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Noah&rsquo;s testimony Genesis 6, the whole world around him was against what he was doing. In face of the sun not shining I must believe in the Word of God. I know He is real. The closest one we can see being tested with that would be Noah in Genesis 6:6. God repenting that he made man. Now because man has turned away from he is bringing judgment. God didn&rsquo;t say it just like Noah to make him feel like he is isolated and like it was just him and his family, but God said it in such a way that Noah had a tender heart to reach out to the people for 120 years, Please come to God and repent, providing always a hope for room in the ark for any that would receive the message he preached. But it did come down to only 8 people alive. EVERYONE in the world gone but just his family. Would I trust God if it was JUST my family left? Loving God NO MATTER WHAT. If mine was the ONLY family left would I trurst God? would ANYTHING change? Genesis 6:8. Noah trusted and believed God. Just 8 people left to believe. Is there wickedness, evil, violence, things to grieve about? Yes, but we are not going to let it affect our spirit and our faith in Christ. Things develop in people&rsquo;s lives and they begin to question God&rsquo;s ways and even His existence.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Isaiah 54&mdash;Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief. Biography on Abraham Lincoln titled , &ldquo;A Man of Sorrows.&rdquo; He was put down ad reject and lost everything he ran for until it was time for God to use him. But at the right time when God needed him God rose him up and used him there. Our vision is too narrow often, God used John the Baptists for 6 months&rsquo; ministry. God give us the faith and the courage and confidence if God is only going to use me special one day we will yet be faithful and no less zealous. Put away selfishness. Let everything be taken away and let nothing be changed in regards to our faith and trust in God. A Man of Sorrows and not something to be rejected or looked down upon or misunderstood. Christ who is the prince of prince and the giver of Joy answered the call through grief. He has gone through it all and is familiar with all that we suffer.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Psalm 119:58 David was a man after God&rsquo;s own heart. David learned how to suffer properly not because of things he had done but over people not keeping the Word of God. Sometimes we grieve just because we don&rsquo;t&rsquo; like somebody, but David is grieve because they kept not the law of God. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Psalm 139:21&mdash;a right spirit required to hate them that hate God. Having the nature of Christ to properly hate sin and hate sinners that are violent, and hate God. To HATE properly. &ldquo;Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s hates unrighteousness and hates evil.</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Amos 6:1,6</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">v.1 Woe to them at ease		v.4-Selfish They Are		v.6-Not grieved by sin</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God is calling us to grieve. To understand the prayer warriors avenue, disposition of weeping in tears and agony. Not like the Pharisees walking around and making sure everyone sees how sad I am and how pious I am. Weeping before the porch and the altar before God and then there is a TIME for rejoicing in God. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much we grieve over the things that we lose, yet I WILL REJOICE IN THE GOD OF MY SALVATION. (Habakkuk 3:18) If I carry a dark countenance all the time how is that attractive to the sinner? Joy in our spirit. Life in us like a river of living water. But a grievance and a sorrow even with tears for the lost. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Samuel &ndash;takes some time to see Hannah in chapter one. Hannah is not picking and choosing a need for herself, but she cries out for the need of a nation in need of man of God that will declare the WHOLE word of God. Praise that God will raise up men. There is a lot of wickedness and evil out there. Little by little God will use you more and more. You will never know the call of grieve until you have offended someone for the truth&rsquo;s sake. The greatest time of suffering comes when have done all you can to help someone and they reject you. They came to Samuel as an old man saying that he is washed up and they need ANOTHER man to lead them, a king. I Samuel 15:35 in the days of Saul Samuel grived becaue God had been rejected and disobeyed. Men had pushed away the ways of God and the call of God. God is our way and our God we live for Him and ONLY for Him. </span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">James &ndash;dealing with me as an individual. Understanding that God leads us to victory in all things. God always causes us to triumph. Many do not understand and the best the can do is learn to &lsquo;roll with the punches&rsquo; until they just get so tired they throw in the towl. When I pray do I belive? Is my prayer in FAITH? Look at the Scripture to be a mirror of my soul. Doon&rsquo;t ever take any counsel of my flesh. Look in the Word of God. Philippians 4:8 &ldquo;Think ono these things&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">James 4:8 James deals with 4 Classes of people, all classes are to draw nigh to God:</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
