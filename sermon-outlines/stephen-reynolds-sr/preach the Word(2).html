This idea just does not make sense to most people, for there are some so called good people in the world that believe to do good to be acceptable to God. Think about it: no matter who the person is&mdash;no matter how good and moral he is&mdash;no matter how much good he does, he is not acceptable and cannot make himself acceptable to God. This is not a pleasant thought, not to any person.

What &#39;softies&#39; we sometimes are, afraid to come out clearly in our proclamation of the truth and our stand as to false doctrine, fearing our fellows, the displeasure of our superiors, or the cutting off of our immediate financial income. I would rather walk a lonely road with Jesus than be without His fellowship in the crowd, wouldn&#39;t you?

This does not mean that the minister is to become a travelling or professional evangelist. It means that his work is to be evangelistic&mdash;he is to seek to win souls in all that he does. He is to share the love and judgment of God in all of his preaching and teaching and in everything else he does. The very thrust of his ministry is to be that of reconciling people to God, that of sharing the glorious news of God&#39;s love and of coming judgment: that God saves and shall judge people through His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csF42C4B08">Acts 1:8</span><span class="cs75A07D5F"> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csF42C4B08">4:20</span><span class="cs75A07D5F">For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF42C4B08">2 Cor. 4:13</span><span class="cs75A07D5F">We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear&quot; (</span><span class="csF42C4B08">1 Peter 3:15</span><span class="cs75A07D5F">).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="cs75A07D5F">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is to complete and fulfill his ministry, fill it to the brim.
