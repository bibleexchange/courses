&nbsp;The Israelites had utilized foreigners in temple service under Joshua and David and that this was common among ancient religions of the Near East. &nbsp;Though they had started out as water bearers and servants to the Levites, it would seem that they had gradually been allowed to assume some of the priestly duties. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA79A1717">&nbsp;&ldquo;uncircumcised in heart.&rdquo; &nbsp;Circumcision in the flesh of the Jewish people was supposed to represent a circumcised heart, a heart yielded to God as Lord. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA79A1717">Most of the priests of the Lord during Isaiah and Ezekiel&rsquo;s times had become uncircumcised in their heart. &nbsp;They were no longer serving as unto the Lord, but as unto themselves and to court the pleasure of the people. &nbsp;They had broken covenant with God. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6F0253E1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csBB08245D">Ezek. 44:9</span><span class="cs6F0253E1"> Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that </span><span class="cs14FFC6CE">is</span><span class="cs6F0253E1"> among the children of Israel. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA79A1717">This verse would indicate that no one will enter the temple who is uncircumcised in the flesh or uncircumcised in the heart. &nbsp;It would seem that all men will be expected to circumcise the flesh as evidence of a circumcised heart if they want to have access to the temple.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6F0253E1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csBB08245D">Ezek. 44:10</span><span class="cs6F0253E1"> And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols;
