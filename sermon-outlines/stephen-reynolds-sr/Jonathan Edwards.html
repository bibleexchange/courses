			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">It implies, that they were always exposed to </span><span class="csA77D58D6">sudden unexpected</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> destruction. As he that </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">walks in slippery places is every moment liable to fall, he cannot foresee one moment whether he shall stand or fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once without warning: Which is also expressed in <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Ps.73.html#Ps.73.18"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Psalm 73:18,19</span></a></span><a name="_Ps_73_18_73_19"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction: How are they brought into desolation as in a moment!</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

For it is said, that when that due time, or appointed time comes, </span><span class="csA77D58D6">their foot shall slide</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">. Then they shall be left to fall, as they are inclined by their own weight. God will not hold them up in these slippery places any longer, but will let them go; and then, at that very instant, they shall fall into destruction; as he that stands on such slippery declining ground, on the edge of a pit, he cannot stand alone, when he is let go he immediately falls and is lost.</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The observation from the words that I would now insist upon is this. -- &quot;There is nothing that keeps wicked men at any one moment out of hell, but the mere pleasure of God.&quot; -- By the </span><span class="csA77D58D6">mere</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> pleasure of God, I mean his </span><span class="csA77D58D6">sovereign</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> pleasure, his arbitrary will, restrained by no obligation, hindered by no manner of difficulty, any more than if nothing else but God&#39;s mere will had in the least degree, or in any respect whatsoever, any hand in the preservation of wicked men one moment. -- The truth of this observation may appear by the following considerations.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">There is no want of </span><span class="csA77D58D6">power</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> in God to cast wicked men into hell at any moment.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;Men&#39;s hands cannot be strong when God rises up. The strongest have no power to resist him, nor can any deliver out of his hands. -- He is not only able to cast wicked men into hell, but he can most easily do it. Sometimes an earthly prince meets with a great deal of difficulty to subdue a rebel, who has found means to fortify himself, and has made himself strong by the numbers of his followers. But it is not so with God. There is no fortress that is any defence from the power of God. Though hand join in hand, and vast multitudes of God&#39;s enemies combine and associate themselves, they are easily broken in pieces. They are as great heaps of light chaff before the whirlwind; or large quantities of dry stubble before devouring flames. We find it easy to tread on and crush a worm that we see crawling on the earth; so it is easy for us to cut or singe a slender thread that any thing hangs by: thus easy is it for God, when he pleases, to cast his enemies down to hell. What are we, that we should think to stand before him, at whose rebuke the earth trembles, and before whom the rocks are thrown down?</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">They </span><span class="csA77D58D6">deserve</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> to be cast into hell; so that divine justice never stands in the way,</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;it makes no objection against God&#39;s using his power at any moment to destroy them. Yea, on the contrary, justice calls aloud for an infinite punishment of their sins. Divine justice says of the tree that brings forth such grapes of Sodom, &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot; <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Luke.13.html#Luke.13.7"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Luke 13:7</span></a></span><a name="_Luke_13_7_0_0"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. The sword of divine justice is every moment brandished over their heads, and it is nothing but the hand of arbitrary mercy, and God&#39;s mere will, that holds it back.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">They are already under a sentence of </span><span class="csA77D58D6">condemnation</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> to hell. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">They do not only justly deserve to be cast down thither, but the sentence of the law of God, that eternal and immutable rule of righteousness that God has fixed between him and mankind, is gone out against them, and stands against them; so that they are bound over already to hell. <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.3.html#John.3.18"><span class="csEFD10EDC">John 3:18</span></a></span><a name="_John_3_18_0_0"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">He that believeth not is condemned already.</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot; So that every unconverted man properly belongs to hell; that is his place; from thence he is, <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.John.8.html#John.8.23"><span class="csEFD10EDC">John 8:23</span></a></span><a name="_John_8_23_0_0"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">Ye are from beneath:</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot; And thither he is bound; it is the place that justice, and God&#39;s word, and the sentence of his unchangeable law assign to him.</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">They are now the objects of that very same </span><span class="csA77D58D6">anger</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> and wrath of God, that is expressed in </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">the torments of hell. And the reason why they do not go down to hell at each moment, is not because God, in whose power they are, is not then very angry with them; as he is with many miserable creatures now tormented in hell, who there feel and bear the fierceness of his wrath. Yea, God is a great deal more angry with great numbers that are now on earth: yea, doubtless, with many that are now in this congregation, who it may be are at ease, than he is with many of those who are now in the flames of hell.</span></p><p class="csFEE8EB43"><span class="cs1DA2E76">So that it is not because God is unmindful of their wickedness, and does not resent it, that he does not let loose his hand and cut them off. God is not altogether such an one as themselves, though they may imagine him to be so. The wrath of God burns against them, their damnation does not slumber; the pit is prepared, the fire is made ready, the furnace is now hot, ready to receive them; the flames do now rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet, and held over them, and the pit hath opened its mouth under them.</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The </span><span class="csA77D58D6">devil</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> stands ready to fall upon them, and seize them as his own, </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">at what moment God shall permit him. They belong to him; he has their souls in his possession, and under his dominion. The scripture represents them as his goods, <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Luke.11.html#Luke.11.12"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Luke 11:12</span></a></span><a name="_Luke_11_12_0_0"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. The devils watch them; they are ever by them at their right hand; they stand waiting for them, like greedy hungry lions that see their prey, and expect to have it, but are for the present kept back. If God should withdraw his hand, by which they are restrained, they would in one moment fly upon their poor souls. The old serpent is gaping for them; hell opens its mouth wide to receive them; and if God should permit it, they would be hastily swallowed up and lost.</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">There are in the souls of wicked men those hellish </span><span class="csA77D58D6">principles</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> reigning, </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">that would presently kindle and flame out into hell fire, if it were not for God&#39;s restraints. There is laid in the very nature of carnal men, a foundation for the torments of hell. There are those corrupt principles, in reigning power in them, and in full possession of them, that are seeds of hell fire.</span></p><p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;These principles are active and powerful, exceeding violent in their nature, and if it were not for the restraining hand of God upon them, they would soon break out, they would flame out after the same manner as the same corruptions, the same enmity does in the hearts of damned souls, and would beget the same torments as they do in them. The souls of the wicked are in scripture compared to the troubled sea, <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.57.html#Isa.57.20"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Isa. 57:20</span></a></span><a name="_Isa_57_20_0_0"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. For the present, God restrains their wickedness by his mighty power, as he does the raging waves of the troubled sea, saying, &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further;</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot; but if God should withdraw that restraining power, it would soon carry all before it. Sin is the ruin and misery of the soul; it is destructive in its nature; and if God should leave it without restraint, there would need nothing else to make the soul perfectly miserable. The corruption of the heart of man is immoderate and boundless in its fury; and while wicked men live here, it is like fire pent up by God&#39;s restraints, whereas if it were let loose, it would set on fire the course of nature; and as the heart is now a sink of sin, so if sin was not restrained, it would immediately turn the soul into fiery oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone.</span></p><ol start="7" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">It is no security to wicked men for one moment, that there are no visible means of death at hand.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;It is no security to a natural man, that he is now in health, and that he does not see which way he should now immediately go out of the world by any accident, and that there is no visible danger in any respect in his circumstances. The manifold and continual experience of the world in all ages, shows this is no evidence, that a man is not on the very brink of eternity, and that the next step will not be into another world. The unseen, unthought-of ways and means of persons going suddenly out of the world are innumerable and inconceivable. Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering, and there are innumerable places in this covering so weak that they will not bear their weight, and these places are not seen. The arrows of death fly unseen at noon-day; the sharpest sight cannot discern them. God has so many different unsearchable ways of taking wicked men out of the world and sending them to hell, that there is nothing to make it appear, that God had need to be at the expense of a miracle, or go out of the ordinary course of his providence, to destroy any wicked man, at any moment. All the means that there are of sinners going out of the world, are so in God&#39;s hands, and so universally and absolutely subject to his power and determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than if means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.</span></p><ol start="8" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Natural men&#39;s prudence and care to preserve their own lives, or the care of others to preserve them, do not secure them a moment. To this, divine providence and universal experience do also bear testimony. There is this clear evidence that men&#39;s own wisdom is no security to them from death; that if it were otherwise we should see some difference between the wise and politic men of the world, and others, with regard to their liableness to early and unexpected death: but how is it in fact? <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Eccl.2.html#Eccl.2.16"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Eccles. 2:16</span></a></span><a name="_Eccl_2_16_0_0"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">How dieth the wise man? even as the fool.</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot;</span></li><li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">All wicked men&#39;s pains and </span><span class="csA77D58D6">contrivance</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> which they use to escape hell, while they continue to reject Christ, and so remain wicked men, do not secure them from hell one moment. Almost every natural man that hears of hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it; he depends upon himself for his own security; he flatters himself in what he has done, in what he is now doing, or what he intends to do. Every one lays out matters in his own mind how he shall avoid damnation, and flatters himself that he contrives well for himself, and that his schemes will not fail. They hear indeed that there are but few saved, and that the greater part of men that have died heretofore are gone to hell; but each one imagines that he lays out matters better for his own escape than others have done. He does not intend to come to that place of torment; he says within himself, that he intends to take effectual care, and to order matters so for himself as not to fail.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csE174AB9B"><span class="cs1DA2E76">But the foolish children of men miserably delude themselves in their own schemes, and in confidence in their own strength and wisdom; they trust to nothing but a shadow. The greater part of those who heretofore have lived under the same means of grace, and are now dead, are undoubtedly gone to hell; and it was not because they were not as wise as those who are now alive: it was not because they did not lay out matters as well for themselves to secure their own escape. If we could speak with them, and inquire of them, one by one, whether they expected, when alive, and when they used to hear about hell, ever to be the subjects of misery: we doubtless, should hear one and another reply, &quot;No, I never intended to come here: I had laid out matters otherwise in my mind; I thought I should contrive well for myself -- I thought my scheme good. I intended to take effectual care; but it came upon me unexpected; I did not look for it at that time, and in that manner; it came as a thief -- Death outwitted me: God&#39;s wrath was too quick for me. Oh, my cursed foolishness!</span></p><p class="csE174AB9B"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;I was flattering myself, and pleasing myself with vain dreams of what I would do hereafter; and when I was saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction came upon me.&quot;</span></p><ol start="10" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCF58C20E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">God has laid himself under no </span><span class="csA77D58D6">obligation</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">, by any promise to keep any natural</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">man out of hell one moment. God certainly has made no promises either of eternal life, or of any deliverance or preservation from eternal death, but what are contained in the covenant of grace, the promises that are given in Christ, in whom all the promises are yea and amen. But surely they have no interest in the promises of the covenant of grace who are not the children of the covenant, who do not believe in any of the promises, and have no interest in the Mediator of the covenant.</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">So that, whatever some have imagined and pretended about promises made to natural men&#39;s earnest seeking and knocking, it is plain and manifest, that whatever pains a natural man takes in religion, whatever prayers he makes, till he believes in Christ, God is under no manner of obligation to keep him a moment from eternal destruction. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">So that, thus it is that natural men are held in the hand of God, over the pit of hell; they have deserved the fiery pit, and are already sentenced to it; and God is dreadfully provoked, his anger is as great towards them as to those that are actually suffering the executions of the fierceness of his wrath in hell, and they have done nothing in the least to appease or abate that anger, neither is God in the least bound by any promise to hold them up one moment; the devil is waiting for them, hell is gaping for them, the flames gather and flash about them, and would fain lay hold on them, and swallow them up; the fire pent up in their own hearts is struggling to break out: and they have no interest in any Mediator, there are no means within reach that can be any security to them. In short, they have no refuge, nothing to take hold of; all that preserves them every moment is the mere arbitrary will, and uncovenanted, unobliged forbearance of an incensed God.</span></p><h4 class="cs96FD36A">

		<p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The use of this awful subject may be for awakening unconverted persons in this congregation.

There is the dreadful pit of the glowing flames of the wrath of God; there is hell&#39;s wide gaping mouth open; and you have nothing to stand upon, nor any thing to take hold of; there is nothing between you and hell but the air; it is only the power and mere pleasure of God that holds you up.</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">You probably are not sensible of this; you find you are kept out of hell, but do not see the hand of God in it; but look at other things, as the good state of your bodily constitution, your care of your own life, and the means you use for your own preservation. But indeed these things are nothing; if God should withdraw his hand, they would avail no more to keep you from falling, than the thin air to hold up a person that is suspended in it.</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you out of hell, than a spider&#39;s web would have to stop a falling rock. Were it not for the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not bear you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans with you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your corruption, not willingly; the sun does not willingly shine upon you to give you light to serve sin and Satan; the earth does not willingly yield her increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage for your wickedness to be acted upon; the air does not willingly serve you for breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you spend your life in the service of God&#39;s enemies. God&#39;s creatures are good, and were made for men to serve God with, and do not willingly subserve to any other purpose, and groan when they are abused to purposes so directly contrary to their nature and end. And the world would spew you out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath subjected it in hope. There are the black clouds of God&#39;s wrath now hanging directly over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big with thunder; and were it not for the restraining hand of God, it would immediately burst forth upon you. The sovereign pleasure of God, for the present, stays his rough wind; otherwise it would come with fury, and your destruction would come like a whirlwind, and you would be like the chaff on the summer threshing floor. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present; they increase more and more, and rise higher and higher, till an outlet is given; and the longer the stream is stopped, the more rapid and mighty is its course, when once it is let loose. It is true, that judgment against your evil works has not been executed hitherto; the floods of God&#39;s vengeance have been withheld; but your guilt in the mean time is constantly increasing, and you are every day treasuring up more wrath; the waters are constantly rising, and waxing more and more mighty; and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, that holds the waters back, that are unwilling to be stopped, and press hard to go forward. If God should only withdraw his hand from the flood-gate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and wrath of God, would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength were ten thousand times greater than it is, yea, ten thousand times greater than the strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it would be nothing to withstand or endure it. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The bow of God&#39;s wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string, and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an angry God, without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood. Thus all you that never passed under a great change of heart, by the mighty power of the Spirit of God upon your souls; all you that were never born again, and made new creatures, and raised from being dead in sin, to a state of new, and before altogether unexperienced light and life, are in the hands of an angry God. However you may have reformed your life in many things, and may have had religious affections, and may keep up a form of religion in your families and closets, and in the house of God, it is nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being this moment swallowed up in everlasting destruction. However unconvinced you may now be of the truth of what you hear, by and by you will be fully convinced of it. Those that are gone from being in the like circumstances with you, see that it was so with them; for destruction came suddenly upon most of them; when they expected nothing of it, and while they were saying, Peace and safety: now they see, that those things on which they depended for peace and safety, were nothing but thin air and empty shadows. </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked: his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire; he is of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight; you are ten thousand times more abominable in his eyes, than the most hateful venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment. It is to be ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell the last night; that you was suffered to awake again in this world, after you closed your eyes to sleep. And there is no other reason to be given, why you have not dropped into hell since you arose in the morning, but that God&#39;s hand has held you up. There is no other reason to be given why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat here in the house of God, provoking his pure eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending his solemn worship. Yea, there is nothing else that is to be given as a reason why you do not this very moment drop down into hell.</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you, as against many of the damned in hell. You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; and you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment. -- And consider here more particularly,</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

It is but little that they can do, when most enraged, and when they have exerted the utmost of their fury. All the kings of the earth, before God, are as grasshoppers; they are nothing, and less than nothing: both their love and their hatred is to be despised. The wrath of the great King of kings, is as much more terrible than theirs, as his majesty is greater. <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Luke.12.html#Luke.12.4"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Luke 12:4,5</span></a></span><a name="_Luke_12_4_12_5"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">And I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, have no more that they can do.

But when once the day of mercy is past, your most lamentable and dolorous cries and shrieks will be in vain; you will be wholly lost and thrown away of God, as to any regard to your welfare. God will have no other use to put you to, but to suffer misery; you shall be continued in being to no other end; for you will be a vessel of wrath fitted to destruction; and there will be no other use of this vessel, but to be filled full of wrath.

		<p class="csCCEA7771"><span class="cs1DA2E76">show what that wrath of Jehovah is. God hath had it on his heart to show to angels and men, both how excellent his love is, and also how terrible his wrath is. Sometimes earthly kings have a mind to show how terrible their wrath is, by the extreme punishments they would execute on those that would provoke them. Nebuchadnezzar, that mighty and haughty monarch of the Chaldean empire, was willing to show his wrath when enraged with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and accordingly gave orders that the burning fiery furnace should be heated seven times hotter than it was before; doubtless, it was raised to the utmost degree of fierceness that human art could raise it. But the great God is also willing to show his wrath, and magnify his awful majesty and mighty power in the extreme sufferings of his enemies. <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Rom.9.html#Rom.9.22"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Rom. 9:22</span></a></span><a name="_Rom_9_22_0_0"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot; And seeing this is his design, and what he has determined, even to show how terrible the unrestrained wrath, the fury and fierceness of Jehovah is, he will do it to effect.

When the great and angry God hath risen up and executed his awful vengeance on the poor sinner, and the wretch is actually suffering the infinite weight and power of his indignation, then will God call upon the whole universe to behold that awful majesty and mighty power that is to be seen in it. <a class="cs490F1DCA" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/asv.Isa.33.html#Isa.33.12"><span class="csEFD10EDC">Isa. 33:12-14</span></a></span><a name="_Isa_33_12_33_14"></a><span class="cs1DA2E76">. &quot;</span><span class="csC8468922">And the people shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut up shall they be burnt in the fire.

When you look forward, you shall see a long for ever, a boundless duration before you, which will swallow up your thoughts, and amaze your soul; and you will absolutely despair of ever having any deliverance, any end, any mitigation, any rest at all. You will know certainly that you must wear out long ages, millions of millions of ages, in wrestling and conflicting with this almighty merciless vengeance; and then when you have so done, when so many ages have actually been spent by you in this manner, you will know that all is but a point to what remains.

But this is the dismal case of every soul in this congregation that has not been born again, however moral and strict, sober and religious, they may otherwise be. Oh that you would consider it, whether you be young or old! There is reason to think, that there are many in this congregation now hearing this discourse, that will actually be the subjects of this very misery to all eternity. We know not who they are, or in what seats they sit, or what thoughts they now have. It may be they are now at ease, and hear all these things without much disturbance, and are now flattering themselves that they are not the persons, promising themselves that they shall escape. If we knew that there was one person, and but one, in the whole congregation, that was to be the subject of this misery, what an awful thing would it be to think of! If we knew who it was, what an awful sight would it be to see such a person! How might all the rest of the congregation lift up a lamentable and bitter cry over him! But, alas! instead of one, how many is it likely will remember this discourse in hell? And it would be a wonder, if some that are now present should not be in hell in a very short time, even before this year is out. And it would be no wonder if some persons, that now sit here, in some seats of this meeting-house, in health, quiet and secure, should be there before tomorrow morning. Those of you that finally continue in a natural condition, that shall keep out of hell longest will be there in a little time! your damnation does not slumber; it will come swiftly, and, in all probability, very suddenly upon many of you. You have reason to wonder that you are not already in hell. It is doubtless the case of some whom you have seen and known, that never deserved hell more than you, and that heretofore appeared as likely to have been now alive as you. Their case is past all hope; they are crying in extreme misery and perfect despair; but here you are in the land of the living and in the house of God, and have an opportunity to obtain salvation. What would not those poor damned hopeless souls give for one day&#39;s opportunity such as you now enjoy!</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily coming from the east, west, north and south; many that were very lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God. How awful is it to be left behind at such a day! To see so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see so many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit! How can you rest one moment in such a condition? Are not your souls as precious as the souls of the people at Suffield, where they are flocking from day to day to Christ?</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Are there not many here who have lived long in the world, and are not to this day born again? and so are aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and have done nothing ever since they have lived, but treasure up wrath against the day of wrath? Oh, sirs, your case, in an especial manner, is extremely dangerous. Your guilt and hardness of heart is extremely great. Do you not see how generality persons of your years are passed over and left, in the present remarkable and wonderful dispensation of God&#39;s mercy? You had need to consider yourselves, and awake thoroughly out of sleep. You cannot bear the fierceness and wrath of the infinite God. -- And you, young men, and young women, will you neglect this precious season which you now enjoy, when so many others of your age are renouncing all youthful vanities, and flocking to Christ? </span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">You especially have now an extraordinary opportunity; but if you neglect it, it will soon be with you as with those persons who spent all the precious days of youth in sin, and are now come to such a dreadful pass in blindness and hardness. -- And you, children, who are unconverted, do not you know that you are going down to hell, to bear the dreadful wrath of that God, who is now angry with you every day and every night?</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;Will you be content to be the children of the devil, when so many other children in the land are converted, and are become the holy and happy children of the King of kings?</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">And let every one that is yet out of Christ, and hanging over the pit of hell, whether they be old men and women, or middle aged, or young people, or little children, now hearken to the loud calls of God&#39;s word and providence. This acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will doubtless be a day of as remarkable vengeance to others. Men&#39;s hearts harden, and their guilt increases apace at such a day as this, if they neglect their souls; and never was there so great danger of such persons being given up to hardness of heart and blindness of mind. God seems now to be hastily gathering in his elect in all parts of the land; and probably the greater part of adult persons that ever shall be saved, will be brought in now in a little time, and that it will be as it was on the great out-pouring of the Spirit upon the Jews in the apostles&#39; days; the election will obtain, and the rest will be blinded. If this should be the case with you, you will eternally curse this day, and will curse the day that ever you was born, to see such a season of the pouring out of God&#39;s Spirit, and will wish that you had died and gone to hell before you had seen it. Now undoubtedly it is, as it was in the days of John the Baptist, the axe is in an extraordinary manner laid at the root of the trees, that every tree which brings not forth good fruit, may be hewn down and cast into the fire.</span></p><p class="cs350C218D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Therefore, let every one that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from the wrath to come. The wrath of Almighty God is now undoubtedly hanging over a great part of this congregation. Let every one fly out of Sodom: &quot;Haste and escape for your lives, look not behind you, escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
