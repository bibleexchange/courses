<br>
PAS/T is a condition which can occur in both men and women after the abortion
experience, due to unresolved psychological, physical and spiritual aspects.
Family member can also be affected. Symptoms are similar to those in any post
traumatic stress disorder. Basically it is the personal struggle to work
through thoughts, feelings about the abortion and previous pregnancy, and the
goal to come to peace with those involved in the decision making process and
ultimate loss of life. Granted some men/women are better equipped to deal with
the aftermath of an abortion, but EVERYONE is changed by it! As one woman
quoted: &quot;Once I laid on that table, I was never the same!&quot;</span></p>

not appear all together. Nor will each woman/man possess all of them. If you
find that you experience between 5-7 of the following emotions, following an
abortion, you might consider seeking help for post abortion stress/trauma. Note
sometimes these symptoms happen immediately </span></p>

<h2>Methods of Abortions</h2>

<p><strong>RU486, Mifepristone: (Abortion Pill) </strong>- Within <em>4 to 7
weeks</em> after last menstrual period (LMP)<br>
<br>
This drug is only approved for use in women up to the 49th day after their last
menstrual period. The procedure usually requires three office visits. On the
first visit, the woman is given pills to cause the death of the embryo. Two
days later, if the abortion has not occurred, she is given a second drug which
causes cramps to expel the embryo. The last visit is a follow up ultrasound to
determine if the procedure has been completed.</p>

<p>RU486 will not work in the case of an ectopic pregnancy. This is a
potentially life-threatening condition in which the embryo lodges outside of
the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. If not diagnosed early, the tube may
burst, causing internal bleeding and in some cases, the death of the woman.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Vacuum Aspiration</strong>: up to <em>7 weeks</em> after LMP<br>
<br>
This surgical abortion is done early in the pregnancy up until 7 weeks after
the woman's last menstrual period. A long, thin tube is inserted into the
uterus. A large syringe is attached to the tube and the embryo is suctioned
out.</p>

<p><strong>Suction Curettage:</strong> between <em>6 to 14 weeks</em> after LMP<br>
<br>
This is the most common surgical abortion procedure. Because the baby is
larger, the doctor must first stretch open the cervix using metal rods. Opening
the cervix may be painful, so local or general anesthesia is typically needed.
After the cervix is stretched open, the doctor inserts a hard plastic tube into
the uterus, and then connects this tube to a suction machine. The suction pulls
the fetus' body apart and out of the uterus. The doctor may also use a
loop-shaped knife called a curette to scrape the fetus and fetal parts out of
the uterus. (The doctor may refer to the fetus and fetal parts as the products
of conception.).</p>

<p>Abortion is not just a simple procedure; it may have many side effects.
Abortion has been associated with preterm birth, emotional and psychological
impact, and spiritual consequences. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Prior
to the <i>Roe vs. Wade</i> Supreme Court decision of 1973, about 500,000
illegal abortions were occurring per year. By 1975, over 1,000,000 babies were
being aborted in the United States. Today, about 1,500,000 abortions occur each
year. That's over 4000 per day, and nearly three per minute!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Ninety-three
percent of the abortions in America are for convenience. The mother's health is
an issue only three percent of the time, and the baby's health is an issue only
three percent of the time. Rape or incest are issues only one percent of the
time. Ninety-three percent of all abortions in America are performed just
because someone doesn't want a child!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>There
are four basic types of abortion being performed in America today, while two
more types may be added in the near future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>First,
there's the <b><i>suction type </i></b>abortion. This is where the unborn child
is literally vacuumed from the mother's womb during the early stages of
pregnancy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>The
<b><i>currette-type</i></b> abortion is where the child is cut from the
mother's womb with a spoon-like object.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>A
third type is similar to a <b>Caesarean operation.</b> The baby is surgically
removed from the mother and allowed to suffocate, because the child's lungs
aren't developed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>The
fourth type of abortion is the <b><i>Salt Brine</i></b> technique. With this
method, the unborn child is literally &quot;pickled&quot; to death by the
injection of a strong salt solution. A few days after the injection the child is
still born.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>There
is currently much debate about <i>partial-birth</i> abortions. This is where a
child is partially delivered, then stabbed in the skull to have his or her
brains sucked out. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>There
is also much talk about the <i>RU-486</i> abortion pill from France, also
called &quot;mifepristione&quot; in America. This pill works by inhibiting
pregnancy hormones, and is normally used within seven weeks from conception. At
the present time, mifepristone is illegal in the U.S., but there is much
political pressure to make it legal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Abortion
Is An Act of Murder</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>In
reference to pregnant women, the term &quot;with child&quot; occurs twenty-six
times in the Bible. The term &quot;with fetus&quot; never occurs once. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>In
Luke chapter one, verses 36 and 41, we are told that Elisabeth conceived a
&quot;son&quot; and that the &quot;babe&quot; leaped in her womb. God does not
say that a &quot;fetus&quot; leaped in her womb! He says THE BABE leaped. This
is the exact same word that God uses to describe Christ in the manger AFTER He
is born (Luke 2:12, 16). In God eyes, an unborn babe and a newborn babe are the
same. They are both living human beings!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Dear
reader, please answer a question: <i>What is an &quot;infant?&quot;</i> Get the
answer in your mind and keep it there for a moment. Do you have it? Okay,
please consider Job 3:16: <i>&quot;Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not
been; as infants which never saw light.&quot; </i>Did you see that? Job
referred to unborn children as INFANTS. Not fetuses! Not masses of tissue!
INFANTS! In God's eyes, an unborn child is a living human baby. God never says
once that an unborn child is anything less than a human being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>David
said in Psalm 51:5, <i>&quot;Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did
my mother conceive me.&quot;</i> He did not say that a fetus was shapen in
iniquity and conceived in iniquity. David, speaking under the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit, said that HE was conceived. David, not a blob of tissue, was
conceived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>The
same is the case in Psalm 139:13-16:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:black'>&quot;For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
mother's womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was
not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the
lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being
unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Who
was in the womb? David! A literal and living person. The Bible never uses
anything less than human terms to describe the unborn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Notice
that in Jeremiah 1:5 we are told that God KNEW Jeremiah:<i>&quot;Before I
formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the
womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>To
further confirm the fact that God views the unborn child as a person, please
consider Exodus 21:22-23:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:black'>&quot;If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her
fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished,
according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the
judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
life,&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>If
the woman has a premature birth and the child lives (<i>&quot;no mischief
follows&quot;</i>), then there's no death penalty. However, if the child dies
(or the woman dies) God says the death penalty applies: <i>&quot;thou shalt
give life for life.&quot; </i>Why would God require the death penalty if He
didn't consider the unborn child to be a human being?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Friend,
like it or not, God says that life begins at conception, and the unborn child
is a human being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>But
the Bible isn't alone in declaring this truth. Science also declares that an
unborn child is just as much an independent human being as you. The original
human cell consists of 46 chromosomes, 23 from each parent. At no point during
pregnancy does the mother contribute any new cells to the child. The original
cell divides itself and multiplies to provide development and growth for the
child. Scientifically speaking, the child is just as independent at six months
before birth as he will be six months after birth.<i> </i>Yes, the mother does
provide nourishment to the unborn child, but she also provides nourishment to
the <i>newborn</i> child!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>At
two weeks pregnancy, the &quot;fetus&quot; can move alone. By four weeks the
child has limbs, muscle tissue, a heart and heartbeat. Ears, eyes, and small
hands are visible by the fifth week. The child responds to touch sensations by
the sixth or seventh week. At eight weeks, the baby sometimes tries to take a
breath when removed from the mother. At twelve weeks, the child will often
struggle for life two or three hours when removed from the mother. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Friend,
abortion is wrong because abortion is MURDER!</span></p>

convenience of abortion will only lead to an increase of other sins such as
adultery and fornication. Friend, abortion is wrong because abortion encourages
sin!</span></p>

style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Abortion
Shows A Lack of Faith</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Romans
14:23 says, <i>&quot;...for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&quot; </i>Hebrews
11:6 tells us that without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>To
have an abortion is to take matters into your own hands, rather than to trust
God to work things out. This shows a lack of faith in God, which the Bible
labels as SIN.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>A
desperate woman says, &quot;I can't afford to have a child. I'm not ready for
this.&quot; Lady, you need to start trusting God and claiming His promises. You
need to STOP trying to run your own life for a change and START trusting God.
You don't need an abortion, for such will only INCREASE your troubles. The
devil has you thinking that abortion is the answer, that it will take care of
everything, and you're very close to giving in to his subtle temptation. If you
do, you'll regret it forever, and God will hold you accountable! Why not turn
your life over to the Lord Jesus Christ right now? Why not make Him the Lord of
your life and trust Him to work things out for you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:red'>You Can Be
Saved Right Now!</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Jesus
Christ came into this world to lay down His sinless life for YOU--to pay for
your sins, because you couldn't. Jesus is your only hope for salvation. Only by
receiving Him as your Savior can you enter the gates of Heaven. There is no
other way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;Jesus
saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
Father but by me.&quot; (John 14:6)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;Neither
is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven
given among men, whereby we must be saved.&quot; (Acts 4:12)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The
Lord Jesus Christ has come and PAID for your sins by shedding His own Blood on
Calvary. By receiving Him as your Savior, you can be WASHED from all your sins
in His precious Blood (Rev. 1:5; Col. 1:14; Acts 20:28; I Pet. 1:18-19). Notice
these important words from Romans 5:8-9:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;But
God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ
died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
saved from wrath through him.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Jesus
PAID your way to Heaven for you! By receiving Him as your Savior, you will be
receiving God's ONLY means of Salvation for you. Are you willing to forsake
YOUR righteousness and receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, your ONLY HOPE for
Salvation? Romans 10:13 says<i>, &quot;Whosoever shall call upon the name of
the Lord shall be saved.&quot; </i>Romans 10:9 says,<i> &quot;That if thou
shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart
that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&quot; </i>Are you
willing to forsake your own righteousness, and trust Jesus Christ alone? He
will save you just as He promised. Why not receive Him today and trust Him to
give you a better way of life?</span></p>
