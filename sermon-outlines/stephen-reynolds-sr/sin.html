For example, let us compare Psalm 5l:5 with Job 1:21: &quot;Naked came I out of my mother&#39;s womb, and naked shall I return thither.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If Psalm 51:5 can be interpreted literally to teach the doctrine that David and all other men are born sinners, then Job 1:21 can also be interpreted literally to teach the doctrine that Job and all other men will go back into their mother&#39;s womb: &quot;Naked came I out of my mother&#39;s womb, and naked shall I return thither.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Neither Psalm 5l:5 nor Job 1:21 should be understood literally. Both texts are figurative expressions. The same rules of interpretation that would permit Psalm 51:5 to teach that little babies are born sinners, if they were also applied to Job 1:21 (or if they were applied to many other passages from the Bible), would permit every kind of perverted and absurd interpretation of the Word of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">David was not teaching in this passage that he was born a sinner (which would have been an </span><span class="csA657E9A2">excuse</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> for his sins in a Psalm which was clearly a Psalm of </span><span class="csA657E9A2">confession</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). On the contrary, he was confessing the great magnitude and guilt of the sin he had committed; and he broke out in the language of strong feeling and emotion--the language of figure and symbol--to express the </span><span class="csA657E9A2">monstrousness of his sin</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: &quot;Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Psalmist David uses figurative language throughout his Psalms; and he uses several figurative expressions in Psalm 51. Verses five, seven, and eight of Psalm 51 are all figurative expressions. So that if verse five can be used to teach the doctrine that babies are born sinners, then also verse seven can be used to teach the doctrine that hyssop cleanses us from sin:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.&quot; Psalm 51:7</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Also, verse eight can be used to teach the doctrine that God breaks the bones of the Christian when he sins, and that his broken bones rejoice when he is forgiven:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.&quot; Psalm 51:8</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And another Psalm, Psalm 58:3, can be used to teach the astonishing doctrine that all babies talk and tell lies from the very moment of their birth:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.&quot; Psalm 58:3</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But, who would teach from this last text the doctrine that babies really do speak as soon as they are born? None of these passages should be taken literally. They are all figurative expressions. If they were taken in their literal sense, they would all teach what we know to be contrary to reality and impossible: Men do not enter again into their mother&#39;s womb. Hyssop does not purify our sins. Babies do not start speaking as soon as they come out of the womb. And babies are not born sinners!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csA657E9A2">Second Proof-text Examined</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.

If it were literal, it would teach that babies speak and tell lies as soon as they are born, and that they alienate themselves from God and go astray from him immediately upon coming out of the womb.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But all of this is clearly contrary to reality. We know that babies do not do any of these things at birth. Therefore it is clear that this language is not to be understood literally. If this verse taught that Babies literally came forth from their mother&#39;s womb &quot;estranged from God,&quot; it would contradict other passages from the Bible that teach that babies are not &quot;estranged from God&quot; at birth. John the baptist was not &quot;estranged from God from his mother&#39;s womb.&quot; On the contrary, the angel who announced his birth said, &quot;He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even </span><span class="csA657E9A2">from his mother&#39;s womb.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; Luke 1:15. This fact is hard to reconcile with a literal interpretation of Psalms 51:5 and 58:3. Job also testified that he was a guide to the widow &quot;</span><span class="csA657E9A2">from his mother&#39;s womb</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; Job 31:18. Job obviously did not mean that from the moment he was a helpless newborn infant that he had been ministering to the needs of the widow. Also, the Psalmist David himself testified that God had been his help &quot;</span><span class="csA657E9A2">from the womb</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; Psalm 71:6. It is easy to see that the phrase &quot;from the womb&quot; is often used in a figurative sense and should not always be understood in its literal sense.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csA657E9A2">Third Proof-text Examined</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3.

This is clearly evident from its context. The context of Ephesians 2:3 shows that Paul was not speaking of the &quot;birth&quot; of children at all when he used the word &quot;nature.&quot; On the contrary, he used the word &quot;nature&quot; to describe the </span><span class="csA657E9A2">wicked character</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and the </span><span class="csA657E9A2">wicked works</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of men </span><span class="csA657E9A2">before they were converted</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For example, he calls the attention of the believers in Ephesians 2:1-2 to the fact that </span><span class="csA657E9A2">before their conversion</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> they had lived in trespasses and sins, and walked in every kind of wickedness, in company with other sinners: &quot;Ye were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein </span><span class="csA657E9A2">in time past </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.&quot; Then, he continues in verse three speaking of their participation with other sinners in carnality and wickedness: &quot;Among whom also we all had our conversation </span><span class="csA657E9A2">in time past</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and </span><span class="csA657E9A2">were by nature</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (were by our past wicked works) the children of wrath even as others.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It was only after he had described their past life of wicked works that he summed up the guilt and ill desert of their </span><span class="csA657E9A2">past life</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> with the words: &quot;And </span><span class="csA657E9A2">WERE by nature the children of wrath</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, even as others.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We know by the immediate context of this text (as well as the context of the whole Bible) that Ephesians 2:3 is not speaking of being born a sinner or being born under the wrath of God. The immediate context and the context of the whole Bible teaches us that we Christians &quot;</span><span class="csA657E9A2">were by nature</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; (were by our past wicked works) the children of wrath, just like the rest of the world that is still living in sin.&quot; Eph. 2:3</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The word &quot;nature&quot; in the Bible, when it refers to what we are by birth, never refers to a sinful nature. This is made manifest by Romans 2:14:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;The Gentiles, which have not the law, </span><span class="csA657E9A2">do by nature</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the things contained in the law.&quot; Romans 2:14</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now the word &quot;nature&quot; in the above text does refer to the nature that we receive at birth. But it is evident that the word &quot;nature&quot; here is </span><span class="csA657E9A2">not a sinful nature</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. For, how could a sinful nature cause us to do the things contained in the law? A sinful nature would not cause us to do the things contained in the law--a sinful nature would only cause us to do evil!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The word &quot;nature&quot; is used again in II Peter 1:4, and it is used just like it was used in Ephesians 2:3, speaking of character and life. We saw in Ephesians 2:3 that it spoke of the evil character or the wicked works of men; but we will see in II Peter 1:4 that it speaks of the good character and life of God--it speaks of the life and </span><span class="csA657E9A2">moral perfections</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of his divine being:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;That by these (promises) ye might be partakers of the </span><span class="csA657E9A2">divine nature</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; II Peter 1:4</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Men use Ephesians 2:3 to teach that the &quot;nature&quot; has to refer to being born a sinner. But we see in II Peter 1:4 that the word &quot;nature&quot; is not speaking of a birth at all. It is speaking of the life and moral character of God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible teaches us that the nature that God has given us is not a sinful nature. It is a good nature that teaches us the difference between good and evil, and a nature that urges us to obey the &quot;law of God written in our hearts.&quot; Also the Bible teaches us that all sin and wickedness is </span><span class="csA657E9A2">against the nature we are born with</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But </span><span class="csA657E9A2">if we were born with a sinful nature</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> not one sin would be against our nature but every sin would agree with and be in harmony with our nature. So the fact that all sin is against our nature proves that we are not born with a sinful nature.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We see, then, that Ephesians 2:3 does not teach that babies are born sinners, and condemned, and under the wrath of God. What it does teach is that all we Christians, who are presently saved from our sins by the marvelous grace of God, </span><span class="csA657E9A2">were before our salvation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, wicked, abandoned sinners, and dead in our trespasses and sins, and </span><span class="csA657E9A2">under the wrath of God for our sins</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, just like the rest of the world that still lives in sin and rebellion against God: &quot;And you hath he quickened, who </span><span class="csA657E9A2">were dead in trespasses and sins</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&hellip;we </span><span class="csA657E9A2">all had our conversation in time past</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; </span><span class="csA657E9A2">and were</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> by nature the children of wrath, </span><span class="csA657E9A2">even as others</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; Ephesians 1:1-3</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csA657E9A2">Fourth Proof-text Examined</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71">4.

For if the doctrine of original sin is true, Mary, the mother of our Lord Jesus was also born a sinner. And if Job 14:4 really does teach that a sinner must produce another sinner, there could be no way of escaping the blasphemous conclusion that our Lord also was born a sinner.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csA657E9A2">Fifth Proof-text Examined</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71">5.

So for the advocates of the doctrine of original sin to arbitrarily give to the phrases &quot;made sinners&quot; and &quot;came upon all men&quot; the meaning of </span><span class="csA657E9A2">physical force</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> when these phrases refer to Adam&#39;s sin, without giving the same meaning of </span><span class="csA657E9A2">physical force</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> when they refer to Christ&#39;s righteousness, is an example of a forced and inconsistent interpretation of this passage dictated by a prepossessed belief in the doctrine of original sin.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul does not affirm an involuntary, necessary, or irresistible connection between either the sin of Adam and mankind or the righteousness of Christ and mankind. Otherwise, Romans 5:18 would teach the universal salvation of mankind:</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;The free gift </span><span class="csA657E9A2">came upon all men</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> unto justification of life.&quot; Romans 5:18</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We know that universal salvation is not taught in the Bible. Men are not saved involuntarily, automatically, and necessarily because of the obedience of Christ. Nor are they &quot;made sinners&quot; involuntarily, automatically, and necessarily because of the transgression of Adam. But the context of Romans 5:12-21 (and the context of the whole Bible) shows that men are &quot;made sinners&quot; in the same way they are &quot;made righteous,&quot; that is, voluntarily or willingly.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul did not teach that men are &quot;</span><span class="csA657E9A2">made sinners</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; involuntarily, by an act of physical force; because he would have been teaching at the same time that all men are &quot;</span><span class="csA657E9A2">made righteous</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; involuntarily, by an act of physical force. In other words he would have been teaching that </span><span class="csA657E9A2">every human being upon the face of the earth is saved involuntarily and necessarily whether he believes the gospel of salvation or not!</span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;By the righteousness of one the free gift </span><span class="csA657E9A2">came upon all men</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> unto justification of life.&quot; Romans 5:18</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is true that Adam brought sin and death into this world by his transgression; but his sin and his death did not pass upon his descendants. The Bible (Romans 5:12) says that &quot;death passed upon all men, </span><span class="csA657E9A2">for that all have sinned</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; Men are sinners because </span><span class="csA657E9A2">they have sinned</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Sin is an individual, voluntary choice. No human being can sin for another human being. Adam did not sin and could not sin for anyone but himself.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The purpose of the Apostle Paul in this passage is to show that, although the transgression of Adam has been a powerful force to bring sin, death, and condemnation upon all men, the righteousness and obedience of Christ in his work of atonement for sinners has been </span><span class="csA657E9A2">much more powerful</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to bring grace, reconciliation, righteousness, and eternal life upon all men. (See the overall context in Romans 5:6-21). The following Scriptures show that no man can be guilty or condemned for the sin of Adam--Adam could sin only for himself:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;The </span><span class="csA657E9A2">soul that sinneth, it shall die</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.&quot; Ezekiel 18:20 </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: </span><span class="csA657E9A2">every man shall be put to death for his own sin</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; Deuteronomy 24:16</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but </span><span class="csA657E9A2">every man shall die for his own sin</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; II Chronicles 25:4</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;He shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.&quot; Ezekiel 18:17-18</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;The soul that sinneth, it shall die.&quot; Ezekiel 18:4</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;I will judge&hellip;everyone according to his ways, saith the Lord God.&quot; Ezekiel 18:30</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: </span><span class="csA657E9A2">Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">?&quot; Gen. 18:25</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
