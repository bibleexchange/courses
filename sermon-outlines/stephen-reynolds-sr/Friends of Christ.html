He was imprisoned, tortured, and kept in shackles. After the death of his first wife, Ann, to whom he was devoted, for several months he was so depressed that he sat daily beside her tomb. Three years later, he wrote: God is to me the Great Unknown. I believe in him, but I cannot find him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">But Adoniram&#39;s faith sustained him, and he threw himself into the tasks to which he believed God had called him. He worked feverishly on his translation of the Bible. The New Testament had now been printed, and he finished the Old Testament in early 1834.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">There were only twenty-five professing Christians in the country when he died, and there were not churches to speak of.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">At the 150th anniversary of the translation of the Bible into the Burmese language, Paul Borthwick was addressing a group that was celebrating Judson&#39;s work.

Judson.&quot; </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs6DA126DA">So Borthwick turned to his interpreter, a Burmese man named Matthew Hia Win, and asked him, &quot;Matthew, what do you know of this man?&quot; Matthew began to weep as he said,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">We know him&mdash;we know how he loved the Burmese people, how he suffered for the gospel because of us, out of love for us. He died a pauper, but left the Bible for us. When he died, there were few believers, but today there are over 600,000 of us, and every single one of us traces our spiritual heritage to one man: the Rev. Adoniram Judson.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">But Adoniram Judson never saw it!</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs6DA126DA">We are called to invest our lives in ministries for which we do not always see immediate fruit.
