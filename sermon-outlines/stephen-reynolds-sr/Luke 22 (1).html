The experience of being </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">separated from God</span><span class="csC05134DD"> upon the cross was too much to bear.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divine nature and will of Jesus is also clearly seen in this experience. Note the Lord&#39;s words: &quot;Let this cup pass from me: nevertheless....&quot; The first act, the first impulse and struggle of His will, had come from His flesh: to escape the cup of separation from God. But immediately, the second act, the second impulse and struggle of His will, came from His Godly nature: not to do as He willed, but as God willed.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Jesus&#39; surrender to do God&#39;s perfect will in the Garden of Gethsemane was critical.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in His surrender that He was made perfect and was able to stand before God as the Ideal, Perfect Man.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in His surrender to be the Ideal, Perfect Man that His righteousness was able to stand for every man.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in His surrender to be the Ideal, Perfect Man that He was able to bear the cup of God&#39;s wrath against sin </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">for every man</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in His surrender to be the Ideal, Perfect Man that His sacrifice and sufferings were able to stand for every man.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC05134DD">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

We can imagine the angel embracing His Lord, just holding Him ever so tightly, perhaps infusing strength into His being. The scene of our Lord being so weak that He had to be embraced and engulfed in the arms of an angel should break the believer&#39;s heart. Perhaps the angel wiped the perspiration and blood and tears off His brow. Whatever the scene, we need to see the awful weight and intensity of our Lord&#39;s agony.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prayed &quot;more earnestly,&quot; more intensely. The reason is seen in the Greek words for &quot;being in an agony&quot; (</span><span class="csF1BA8D25">genomenos en agōnia</span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup>&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="csC05134DD"><sup></sup></span><a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/book.asp?pub=0&amp;book=748&amp;tocpath=A\#88: Agony, Being In An; Being In; In Such"><span class="cs6C232F6B"><sup>PWS:&nbsp;88</sup></span></a><span class="csC05134DD">). The Greek (aorist participle) means Jesus experienced a growing agony. The weight upon Him was not only intense, it grew more and more intense. The pressure and sense of suffering became heavier and heavier. The picture is that of His becoming engrossed and embodied in agony. Thus, He prayed more and more earnestly. His prayer grew and increased in intensity even as His agony intensified.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sweat great drops of blood.

The disciples were weak, so weak in fact that they were of no help to Jesus as He faced the most severe crises of His life. Jesus had to face the cross knowing the terrible weakness of His own men. Note what happened.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus arose from prayer and went to the three who were supposed to be praying with Him. They were asleep. The companionship and spirit of prayer and comfort He had sought were not there. All were asleep. He had been left alone to wrestle with God by Himself.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus warned them of temptation. They had failed to pray for Him, but they must not fail to pray for themselves. Jesus said, &quot;Watch and pray.&quot; Both were important. </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">Watchfulness</span><span class="csC05134DD"> sees and </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">praying</span><span class="csC05134DD"> prepares.

They were sleeping because of the emotional strain and distress of the evening. As Luke says, they slept because of &quot;sorrow,&quot; that is, sadness (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lk+22%3A45"><span class="cs6C232F6B">Luke 22:45</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">). The evening had been shocking and taxing. They were weary, fatigued, and preoccupied. Concentration in prayer was difficult. They probably fought to stay awake and to pray for their Lord, but the importance of prayer and of spiritual dependancy upon God in facing trials had not yet been learned. They were making two mistakes common among believers.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were depending upon their own wisdom and strength instead of God&#39;s Spirit to fight whatever battles lay ahead.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were taking God&#39;s deliverance for granted instead of assuring themselves of His deliverance through the testimony of prayer. They believed Christ to be the Messiah; therefore, they believed that God was going to deliver them from the Romans no matter what. As carnal, fleshy men are apt to do, the disciples no doubt thought prayer mattered little. They were just presuming upon God, taking His deliverance for granted. What Jesus said was, &quot;Watch and pray, for only as you watch and pray can you keep from falling when the trial comes.&quot;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">A point needs to be noted here: watchfulness and prayer bear </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">testimony</span><span class="csC05134DD"> to God. When men watch and pray, they demonstrate that dependency and trust in God are well founded. When God answers the prayers of men, He demonstrates that He loves and delivers those who truly look up to Him. Without watching and praying, God allows the disciples to fall in order to teach that dependency and trust in Him are absolutely essential.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were failing to stay awake to pray, to watch and be watchful in prayer.
