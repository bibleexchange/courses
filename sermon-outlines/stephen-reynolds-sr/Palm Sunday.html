The blue is the color of heaven, and it suggests to us, surely, that Jesus was the Son of God, the One who came from heaven itself. The scarlet reminds us that He was the Son of Man, the last Adam, for the very name </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adam</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> simply means &quot;red.&quot; But what about the purple? If we take a measure of the blue dye and an equal measure of the red, then pour the one into the other and mix the two so that it is impossible to tell where the one ends and other begins, that&#39;s the purple. In the person of the Lord Jesus, deity is perfectly blended with humanity, and humanity is perfectly blended with deity so that it is impossible to tell where the one ends and the other begins.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Take, for instance, the Lord&#39;s meeting with the woman at the well. &quot;Give me to drink&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+4%3A7"><span class="cs92015F65">John 4:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), He said. That was His humanity. He was thirsty. But a moment later He was confronting her with details about her life that as a mere man He could not possible know. That was His deity. Where does the one end and the other begin? We can never say.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Think, too, of when He slept in Simon Peter&#39;s boat. That was a demonstration of His humanity: the Lord Jesus asleep. A storm came, and the boat was filled with water so that the frightened disciples awoke Him in direst alarm. He arose and spoke to the heaving waves and howling winds. &quot;Be still!&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Mk+4%3A39"><span class="cs92015F65">Mark 4:39</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), He said, and at once there was a great calm. That was His deity. Where does the humanity end and the deity begin? It is impossible to say. The two are perfectly blended into one.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The veil, then, spoke of the incarnate Christ. But that veil separated men&mdash;even good, consecrated men&mdash;from God. It was a barrier to shut men out from the Holy of Holies. And is not that exactly what the life of Jesus does? His life is so perfect, so spotless, so free from taint and sin that it forms an impassable barrier. We run into it the moment we seek to approach God on our own. God says, &quot;I demand absolute perfection. I demand a life just like the one lived by the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; But that is more than we can ever produce, so His life, as lived on earth, is an impossible bar to God&#39;s presence.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Except for one thing. The veil was rent. When, as the Lord Jesus hung upon the cross of Calvary, the soldier took the spear and rent His side, God reached down from heaven and with His own hand rent the Temple veil.</span></p></body>
