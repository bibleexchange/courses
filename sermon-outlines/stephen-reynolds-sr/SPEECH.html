Thus through marriage, Tobiah had both family and friends working in the crews employed by Nehemiah to rebuild the city. In addition to this fact, Tobiah was closely related to the High Priest Eliashib (<a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ne+13%3A4-7"><span class="csDA02FF29">13:4-7</span></a></span><span class="csA7555675">). These officials, Sanballat and Tobiah, served under the authority of King Artaxerxes. In view of this, they had to be very careful in opposing or plotting against Nehemiah, for their very livelihood or political positions were dependent upon the favor of the king. They were disturbed over Nehemiah&rsquo;s mission to rebuild Jerusalem and its walls. Obviously, they feared Nehemiah politically, they feared to lose power, authority and influence over the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csC57700C4">Nehemiah </span><span class="cs79659084">praying</span><span class="csC57700C4"> and </span><span class="cs79659084">obeying</span><span class="csC57700C4"> was a threat to them. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Samuel (Kaboo) Morris</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (1873 - May 12, 1893) was a <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia" title="Liberia"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Liberian</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> prince who converted to <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Christianity</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> around the age of 14. Around age 18, he left Liberia for the United States to achieve an education and arrived at <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_University" title="Taylor University"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Taylor University</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in December 1891. He died in 1893 from complications of a respiratory infection.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Morris&#39;s life has been the subject of five novels, over a dozen biographies, a 1954 film, and a 1988 documentary. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Taylor University has named numerous buildings, scholarships, and a society in his honor. His story helped to inspire other people to go to Africa to preach the gospel.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Samuel (Kaboo) Morris was known as the boy who God used through praying to empower </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Taylor University to reach out to the world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the most amazing stories from Samuel Morris&#39;s life is his escape from the Grebos; another tribe in the interior of Liberia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tribe (the Kru) was attacked by the Grebos one day and Kaboo (his name was changed to Samuel Morris later) was captured. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He was used as a &quot;pawn&quot;, meaning the Kru would have to bring the Grebos a present each month if they wanted to see their prince again. His father, the chief, came each time but what he brought was never enough. Kaboo was beaten badly with poisonous thorns that made his back burn.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">His father, the chief brought his daughter to trade in place of Kaboo and Kaboo refused to put his sister through this torture. Finally the Kru could bring no more and Kaboo was beaten every day. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Grebo chief would send another one of their slaves to the Kru village once in a while to tell them what he saw. Kaboo realized that he would die if this continued, and that the Grebos already had a cruel fate planned for him. He would be buried up to his neck with honey on his face, then driver ants would eat his flesh. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One night, though, there was a flash of light and a voice telling Kaboo to flee. His ropes fell off and his sick body gained strength.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;He ran off into the jungle, where he traveled for days living off such things as snails and mangos until he came to a coffee plantation owned by a former slave. The slave had come to Liberia and was a Christian. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Kaboo worked there with another boy from his village before coming to America. His motivation to come to America was learning more about God and the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the missionaries there told him all she knew. Sammy asked who it was that taught her. She told him it was a man in New York named Stephen Merrit. He decided he would go to New York to find this man. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As he walked to the shore he prayed that there would be a boat there that could take him. There was a ship there called a tramp ship. The crew of this ship made money by trading. It was very profitable for them because natives often sold goods for useless trinkets. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God told Sammy that the captain would take him to America. When Sammy asked the captain if he would take him to America he refused many times, Kaboo would lay in the spot that the little boat made in the sand and pray until they would return, the little boat was used to get to land for the big ship was 350 feet long.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Later, when two of his crew members ran off leaving the captain short-handed, he accepted Sammy onboard taking him for an unemployed sailor. When he arrived on the ship, he was disliked and abused, but by the time the ship reached America, villians that had mistreated him were saved and they were all praying and singing hymns. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God used Samuel to lead the crew to Christ. Later the Captain of the crew returned to America to see Samuel to find out he had passed away already. He confirmed his testimony of salvation.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Samuel in America</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In America, Samuel found Stephen Merritt. Mr. Merritt had to attend a prayer meeting that night so he asked Samuel to wait for him at his mission. When Mr. Merritt came back, he found Samuel in a prayer meeting of his own with the people of the mission. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">On his first night in America, he had led nearly twenty men to Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Impressed by Samuel&rsquo;s anointing and confidence, Mr. Merritt invited Samuel to stay at his house, much to his wife&rsquo;s dismay. However, in time, Samuel won her over, as well. Not only did Samuel win over Ms. Merritt, he also won over the people at Mr. Merritt&rsquo;s church. In a time when racism was commonplace, these men were colorblind. They saw that God was working in Samuel and created the Samuel Morris Missionary Society to collect money to send Samuel to college at Taylor University in Indiana so he could advance his knowledge of God and the Bible.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">While at Taylor University, Samuel was used by God mightily to draw people to the Lord. Students would stop by his dorm room to pray with him. People from around the world would come to hear him speak and to have him pray for them. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He was known (and heard) to spend hours in prayer with God, from late at night to early in the morning. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He inspired others to look at their relationship with God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Newspapers printed stories of the boy from Africa who was charging Fort Wayne with the electric power of God. He was an active member of Berry Street Methodist Episcopal Church and regularly attended East Wayne Street Methodist Episcopal Church.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It was his desire to be educated in the Word of God so he could go back to his homeland of Liberia and teach Jesus to the people there. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">However, that was not God&rsquo;s plan for his life. Late in 1892, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Samuel came down with an illness(Pneumonia) that he could not shake. Though he&rsquo;d been sick before and prayed to the Lord for healing and received it, this time the illness wouldn&rsquo;t leave. In time, God explained to Samuel why his illness hadn&rsquo;t left him. He told him that his work on earth was done and that it was time for him to come home. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Samuel related this to his fellow students, they would ask about his dream of returning home to preach the Gospel. Samuel is reported to have said, &ldquo;It is not my work, Dr. Reade. It is His. I have finished my job. He will send others better than I to do the work in Africa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">On May 12, 1893, at approximately 20 years of age, Samuel Morris, aka Prince Kaboo, died. Fellow students served as pallbearers at his funeral. After his funeral, many of them said they felt led to go to Africa to be missionaries in Samuel&rsquo;s place, fulfilling Samuel&rsquo;s prophecy.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Samuel Kaboo Morris was a servant that led people to the Lord through Prayer.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At first only three missionaries, but then twelve, then more and the number has never stopped, how about you praying?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Though it was the custom in those days to bury blacks in the Negro section of the cemetery, Samuel&rsquo;s body was later moved to the center of the cemetery, linking blacks and whites in death like he did in life. A memorial is placed at his gravesite that reads:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Samuel Morris</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1873-1893</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Prince Kaboo</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Native of West Africa</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Famous Christian Mystic</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Apostle of Simple Faith</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Exponent of the Spirit-filled life</span></p></body>
