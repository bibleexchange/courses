How dangerous is it for us to desire to be at our own disposal, to live in a state of independency, and to be our own governors! God cannot give to wretched man a greater proof of his wrath than to abandon him to the corruption of his own heart.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The first degree of his misery is, that he loses sight of God, and removes at a distance from him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The second degree of a sinner&#39;s misery is, that the love of God being no longer retained in the heart, carnal love and impure desires necessarily enter in, reign there, and corrupt all his actions. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The third degree is, that he squanders away all spiritual riches, and wastes the substance of his gracious Father in riot and debauch.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The fourth degree of an apostate sinner&#39;s misery is, that having forsaken God, and lost his grace and love, he can now find nothing but poverty, misery, and want. How empty is that soul which God does not fill! What a famine is there in that heart which is no longer nourished by the bread of life! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The fifth degree of a sinner&#39;s misery is, that he renders himself a slave to the devil, is made partaker of his nature, and incorporated into the infernal family. The farther a sinner goes from God, the nearer he comes to eternal ruin. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The sixth degree of his misery is, that he soon finds by experience the hardship and rigour of his slavery. There is no master so cruel as the devil; no yoke so heavy as that of sin; and no slavery so mean and vile as for a man to be the drudge of his own carnal, shameful, and brutish passions. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The seventh degree of a sinner&#39;s misery is, that he has an insatiable hunger and thirst after happiness; and as this can be had only in God, and he seeks it in the creature, his misery must be extreme. He desired to fill his belly with the husks, Lu 15:16. The pleasures of sense and appetite are the pleasures of swine, and to such creatures is he resembled who has frequent recourse to them, 2Pe 2:22.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The first is, he begins to know and feel his misery, the guilt of his conscience, and the corruption of his heart. He comes to &nbsp;himself, because the Spirit of God first comes to him, Lu 15:17. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The second is, that he resolves to forsake sin and all the occasions of it; and firmly purposes in his soul to return immediately to his God. I will arise, &amp;c., Lu 15:18. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The third is, when, under the influence of the spirit of faith, he is enabled to look towards God as a compassionate and tender-hearted father.

And he arose and came, &amp;c., Lu 15:20. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The seventh is, God tenderly receives him with the kiss of peace and love, blots out all his sins, and restores him to, and reinstates him in, the heavenly family. His father-fell on his neck, and kissed him, Lu 15:20. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The eighth is, his being clothed with holiness, united to God, married as it were to Christ Jesus, 2Co 11:2, and having his feet shod with the shoes of the preparation of the Gospel of peace, Eph 6:15, so that he may run the ways of God&#39;s commandments with alacrity and joy. Bring the best robe-put a ring-and shoes, &amp;c., Lu 15:22. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">III. The consequences of the sinner&#39;s restoration to the favour and image of God are, </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA521DC07">first, the sacrifice of thanksgiving is offered to God in his behalf; he enters into a covenant with his Maker, and feasts on the fatness of the house of the Most High. <br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp; Secondly, The whole heavenly family are called upon to share in the general joy; in heaven above and the Church below both triumph; for there is joy (peculiar joy) in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. See Lu 15:10. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp; Thirdly, God publicly acknowledges him for his son, not only by enabling him to abstain from every appearance of evil, but to walk before him in newness of life, Lu 15:24. The tender-hearted father repeats these words at Lu 15:32, to show more particularly that the soul is dead when separated from God; and that it can only be said to be alive when united to him through the Son of his love. A Christian&#39;s sin is a brother&#39;s death; and in proportion to our concern for this will our joy be at his restoration to spiritual life. Let us have a brotherly heart towards our brethren, as God has that of a father towards his children, and seems to be afflicted at their loss, and to rejoice at their being found again, as if they were necessary to his happiness.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Lu 15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
