He asked Pastor Powers if he would come to Tanzania to meet his uncle. </span></p><p class="csC38C7789"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After arriving in Tanzania and being introduced to Pastor Kombi he told him that he had been praying for over twenty years for God to send him a friend from America - and that Pastor Powers was that friend....</span></p><p class="csC38C7789"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Since that time, many wonderful and miraculous things have happened in Tanzania. We have been able to build Bro. Kombi a new church, replacing the tin shack that he had been using. We have also been able to bring fresh water to his village for the first time, assist in completing other churches and have opened Safe Haven Orphanage in Moshi.</span></p><p class="csC38C7789"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In 2007 at our annual campmeeting enough funds were raised to purchase a new pickup truck for Bro. Jonas so that he can better reach people in the countryside and two pastors will be able to have new churches built.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="csC38C7789"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Pastor Powers will be traveling to Tanzania in November to oversee the beginning of the construction of the first new church for Pastor Samson.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs31B015EA">New Water Systems for Villages</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">In the village where Pastor Kombi lives, near the base of Mt. Kilimangaro, there was no fresh water. People walked for long distances to the river to bring back dirty water to use for cooking and drinking. Many years earlier the government had built a reservoir on the mountain and others had tapped into it to bring fresh water from the melting snow to their villages. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">Pastor Powers had made contact with a man who knew how to get access to the reservoir and what to do to get the proper equipment in place. Our church, along with many others, raised enough money to purchase a pump and to build a reservoir and gravity tank in Bro. Kombi&acute;s village. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">People there now have plenty of fresh water for drinking and cooking and washing. During the night, the melting water flows from the mountain through the new pipes and into their in-ground reservoir. The pump fills the gravity tank so that they will have water pressure in the church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
