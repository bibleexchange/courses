<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>TEXT: I John 2:1-3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>He has a burden fro these people
like he would a little child. Here it is considered an honor to be considered a
child of the apostle John. John is not in any measure putting them down, or
putting them in some level that is below him. “you are down here and I am up
here.” He is recognizing that there is power and authority in his life so that
he would be able to help somebody. These are words of encouragement ad
challenge, and not a put down to distress or discourage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I would be a fool to take upon
myself the credit for the respect given to me by people. The glory and honor
goes to God, our part is to act as faithful stewards of the trust and respect
God has blessed us with. The POWER IS WITH GOD!!! There is power and authority
from the Word of God that helps us to meet the challenge. “MY little children
these things I write unto thee that ye sin not.’ “That ye commit no ‘no, no’s.’
God wants to help us but we must learn how to let Him. The Word of God and the
Christian life is a paradox to the carnal mind. God will give you wisdom and
insight to understand His word. His word is not hard to understand in a
Christian Experience as you obey. There is a source and strength in God that we
do not have to sin. You are human; you must recognize the dangers of sin. They
teach, “You are human you have to sin a little everyday.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>APPLY the Word to my life. We don’t
want death; we want life. The law itself cannot change us. Grace is the means
to save us, transform us, and make like His Son. Obey want you do know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We are going to use the phrase KNOW
KNOW. Know what you know. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Your flesh will never subject
itself to the truth in pure motive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I John 2:3 KNOW that we KNOW. Not
just knowledge in our mind. How do we know that we know? IF WE KEEP HIS
COMMANDMENTS. Keeping His commandments is going to help us KNOW Him, and know
that we know. Philippians 3:10. </p>
