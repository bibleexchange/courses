As the last judgments, they will be concluded by the personal return of the Lord Jesus and His personal defeat of the enemies of God and His people.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;For in them </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">is filled up</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the wrath of God.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Is filled up.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;The wrath of God.&rdquo; qumos, &ldquo;wrath,&rdquo; which points to the expression of God&rsquo;s anger or God&rsquo;s holiness in action or His wrath overflowing in indignation.

It will purge out the rebels and cause the rest to turn to Christ (Ezek. 20:33-44; Zech. 14:9-10).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(2) The Tribulation will bring God&rsquo;s judgment on the Gentiles for anti-Semitism.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> It will be a strong source of motivation for men to repent and turn to faith in Christ, and judge the rest for their unbelief and rebellion.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(3) As to Satan the Tribulation is to demonstrate the true character and program of Satan as the source of sin, misery, war and murder.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(4) It will demonstrate to mankind as a whole (Jew and Gentile) the true rebellion and spiritually corrupt nature of man and the depths to which he will go when given the chance.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The restraint of the Holy Spirit who is at work today through the church, the body of Christ, will have been completely removed. The Tribulation, without this special restraint, will be a time of unprecedented lawlessness and unrighteousness, which will demonstrate the failure of man and how desperately he needs the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(5) As to God and Christ it will demonstrate their absolute holiness, grace, faithfulness to their promises, and that God is still on the throne and He is just in his decisions against Satan and unbelieving man.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So these last seven plagues will complete these purposes as well as bring an end to the judgments (16:9-11, 13-14, 21). </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because of the reference to the beast and his work which sets the context, these are clearly the martyred dead of the Tribulation.

Ek means &ldquo;out of, from, away from.&rdquo; It is used to introduce the person, place, or thing from which a separation takes place. Here, nikaw carries the idea of deliverance. Because of their victory in Christ, they were delivered - &ldquo;gotten the victory over the beast, (The Beast refers to the Antichrist and his political system). and over his image, (The image of the Beast refers to </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">religious</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> pressure to reject Christ, brought about by the False Prophet). &nbsp;and over his mark, and over the number of his name (Finally, the number of his name refers to </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">economic</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> pressure to reject Christ) The four-fold repetition emphasizes the element of victory and deliverance. These believers will find themselves living in the sphere of the beast&rsquo;s power and under great pressure to worship him, his image, and to wear his mark and the number of his name even to the point of death for refusing to obey. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These saints are victors literally &ldquo;from&rdquo; him (14:13). The Greek preposition </span><span class="csC382D2BB">ek</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is used four times in 15:2.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">5 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the first section we saw the saints in glory, praising God and fully understanding the cause of wrath,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Re 15:1 &ldquo;And I saw&rdquo; - eidw &nbsp;eido, &nbsp;i&#39;-do &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re 15:2 &ldquo;And I saw&rdquo; - eidw &nbsp;eido, &nbsp;i&#39;-do</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Saw, I Know, I understand</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But here the emphasis is on the divine side which emphatically and impressively stresses the source and cause of what is about to happen. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So literally John says, Re 15:5 &ldquo;And after that I looked, and, behold&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(After these things I saw and understood) &ndash; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more continued inspection</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;I saw&rdquo; occurs two times (vss. 1, 2). The verb is eidw &nbsp;eido, &nbsp;i&#39;-do, &ldquo;to see, know and understand.&rdquo; John not only saw this with his eyes, but he spiritually grasped the meaning of this vision (as should we).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;The temple.&rdquo; is naos, which refers to the Holy of Holies. The design was given to Israel in Exodus. The earthy tabernacle with the naos as a picture and type of the heavenly place (Isa. 6:2). Today the believer&rsquo;s body is called the naos (1 Cor. 6:19) because God the Holy Spirit Himself dwells within every Holy Ghost filled believer. Within the earthly counterpart of the Holy of Holies was the ark over which the shekinah glory, representing God&rsquo;s presence, hovered. Naos stands for the very abode of God and His personal presence.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony&rdquo; Literally, &ldquo;the tabernacle, the one of witness.&rdquo; The whole tabernacle was a testimony and witness to the grace plan of God in Jesus Christ. However, of special importance here is the witness of the Ark of the Covenant, which was within the naos.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Re 11:19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Re 15:5 &para; And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1) The ark stood for the divine presence of God. It is here the glory of God&rsquo;s presence hovered over the mercy seat of the ark.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(2) By its contents, the ark stood for God&rsquo;s faithfulness. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It contained: (a) the law or the tables of stone, which represented the whole law and guided the people as a way of life and pointed them to Christ; (b) Aaron&rsquo;s rod that budded, which portrayed resurrection, spiritual growth to be supernatural and God&rsquo;s choice of leaders; (c) the pot of manna, which portrayed divine revelation of the person of Christ and God&rsquo;s daily provision, but it also taught them happiness comes only from the Lord and not the details of life (Deut. 8:3; Matt. 4:4).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(3) The ark stood for God&rsquo;s holiness, grace, and love through the tables of stone within, to the cherubim above and on either side of the top of the ark, and by the mercy seat, which formed a lid for the ark. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The tables of stone declared the perfect holiness of God and demonstrated the sinfulness of man since no man is able to keep the law. The law declared man a sinner and cut off from God. The sprinkling of blood by the high priest on the mercy seat (under or in front of the cherubim) showed that God&rsquo;s holiness could only be satisfied by the shedding of blood. This foreshadowed the person and work of Christ on the cross as did the whole ritual of the tabernacle,</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">priesthood, and the sacrifices (Acts 7:44; Ex. 32:15; 38:21; Numb. 1:50, 53; 17:7-10; Ex. 16:33; Heb. 9:1-5).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John saw that the temple in heaven &ldquo;was opened.&rdquo; In front of the Holy of Holies was a large curtain, a veil, which separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. The high priest could only go into the Holy of Holies only once a year and then only after proper sacrifices. He went in with blood to sprinkle over the mercy seat signifying the way into God&rsquo;s presence was not yet open (Heb. 9:7-8). When Christ died on the cross one of the things accomplished was the tearing of that veil in the temple from top to bottom, signifying the way had been opened and the work complete (Mark 15:38). It signified the barrier, those things that separate man from God, had been removed&mdash;sin, the penalty of sin or death, and man&rsquo;s absence of spiritual life and righteousness.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Today man can have access into the very presence of God through the person and work of Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:4-6, 11-18; 3:12). However, today and also in the Tribulation, Jesus Christ now forms a new barrier, a new veil, one that excludes from God&rsquo;s presence all who reject Christ (John 14:6; 3:3, 16). Upon these, the judgment of God must fall because of their failure to trust in Christ (John 3:13, 36).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This opening of the temple (naos) symbolizes the parting</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">of the veil, but in reverse order. Here, rather than access to God, it symbolizes the outpouring of God&rsquo;s perfect justice and wrath for rejection of Christ. Here the veil is pulled back, not to let man in, but to pour out God&rsquo;s justice. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;And the seven angels &hellip; came out of the temple.&rdquo; As the ministers and agents of God&rsquo;s holy justice, these angels proceed from the presence of God acting on behalf of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and justice. That they are &ldquo;clothed in pure white linen&rdquo; refers to the nature of their commission as representatives of God&rsquo;s holiness. Pure white portrays righteousness and reminds us of the truth of 1 John 1:5, &ldquo;God is light and in Him is not darkness at all.&rdquo; &ldquo;Linen,&rdquo; as in the garment of the wife of the Lamb (19:8), symbolizes righteousness in action. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They have been clothed with linen as a symbol of their commission and work in the outpouring of the righteous acts of judgment.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;And having their breasts girded with golden girdles&rdquo; is also symbolical. Gold stands for diety (the divine nature) the glory of God and girding was an act of preparation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What they are seen doing here is introductory for bringing maximum glory to God and will cause all creatures to fall on their knees and acknowledge the sovereignty and perfect holiness of God. </span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csBCE67FA3"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Seven Golden Bowls Given to the Angels </span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The &ldquo;four living creatures&rdquo; are Christ like believers who manifest certain aspects of God&rsquo;s glory and essence, especially His holiness. They are seen here engaged in this role by distributing the bowls to the seven angels. Previously these seven angels were given the responsibility for these last plagues.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;The giving of the seven bowls sets forth their authorization to use the plagues and describes the overall nature of the plagues, they are like a bowl which is overturned causing the contents to be poured out all at once or suddenly.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Full of the wrath of God.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;full&rdquo; is a descriptive participle from the Greek verb gemw, which means &ldquo;be full to the brim.&rdquo; Verse 1 teaches us the seven last plagues complete the judgments of the Tribulation. There we have telew, &ldquo;to complete, fulfill.&rdquo; Here in verse 7 the verb gemw, &ldquo;be full,&rdquo; adds to this emphasis and stresses the full devastating character of each bowl.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Wrath&rdquo; is again thumos which refers to God&rsquo;s divine justice and anger in action.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Who lives for ever and ever.&rdquo; Literally the Greek reads, &ldquo;of the wrath, the one of God, the One who lives unto the ages of ages (eternally).&rdquo; This is a solemn reminder that God, as the eternal One, is first a long-suffering God. For centuries God has withheld his judgment in grace (2 Pet. 3:8-9). At some point, not only will God&rsquo;s period of grace be over, but once God pours out His justice in divine wrath it will have eternal ramifications. Through the Lord Jesus Christ man has the opportunity and the means to come to God and be with Him eternally, but if he rejects God&rsquo;s grace in Jesus Christ, he must eternally face God&rsquo;s wrath (14:11).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;And the temple was filled with smoke.&rdquo; The &ldquo;temple&rdquo; of course is the heavenly temple, the very abode of God, the Holy of Holies of God&rsquo;s presence.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Was filled&rdquo; is a causative verb which means to &ldquo;cause to be full.&rdquo; It is the perfect holiness of God&rsquo;s divine essence that causes the temple to be filled with smoke. As the setting in Isaiah 6:3-4 shows us, the smoke represents the holiness of God; here it is acting in divine justice against sin. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Re 15:8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

					<li class="cs408F9A1C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Glory&rdquo; stands for God&rsquo;s divine essence and particularly God&rsquo;s righteousness and justice. </span></li><li class="cs408F9A1C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Together they form the holiness of God.</span></li></ol>
				</li><li class="csC1896D38"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;And from his power.&rdquo; </span><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
					<li class="cs408F9A1C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This refers to God&rsquo;s sovereign omnipotence, His inherent and sovereign power to execute and carry out the demands of His holy character.</span></li></ol>
				</li></ol>
			</li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;And no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues &hellip; &ldquo;were fulfilled&rdquo; (finished).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The smoke, which points to the awesome holiness of God, will make access into the presence of God impossible. This strongly stresses the principle of Habakkuk 1:13, &ldquo;Your eyes are too pure to approve evil and You cannot not look on wickedness with favor &hellip;&rdquo; It also reminds us of Romans 3:23, &ldquo;all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.&rdquo; The smoke illustrates the truth of God&rsquo;s righteousness; He is unable and unwilling to have fellowship with sin. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;smoke&hellip;till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This smoke continues until the plagues are finished, until God&rsquo;s holy character is satisfied and God deals with sin. This teaches us that God will so completely turn to anger and justice in these final moments that all else seems to cease. Absolute and undiluted wrath will be the business of these final days. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Re 15:4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It will be as the Psalmist says in Ps 76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This chapter has prepared the way for the judgments to follow as cause and effect or root to fruit. The judgments of chapter 16 stem from the ineffable holiness of God. &ldquo;It is an ominous sign of impending doom for those who persist in their blasphemous disregard of the sovereignty and holiness of God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These &ldquo;seven plagues&rdquo;complete or finish God&rsquo;s wrath (15:1-19:5). The verb &ldquo;finished&rdquo; means &ldquo;reaches its goal&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;comes to an end.&rdquo; Other expressions of God&rsquo;s wrath come later (20:10). During the tribulation period, the judgments (the seals, trumpets, and bowls) are progressive, each worse than the last. However, these last seven judgments, the bowl judgments, are in a category of their very own. They represent God&rsquo;s final response to the world&rsquo;s unrepentant wickedness.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC7571D80">Ps. 98:1 O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things.&quot; We had a new song before (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Psalm 96:1-13</span><span class="csC7571D80">) because the Lord was coming, but now we have another new song because he has come, and seen and conquered. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC7571D80">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC7571D80">Jesus, our King, has lived a marvellous life, died a marvellous death, risen by a marvellous resurrection, and ascended marvellously into heaven. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC7571D80">By His divine power He has sent forth the Holy Spirit doing marvels, and by His Power, His disciples have also wrought marvellous things and astonished all the earth.

This great deliverance under Moses was a foreshadowing of the great deliverance that was accomplished by the true Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, whose blood must be applied by faith, to the heart of every man and woman who desires to be spared the wrath of God and delivered from His enemies.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is the song of the Lamb? The Song of the Lamb emphasizes the redemptive work and plan of God in Christ and His promise of deliverance through Christ&rsquo;s shed blood on the cross (5:9-10).
