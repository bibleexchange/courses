The arrival of the young Anglican preacher <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield" title="George Whitefield"><span class="cs92015F65">George Whitefield</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> probably sparked the religious conflagration. Whitefield, whose reputation as a great pulpit and open-air orator had preceded his visit, traveled through the colonies in 1739 and 1740. Everywhere he attracted large and emotional crowds, eliciting countless conversions as well as considerable controversy. Critics condemned his &quot;enthusiasm&quot;, his censoriousness, and his extemporaneous and itinerant preaching. A famous literary example of the new style of preaching can be found in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)" title="Jonathan Edwards (theologian)"><span class="cs92015F65">Jonathan Edwards</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&#39; sermon <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God" title="Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"><span class="cs92015F65">Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. His techniques were copied by numerous imitators both lay and clerical. They became itinerant preachers themselves, spreading the Great Awakening from New England to Georgia, among rich and poor, educated and illiterate, and in the back-country as well as in seaboard towns and cities.

Franklin printed Whitefield&rsquo;s sermons on the front page of his Gazette, devoting 45 issues to Whitefield&#39;s activities. Franklin used the power of his press to spread Whitefield&#39;s fame by publishing all of Whitefield&rsquo;s sermons and journals.

The camp meeting was a religious service of several days&#39; length with multiple preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas looked to gathering at the camp meeting as a refuge from the lonely life on the frontier. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events. The revivals followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis of the individual&#39;s sins and need to turn to Christ, restored by a sense of personal salvation. Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the early camp meetings took place in July 1800 at <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasper_River" title="Gasper River"><span class="cs92015F65">Gasper River</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Church in southwestern Kentucky.

In this work, he also states that salvation depends on a person&#39;s will to repent and not forced by God on people against their will.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grandison_Finney#cite_note-12"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>[13]</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> However, Finney affirmed salvation by grace through faith alone, not by works or by obedience.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grandison_Finney#cite_note-13"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>[14]</sup></span></a></span><span class="cs92015F65"><sup></sup></span><a class="cs92015F65" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grandison_Finney#cite_note-14"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>[15]</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Finney also affirmed that works were the evidence of faith.

Finney draws support for this position from Peter&#39;s treatment of the baptized Simon (see <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=8&amp;src=NIV" title="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=8&amp;src=NIV"><span class="cs92015F65">Acts 8</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) and Paul&#39;s instruction of discipline to the Corinthian church (see <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=1%20Corinthians&amp;verse=5&amp;src=NIV" title="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=1%20Corinthians&amp;verse=5&amp;src=NIV"><span class="cs92015F65">1&nbsp;Corinthians 5</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). This type of teaching underscores the strong emphasis on personal holiness found in Finney&#39;s writings.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Finney&#39;s understanding of the atonement was that it satisfied &quot;public justice&quot; and that it opened up the way for God to pardon people of their sin. This was the so-called <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Divinity" title="New Divinity"><span class="cs92015F65">New Divinity</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> which was popular at that time period. In this view, Christ&#39;s death satisfied public justice rather than retributive justice. As Finney put it, it was not a &quot;commercial transaction.&quot; This view of the atonement, typically known as the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonement_(Governmental_view)" title="Atonement (Governmental view)"><span class="cs92015F65">governmental view</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> or moral government view, differs from the Calvinistic view, known as the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonement_(satisfaction_view)" title="Atonement (satisfaction view)"><span class="cs92015F65">satisfaction view</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> where Jesus&#39; sufferings equal the amount of suffering that Christians would experience in hell. The governmental view doesn&#39;t see the atonement as &quot;paying&quot; off a debt people owe, but rather as making it possible for sinners to be pardoned without weakening the effect of the Law of God against sin. The forgiveness of sins, or mercy, is when God sets aside the execution of the penalty of the law. Since the blood atonement of Jesus Christ substitutes the eternal punishment of sinners, God is able to set aside their punishment. The atonement did not satisfy God&#39;s wrath, rather, the atonement was a governmental condition in order for God to turn from His wrath without weakening His law in His universe. If the atonement satisfied God&#39;s wrath, sinners would be born saved and they would not be under God&#39;s wrath prior to conversion. But if the atonement was a necessary condition in order for God to turn away from His wrath, then sinners can be saved from God&#39;s wrath when and only when they are converted.</span></p><h2 class="cs673C987F">

His mother struggled to support the family, but even with her best effort, some of her children had to be sent off to work for their room and board. Dwight too was sent off, where he went he received cornmeal porridge and milk, three times a day. He complained to his mother, but when she found out that he had all that he wanted to eat, she sent him back. Even during this time, she continued to send them to church.

It is the only happy life to live for the salvation of souls.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">3. We must be willing to do little things for Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">4. Must be of good courage.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">5. Must be cheerful.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God had no children too weak, but a great many too strong to make use of. God stands in no need of our strength or wisdom, but of our ignorance, of our weakness; let us but give these to Him, and He can make use of us in winning souls.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.&quot; Daniel 12:3.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now we all want to shine; the mother wishes it for her boy, when she sends him to school, the father for his lad, when he goes off to college; and here God tells us who are to shine - not statesmen, or warriors, or such like, that shine but for a season - but such as will shine for ever and ever; those, namely, who win souls to Christ; the little boy even who persuades one to come to Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Speaking of this, Paul counts up five things (1 Cor. 1:27-9) that God makes use of - the weak things, the foolish things, the base things, the despised things, and the things which are not, and for this purpose, that no flesh might glory in his sight - all five being just such as we should despise. He can and will use us, just when we are willing to be humble for Christ&#39;s sake, and so for six thousand years God has been teaching men; so with an ass&#39;s jawbone Samson slew his thousands (Judges 15:15), so at the blowing of rams&#39; horns the walls of Jericho fell (Joshua 6:20). Let God work in His own way, and with His own instruments; let us all rejoice that He should, and let us too get into the position in which God can use us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is much mourning to-day over false &quot;isms,&quot; infidelity, and the like, but sum them all up, and I do not fear them one half so much as that dead and cold formalism that has crept into the Church of God. The unbelieving world, and these skeptics holding out their false lights, are watching you and me: when Jacob put away his idols, he could go up to Bethel and get strength and the blessing - so will it be with the Church of God. A viper fixes upon the hand of the shipwrecked Paul; immediately he is judged by the barbarians some criminal unfit to live; but he shakes it off into the fire, and suffers no harm, and now they are ready to worship him, and ready too to hear and receive his message: the Church of God must shake off the vipers that have fastened on hand and heart too, ere men will hear. Where one ungodly man reads this Bible, a hundred read you and me: and if they find nothing in us, they set the whole thing aside as a myth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Again, a man who has found out what his true work is, winning souls to Christ, and does it, such is the happiest man. Not the richest are this - least of all those who have just got converted for themselves, and into the Church - lost what pleasure the world could give, and found none other. Job&#39;s captivity turned away when he began praying for his friends; and so will all who thus work for others shine not in heaven alone and hereafter, but here as well, and now.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But you say &quot;I haven&#39;t got the ability.&quot; Well, God doesn&#39;t call you to do Dr. Bonar&#39;s work, or Dr. Duff&#39;s work, else He had given you their ability, their talent. The word is, &quot;To every man </span><span class="csC57700C4">his</span><span class="csA7555675"> work.&quot; I have a work to do, laid out for me in the secret counsels of eternity; no other can do it. If I neglect it, it is not true that some other will do it; it will remain undone. And if, for the work laid upon us, we feel we have not the ability or talent necessary, then we have a throne of grace; and God never sends, unless that He is willing to give the strength and wisdom. The instruments He often uses may seem all unlikely, yet when did they fail? - when once? and why not? Because He had fitted them out as well. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He sent Moses to Egypt to deliver His people - not an eloquent, but a stuttering man. He refuses a while, at last he went; and no man once sent by God ever did break down. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">So was Elisha a most unlikely man to be a successor to the great prophet Elijah. Men would have chosen some famous man, some professor in the school of the prophets. God took one from the plough; but He gave him what was needed. Elisha had but to </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">keep by</span><span class="csA7555675"> his master to the end; and he received even a double portion of the Spirit. And if we want to get it, we too must keep by the Lord, nor ever lose sight of Him, should He, as Elijah Elisha, in one way or another try our faith.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And further, we must be ready to </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">do little things</span><span class="csA7555675"> for God; many are willing to do the great things. I dare say hundreds would have been ready to occupy this pulpit to-day. How many of them would be as willing to teach a dirty class in the ragged school?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember, one afternoon I was preaching, observing a young lady from the house I was staying at, in the audience. I had heard she taught in the Sabbath-school, which I knew was at the same hour; and so I asked her, after service, how she came to be there? &quot;Oh,&quot; said she, &quot;my class is but five little boys, and I thought it did not matter for them.&quot; And yet among these there might have been, who knows, a Luther or a Knox, the beginning of a stream of blessing, that would have gone on widening and ever widening; and besides, one soul is worth all the kingdoms of the earth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Away in America, a young lady was sent to a boarding-school, and was there led to Christ; not only so, but taught that she ought to work for Him, By-and-by she goes home, and now she seeks, in one way and another, to work for Him, but without finding how. She asks for a class in her church Sunday-school, but the superintendent is obliged to tell her that he has already more than enough of teachers. One day, going along the street, she sees a little boy struck by his companion, and crying bitterly. She goes up and speaks to him; asks him what the trouble is? The boy thinks she is mocking him, and replies sullenly. She speaks kindly, tries to persuade him to school. He does not want to learn. She coaxes him to come and hear her and the rest singing there; and so next Sunday he comes with her. She gets a corner in the school of well-dressed scholars for herself and her charge. He sits and listens, full of wonder. On going home, he tells his mother he has been among the angels. At first at a loss, she becomes angry, when a question or two brings out that he has been to a Protestant Sunday-school; and the father, on coming home, forbids his going back, on pain of flogging. Next Sunday, however, he goes, and is flogged, and so again, and yet again, till one Sunday, he begs to be flogged before going, that he may not be kept thinking of it all the time. The father relents a little, and promises him a holiday every Saturday afternoon, if he will not go to Sunday-school. The lad agrees, sees his teacher, who offers to teach him then. How many wealthy young folks would give up their Saturdays to train one poor ragged urchin in the way of salvation? Some time after, at his work, the lad is on one of the railway cars. The train starts suddenly; he slips through, and the wheels pass over his legs; he asks the doctor if he will live to get home; it is impossible. &quot;Then,&quot; says he, &quot;tell father and mother that I am going to heaven, and want to meet them there.&quot; Will the work she did seem little now to the young lady? Or is it nothing that even one thus grateful waits her yonder?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Another thing we want is, to be </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">of good courage.</span><span class="csA7555675"> Three or four times this comes out in the first chapter of Joshua; and I have observed that God never uses a man that is always looking on the dark side of things: what we do for Him let us do cheerfully, not because it is our duty - not that we should sweep away the word but because it is our privilege. What would my wife or children say if I spoke of loving them because it was my </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">duty</span><span class="csA7555675"> to do so? And my mother - if I go to see her once a year, and were to say - &quot;Mother, I am come all this way to discharge what feel to be my duty in visiting you;&quot; might she not rightly reply - &quot;My son, if this is all that has brought you, you might have spared coming at all!&quot; and go own in broken-hearted sorrow to the grave?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A London minister, a friend of mine, lately pointed out a family of seven, all of whom he was just receiving into the Church. Their story was this: going to church, he had to pass by a window, looking up at which one day, he saw a baby looking out; he smiled - the baby smiled again. Next time he passes he looks up again, smiles, and the baby smiles back. A third time going by, he looks up, and seeing the baby, throws it a kiss - which the baby returns to him. Time after time he has to pass the window, and now cannot refrain from looking up each time: and each time there are more faces to receive his smiling greeting; till by-and-by he sees the whole family grouped at the window - father, mother, and all. The father conjectures the happy, smiling stranger must be a minister, and so, next Sunday morning, after they have received at the window the usual greeting, two of the children, ready dressed, are sent out to follow him: they enter his church, hear him preach, and carry back to their parents the report that they never heard such preaching; and what preaching could equal that of one who had so smiled on them? Soon the rest come to the church too, and are brought in - all by a smile. Let us not go about, hanging our heads like a bulrush; if Christ gives joy, let us live it! The whole world is in all matters for the very best thing - you always want to get the best possible thing for your money; let us show, then, that our religion is the very best thing: men with long, gloomy faces are never wise in the winning of souls.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I was preaching in Jacksonville, and, at the house in which I stayed, my attention was attracted by a little boy, who bore a different name from the household, and yet was in all things and in all respects treated as one of themselves; to the other children he was &quot;brother,&quot; and they were &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot; to him, and with them he came up to the mother for the same good-night kiss.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">By-and-by I asked the lady of the house who it was. She told me the father of the boy was a missionary out in India; some years before, father and mother had come home with their five children to have them educated. After being home a short time, the father resolved to return to India; wishing to leave the mother with the children till their education should be finished. She wanted to go back with him; he opposed to it, saying it was hard enough for him to leave them, for her it must be impossible. Still she wished to go, - she had received and been some blessing in India, and she would give up even all for Christ. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ultimately it was arranged that the children should be received into various families, - treated as part of them, - and that father and mother together should return. So with the boy the mother came to this friend&#39;s and stayed a few days along with him. The night before she had leave, sitting with the lady of the house, she told her how anxious she was that her boy should receive the impression that his mother had for Christ&#39;s sake cheerfully left him behind, and that for this end she wished to leave him without a tear at parting. The struggle this would cost the lady well knew, especially as the boy was of a peculiarly amiable disposition.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Next morning, passing the door of the mother&#39;s room, the lady overheard a sobbing, struggling prayer for strength to do what was on her heart to do. In a short time the mother came down with smiling, cheerful face; and looking so, she took leave of her boy, to go by rail some miles further on to bid a like farewell to another of her family. She went with her husband to India. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A short year after, a still, quiet voice came to her, to come up to meet her Saviour. And would not a welcome await her there, who had so loved Him here, and so cheerfully served Him?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;They that be wise shall shine, as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.&quot; (Daniel 12:3). The Lord help us as humbly, devoutly, and cheerfully to abound in His work!</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">Christ All in All</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs9E7EF551">Colossians 3:11- &quot;Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">CHRIST is all in all to every one who has truly found Him. He is our Savior, Redeemer, Deliverer, Shepherd, Teacher, and also sustains toward us many more offices, to which I desire to call your attention.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">1. </span><span class="csA7555675">If we turn to Luke 2:10, 11, we find Christ is there announced as our SAVIOR: &quot;Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We learn to know Christ as our Savior, to meet Him on Mount Calvary, to look on Him as the bleeding Lamb of God, before we know Him as our Redeemer, Deliverer, and Shepherd. Now, looking round upon this vast assembly, I, who do not know the hearts of the people, cannot know whether you can say that Christ is your Savior. There are many, I trust, who can say this, and who rejoice in His salvation; while, without being uncharitable, I am afraid there are many who know nothing personally of Jesus as their Savior.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He is offered to every one of you today as a Savior; &quot;God gave Him up freely for us all,&quot; that we all through Him might be saved. If you are belonging to this world, I can prove that you have a Savior. If you belonged to some other planet, such as the moon or any of the stars, then I could not say a Savior was offered to you; for it is not revealed whether the people of these distant worlds, even if they are inhabited, require salvation or not. But this I know, that every man on this globe has a Savior offered him.</span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">SALVATION FREE TO ALL</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have no sympathy with those men who try to limit God&#39;s salvation to a certain few. I believe that Christ died for all who will come. I have received many letters finding fault with me, and saying I surely don&#39;t believe the doctrine of election. I do believe in election; but I have no business to preach that doctrine to the world at large. The world has nothing to do with election; it has only to do with the invitation, &quot;Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&quot; That is the message for the sinner. I am sent to preach the gospel to all.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">After you have received salvation, we can talk about election. It&#39;s a doctrine for Christians, for the Church, not for the unconverted world. Our message is &quot;good tidings, which shall be to all people; for unto you is born this day a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.&quot; All people, this Savior is proffered to you. Accept Him, and God will accept you; reject Him, and God will reject you. Your eternal destiny depends on your refusal or otherwise to accept the proffered Savior. The case is simply one of giving and taking. God gives; I receive. We must, then, first of all know Christ as our Savior.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">2. </span><span class="csA7555675">But He is still more: He is our REDEEMER.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Supposing I saw a man tumble into a river, and I were to jump in and rescue him, I should be a savior to him - I should have saved him. But when I brought the man ashore, I should probably leave him, and do nothing further.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But the Lord does more. He not only saves us, but He redeems us - that is, buys us back. He ransoms us from the power of sin, as if I should promise to watch over that rescued man for ever, and see that he did not again fall into the water. The Lord not only saves us from spiritual death, but He redeems us for ever that death can never touch us.</span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was at Richmond, U.S., the colored people were going to have a meeting. It was the first day of their freedom. I went to the African church, and never before or since heard such bursts of native eloquence.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Mother,&quot; said one, &quot;rejoice today. Your little child has been sold from you for the last time; your posterity are for ever free. Glory to God in the highest! Young men, you have heard the driver&#39;s whip for the last time; you are free today! Young maidens, you have been put up on the auction- block for the last time!&quot; They spoke right out, they shouted for joy; their prayers had been answered, it was the gospel to them. In like manner Jesus Christ proclaims liberty to the captives. Some have accepted it; some, like the poor negroes, scarcely believe the good tidings; but it is none the less true. Christ has come to redeem us from the slavery of sin.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, who will accept of that redemption? There was one colored woman, a servant in an inn in the Southern States, who could not believe she was free. &quot;Be&#39;s I free, or be I not?&quot; she asked of a visitor. Her master told her she was not, her colored brethren told her she was. For two years she had been free without knowing it. She represents a great many in the Church of God today. They can have liberty, and yet they don&#39;t know it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">3.</span><span class="csA7555675"> Again, Christ is our DELIVERER.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The children of Israel were not only saved and redeemed from the bondage of the Egyptians, but they were also delivered, that they should not be led back again into bondage. Many are afraid; they think they are not able to hold on, and therefore shrink from making a profession. But Christ is able to keep you from falling; He is able to deliver you in the dark hour of trial and temptation, from every evil device of Satan, and from the snare of the fowler.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In Isaiah 49:24, we read: &quot;Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.&quot; I will save him; I will deliver him. The children of Israel were saved from the cruel bondage of Egypt, they were led out of the land of Goshen; but still they were not fully delivered. The great host of the Egyptians was thundering behind them. It was not till they had passed safely through the Red Sea, which closing behind, them, swallowed up the host of the enemy - it was not till then that they were free, that they were delivered. And similarly in our times of danger we shall find it to be true of Christ, &quot;He delivered my soul&quot;; and again in Job 33:24, &quot;Then He is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child&#39;s: he shall return to the days of his youth: he shall pray unto God, and He will be favorable unto him: and he shall see His face with joy: for He will render unto man His righteousness. He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.&quot; Here we have the saving, the redeeming, the deliverance from the pit. Man is fallen into the deep pit, he is kept there a lawful captive by one who is mighty. If he is to be brought back from the darkness of the pit to see the light, then we must have a ransom. Here God comes forward, and says, &quot;I have found a ransom.&quot; Christ is the ransom, and He will deliver us. Sound out the cry, &quot;Christ is our deliverer.&quot; He is mighty to save, He is able to deliver.</span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A LEADER</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">4.</span><span class="csA7555675"> But now we need something more. Look back again to the children of Israel; when they had marched gloriously through the Red Sea, they had been saved, redeemed, and delivered; but was that all they required? No; they had been brought into the wilderness. What now do they need? They must have a way to go in the pathless desert. They required a leader. Then Christ is the way and the leader. Are we in difficulties, in doubt, or in perplexity? Christ is our way. &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life&quot; (John 10).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have heard some say, &quot;Well, if I am converted, and become religious, I don&#39;t know what church I would go to. There are so many different churches and denominations. I really don&#39;t know which is the right one.&quot; Hence some people are bewildered, and do not know which is the true way. Well, I would say to such, Look only to Him who says, &quot;I AM THE WAY.&quot; He is the only true way, and if you want to reach the kingdom you have only to follow Him. We may be in darkness, but He is able to lead us in the right path. He is the Shepherd of His flock. He will go before us and lead us. He is calling upon us to arise and follow Him, and He will lead us by a way we know not; He will guide us to the green pastures if we only look to Him.</span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE PILLAR OF CLOUD</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">All that the children of Israel had to do was to follow the cloud. If the cloud rested, they rested; if the cloud moved forward, then they moved. I can imagine that the first thing Moses did, when the gray dawn of morning broke, was to look up and see if the cloud was still over the camp. By night it was a pillar of fire, lighting up the camp, and filling them with a sense of God&#39;s protecting care; by day it was a cloud shielding them from the fierce heat of the sun&#39;s rays, and sheltering them from the sight of their enemies.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Israel&#39;s Shepherd could lead them through the pathless desert. Why? Because He made it. He knew every grain of sand in it. They could not have a better leader through the wilderness than its Creator.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And, sinner, can you, in all your difficulties or doubts and fears, have a better leader than Jehovah? Oh, I do like that good old hymn: &quot;Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah, Pilgrim through this barren land; I am weak, but Thou art mighty, Hold me with Thy powerful hand.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more.&quot; Yes, that is the true prayer of the bewildered sinner. God is able, and still more, He is willing, to lead us, and to feed us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Thou gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst&quot; (Nehemiah 9:15).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He is still as able to lead any of us as He was four thousand years ago to lead the children of Israel, &quot;For I am the Lord; I change not.&quot; To every one of us He says, &quot;Fear not, I will lead thee; I will help thee.&quot; Wonderful thing, is it not, to have God to help us on our way? In our Western countries, when men go out hunting into the dense backwoods, where there are no roads or paths of any kind, they take their hatchet and cut a little chip out of the bark of the trees as they go along, and then they easily find their way by these &quot;blazes.&quot; They call it &quot;blazing the way.&quot; And so, if you will allow me the expression, Christ has &quot;blazed the way.&quot; He has traveled the road Himself, and knowing the way, He tells us to follow Him, and He will lead us safe on high.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">5. </span><span class="csA7555675">Now we have seen Christ is our Savior, Redeemer, Deliverer, Leader, or Way. But He is more than all that; HE IS OUR LIGHT.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&quot; He shall have the very &quot;light of life.&quot; Yes, it is the privilege of every Christian to walk in an unclouded sky.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But do we walk thus in an unclouded sky? No, most Christians are often in darkness. If I were to ask this congregation if they were all walking in the light, I believe there is scarcely one, if he spoke the true feeling of his heart, but would reply, &quot;No, I am often in darkness.&quot; Why is that? It is because we are not following Christ, and keeping close to Him. We are much in darkness when we might be in the light.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose the windows of this building were all closed, and we were complaining of the darkness, what would any one say to us? Why, they would say, &quot;Admit the light; open the windows all round, and you&#39;ll soon have plenty of light.&quot; Similarly we must let in Christ, who is the light, and open our minds to receive Him, and we shall soon walk in light. There is a great deal of darkness at the present time, even in the hearts of God&#39;s own people. But follow Him, and then you will have plenty of light. Then Christ will show to each of us that He is &quot;The Light&quot;; and He will do more, He will set us on fire with His light, that we also may shine as lights in this dark world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">May God help His own people to SHINE BRIGHTLY, to flash out of darkness, that men may take knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus. But remember, the world hates the light. Christ was the light of the world, and the world sought to extinguish it at Calvary. Now He has left His people to shine. &quot;Ye are the light of the world.&quot; He has left us here to shine. He means us to be &quot;living epistles, known and read of all men.&quot; The world is certain to watch, and to read you and me. If we are inconsistent, then you may be sure the world will take occasion to stumble at us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The world finds plenty of difficulties on the way; let us see that we Christians do not add more stumbling-blocks by our un-Christlike walk.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God help us to keep our lights burning clear and brilliant! Out West a friend of mine was walking along one of the streets one dark night, and saw approaching him a man with a lantern. As he came up close to him he noticed by the bright light that the man had got no eyes. He went past, but the thought struck him, &quot;Surely that man is blind.&quot; He turned round, and said, &quot;My friend, are you not blind?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Then what have you got the lantern for?&quot; &quot;I carry the lantern that people may not stumble over me, of course,&quot; said the blind man. Let us take a lesson from that blind man, and hold up our light, burning with the clear radiance of heaven, that men may not stumble over us.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">6. </span><span class="csA7555675">Objectors have said that it&#39;s all moonshine about Christ&#39;s people being lights on the way. Well, that&#39;s just what we believe; we reflect the light of Christ.</span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">REFLECTED LIGHT</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Just like the moonshine, our light is borrowed light. When we are living in the light of our Savior we shine with His light: somewhat like the face of Moses, which shone after he had been in the mount with God. Let us live in an atmosphere of heaven, and we cannot help shining. But whenever we get downcast and weak in faith, then we are sure to lose our light.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember during the American war I was in a prayer meeting. We were all very dark and gloomy. Things had been going against us for some time.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">At last an old man got up, and said, &quot;What is the matter with us, that we are downhearted and sad? It is simply our lack of faith. Moses, Joshua, and David were men strong in faith. They believed, and therefore God honored them. Whence comes our want of faith? God is not dead. He is as powerful, as willing, to help today as ever He was. Why, then, are we not full of faith in Him? It is God-dishonoring to forget that He still has power, although our armies are defeated, and all seems dark and gloomy.&quot; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">GET ABOVE THE CLOUDS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I will tell you what happened to me some time ago when I was out West. I wanted to reach the summit of one of the Western mountains. I had been told that sunrise was very beautiful when seen from the summit. We got up to the half-way house one afternoon, where we were to rest till midnight, and then set out for the top. Soon a little party of us started with a good guide. Before a great while it began to rain, and then it became a regular storm of thunder and lightning. I thought there was little use in going on, and said to the guide, &quot;Guess we&#39;d better turn back; we won&#39;t see anything this morning, with all these clouds.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; said the guide, &quot;I expect we&#39;ll soon get through these clouds, and get above them, and then we&#39;ll have a glorious view.&quot; So we went on, whilst the thunders were rumbling right about our ears. But soon we began to get above the thunder-cloud; the air was quite clear, and when the sun rose we had a splendid view of his rays as they tinged the hilltops; and then, as the glorious sunshine began to break on where we stood, we could see the dark cloud far beneath our mountain height. That&#39;s what God&#39;s people want - to get into the clear air above the stormy clouds, and to CLIMB HIGHER away up to the mountain peak. There you&#39;ll catch the first rays from the Sun of Righteousness far above the clouds and mists. Some of you may be in great darkness and gloom; but fear not, climb higher, get nearer to the Master, and soon you&#39;ll catch His bright rays on your own soul, and they will sprinkle back upon others. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">KEEP THE LOWER LIGHTS BURNING</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We must live as children of the light, not as children of the darkness. If we are dark and sorrowful, how is the world to know that we are children of peace, and joy, and gladness? Our determination must be to keep our lights burning. A few years ago, at the mouth of Cleveland harbor there were two lights, one at each side of the bay, called the upper and lower lights; and, to enter the harbor safely by night, vessels must sight both of these lights.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">These Western lakes are more dangerous sometimes than the great ocean.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">One wild, stormy night a steamer was trying to make her way into the harbor. The captain and the pilot were anxiously watching for the lights.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">By and by the pilot was heard to say, &quot;Do you see the lower lights?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; was the reply; &quot;but I fear we have passed them.&quot; &quot;Ah, there are the lights,&quot; said the pilot; &quot;and they must be, from the bluff on which they stand, the upper lights. We have passed the lower lights, and have lost our chance of getting into the harbor.&quot; What was to be done? They looked back, and saw the dim outline of the lower lighthouse against the sky. The lights had gone out. &quot;Can&#39;t you turn her head round?&quot; &quot;No; the night is too wild for that. She won&#39;t answer her helm.&quot; The storm was so fearful that they could do nothing. They tried again to make for the harbor, but they went crash against the rocks, and sank to the bottom. Very few escaped; the great majority found a watery grave. Why? Simply because the lower lights had gone out.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And with us the upper lights are all right. Christ Himself is the upper light, and we are the lower lights, and the cry to us is, keep the lower lights burning, that is what we have to do. In the place God has put us He expects us to shine, to be living witnesses, to be a bright and shining light.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">While we are here our work is to shine for Him, and He will lead us safe to the sunlit shore of Canaan, where there is no more night.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">7. </span><span class="csA7555675">But Christ is more than our Light on the way; for He is OUR TEACHER.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What a wonderful thing to have a teacher sent from heaven. &quot;If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him&quot; (James 1:5).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If any lack wisdom&quot;: I am afraid there are a great many of us who lack wisdom, and even the best of us at times will be in perplexity. There are moments in the life of us all when we seem in a fix; we just stand still, and say, &quot;What shall I do? I don&#39;t know what is the best way.&quot; Oh, leave it with God, He will Himself be our teacher! &quot;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.&quot; Here is a wonderful teacher. He has had a school for many thousand years; He has had the best men in His school; but still there&#39;s room for another scholar there. His college is not too full yet, and the teacher is the One sent from heaven.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Any one, every one in this assembly may join this school. Jesus will welcome you there. Are you in doubt about anything? ask Jesus; He will tell you.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Anxious sinner, seek the good teacher, as Nicodemus did: &quot;Master, we know thou art a teacher sent from God.&quot; If you seek Him thus He will direct you. He will keep you, and lead you into green pastures and by the still waters. I met a woman the other day who was full of infidel doubts and fancies. She could not believe. Reading for some time infidel works had thrown a dark and gloomy pall over her mind. It made me sad to see her in such a case. Some of you may be like her. I wish you would take Christ as your teacher, and then all darkness would flee away.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Christ is able to teach us. See how He taught the disciples. He never wearied of their learning from Him. So He will teach us if we will only listen to Him.</span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE OLD JUDGE CONVERTED</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember, as I was coming out of the daily prayer meeting in one of our American cities a few years ago, a lady said she wished to speak to me; her voice trembled with emotion, and I saw at once that she was heavily burdened by something or other. She said she had long been praying for her husband, and she wanted to know if I would go to see him; she thought it might do him some good. What is his name? &quot;Judge - ,&quot; and she mentioned one of the most eminent politicians in the State. &quot;I have heard of him,&quot; I said; &quot;I am afraid I need not go, he is a booked infidel; I cannot argue with him.&quot; &quot;That is not what he wants,&quot; said the lady. &quot;He has had too much argument already. Go and speak to him about his soul.&quot; I said I would, although I was not very hopeful. I went to his house, was admitted to his room, and introduced myself as having come to speak to him about salvation. &quot;Then you have come on a very foolish errand,&quot; said he; &quot;there&#39;s no use in attacking me, I tell you that. I am proof against all these things, I don&#39;t believe in them.&quot; Well, I saw it was no use arguing with him; so I said, &quot;I&#39;ll pray for you, and I want you to promise me that when you are converted you&#39;ll let me know.&quot; &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;ll let you know,&quot; he said in a tone of sarcasm. &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m converted!&quot; I left him, but I continued to pray for him. Some time subsequently I heard that the old judge was converted. I was again preaching in that city a while after that, and when I had done talking the judge himself came to me, and said: &quot;I promised I&#39;d let you know when I was converted; I have come to tell you of it. Have you not heard of it?&quot; &quot;Yes; but I would like to hear from you how it happened.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said the judge, &quot;one night, some time after you called on me, my wife had gone to the meeting; there was no one in the house but the servants. I sat by the drawing-room fire, and I began to think: Suppose my wife is right, that there is a heaven and a hell; and suppose she is on the right way to heaven, where am I going? I just dismissed the thought. But a second thought came: Surely He who created me is able to teach me. Yes, I thought, that is so. Then why not ask Him? I struggled against it, but at last, though I was too proud to get down on my knees, I just said, &#39;Father, all is dark; Thou who created me canst teach me.&#39; &quot;Somehow, the more I prayed the worse I felt. I was very sad. I did not wish my wife to come home and find me thus, so I slipped away to bed, and when she came into the room I pretended to be asleep. She got down on her knees and prayed. I knew she was praying for me, and that for many long years she had been doing so. I felt as if I could have jumped up and knelt beside her; but no, my proud heart would not let me, so I lay still, pretending to be asleep. But I didn&#39;t sleep that night. I soon changed my prayer; it was now, &#39;O God, save me; take away this terrible burden.&#39; &quot;I didn&#39;t believe in Christ even yet. I thought I&#39;d go right straight to the Father Himself. But the more I prayed I only became the more miserable; my burden grew heavier. The next morning I did not wish to see my wife, so I said &#39;I was not well, and wouldn&#39;t wait for breakfast.&#39; I went to the office, and when the boy came I sent him home for a holiday. When the clerks came I told them they might go for the day. I closed the office doors: I wanted to be alone with God. I was almost frantic in my agony of heart. I cried to God to take away this load of sin. At last I fell on my knees, and cried, &#39;For Jesus Christ&#39;s sake take away this load of sin.&#39; At length I went to my wife&#39;s pastor, who had been praying with her for my conversion for years, and the same minister who had prayed with my mother before she died. As I walked down the street the verse that my mother had taught me came into my mind, &#39;Whatsoever things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&#39; Well, I thought, I have asked God, and here I am going to ask a man. I won&#39;t go.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe I am a Christian. I turned and went home. I met my wife in the hall as I entered. I caught her hand, and said, &#39;I am a Christian now.&#39; She turned quite pale; she had been praying for twenty-one years for me, and yet she could not believe the answer had come. We went into our room, and knelt down by the very bedside where she had so often knelt to pray for her husband. There we erected our family altar; and for the first time our voices mingled in prayer. And I can only say that the last three months have been the happiest months ever I spent in my life.&quot; Since then that judge has lived a consistent Christian life; and all because he came to God, asking for guidance.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If there is one here today whose mind is filled with such infidel thoughts, go honestly to God, and He will teach you the right way through the dark wilderness of infidelity. He won&#39;t leave you in darkness or doubt. It is the devil&#39;s own work to lead men into such doubts; well he knows if he once gets them there he has them pretty safe.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is Satan&#39;s work to keep you in ignorance or doubt. It is God&#39;s work to teach you. The teacher is Christ; He is appointed by God for this work.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God help us all to accept Him as our teacher. 8. Now we have seen Christ as our Savior, Redeemer, Deliverer, Leader, Light, and Teacher. But He is still more; He is also OUR SHEPHERD.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A very sweet thought it is to me, &quot;The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.&quot; There is not one here, except the very babes, who does not understand the work of a shepherd. He watches over his flock, protects them from danger, feeds them, leads them into the best pastures. In fact, the 23rd Psalm is just a statement of the duties of a good shepherd: &quot;The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want,&quot; etc.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You want to be fed; are you going to wander about seeking something to satisfy the cravings of your soul? Then, I tell you, you never will find anything to satisfy the longings of your heart. The world cannot, and never could, satisfy a hungry soul. The Lord Jesus can - He is the true Shepherd. He is seeking to restore your soul, to lead you back to the paths of righteousness. Even to death will He lead you, and safely through its shadow guide you to a better land. Mother, father, will you claim Him as your Shepherd? Young man, young woman, will you have Him as your Shepherd? My little child, will you have Jesus as your Shepherd? He will lead safely and softly.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You can, all of you, if you will. For &quot;God gave Him up freely for us all,&quot; that He might have us for His flock. He will lead us through life, down to the banks of the Jordan; He will lead us across the dark river into His kingdom. He is a tender, loving Shepherd.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I sometimes meet people in the anxious inquiry-room who are nourishing hard, bitter feelings against God, generally because they have been afflicted. A mother said to me the other day, &quot;Ah, Mr. Moody, God has been unjust to me; He has come and taken away my child.&quot; Dear afflicted mothers, has God not removed your children to a pure and happy life? You may not understand it now, but you will by and by. He wants to lead you up there. THE EASTERN SHEPHERD.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A friend of mine, who had been in eastern lands, told me he saw a shepherd who wanted his flock to cross a river. He went into the water himself and called them; but no, they would not follow him into the water.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What did he do? Why, he girded up his loins and lifted a little lamb under each arm, and plunged right into the stream, and crossed it without even looking back. Whenever he lifted the lambs, the old sheep looked up into his face and began to bleat for them; but when he plunged into the water the dams plunged after him, and then the whole flock followed. When they got to the other side he put down the lambs, and they were quickly joined by their mothers, and there was a happy meeting.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friend says he noticed the pastures on the other side were much better and the fields greener; and on this account the shepherd was leading them across. Our great Palestine Shepherd does that. That child which He has taken from the earth is but removed to green pastures of Canaan, and the Shepherd means to draw your hearts after it, to teach you to &quot;set your affections on things above.&quot; When He has taken your little Mary, Edith, or Julia, accept it as a call to look upward and beyond. You, mother, are you weeping bitter tears for your little one? Do not weep! Your child has gone to the place where there is neither weeping nor sorrow. Would you have it return? Surely never.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Christ is our Shepherd - faithful and loving. Though sickness, or trouble, or even death itself, should come to our house, and claim our dearest ones, still they are not lost, but only gone before. God help each one of us to have Him as our Shepherd.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If time permitted, I should like to take up the subject of Christ as our Justification, our Wisdom, our Righteousness, the Friend that sticketh closer than a brother; but it would take a whole eternity to tell what Christ is to His people, and what He does for them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember when I was preaching on this subject in Scotland, after I had done, I said to a man that &quot;I was sorry I could not finish the subject for want of time.&quot; &quot;Finish the subject,&quot; said the Scotchman, &quot;why, that would require all eternity, and even then it would not be complete; it will be the occupation of heaven.&quot; 9. Once more, let us look at Christ as OUR BURDEN-BEARER.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Oh, I love to think of Him as the bearer of our burdens as well as our sin-bearer.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He carries our sins, although they are more numerous than the hairs of our heads. Great and terrible as these burdens are, God has laid them all on Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head! Our load was laid on Thee.&quot; That aspect of His burden-bearing we have already looked at in His work as Savior and Redeemer. I wish now to take up the sweet thought, which has been a great comfort to me.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.&quot; Glorious, is it not, to know we have such a Savior? Can you feel that He has lifted your burden off your shoulders on to His own shoulder? Then you will feel light in heart.</span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A LIGHT HEART</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">On one occasion, after I had been talking this way, a woman came forward, and said, &quot;Oh, Mr. Moody, it&#39;s all very well for you to talk like that, about a light heart. But you are a young man, and if you had a heavy burden like me you would talk differently. I could not talk in that way, my burden is too great.&quot; I replied, &quot;But it&#39;s not too great for Jesus.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;I cannot cast it on Him.&quot; &quot;Why not? surely it is not too great for Him. It is not that He is feeble. But it is because you will not leave it to Him. You&#39;re like many others. They will not leave it with Him. They go about hugging their burden, and yet crying out against it. What the Lord wants is, you to leave it with Him, to let Him carry it for you. Then you will have a light heart, sorrow will flee away, and there will be no more sighing. What is your burden, my friend, that you cannot leave with Christ?&quot; She replied, &quot;I have a son who is a wanderer on the face of the earth. None but God knows where he is.&quot; &quot;Cannot Christ find him, and bring him back?&quot; &quot;I suppose He can.&quot; &quot;Then go and tell Jesus, and ask Him to forgive you for doubting His power and willingness; you have no right to mistrust Him.&quot; She went away much comforted, and I believe she ultimately had her wandering boy restored to her! </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A MOTHER&#39;S PRAYER ANSWERED</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This circumstance reminds me of a faithful father and mother in our country, whose eldest son had gone to Chicago to a situation. A neighbor of theirs was in the city on some business, and he met the young man reeling along the streets drunk. He thought, &quot;How am I to tell his parents?&quot; When he returned to his village, he went and called out the father, and told him. It was a terrible blow to that father, but he said nothing to the mother till the little ones had all gone to rest; the servants had retired, and all was quiet in that little farm on the Western prairies. They drew up their chairs to the little drawing-room table, and then he told her the sad news. &quot;Our boy has been seen drunk on the streets of Chicago - drunk.&quot; Ah, that mother was sorely hurt; they did not sleep much that night, but spent the hours in fervent prayers for their boy. About daybreak the mother felt an inward conviction that all would be well. She told the father &quot;she had cast it on the Lord, had left her son with Jesus, and she felt He would save him.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">One week from that time the young man left Chicago, took a journey of three hundred miles into the country; and when he reached his home, he walked in, and said, &quot;Mother, I&#39;ve come home to ask you to pray for me.&quot; Ah, her prayer had reached heaven; she had cast her burden on Jesus, and He had borne it for her. He took the burden, presented her prayer sprinkled with the atoning blood, and got it answered. In two days that young man returned to Chicago rejoicing in the Savior. What a wonderful thing it is to have Christ as our burden-bearer! How easy, how light do our cares become when cast upon Him! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Do you say Christ is nothing to you? If so, it is only because you won&#39;t have Him. He is to all who will accept Him a Savior from death, a Redeemer from the power of sin, a Deliverer from our enemies, a Leader through the wilderness; He is the way Himself, He is Light in the darkness, He is a Teacher to His people, He is the Shepherd of His flock, our Justification, Wisdom, Righteousness, Elder Brother, Burden-bearer.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He is in fact &quot;Our all in all.&quot; Then come to Christ; oh, come today, The Father, Son, and Spirit say, The Bride repeats the call, For He will cleanse your guilty stains, His love will soothe your weary pains, For Christ is All in All.</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" align="center">

		<p class="cs1FEDDE5E"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">Does God Answer Prayer?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I suppose there has been no word on Christians&#39; lips so frequently at this time as the word &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">prayer</span><span class="csA7555675">,&quot; and there is not one in this hall who has not thought often, during the last forty-eight hours, of the importance of prayer.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">During this week of prayer, they are a great many not only thinking about it, but talking about it. When there is a special interest and awakening in the community on the subject of religion, then it is that a great many skeptics and infidels, and a great many mere nominal professors of Christianity - we will not judge them - begin talking against &quot;prayer.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">They say, &quot;The author of the world doesn&#39;t change His plans because of these prayers. The world goes right on. You cannot move God to change His mind or His doings.&quot; You hear this on every side. These young converts hear it. I have no doubt that many are staggered by it, and when you kneel down you say, `Is it a fact that God answers prayer? Is there anything in it?&#39;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I think it would do us good in the week of prayer to take the word &quot;</span><span class="csC57700C4">prayer</span><span class="csA7555675">,&quot; and run through the Bible tracing it out. Read about nothing else. I think you would be perfectly amazed if you took up the word </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;prayer,&quot;</span><span class="csA7555675"> and counted the cases in the Bible where people are recorded as praying, and God answering their prayers.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A great many think it is only the perfectly righteous and pure that pray. But you remember who it was who prayed in this fashion, &quot;Lord remember me when Thou comest into Thy Kingdom.&quot; You remember that Christ answered the dying thief&#39;s prayer.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We cannot but notice that every man of God spoken of in the Bible was a man of </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">prayer.</span><span class="csA7555675"> You have therefore very good authority and encouragement for asking God to hear your prayers, and for praying on behalf of others, as we are daily requested to do. Many are surprised at these requests. But many mothers and fathers are rejoicing that they sent them in. The prayers offered up here have been answered, and their children have been saved.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Last night I was more confirmed in my views regarding the power of </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">prayer</span><span class="csA7555675"> than ever. &quot;This is all excitement,&quot; some say; &quot;it is got up by earnest appeals that work on the feelings of people, and move their impulses, making them uneasy and anxious.&quot; Now, for example, there was nothing said last night to speak of, and I never was more disgusted with myself than I was on Sunday -night. It seemed as if I could not preach the Gospel, as if my tongue would not speak. But still the number of inquirers was extraordinary.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Last night, when there was no speaking at all, and when I just came in and asked that any inquirers might follow me into the moderator&#39;s room, taking a few with me, and expecting to come in and ask out a few more when I had seen these, the number was so great that came out without solicitation that I did not need to return. I saw over a hundred inquirers last night, and there were from fifty to seventy that I had to close the door on, being unable to see them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A great many who have not been at the meetings at all, have been converted in their own homes. God is working, not we. Oh! that we would keep ourselves down in the dust, and every one of us get out of the way, and let God work. It would be so easy for Him to go into every dwelling in Edinburgh, and convict and convert ten thousand souls.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look at the 6th verse of the 4th chapter of Philippians. &quot;Be careful for nothing, but in everything&quot; - mark that - &quot;by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.&quot; He doesn&#39;t say He will answer all, but He says, &quot;And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He tells us to make our wants known; to make our requests known to Him by prayer and supplication. It is right to come and make our requests known. He has told us to come and pray for the conversion of souls.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is said by many people that God does not do anything supernatural in answer to prayer; that the God of nature moves right on and never changes His decrees. Read the first six verses of the 20th chapter of 2nd Kings, and see - &quot;In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death: and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, saying, I beseech Thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before Thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying, Turn again, and tell Hezekiah, the captain of my people, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David, thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears, behold I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord, and I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the King of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David&#39;s sake.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Was not that a direct answer to prayer? Hezekiah was only praying for his own life; we are come together to pray for the life of others, and not their temporal but their eternal welfare. He was not praying for Christ&#39;s sake as we now do, but we can come to-day and ask God to save the souls of men for Christ&#39;s sake, not only for our sake, but for the sake of the beloved Son. He loves to honor that Son, and to see Christ honored. We can come now and ask Him to save souls, that it might bring glory and honor to the Son of His bosom, and glory and honor to the Son He delights to honor. &quot;I will,&quot; He says to Hezekiah, &quot;defend the city for mine own sake, and for my servant David&#39;s sake.&quot; That is only one instance.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look also at Daniel praying. It was his prayers that took the Jews back to Jerusalem. It was his prayers that turned Nebuchadnezzar to the God of Israel, and brought Gabriel down from heaven to tell him he was greatly beloved. He had power with God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">See also how God answered Jacob&#39;s prayers and Isaac&#39;s prayers. All through the Bible we have records of the answers to prayers. It would be terrible to think that God did not delight to answer prayer.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Turn to the 20th chapter of 2nd Chronicles. There we read that the Moabites, the Ammonites, and others coming against Jehoshaphat, he was afraid, &quot;and set himself to seek the Lord,&quot; and that afterwards Judah &quot;gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord.&quot; That is what we want - to seek the Lord not only here in the public assembly, but alone. If you have got an unconverted friend, and are anxious that he should be saved, go and tell it privately to Jesus, and if a blessing does not come, like Jehoshaphat, spend a few days in fasting, and prayer, and humiliation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in Thy presence (for Thy name is in this house), and cry unto Thee in our affliction, then Thou wilt hear and help.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I go into the streets, and see the terrible wickedness, and blasphemy, and drunkenness that is in them, it seems dark, but I look up and think that God can repel those dark waves of sin and iniquity.

Those who seek for Him with all their hearts, find Christ. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I am tired and sick of half-heartedness. I don&#39;t like a half-hearted man.

He has proved it by giving His only Son to die for us. The Son of God was in earnest when He died. What is Calvary but a proof of that? And the Lord wants us to be in earnest when it comes to this great question of the soul&#39;s salvation. I never saw men seeking Him with all their hearts but they soon found Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It was quite refreshing one night to find in the inquiry room a young man who thought he was not worth saving, he was so vile and wicked.

When he had lost the fingers of his right hand, the man was so earnest to save his life that he seized the boat with his left hand. They cut off the fingers of that hand too. Then the man swam up and seized the boat with his teeth. Now they had compassion on him and relented. They could not cut off his head, so they took him in, and the man&#39;s life was saved. Why?

The true Christian puts faith before reason, and believes that reason always goes wrong when faith is set aside. If people would but read their Bibles more, and study what there is to be found there about Heaven, they would not be as worldly minded as they are. They would not have their hearts set upon things down here, but would seek the imperishable things above. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">EARTH THE HOME OF SIN</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It seems perfectly reasonable that God should have given us a glimpse of the future, for we are constantly losing some of our friends by death, and the first thought that comes to us is, &quot;where have they gone?&quot; When a loved one is taken away from us, how that thought comes up before us! How we wonder if we will ever see them again, and where and when it will be! Then it is that we turn to this blessed Book, for there is no other book in all the world that can give us the slightest comfort; no other book that can tell us where the loved ones have gone. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Not long ago I met an old friend, and as I took him by the hand and asked after his family, the tears came trickling down his cheeks as he said: </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I haven&#39;t any now.&quot;<br/>&quot;What,&quot; I said, is your wife dead? &quot;<br/>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br/>&quot;And all your children, too?&quot;<br/>&quot;Yes, all gone,&quot; he said, &quot;and I am left here desolate and alone.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Would any one take from that man the hope, that he will meet his dear ones again? Would any one persuade. him that there. is not a future where the lost will be found? No, we need not forget our dear loved ones; but we ,fly cling forever to the enduring hope that there will be a time when we can meet unfettered, and be blest in that land of everlasting suns, where the soul drinks from the living, streams of love that roll by Gods high throne. In our inmost hearts there are none of us but have questionings of the future. </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Tell me, my secret soul,<br/>0, tell me, Hope and Faith,<br/>Is there no resting place,<br/>From sorrow, sin and death?<br/>Is there no happy spot<br/>Where mortals may be blest,<br/>Where grief may find a balm,<br/>And weariness a rest?<br/>Faith, Hope and Love - best boons to mortals given -<br/>Waved their bright wings, and whispered:<br/>Yes, in heaven&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There are men who say that there is no heaven. I was once talking with a man who said he thought there was nothing to justify us in believing in any other heaven than we know here on earth. If this is heaven, it is a very strange one - this world of sickness, and sorrow, and sin. I pity from the depths of my heart the man or woman who has that idea. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This world that so many think is heaven, is the home of sin, a hospital of sorrow, a place that has nothing in it to satisfy the soul. Men go all over it and then want to get out of it. The more one sees of the world the less they think of it. People soon grow tired of the best pleasures it has to offer. Some one has said that the world is a stormy sea, whose every wave is strewed with the wrecks of mortals that perish in it. Every time we breathe some one is dying. We all know that we are going to stay here but a very little while. Our life is but a vapor. It is just a mere shadow. We meet one another, as some one has said, salute one another, and pass on and are gone. And another has said, it is just inch of time, and then eternal ages roll on; and it seems to me that it is perfectly reasonable that we should study this book, to find out where we are going, and where our friends are who have gone on before. The longest time man has to live, has no more proportion to eternity than a drop of dew has to the ocean. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">CITIES OF THE PAST</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look at the cities of the past. There is Babylon. It was founded by a woman named Semiramis, who had two millions of men at work for years building it. It is nothing but dust now. Nearly a thousand years ago, some historian wrote that the ruins of Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s palace were still standing, but men were afraid to go near them because they were full of scorpions and snakes. That&#39;s the Sort of ruin that greatness often comes to in our own day. Nineveh is gone. Its towers and bastions have fallen. The traveler who tries to see Carthage, can&#39;t see much of it. Corinth, once the seat of luxury and art, is only a shapeless mass. Ephesus long the metropolis of Asia, the Paris of that day, was crowded with buildings as large as the capitol at Washington. I am told it looks more like a neglected graveyard now than anything else. Granada is now the housing place of lions and jackals. It was once very grand, with its twelve gates and towers. The Alhambra, the palace of the Mohammedan kings, was situated there. Probably the animals play with the monarchs&#39; bones. Little pieces of the once grand and beautiful cities of Herculanaeum and Pompeii are now being sold in the shops for relics. Jerusalem, once one of the grandest cities of the universe, is but a shadow of itself. Thebes - for thousands of years, up almost to the coming of Christ, the largest and wealthiest city of the world - is now a mass of decay. Very little of Athens and many more of the proud cities of olden times, remain to tell the story of their downfall. God drives His plowshare through cities, and they are upheaved like furrows in the field. &quot;Behold,&quot; says Isaiah, &quot;the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance; behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">See how Antioch has fallen! When Paul preached there it was a superb metropolis. A wide street, over three miles long, stretching across the entire city, was ornamented with rows of columns and covered galleries, and at every corner stood carved statues to commemorate their great men, whose names even we have never heard. These are never heard of now, but the poor preaching tent-maker who came into its portals, stands out as the grandest character in all history. The finest specimens of Grecian art decorated the shrines of the temples, and the baths and the aqueducts were such as are never approached in elegance now. Men then, as now, were seeking honors and wealth and mighty names, and seeking to enshrine their names and records in perishable clay. Within the walls, we are told, were enclosed mountains over seven hundred feet high, and rocky precipices and deep ravines gave wild and picturesque character to the, city of which no modern city gives us an example, These heights were fortified in a marvelous manner, which gave to them strange startling effects. The vast population of this brilliant city, combining all the art and cultivation of Greece with the levity, the luxury and the superstition of Asia, was as intent on pleasure as the population of any of our great cities are to-day. They had their shows, their games, their races and dances, their sorcerers, puzzlers, buffoons and miracle-workers, and the whole people sought constantly in the theatres and processions, for something to stimulate and gratify the most corrupt desires of the soul. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This is pretty much what we find the masses of the people in our great cities doing now. The place was even worse than Athens, for the so-called worship they indulged in was not only idolatrous, but had mixed up with it the grossest passions to which man descends. It was here that Paul it came to preach the glad tidings of Christ; it was here that his converts were first called Christians, as a nickname; the first time the name, was ever used, all followers of Christ before time having been called &quot;saints &quot; or &quot;brethren.&quot; As has been well said, out of that spring at Antioch, a mighty stream has flowed to water the world. Astarte, the &quot;Queen of Heaven,&quot; whom they worshipped; Diana, Apollo, the Pharisee and Sadusee, are no more, but the despised Christians yet live. Yet that Heathen City, which would not take Christianity to its heart and keep it, fell. Cities that have not the refining and restraining influences of Christianity well established in them, seldom do amount to much in the long ran. They grow dim in the light of ages. Few of our great cities in this country are a hundred years old as yet. For nearly a thousand years this city prospered; yet it fell. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I do not think that it is wrong for us to think and talk about heaven. I like to locate, heaven, and find out all I about it. I expect to live there through all eternity If I was going to dwell in any place in this country, if I was going to make it my home, I would want to inquire about the place, about its climate, about the neighbors I would have, and about everything in fact, that I could learn concerning it. If any of you were going to emigrate, that would be the way you would feel. Well, we are all going to emigrate in a very little while to a country that is very far away. We are going to spend eternity in another world a grand and glorious world where God reigns. Is it riot natural, then, that we should look and listen and try to find out who is already there, and what is the route to take? Soon after I was converted, an infidel asked me one day why I looked up when I prayed. He said that heaven was no more above as than below us; that heaven was everywhere. Well, I was greatly bewildered, and the next time I prayed, it seemed almost as if I was praying into the air. Since then I have become better acquainted with the Bible, and I have come to see that heaven is above us; that it is upward and not downward. The spirit of God is everywhere, but God is in heaven, and heaven is above our heads. It does not matter what part of the globe we may stand upon, heaven, is above us. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In 17th chapter of Genesis it says that God went up from Abraham; and in the 3d chapter of John, that he came down from heaven. So, in the 1st chapter of Acts we find that Christ went up into heaven (not down), and a cloud received him out of sight, Thus we see heaven is up. The very arrangement of the firmament about the earth declares the, seat of God&#39;s glory to be above us. Job says, &quot;Let not God regard it from above,&quot; and we find the Psalmist declaring, &quot;the Lord is high above nations, and His glory above the heavens.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Again in Deuteronomy, we find, &quot;who shall go up for us to heaven?&quot; Thus, all through scripture we find that we are given the location of heaven as upward and beyond the firmament. This firmament, with its many bright worlds scattered through, is so vast that heaven must be an extensive realm. Yet this need not surpass us. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is not for short-sighted man to inquire why God made heaven so extensive that its lights along the way can be seen from any part or side of this little world. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the 51st chapter of the prophecy of Jeremiah we are told that: He hath made the earth by his power; he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. Yet, how little we really know of that power, or wisdom or understanding! As it says in the 26th chapter of Job: Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? But the thunder of his power, who can understand? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This is the word of God. As we find in the 42nd chapter of Isaiah: Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the heavens and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth bread unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk within. The discernment of God&#39;s power, the messages of heaven, do not always come in great things. We read in the 19th chapter of the first book of Kings: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is as a still small voice that God speaks to His children. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some people are trying to find out just how far heaven is away. There is one thing we know about it; that is, that it is not so far away but that God can hear us when we pray. I do not believe there has ever been a tear shed for sin since Adam&#39;s fall in Eden to the present time, but God has witnessed that. He is not too far from this earth for us to go to Him; and if there is a sigh that comes from a burdened heart to-day, God will hear that sigh. If there is a cry coming up from a heart broken on account of sin, God will hear that cry, He is not so far away, heaven is not so far away, as to be inaccessible to the smallest child. In the 7th chapter and 14th verse of 2nd Chronicles, we read: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sins, and will heal, their land,&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was in Dublin, they were telling me about a father who had lost a little boy, and he had not thought about the future, he bad been so entirely taken up with this world and its affairs; but when that little boy his only child, died, that father&#39;s heart was broken, and every night when he got home from work, they would find him with his tallow candle and his Bible in his room, and he was hunting up all that he could find there about heaven. And someone asked him what he was doing, and he said he was trying to find out where his child had gone, and I think he was a reasonable man. I suppose there is not a man or woman but has dear ones that are gone. Shall we close this book to-day? Or shall we look into it to try to find where the loved ones are? I was reading, some time ago, and account of a father, a minister, who had lost a child. He had gone to a great many funerals, offering comfort to others in sorrow, but now the iron had entered his own soul, and a brother minister had come to officiate and preach the funeral sermon; and after the minister got through speaking, the father got up, and standing right at the head of the coffin, looking at the face of that loved child that was gone, he said that a few years ago, when he had first come into that parish, as he used to look over the river he took no interest in the people over there, because they were all strangers to him and there were none over there that belonged to his parish. But, he said , a few years ago a young man came into his home, and married his daughter, and she went over the river to live, and when that child went over there, he became suddenly interested in the inhabitants, and every morning as he would get up he would look out of the window and look over there at her home. But now, said he, another child has been taken. She has gone over another river, and heaven seems dearer and nearer to me than it ever has before. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friends, let us believe this good old Book, that heaven is not a myth, and let us be prepared to follow the dear ones who have gone before. There, and there alone, can we find the peace we seek for. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">SEEKING A BETTER COUNTRY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="csD5D7D290">What has been, and is now, one of the strongest feelings in the human heart? Is it not to find some better place, some lovelier spot, than we have now? It is for this that men are seeking everywhere; and yet, they can have it, if they will; but instead of looking down, they must look up to find it. As men grow in knowledge, they vie with each other more and more to make their homes attractive, but the brightest home on earth is but an empty barn, compared with the mansions that are in the skies. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What is it that we look for at the decline and close of life? Is it not some sheltered place, some quiet spot, where if we cannot have constant rest, we may at least have a foretaste of what it is to be. What was it that led Columbus, not knowing what would be his fate, across the unsailed western seas, if it was not the hope of finding a better country? This is was that sustained the hearts of the Pilgrim Fathers, driven from their native land by persecution, as they faced an iron-bound, savage coast, with an unexplored territory beyond. They were cheered and upheld by the hope of reaching a free and fruitful country, where they could be at rest and worship God in peace. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Somewhat similar is the Christian&#39;s hope of heaven, only it is not an undiscovered country, and in attractions cannot be compared with anything we know on earth. Perhaps nothing but the shortness of our range of sight keeps us from seeing the celestial gates all open to us, and nothing but the deafness of our ears, prevents our hearing the joyful ringing of the bells of heaven. There are constant sounds around us that we cannot hear, and the sky is studded with bright worlds that our eyes have never seen. Little as we know about this bright and radiant land, there are glimpses of its beauty that come to us now and then. </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;We may not know how sweet its balmy air,<br/>How bright and fair its flowers; <br/>We may not hear the songs that echo there, <br/>Through these enchanted bowers. </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csA7555675">The city&#39;s shining towers we may not see<br/>With our dim earthly vision, <br/>For death, the silent warder, keeps the key<br/>That opes the gates elysian. </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csA7555675">But sometimes when adown the western sky<br/>A fiery sunset lingers, <br/>Its golden gate swings inward noiselessly, <br/>Unlocked by unseen fingers. </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csA7555675">And while they stand a moment half ajar, <br/>Gleams from the inner glory<br/>Stream brightly through the azure vault afar, <br/>And half reveal the story.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is said by travelers, that in climbing the Alps the houses of far distant villages can be seen with great distinctness, so that sometimes the number of panes of glass in a church window can be counted. The distance looks so short that the place seems almost at hand, but after hours and hours of climbing, it looks no nearer yet. This is because of the clearness of the atmosphere. By perseverance, however, the place is reached at last, and the tired traveler finds rest. So sometimes we dwell in high altitudes of grace; heaven seems very near, and the hills of Beulah are in full view. At other times the clouds and fogs that come through suffering and sin, cut off our sight. We are just as near heaven in the one case as we are in the other, and we are just as sure of gaining it if we only keep in the path that Christ has trod. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have read that on the shores of the Adriatic sea, the wives of fishermen, whose husbands have gone far out upon the deep, are in the habit of going down to the seashore at night and singing with their sweet voices the first verse of some beautiful hymn, After they have sung it they listen until they hear brought on the wind, across the sea, the second verse sung by their brave husbands as they are tossed by the gale-and both are happy. Perhaps, if we would listen, we too might hear on this sea-tossed world of ours, some sound, some. whisper, borne from afar to tell us there is a heaven which is our home; and when we sing our hymns upon the shores of earth, perhaps we may hear their sweet echoes breaking in music upon the sands of time, and cheering the hearts of those who are pilgrims and strangers along the way. Yet we need to look up-out, beyond this low earth, and to build higher in our thoughts and actions, even here. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You know, when a man is going up in a balloon, he takes in sand as a ballast, and when he wants to mount a little higher, he throws out a little of the ballast, and then he will mount a little higher; he throws out a little more ballast, and he mounts still higher; and the higher he gets the more he throws out-and so the nearer we get to God the more we have to throw out of the things of this world. Let go of them; do not let us first set our hearts and affections on them, but do what the Master tells us_lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. In England I was told of a lady who bad been bedridden for years. She was one of those saints that God polishes up for the kingdom; for I believe that there are a good many saints in this world that we never hear about; we never see their names heralded through the press; they live very near the Master; they live very near heaven; and I think it takes a great deal more grace to suffer God&#39;s will than it does to do God&#39;s will; and if a person lies on a bed of sickness, and suffers cheerfully, it is just as acceptable to God as if they went out and worked in his vineyard. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, it was One of those saints, and a lady, who said that for a long time she used to have a great deal of pleasure in watching a bird that came to make its nest near her window. One year it came to make its nest, and it began to make it so low she was afraid something would happen to the young; and every day that she saw that bird busy at work making its nest, she kept saying, &quot;O bird, build higher!&quot; She could that the bird was going to come to grief and disappointment. At last the bird got its nest done,, and laid its eggs and hatched its young; and every morning the lady looked out to see if the nest was there, and she saw the old bird bringing food for the little ones, and she took a great deal of pleasure in looking at it. But one morning she woke up and she looked out and she saw nothing but feathers scattered all around, and she said, &quot;Ah, the cat has got the old bird and all its young.&quot; It would have been a mercy to have torn that nest down. That is what God does for us very often just snatches things away before it is to late. Now, I think that is what we want to say to church people_that if you build for time you will be disappointed. God says: Build up yonder. It is a good deal better to have life in Christ and God than any where else. I would rather have my life hid with Christ in God than be in Eden as Adam was. Adam might have remained in Paradise for 16,000 years, and then fallen, but if ours is hid in Christ, how safe! </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">Heaven Inhabitants</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If there is anything that ought to make heaven near to Christians, it is knowing that God and all their loved ones will be there. What is it that makes home so attractive? Is it because we have a beautiful home? Is it because we have beautiful lawns? Is it because we have beautiful trees around that home? Is it because we have beautiful paintings upon the walls inside? Is it because we have beautiful furniture. Is that all that makes home so attractive and so beautiful? Nay, it is the loved ones in it; it is the loved ones there. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember after being away from home some time, I went back&nbsp; to see my honored mother, and I thought in going back I would take her by surprise, and steal in unexpectedly upon her, but when I found she had gone away, the old place didn&#39;t seem like&nbsp; home at all. I went into one room and then into another, and I went all through the house, but I could not find that loved mother, and I said to some member of the family, &quot;Where is&nbsp; mother?&quot; and they said she had gone away. Well, home had lost its charm to me; it was that mother that made home so sweet to me, and it is the loved ones that make home so sweet to every&nbsp; one; it is the loved ones that are going to make heaven so sweet to all of us. Christ is there; God, the Father, is there; and many, many that were dear to us that lived on earth are there - and we shall be with them by and by. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We find clearly in the 18th chapter of Matthew, and the 10th&nbsp; verse, that the angels are there: Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven, their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in&nbsp; heaven. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Their angels do always behold the Father&#39;s face! We shall have good company up there; not only they that have been redeemed, but those that have never been lost; those that have never known what it is to transgress; those who have never known what it is to be disobedient; those who have obeyed Him from the very morning of creation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It says in another place, when Gabriel came down to tell Zachariah that he was to be the father of the forerunner of Jesus Christ, Zachariah doubted him, he had never been doubted before; and that doubt is met with the declaration: &quot;I am Gabriel, that standeth in the presence of the Almighty.&quot; What a glorious thing to be able to say! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It has been said that there will be three things which will surprise us when we get to heaven--one, to find many there that we did not expect to find there; another, to find some not there whom we had expected; a third, and perhaps the greatest wonder, will be to find ourselves there. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A poor woman once told Rowland Hill that the way to heaven was short, easy and simple; comprising only three steps--out of self, into Christ, and into glory. We have a shorter way now--out of self and into Christ, and we are there. As a dead man cannot inherit an estate, no more can a dead soul inherit heaven. The soul must be resurrected in Christ. Among the good whom we hope to meet in heaven, we are told, there will be every&nbsp; variety of character, taste, and disposition. There is not one mansion there; but many. There is not one gate to heaven, but many. There are not only gates on the north; but on the east three gates, and on the west three gates, and on the sough three gates. From opposite quarters of the theological compass, from opposite quarters of the religious world, from opposite quarters of human life and character, through different expressions of their common faith and hope, through different modes of conversion, through different portions of the Holy Scripture, will the weary travelers enter the Heavenly City, and meet each other--&quot;not without surprise&quot;--on the shores of the same river of life. And on those shores they will find a tree bearing, not the same kind of fruit always and at all times, but &quot;twelve&nbsp; manner of fruits,&quot; for every different turn of mind, --for the patient sufferer, for the active servant, for the holy and humble philosopher, for the spirits of just men now at last made&nbsp; perfect; and &quot;the leaves of the tree shall be for the healing,&quot; not of one single church or people only, not for the Scotchman or the Englishman only, but for the &quot;healing of the nations,&quot;--the Frenchman, the German, the Italian, the Russian--for all those from whom it may be, in this, its fruits have been farthest removed, but who, nevertheless, have &quot;hungered&nbsp; and thirsted after righteousness,: and who therefore &quot;shall be filled.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">An eminent living divine says: &quot;When I was a boy, I thought of heaven as a great, shining city, with vast walls and domes and spires, and with nobody in it except white-robed angels, who were strangers to me. By and by my little brother dies; and I thought of a great city with walls and domes and spires, and a flock of cold, unknown angels, and one little fellow that I was acquainted with. He was the only one I knew at that time. Then another brother dies; and there were two that I knew. Then my acquaintances began to die; and the flock continually grew. But it was not till I had sent one of my little children to his Heavenly Parent-God-that I began to think I had got a little in myself. A second went, a third went; a fourth went; and by that time I had so many acquaintances in heaven, that I did not see any more walls and domes and spires. I began to think of the residents of the celestial city. And now there have so many of my acquaintances gone there, that it sometimes seems to me that I know more in heaven than I do on earth.&quot; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It says in the 12th chapter of John and the 26th verse: If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I cannot agree with some people, that Paul has been sleeping in the grave, and is still there, after the storms of eighteen hundred years. I cannot believe that he who loved the Master, who had such a burning zeal for Him, has been separated from Him in an unconscious state, &quot;Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou has given me.&quot; This is Christ&#39;s prayer. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now when a man believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, he gets eternal life. A great many people make a mistake right there; &quot;He that believeth on the Son hath--h-a-t-h--hath eternal life;&quot; it does not say he shall have it when he comes to die; it is in the present tense; it is mine now--if I believe. He is the gift of God, that is enough. You can&#39;t bury the gift of God; you can&#39;t buy eternal life. All the grave-diggers in the world can&#39;t dig a grave large enough and deep enough to hold eternal life; all the coffin-makers of the world can&#39;t make a coffin large enough and deep enough to hold eternal life; that is mine; it is mine! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe when Paul said &quot;To be absent from the body and present with the Lord,&quot; he meant what he said; that he was not going to be separated from Him for eighteen hundred years; that spirit that he got when he was converted he got from a new life and a new nature, and they could not lay that away in the sepulcher; they could not bury that that flew to meet its Maker. It may be he is not satisfied, and will not be until the resurrection, but&nbsp; Christ says: &quot;He will see then the travail of his soul, and be satisfied.&quot; Even the body shall be raised; this body, sown in dishonor, shall be raised in glory; this body which has put n&nbsp; corruption, shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality. It is only a question of time. The great morning of the world will, by-and-by, dawn upon the earth, and&nbsp; the dead shall come forth and shall hear the voice of Him who is the resurrection and the life. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Paul says: If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. He could take down the clay temple, and leave that, but he had a better house. He says in one place: I am in a strait betwixt two; having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better; nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for me. To me, it is a sweet thought to think that death does not separate us from the Master. A great many people are living continually in the bondage of death, but if I have eternal life, death cannot touch that; it may touch the house I live in; it may change my countenance and send my body away to the grave, but it cannot&nbsp; touch this new life. To me it is very sad to think that so many professed Christians look upon death as they do. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I received some time ago a letter from a friend in London, and I thought, as I read it, I would take it and read it to other people and see if I could not get them to look upon death as this friend does. He lost a loved mother. In England it is a very common thing to send out cards in memory of the departed ones, and they put upon them great borders of black-- sometimes a quarter of an inch of black border--but this friend has gone and put on gold; he did not put on black at all; she had gone to the golden city, and so he just put on a golden border; and I think it is a good deal better than black. I think when our friends die, instead of putting a great black border upon our memorials to make them look dark, it would be better for us to put on gold. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is not death at all; it is life. Some one said to a person dying; &quot;Well, you are in the land of the living yet.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;I am in the land of the dying yet, but I am going to&nbsp; the land of the living; they live there and never die.&quot; This is the land of sin and death and tears, but up yonder they never die. It is perpetual life; it is unceasing joy. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;It is a glorious thing to die,&quot; was the testimony of Hannah More on her deathbed, though her life had been sown thick with the rarest friendships, and age had not so weakened her memory as to cause her to forget those little hamlets among the cliffs of her&nbsp; native hills, or the mission-schools she had with such perseverance established, and where she would be so sadly missed. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csC57700C4">As some one has said:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;There is a soft, a down bed;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Tis fair as breath of even;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">A couch for weary mortals spread,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">Where they may rest the aching head, </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">And find repose--in heaven!</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;There is an hour of peaceful rest,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">To mourning wanderers given.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">There is a joy for souls distressed</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">A balm for every wounded breast, </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Tis found alone--in heaven!&quot; &nbsp; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">KNOWING OUR FRIENDS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many are anxious to know if they will recognize their friends in heaven. In the 8th chapter of Matthew and the 11th verse, we read: And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Here we find that Abraham, who lived so many hundreds of years before Christ, had not lost his identity, and Christ tells us that the time is coming when they shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God. These men had not lost their identity; they were known as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And if you will turn to that wonderful scene that took place on the Mount of Transfiguration, you will find that Moses, who had been gone from the earth 1,500 years, was there; Peter, James and John saw him on the Mount of Transfiguration, they saw him as Moses; he had not lost his name. God says over here is Isaiah, &quot;I will not blot your names out of the Lamb&#39;s Book of Life.&quot; We have names in heaven; we are going to bear our names there, we will be known. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Over in the Psalms it says: When I wake in His likeness I shall be satisfied. That is enough. Want is written on every human heart down here, but there we will be satisfied. You may hunt the world from one end to the other, and you will not find a man or woman who is satisfied; but in heaven we will want for nothing. It says in the 2nd chapter of the 1st Epistle of John, speaking to followers of Christ: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as he is. &quot;And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Moreover, it seems highly probable; indeed I think it is clearly taught by Scripture, that a great many careless Christians will get into heaven. There will be a great many who will get in by the skin of their teeth, or as Lot was saved from Sodom, so as by fire. They will barely get in, but there will be no crown of rejoicing. But everybody is not going to rush into heaven. There are a great many who won&#39;t be there. You know we have a class of people who tell us they are going into the kingdom of God, whether they are converted or not. They tell us that they are on their way; that they are going there. They tell us all are going there; that the good, the bad and indifferent are all going into the kingdom, and that they will all be there; that there is no difference; and, in other words--if I may be allowed&nbsp; to use plain language--they give God the lie. But they say,&nbsp; &quot;We believe in the mercy of God;&quot; so do I. I believe in the justice&nbsp; of God, too; and I think heaven would be a good deal worse than this&nbsp; earth if an unrenewed man were permitted to go into it. Why, if a&nbsp; man should live forever in this world in sin, what would become of&nbsp; this world? It seems as if it would be hell itself. Let your mind pass over the history of this country and think of some that have lived in&nbsp; it. Suppose they never should die; suppose they should live on and on&nbsp; forever in sin and rebellion; and do you think that God is going to&nbsp; take those men that have rejected His Son, that have rejected the offer&nbsp; of His mercy, that have rejected salvation, and have just trampled His&nbsp; law under their feet, and have been in rebellion against his laws down here? Do you suppose God is going to take them right into His Kingdom&nbsp; and let them live there forever? By no means! &nbsp; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">NO SALOONS IN HEAVEN</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Now let those mothers that have sons who are just commencing a dissipated life, wake up; and not rest day nor night until their boys are converted by the power of God&#39;s grace, because no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God. These moderate drinkers will become drunkards; no man ever became a drunkard all at once. How the devil blinds these moderate drinkers! I do not know of any sin more binding than the sin of intemperance; the man is bound hand and foot before he knows it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I was reading some time ago an account of snake-worshiping in India. I thought it was a horrible thing. I read of a mother who saw a snake come into her home and coil itself around her little infant only six months old, and she thought that the reptile was such a sacred thing that she did not dare to touch it; and she saw that snake destroy her child; she heard its pitiful cries, but dared not rescue it. My soul revolted as I read it. But I do not know but we have things right here in America that are just as bad as that serpent in India-- serpents that are coming into many a Christian home, and coiling around many a son and binding them hand and foot, and the fathers and mothers seem to be asleep. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">O, may the Spirit of God wake us up! No drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God; nor rum-seller either. Bear it in mind. &quot;Woe be to the man that putteth the bottle to his neighbor&#39;s lips.&quot; I pity any professed Christians who rent their property for drinking saloons; I pity them from the depths of my heart. If you can never rent your property to better purposes you had better let it stand empty. This idea that all is going well, and that all are going into the kingdom of God, whether they repent or not, is not taught anywhere in the Scripture. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There will be no extortioners in heaven: those men that are just taking advantage of their brothers; of those men who have been unfortunate; whose families are sick; who have had to go and mortgage their property, and had snap-judgment taken against them by some man who has his hand at their throats, and takes every cent that he can get. That man is an extortioner. He shall not inherit the kingdom of God. I pity a man that gets money dishonestly. See the trouble that he has to keep it. It is sure to be scattered. If you got it dishonestly you can&#39;t keep it; your children can&#39;t keep it--they haven&#39;t got the power. You see that all over the country. A man that gets a dollar dishonestly, had better make restitution and pay it back very quick or it will burn in his pocket. &nbsp; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the days of Noah we read that he waded as it were through the deluge. He was the only righteous man, but according to the theory of some people, the rest of those men who were so foul and so wicked--too wicked to live--God just took them and swept them all into heaven, and left the only righteous man to go through this trial. Drunkards, and thieves and vagabonds all went to heaven, they say. You might as well go forward and preach that you can swear as much as you like, and murder as much as you have a mind to, and it will all come out right--that God will forgive you; God is so merciful.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose the Governor of a State should pardon out every person that the Courts ever convicted, and are now lying in its jails and penitentiaries; suppose he should let them all loose because he is so merciful that he could not bear to have men punished; I think he would not be Governor of that State long. These men who are talking about God being so full of mercy, that he is going to spare all, and tall all men to Heaven, would be the very&nbsp; men to say that such a Governor as that ought to be impeached--that he ought not to be Governor. Let us bear in mind that the Scripture says there is a certain class of people who shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Now, I will give you the sanction--I will give you the Scripture; it is a good deal better to just give the Scripture for these things, and then if you don&#39;t like it you can quarrel with Scripture, and not with me. Let no man say that I have been saying who is going to heaven and who is not; I will let the Scripture speak for itself: &quot;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But the unrighteous--the adulterers, the fornicators and thieves--these men may all inherit it if they will only turn away from their sins. &quot;Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;&quot; but if the unrighteous man says:&nbsp; &quot;I will not turn away from sin; I will hold on to sin and have heaven,&quot; he is deceiving himself. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A man that steals my pocket-book loses a good deal more than I do. I can afford to let him have my pocket-book a great deal better than he can afford to take it. See how much that man loses that steals my pocket-book. Perhaps he may get a few dollars; or he may steal my coat; but he does not get much. See how much he has lost. Take an inventory of what that man loses if he loses heaven. Think of it. No thief shall inherit the kingdom of God. To any thief I would say: steal no more. Let him ask God to forgive him; let him repent of his sin and turn to God. If you get eternal life it is worth more than the whole world. If you were to steal the whole world, you wouldn&#39;t get much, after all. The whole world don&#39;t amount to much, if you have not eternal life with it, to enjoy yourself in the future. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">Hell</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A man came to me the other day and said: &quot;I like your preaching.&nbsp; You don&#39;t preach hell, and I suppose you don&#39;t believe in one.&quot; Now I don&#39;t want any one to rise up in the Judgment and say that I was not a faithful preacher of the Word of God.&nbsp; It is my duty to preach God&#39;s Word just as He gives it to me; I have no right to pick out a text here and there, and say, &quot;I don&#39;t believe that.&quot; If I throw out one text I must throw out all, for in the same Bible I read of rewards and punishments, Heaven and hell. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No one ever drew such a picture of hell as the Son of God.&nbsp; No one could do it, for He alone knew what the future would be.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t keep back this doctrine of retribution, but preached it out plainly; preached it, too, with pure love, just as a mother would warn her son of the end of his course of sin. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Spirit of God tells us that we shall carry our memory with us into the other world.&nbsp; There are many things we would like to forget. I have heard Mr. Cough say he would give his right hand if he could forget how badly he had treated his mother.&nbsp; I believe the worm that dieth not is our memory.&nbsp; We say now that we forget, and we think we do; but the time is coming when we shall remember, and cannot forget.&nbsp; We talk about the recording angel keeping record of our life.&nbsp; God makes us keep our own record. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We won&#39;t need any one to condemn us at the bar of God; it will be our own conscience that will come up as a witness against us.&nbsp; God won&#39;t condemn us at his bar; we shall condemn ourselves.&nbsp; Memory is God&#39;s officer, and when He shall touch these secret springs and say, &quot;Son, daughter, remember&quot; - then tramp, tramp, tramp will come before us, in a long procession, all the sins we have ever committed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have been twice in the jaws of death.&nbsp; Once I was drowning, and was about to sink, when I was rescued.&nbsp; In the twinkling of an eye every thing I had said, done, or thought of flashed across my mind.&nbsp; I do not understand how every thing in a man&#39;s life can be crowded into his recollection in an instant of time, but it all flashed through my mind at once.&nbsp; Another time I was caught in the Clark street bridge, and thought I was dying.&nbsp; Then memory seemed to bring all my life back to me again.&nbsp; It is just so that all things we think we have forgotten will come back by and by.&nbsp; It is only a question of time.&nbsp; We shall hear the words, &quot;Son, remember&quot; - and it is a good deal better to remember our sins now, and be saved from them, than to put off repentance till it is too late to do any good. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The scientific men say that every thought comes back again, sooner or later.&nbsp; I heard of a servant girl whose master used to read Hebrew in her hearing, and some time afterward, when she was sick of a fever, she would talk Hebrew by the hour. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Do you think Cain has forgotten the face of his murdered brother, whom he killed six thousand years ago?&nbsp; Do you think Judas has forgotten that kiss with which he betrayed his Master, or the look that Master gave him as he said, &quot;Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?&quot; Do you think these antediluvians have forgotten the Ark, and the flood that came and swept them all away? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friends, it is a good thing to be warned in time.&nbsp; Satan told Eve that she should not surely die; and there are many men and women now who think that all souls will at last be saved in spite of all their sins. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Do you suppose those antediluvians who perished in Noah&#39;s day - those men too vile and sinful for the world - do you think God swept those men right into Heaven, and left Noah, the only righteous man, to struggle through the deluge?&nbsp; Do you think when the judgment came upon Sodom that those wicked men were taken right into the presence of God, and the only righteous man was left behind to suffer? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There will be no tender, loving Jesus coming and offering you salvation there - no loving wife or mother to pray for you there.&nbsp; Many in that lost world would give millions, if they had them, if they had their mothers to pray them out of that place, but it will be too late.&nbsp; They have been neglecting salvation until the time has come when God say, &quot;Cut them down; the day of mercy is ended.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You laugh at the Bible; but how many there are in that lost world today who would give countless treasures if they had the blessed Bible there!&nbsp; You may make sport of Ministers, but bear in mind there will be no preaching of the Gospel there.

Yes, I told him, God had sent Christ to save him; and I prayed with him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Contrary to all expectations he recovered.&nbsp; One day I went down to see him.&nbsp; It was a bright, beautiful day, and he was sitting out in front of his house. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;You are coming out for God now, aren&#39;t you?&nbsp; You will be well enough soon to come back to our meetings again.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Mr.&nbsp; Moody,&quot; said he, &quot;I have made up my mind to become a Christian.&nbsp; My mind is fully made up to that, but I wont&#39;t be one just now.&nbsp; I am going to Michigan to buy a farm and settle down, and then I will become a Christian.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;But you don&#39;t know yet that you will get well.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;O,&quot; said he, &quot;I shall be perfectly well in a few days.&nbsp; I have got a new lease of life.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I pleaded with him, and tried every way to get him to take his stand. At last he said, &quot;Mr.&nbsp; Moody, I can&#39;t be a Christian in Chicago.&nbsp; When I get away from Chicago, and get to Michigan, away from my friends and acquaintances who laugh at me, I will be ready to go to Christ.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If God has not Grace enough to save you in Chicago, he has not in Michigan&quot; I answered. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">At last he got a little irritated and said, &quot;Mr.&nbsp; Moody, I&#39;ll take the risk,&quot; and so I left him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I well remember the day of the week, Thursday, about noon, just one week from that very day, when I was sent for by his wife to come in great haste.&nbsp; I hurried there at once.&nbsp; His poor wife met me at the door, and I asked her what was the matter. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;My husband,&quot; she said, &quot;has had a relapse; I have just had a council of physicians here, and they have all given him up to die.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Does he want to see me?&quot; I asked. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Then why did you send for me?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I cannot bear to see him die in this terrible siate of mind.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;What does he say?&quot; I asked. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;He says his damnation is sealed, and he will be in hell in a little while.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I went in, and he at once fixed his eyes upon me.&nbsp; I called him by name, but he was silent.&nbsp; I went around to the foot of the bed, and looked in his face and said, &quot;Won&#39;t you speak to me?&quot;, and at last he fixed that terrible deathly look upon me and said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Mr.&nbsp; Moody, you need not talk to me any more.&nbsp; It is too late.&nbsp; You can talk to my wife and children; pray for them; but my heart is as hard as the iron in that stove there.&nbsp; My damnation is sealed, and I shall be in hell in a little while.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I tried to tell him of Jesus&#39; love and God&#39;s forgiveness, but he said, &quot;Mr.&nbsp; Moody, I tell you there is no hope for me.&quot; And as I fell on my knees, he said, &quot;You need not pray for me.&nbsp; My wife will soon be left a widow and my children will be fatherless; they need your prayers, but you need not pray for me.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I tried to pray, but it seemed as if my prayers didn&#39;t go higher than my head, and as if Heaven above me was like brass.&nbsp; The next day, his wife told me, he lingered until the sun went down, and from noon until he died all he was heard to say was, &quot;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and I am not saved.&quot; After lingering along for an hour he would say again those awful words, and just as he was expiring his wife noticed his lips quiver, and that he was trying to say something, and as she bent over him she heard him mutter, &quot;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and I am not saved.&quot; He lived a Christless life, he died a Christless death - we wrapped him in a Christless shroud, and bore him away to a Christless grave. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Are there some here that are almost persuaded to be Christians? Take my advice and don&#39;t let any thing keep you away.&nbsp; Fly to the arms of Jesus this hour.&nbsp; You can be saved if you will. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span

			<span class="csE76D6F74">Jesus Is Now Seeking Every Lost Person</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What more would you like Him to do for you than what He has done already? What would you like God to do more for us? He sent to us the prophets, and we murdered them. He sent His Son from Heaven to be a sacrifice for us. He sent us the Holy Ghost, who is in the world to give us peace and happiness.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Would you like Him to send His Son again to earth to suffer for your sins? My dear friends, what more are you waiting for? He has been looking for you and hunting for you from your cradle. I will tell you how He seeks.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There was never a sermon which you have listened to but in it the Lord was seeking for you. Some of you might have been asleep while the preaching was going on, but He was seeking you while you slept. Have not some of you heard a sermon in which your conscience was troubled? You went away, but you came back again. The Spirit of God came upon you again and again, and you were troubled. Haven&#39;t you passed through that experience? That was the Son of God seeking for your soul.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You might have had a tract presented to you. You might have turned it off. It might have been headed with our same text. That was the Son of God seeking for your soul. He has used a four-page tract-sometimes just one page-to seek to convert a man.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He is seeking through the Bible. I contend that a man can find in every page of this Book that He is seeking him through His blessed Word. This is what the Bible is for-to seek out the lost.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He seeks through His works; He seeks through these ministers, through this building. What is this building for? That you may come and lay your sins right in this tabernacle-here where Christ is seeking for your souls. Do you think the Devil put it into the heads of those businessmen, in those times of great commercial depression, to put this building up?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It has not been put up to catch your money-no collection has been taken. It is not your money we are after: it is your soul.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Do you believe it was Satan who put it into the hearts of those ministers to preach the Word night after night? Was that the Devil&#39;s work? No. It is the Son of Man seeking for your souls. This building, these crowds ought to act as warnings to every man and woman walking these streets.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Another way He seeks you: In the silent midnight hour you have been troubled; you could not sleep. Your mind has been at work. The Son of Man has come into that bedroom. You have felt Him knocking at the door of your heart, and you knew it was to save you. Many of you have passed through that experience. In that hour, the Son of God has sought you.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many of you, in the sickroom of the loved mother (or loved wife or dear child), have felt the knock at your heart. You have been summoned from your room in the stillness of the night and have been told your loved one has passed away. You recollect an incident like this in your life. At that moment your heart has told you, you ought to be a Christian. That was the Son of Man seeking you.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">At the grave of some lost one too you have heard a voice whispering, &quot;Consecrate yourself to Him.&quot; That was the Son of God seeking you. Many must have experienced this. There has not been a day that He has not sought for you, and He still seeks for you.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Forget for a moment the preacher, forget for a moment all your surroundings, and pause to ask yourself, &quot;Has not the Son of Man sought for my soul?&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I will stress again that He seeks for you. Has not the Son of Man been abroad in this community?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Go to Farwell Hall and see the crowds who go there every day; look at the multitudes who nightly assemble here. They don&#39;t all come to hear Mr. Sankey sing nor to hear me preach, for there are many far better singers and preachers. It is the Spirit of God who brings them.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many of you, while in church listening to the preaching, got mad at something said in the sermon, and you have gone out. That was the Son of Man seeking your soul.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">While in Philadelphia a man with his wife came to our meetings. When he left the service, he wouldn&#39;t speak to his wife.

Why do you think that?&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well, then, I wronged you; but when I saw Mr. Moody picking me out among all those people and telling all about me, I was sure you must have written him.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It was the Son of Man seeking for him, my friends. And I hope there will be one here tonight who will feel that I am talking personally to him. May you feel that you are lost and that the Lord is seeking for you. When you feel this, it is an invitation for you to be saved.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was taking my family south last summer, I heard of a man who would not go to church but would go to a theater. He was a hard case-a drinking, swearing, gambling man. He heard that a minister was going to preach in a theater, so he went. When he heard the preacher, the man was convinced that he was preaching at him. He went out swearing and stamping. He told all the people outside that he had been insulted by the minister and intended to wait for him and give him a good licking.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When the minister came out, he was seized by the collar.

You have, perhaps, been called to a funeral where the father and mother laid away their little child. You pity them; it is a terrible loss.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Mr. Needham told me this afternoon of a little incident that happened to him and his wife while in Massachusetts. While at Essex, in that state, someone told him that if they went up to a point on a mountain they would get a view of the country for twenty miles around.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">They went up to the rock and came down. They started for home. They got out of their path, but they treated this lightly, thought it was a good joke, and went on laughing. I suppose if anyone had come and warned them of danger, they would not have heeded the warning. But they went on. Six o&#39;clock came, and at last darkness settled down upon them. Here they were in the wilderness. They found they had lost their road altogether.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">For some time they groped their way through the woods, the darkness growing deeper and deeper. They found themselves more and more bewildered. At last Mr. Needham got to the top of a tree and shouted, &quot;Lost!

He said one day he was walking down Broadway and the street was crowded with people and carriages and horses. This thought came to him: If I only gave my consent, the Lord would save me.

I&#39;ve had far more success when I&#39;ve preached Christ&#39;s goodness.&nbsp; But tonight I will preach about repentance, so you will have no more cause of complaint.&nbsp; I believe in repentance just as much as I believe in the Word of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When John the Baptist came to preach to that Jewish nation his one cry was &quot;Repent! Repent!&quot; But when Christ came He changed it to &quot;The blood of the Lamb taketh away the sin of the world.&quot; I would rather cry &quot;The blood of the Lamb taketh away the sin of the world,&quot; then talk about repentance.&nbsp; And when Christ came we find Him saying &quot;Repent ye,&quot; but He soon pointed them to something higher - He told them about the goodness of God.&nbsp; It is the goodness of God that produces repentance.&nbsp; When upon the Day of Pentecost they asked what to do to be saved, we find Him telling men, &quot;Repent, every one of you.&quot; When Christ sent His disciples out to preach, two by two, we find the message He gave them to deliver was, &quot;Repent ye, for the Kingdom Of Heaven is at hand.&quot; It is clearly preached throughout the Scriptures. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is a good deal of trouble among people about what repentance really is.&nbsp; If you ask people what it is, they will tell you &quot;It is feeling sorry.&quot; If you ask a man if he repents, he will tell you, &quot;Oh, yes; I generally feel sorry for my sins.&quot; That is not repentance.&nbsp; It is something more than feeling sorry.&nbsp; Repentance is turning right about and forsaking sin.&nbsp; I wanted to speak on Sunday about that verse in Isaiah, which says, &quot;Let the guilty forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts.&quot; That is what it is. If a man don&#39;t turn from his sin he won&#39;t be accepted of God, and if righteousness don&#39;t produce a turning about - a turning from bad to good - it isn&#39;t true righteousness. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Unconverted people have got an idea that God is their enemy.&nbsp; Now, let me impress this, and I told you the same thing the other night, God hates sin with a perfect hatred; He will punish sin wherever He finds it, yet He at the same time, loves the sinner, and wants him to repent and turn to Him.&nbsp; If men will only turn they will find mercy, and find it just the moment they turn to Him.&nbsp; You will find men sorry for their misdeeds.&nbsp; Cain, no doubt, was sorry, but that was not true repentance. There is no cry recorded in the Scriptures as coming from him, &quot;O my God, O my God, forgive me.&quot; There was no repentance in his only feeling sorry.&nbsp; Look at Judas.&nbsp; There is no sign that he turned to God - no sign that he came to Christ asking forgiveness.&nbsp; Yet, probably, he felt sorry.&nbsp; He was, very likely, filled with remorse and despair; but he didn&#39;t repent.&nbsp; Repentance is turning to him who loved us and gave Himself for us. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look at King Saul, and see the difference between him and King David.&nbsp; David fell as low as Saul and a good deal lower - he fell from a higher pinnacle, but what was the difference between the two?&nbsp; David turned back to God and confessed his sin and got forgiven.&nbsp; But look at King Saul.&nbsp; There was no repentance there, and God couldn&#39;t save him till he repented.&nbsp; You will find, all through the Scriptures, where men have repented God has forgiven them.&nbsp; Look at that publican when he went up to pray; he felt his sin so great that he couldn&#39;t look up to Heaven - all he could do was to smite his heart and cry &quot;God forgive me a sinner.&quot; There was turning to God -repentance, and that man went down to his home forgiven.&nbsp; Look at that prodigal.&nbsp; His father couldn&#39;t forgive him while he was still in a foreign land and squandering his money in riotous living, but the moment he came home repentant, how soon that father forgave him - how quick he came to meet him with the word of forgiveness.&nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t have done any good to forgive the boy while he was in that foreign country unrepentant. He would have despised all favors and blessings from his father.&nbsp; That is the position the sinner stands toward God.&nbsp; He cannot be forgiven and get His blessing until he comes to God repenting of all his sins and asking the blessing. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, we read in Scripture that God deals with us as a father deals with a son.&nbsp; Fathers and mothers, you who have children, let me ask by way of illustration, suppose you go home, and you find that while you have been here your boy has gone to your private drawer and stolen $5 of your money.&nbsp; You go to him and say: &quot;John, did you take that money?&quot; &quot;Yes, father, I took that money,&quot; he replies.&nbsp; When you hear him saying this without any apparent regret you won&#39;t forgive him.&nbsp; You want to get at his conscience; you know it would do him an injury to forgive him unless he confesses his wrong.&nbsp; Suppose he won&#39;t do it.&nbsp; &quot;Yes,&quot; he says, &quot;I stole your money, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done wrong.&quot; The mother cannot, the father cannot forgive him, unless he sees he has done wrong, and wants forgiveness. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That&#39;s the trouble with the sinners in Chicago.&nbsp; They&#39;ve turned against God, broken His commandments, trampled His law under their feet, and their sins hang upon them; until they show signs of repentance their sin will remain.&nbsp; But the moment they see their iniquity and come to God, forgiveness will be given them and their iniquity will be taken out of their way.&nbsp; Said a person to me the other day, &quot;It is my sin that stands between me and Christ.&quot; &quot;It isn&#39;t,&quot; I replied, &quot;it&#39;s your own will.&quot; That&#39;s what stands between the sinner and forgiveness.&nbsp; Christ will take all your iniquities away if you will. Men are so proud that they won&#39;t acknowledge and confess before God.&nbsp; Don&#39;t you see on the face of it, if your boy won&#39;t repent you cannot forgive him, and how is God going to forgive a sinner if he don&#39;t repent? If He was allowing an unrepentant sinner into His Kingdom, there would be war in Heaven in twenty-four hours.&nbsp; You cannot live in a house with a boy who steals everything he can lay his hands on.&nbsp; You would have to banish him from your house. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look at King David with his son Absalom.&nbsp; After he had been sent away he gets his friends to intercede for him to get him back to Jerusalem.&nbsp; They succeeded in getting him back to the city, but someone told the King that he hadn&#39;t repented, and his father would not see him.&nbsp; After he had been in Jerusalem some time, trying his best to get into favor and position again without repentance, he sent a friend, Joab, to the king, and told him to say to his father: &quot;Examine me, and if you find no iniquity in me, take me in.&quot; He was forgiven, but the most foolish thing King David ever did was to forgive that young prince.&nbsp; What was the result?&nbsp; He drove him from the Throne.&nbsp; That&#39;s what the sinner would do if he got into Heaven unrepentant, He would just drive God from the throne - tear the Crown from Him.&nbsp; No unrepentant sinner can get into the Kingdom of Heaven. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Alas, some people say, &quot;I believe in the mercy of God; I don&#39;t believe God will allow one to perish; I believe everyone will get to Heaven.&quot; Look at those antediluvians.&nbsp; Do you think He swept all those sinners, all those men and women who were too wicked to live on earth - do you believe He swept them all into Heaven, and left the only righteous man to wade through the flood?&nbsp; Do you think He would do this, and yet many men believe all will go into Heaven.&nbsp; The day will come when you will wake up and know that you have been deceived by the devil. No unrepentant sinner will ever get into Heaven, unless they forsake their sin they cannot enter there.&nbsp; The law of God is very plain on this point: &quot;Except a man repent.&quot; That&#39;s the language of Scripture.&nbsp; And when this is so plainly set down, why is it that men fold their arms and say, &quot;God will take me into Heaven anyway.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose a governor elected today comes into office in a few months, and he finds a great number of criminals in prison, and he goes and says: &quot;I feel for those prisoners.&nbsp; They cannot stay in jail any longer.&quot; Suppose some murders have been committed, and he says: &quot;I am tender hearted, I can&#39;t punish those men.&quot; and he opens the prison door and lets them all out.&nbsp; How long would that governor be in his position?&nbsp; These very men who are depending on the mercy of God would be the first to raise their voice against that governor.&nbsp; These men would say, &quot;These murders must be punished or society will be imperiled; life will not be safe&quot;; and yet they believe in the mercy of God whether they repent or not.&nbsp; My dear friends, don&#39;t go on under that delusion; it is a snare of the devil.&nbsp; I tell you the Word of God is true, and it tells us &quot;Except a man repent&quot; there is not one ray of hope held out.&nbsp; May the Spirit of God open your eyes tonight and show you the truth - let it go into your hearts.&nbsp; Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous his thoughts. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, my friends, repentance is not fear.&nbsp; A great many people say I don&#39;t preach up the terrors of religion.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to - don&#39;t want to scare men into the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; I don&#39;t believe in preaching that way.&nbsp; If I did get some in that way they would soon get out.&nbsp; If I wanted to scare men into Heaven I would just hold the terror of hell over their heads and say, &quot;go right in.&quot; But that&#39;s not the way to win men.&nbsp; They don&#39;t have any slaves in Heaven.&nbsp; They are all sons, and they must accept salvation voluntarily.&nbsp; Terror never brought a man in yet. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look at a vessel tossed upon the billows, and sailors think it is going to the bottom and death is upon them.&nbsp; They fall down on their knees, and you would think they were all converted.&nbsp; They ain&#39;t converted; they&#39;re only scared.&nbsp; There&#39;s no repentance there, and as soon as the storm is over and they get on shore, they are the same as ever.&nbsp; All their terror has left them - they&#39;ve forgotten it, and they fall into their old habits.&nbsp; How many men have, while lying on a sick bed, and they thought they saw the terrors of death gathering around them, made resolutions to live a new life if they only get well again; but the moment they get better they forget all about their resolutions.&nbsp; It was only scare with them; that&#39;s not what we want to feel.&nbsp; Fear is one thing, and repentance is another.&nbsp; True repentance is the Holy Ghost showing sinners their sin.&nbsp; That&#39;s what we want.&nbsp; May the Holy Ghost reveal to each one here tonight out of Christ their lost condition unless they repent. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If God threw Adam out of Eden on account of one sin, how can you expect to get into the Heavenly paradise with ten thousand?&nbsp; I can imagine someone saying, &quot;I haven&#39;t got anything to repent of.&quot; If you are one of those Pharisees, I can tell you that this sermon will not reach your heart.&nbsp; I would like to find one man who could come up here and say, &quot;I have no sin.&quot; If I was one of those who thought I had no sin to repent of, I&#39;d never go to Church: I would certainly not come up to the Tabernacle.&nbsp; But could you find a man walking the streets of Chicago who could say this honestly.&nbsp; I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a day passed over my head during the last twenty years but when night came I found I had some sin to repent of.&nbsp; It is impossible for a man to live without sinning, there are so many thing, to draw away the heart and affections of men from God.&nbsp; I feel as if I ought to be repenting all the time. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Is there a man here who can say honestly, &quot;I have not got a sin that I need ask forgiveness for, I haven&#39;t one thing to repent of&quot;?&nbsp; Some men seem to think that God has got ten different laws for each of those ten commandments, but if you have been guilty of breaking one you are guilty of breaking all.&nbsp; If a man steals $5 and another steals $5OO, the one is as guilty of theft as the other.&nbsp; A man who has broken one commandment of God is as guilty as he who has broken ten.&nbsp; If a man don&#39;t feel this, and come to Him repentant and turn his face from sin toward God there is not a ray of hope.&nbsp; Nowhere can you find one ray from Genesis to Revelation.&nbsp; Don&#39;t go out of this Tabernacle saying, &quot;I have nothing to repent.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I heard of a man who said he had been converted, A friend asked him if he had repented.&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;I never trouble my head about it.&quot; My friends, when a man becomes converted the work has to be a little deeper than that.&nbsp; He has to become repentant, and try to atone for what he has done.&nbsp; If he is at war with anyone he has to go and be reconciled to his enemy. If be doesn&#39;t his conversion is the work of Satan.&nbsp; When a man turns to God he is made a new creature - a new man.&nbsp; His impulses all the time are guided by love.&nbsp; He loves his enemies and tries to repair all wrong he has done.&nbsp; This is a true sign of conversion.&nbsp; If this sign is not apparent his conversion has never got from his head to his heart.&nbsp; We must be born of the spirit, hearts must be regenerated - born again.&nbsp; When a man repents, and turns to the God of Heaven, then the work is deep and thorough.&nbsp; I hope that everyone here tonight will see the necessity of true repentance when they come to God for a blessing, and may the Spirit move You to ask it tonight. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can imagine some of You saying now, am I to repent to-night?&quot; My friends, there are only two parties in the world.&nbsp; There has been a great political contest here today, and there have been two sides.&nbsp; We will not know before forty-eight hours which side has triumphed. There is great interest now to know which side has been the stronger. Now, there are two parties in this world - those for Christ and those against Him, and to change to Christ&#39;s party is only moving from the old party to the new.&nbsp; You know that the old party is bad, and the new one is good, and yet you don&#39;t change. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose I was called to New York tonight, and went down to the Illinois Central Depot to catch the ten o&#39;clock train.&nbsp; I go on the train, and a friend should see me and say, &quot;You are on the wrong train for New York.&nbsp; You are on the Burlington train.&quot; &quot;Oh, no,&quot; I say, &quot;you are wrong; I asked someone and he told me this was the right train.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; this friend replies, &quot;I&#39;ve been in Chicago for twenty years, and know that you are on the wrong train,&quot; and the man talks, and at last convinces me, but I sit still, although I believe I am in the wrong train for New York, and I go on to Burlington. If you don&#39;t get off the wrong train and get on the right one you will not reach Heaven.&nbsp; If you have not repented, seize your baggage tonight and go to the other train. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If a man is not repentant his face is turned away from God, and the moment his face is turned toward God peace and joy follow.&nbsp; There are a great many people hunting after joy, after peace.&nbsp; Dear friends, if you want to find it tonight, just turn to God, and you will get it.&nbsp; You need not hunt for it any longer; only come and get it.&nbsp; When I was a little boy I remember I tried to catch my shadow.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if you were ever so foolish: but I remember running after it and trying to get ahead of it.&nbsp; I could not see why the shadow always kept ahead of me. Once I happened to be racing with my face to the sun, and I looked over my head and saw my shadow coming back of me, and it kept behind me all the way.&nbsp; It is the same with the Sun of Righteousness, peace and joy will go with you while you go with your face toward Him, and these people who are getting at the back of the Sun are in darkness all the time.&nbsp; Turn to the light of God and the reflection will flash in your heart.&nbsp; Don&#39;t say that God will not forgive you.&nbsp; It is only your will which keeps His forgiveness from you. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My sister, I remember, told me her little boy said something naughty one morning, when his father said to him, &quot;Sammy, go and ask your mother&#39;s forgiveness.&quot; &quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; replied the child.&nbsp; &quot;If you don&#39;t ask your mother&#39;s forgiveness I&#39;ll put you to bed.&quot; It was early in the morning - before he went to business, and the boy didn&#39;t think he would do it.&nbsp; He said &quot;I won&#39;t&quot; again.&nbsp; They undressed him and put him to bed. The father came home at noon expecting to find his boy playing about the house.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t see him about, and asked his wife where he was. &quot;In bed still.&quot; So he went up to the room, and sat down by the bed, and said: &quot;Sammy, I want you to ask your mother&#39;s forgiveness.&quot; But the answer was &quot;No.&quot; The father coaxed and begged, but could not induce the child to ask forgiveness. The father went away, expecting certainly that when he came home that night the child would have got all over it.&nbsp; At night, however, when he got home he found the little fellow still in bed.&nbsp; He had lain there all day.&nbsp; He went to him and tried to get him to go to his mother, but it was no use.&nbsp; His mother went and was equally unsuccessful.&nbsp; That father and mother could not sleep any that night.&nbsp; They expected every moment to hear the knock at their door by their little son.&nbsp; Now they wanted to forgive the boy. My sister told me it was just as if death had come into their home.&nbsp; She never passed through such a night.&nbsp; In the morning she went to him and said: &quot;Now, Sammy, you are going to ask my forgiveness.&quot; but the boy turned his face to the wall and wouldn&#39;t speak.&nbsp; The father came home at noon and the boy was as stubborn as ever.&nbsp; It looked as though the child was going to conquer. It was for the good of the boy that they didn&#39;t want to give him his own way.&nbsp; It is a great deal better for us to submit to God than have our own way.&nbsp; Our own way will lead us to ruin; God&#39;s way leads to life everlasting.&nbsp; The father went off to his office, and that afternoon my sister went in to her son about four o&#39;clock and began to reason with him, and, after talking for some time, she said, &quot;Now, Sammy, say &quot;mother.&quot; &quot;Mother,&quot; said the boy.&nbsp; &quot;Now say &#39;for.&quot; &quot;For.&quot; &quot;Now just say &#39;give.&quot; And the boy repeated &quot;give.&quot; &quot;Me,&quot; said the mother, &quot;Me,&quot; and the little fellow fairly leaped out of bed.&nbsp; &quot;I have said it,&quot; he cried; &quot;take me down to papa, so that I can say it to him.&quot; Oh, sinner, go to Him and ask His forgiveness.&nbsp; This is repentance. It is coming in with a broken heart and asking the King of Heaven to forgive you.&nbsp; Don&#39;t say you can&#39;t.&nbsp; It is a lie. It is your stubborn will - it is your stubborn heart. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now let me say here tonight you are in a position to be reconciled to God now.&nbsp; You are not in a position to deny this reconciliation a week, a day, an hour.&nbsp; God tells you now. Look at that beautiful steamer Atlantic.&nbsp; There she is in the bay groping her way along a rocky coast. The captain don&#39;t know, as his vessel plows through that ocean, that in a few moments it will strike a rock and hundreds of those on board will perish in a watery grave.&nbsp; If he knew, in a minute he could strike a bell and the steamer would be turned from that rock and the people would be saved. The vessel has struck, but he knows now too late.&nbsp; You have time now.&nbsp; In five minutes, for all you and I know, you may be in eternity.&nbsp; God hangs a mist over our eyes as to our summons.&nbsp; So now God calls - now everyone repent, and all your sins will be taken from you.&nbsp; I have come in the name of the Master to ask you to turn to God now.&nbsp; May God help you to turn and live.&nbsp; Let us pray. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">Shall We Meet Our Loved Ones Again?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This is one of the grandest chapters in the writings of Paul. It is especially grand to those who have lost friends. No sooner do loved ones pass away than the question arises, Shall we meet them again? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Paul answers this question and gives a consolation we can find so clearly stated nowhere else. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What a consolation to know, as we lay our friends away, that we shall meet them again in a little while! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">As I go into a cemetery, I like to think of the time when the dead shall rise from their graves. We read part of this chapter in what we call the &quot;burial service.&quot;I think it is an unfortunate expression. Paul never talked of &quot;burial.&quot; He said the body was sown in corruption, sown in weakness, sown in dishonour, sown a natural body. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If I bury a bushel of wheat, I never expect to see it again, but if I sow it, I expect results. Thank God, our friends are not buried; they are only sown! I like the Saxon name for the cemetery -- GOD&#39;S ACRE. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Gospel preached by the apostles rested upon four pillars: the atoning death of Christ, His burial and resurrection, His ascension, His coming again. These four doctrines were preached by all the apostles, and by them the Gospel must stand or fall. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the opening verses of I Corinthians 15, we get a clear statement from Paul that the doctrine of the resurrection is a part of the Gospel. He defines the Gospel as meaning that Christ died for our sins, but not that only -- He was buried and rose again the third day. Then he summons witnesses to prove the resurrection: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;He was seen of Cephas [Simon Peter] then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now that is pretty clear testimony, strong enough to satisfy a candid inquirer. But the Greeks had no belief in the possibility of the resurrection, and these converts at Corinth had been reared in that unbelief. So Paul puts the question: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It was one of the false doctrines that had crept into the church at Corinth, because no orthodox Jew would ever think of questioning it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">To deny the resurrection is to say that we will never see more of the loved ones whose bodies have been committed to the clay. If Christ has not risen, this life is the only one, and we are as the brutes. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">How cruel it is to have anyone love you if this be true! How horrible that they should let the tendrils of your heart twine around them, if, when they are torn away in death, it is to be the end. I would rather hate than love if I thought there will be no resurrection, because then I would feel no pangs at losing the hated thing. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Oh, the cruelty of unbelief! It takes away our brightest hopes. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.&quot; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">IMMORTALITY </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Mankind has natural &quot;yearnings after the infinite.&quot; Among the most primitive peoples philosophers have detected what has been well called &quot;an appetite for the infinite,&quot; which belies the teaching that death ends all. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is one of the points of difference between man and beast. Birds of the air and beasts of the field are much the same today as they were in Eden. They eat, sleep and pass their lives from sun to sun in unvarying monotony. Their desires and needs are the same. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But man is always changing. His desires are always enlarging. His mind is always planning ahead. No sooner does he reach one goal than he presses towards the next. Not even death itself can arrest him. A well-known infidel once said, &quot;The last enemy that shall be destroyed is not death, but the belief of man in his own immortality.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This presentiment of a future life has been beautifully illustrated by the feeling which grows within the bird when winter approaches, impelling it to travel towards the south -- &quot;an impulse mysterious and undefined, but irresistible and unerring&quot;; or to &quot;the longing of southern plants, taken to a northern climate and planted in a northern soil. They grow there, but they are always failing of their flowers. The poor, exiled shrub dreams of a splendid blossom which it has never seen, but which it is dimly conscious that it ought somehow to produce. It feels the flower which it has not strength to make in the half-chilled but still genuine juices of its southern nature. That is the way in which the thought of a future life haunts us all.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Philosophers have many facts to prove this universal reaching forward to the life beyond the grave. It is supposed that many funeral rites and ceremonies, for instance, are due to it. If the body is once more to be occupied by its spirit, it at once suggests itself that it must be protected from harm. Accordingly we find that graves are concealed lest enemies should dig up the remains and dishonour them. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Livingstone tells how a Bechuana chief was buried in his own cattle pen, then the cattle were driven about for some hours until all trace of the grave was obliterated. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But the body must be protected not alone from ill-usage, but also, as far as possible, from decay; and the process of embalming is an endeavour in this direction. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Sometimes, indeed, resurrection would be undesirable, and so we find that dead bodies are thrown into the water to drown the spirit. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Modern Egyptians turn the body round and round, it is said, to make the spirit giddy and therefore unable to retrace its steps. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Certain aboriginal Australians take off the nails of the hands lest the reanimated corpse should scratch its way out of its narrow cell. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When the conception of a second life as a continuation of the present life is held, we find the custom of burying inanimate things, such as weapons and instruments. The dead man will require everything beyond -- as he did this side -- death. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Not alone inanimate things, but animals are killed in order that their ghosts may accompany the ghost of the dead man. The Bedouins slaughter his camels over the grave of their dead comrade: indispensable in this world, it will be the same in the next. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">From this, one step leads to the immolation of human beings. Wives follow their husbands; slaves are slain that they may continue to serve their masters. In the words of a poet: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">They that in barbarian burials killed the slave and slew the wife Felt within themselves the sacred passion of the second life. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We only catch glimpses of the doctrine of the resurrection now and then in the Old Testament, but the saints of those days evidently believed in it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Nearly two thousand years before Christ, Abraham rehearsed His sacrifice when on Mt. Moriah he obeyed God&#39;s call to offer up Isaac. Referring to this, Paul writes: &quot;Accounting that God was able to raise [Isaac] up, even from the dead: from whence also he received him in a figure.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Five hundred years later we find God saying unto His servant Moses, &quot;I kill, and I make alive.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Isaiah wrote, &quot;He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.&quot; Again, &quot;Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they rise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ezekiel&#39;s vivid description of the resurrection of dry bones, setting forth in prophecy the restoration of Israel, is another evidence. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When David lost his child, he said he could not call the little one back to him, but that he would go and be with the child. At other times he wrote, &quot;As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.&quot; And, &quot;God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Patriarch Job comforted himself with the same glorious hope in the hour of his deep sorrow. He who had asked, &quot;What is my strength that I should hope? and what is mine end that I should prolong my life?&quot; said, &quot;I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another:&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Job must have firmly believed that his body was to be raised to life again, hereafter, but not on earth, for he said again, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;There is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stalk thereof die in the ground; Yet through the scent of water. it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In Hosea the Lord declares: &quot;I will ransom them from the power of the grave; l will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the last chapter of Daniel we have another glimpse of the same truth: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.&quot; And his book closes with these words: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And typically, too, resurrection was set forth in the Old Testament. By the firstfruits offered the day after the passover-sabbath as a pledge of the whole harvest, the children of Israel were taught in type of the Messiah who should be &quot;the firstfruits of them that slept.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Someone has said that the very first employment of Israel in Canaan was preparing the type of the Saviour&#39;s resurrection, and their first religious act was holding up that type of a risen Saviour. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">AND IN THE NEW TESTAMENT </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But what was referred to only at long intervals in the Old Testament became in the New Testament a prominent matter of fact and teaching. The word &quot;resurrection&quot; occurs forty-two times in the New Testament. Many times during His ministry did our Lord refer to the resurrection of all the dead. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The sadducees once came to Him with a difficult question about the marriage relation hereafter; and Jesus said, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;As touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">On another occasion Christ said, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

			<span class="csE76D6F74">A SPLENDID GUESS </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We see then that the belief in a future life did not begin with Christ. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But though the idea existed before Christianity, it was at best only &quot;a splendid guess.&quot; The natural man cannot look across the narrowest grave and see what is beyond. Strain his eyes as he will, he cannot pierce the veil of death. It is ever before him, blighting his hopes, checking his plans, thwarting his purposes, a barrier that nothing can break down. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ever since sin entered the world, Death has reigned, making the earth one huge graveyard. He has not rested for a moment. In every age and every country, &quot;Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return&quot; has been the sentence overhanging mankind. All the generations of men as they pass across the earth do but follow their dead. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many unexpected things happen to us in this life, but death is not among them. We do not know how or when it will come, but come it will, if the Lord tarry. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We have heard of doctors who have performed wonderful cures, but all their skill and knowledge have been unable to undo the work of Death. In all these six thousand years since Death entered this sin-cursed earth, human means have failed to win back a single trophy from Death. Advancing civilisation, increased education, progress in commerce and art -- none of these things make us superior to the most degraded savages. Death always triumphs in the end. The flow is always in one direction -- onward and never backward. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What was unknown by the wisest men on earth was revealed by Christ. He &quot;abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;That undiscovered country,&quot; spoken of by the poet, &quot;from whose bourn no traveller returns,&quot; is not an undiscovered country to the believer. Our Lord explored it. He entered the lists against Death in His own territory and came off more than conqueror. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The sceptre of Death is universal still, but it is broken and shall one day crumble into dust. The Christian need no longer speculate about the future: certainty is reached beside the empty tomb of Christ. &quot;Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.&quot; We can see the trace of His returning footprints. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">TRIUMPH </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And so we can join in the triumphant strain, &quot;Death is swallowed up of victory.&quot; The sting of death is sin, and God has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. They which have fallen asleep in Christ have not perished, but we shall one day see them face to face. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What a Gospel of joy and hope we have, compared to that of unbelief! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The heathen sorrowed without hope, wrote Dr. Bonar: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">To them death connected itself with no hope, no brightness, no triumph. It was not sunset to them, for that bids us be on the lookout for another sun, as bright as that which set. It was not autumn or winter, for these speak of returning spring and summer. It was not seed cast into rough soil, for that predicts the future tree or flower, more beautiful than the seed. It was pure and simple darkness, all cloud, shadow, desolation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A shattered pillar, a ship gone to pieces, a race lost, a harp lying on the ground with snapped strings and all its music lost, a flowerbud crushed -- these were the sad utterances of their hopeless grief. The thought that death was the gate of life came not in to cheer the parting and brighten the sepulchre. The truth that the grave was the soil and the body the seed sown by God&#39;s own hand to call out the latent life; that the race was not lost, but transferred to another building and another city to be &quot;a pillar in the house of God,&quot; that the bud was not crushed, but transplanted for fuller expansion to a kindlier soil and air; that the harp was not broken, but handed to a truer minstrel who will bring out all the rich compass of its hidden music: these were things that had no place in their theology, hardly in their dreams. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">AN ESSENTIAL DOCTRINE </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some people claim that the question of a risen Saviour is not essential. Hear what Paul says: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I tell you, it is very essential. It is not a mere speculative question that we are dealing with; it is of the greatest practical importance. The resurrection is the keystone of the arch on which our faith is supported. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If Christ has not risen, we must impeach all those witnesses of lying. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If Christ has not risen, we have no proof that the crucifixion of Jesus differed from that of the two thieves who suffered with Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If Christ has not risen, it is impossible to admire His atoning death which was accepted. Someone has said that the power of Christ&#39;s death to take away sin is always conditioned in the New Testament with the fact of His resurrection. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If Christ has not risen, it is impossible to admire His words and character. He made the resurrection a test-truth of His divinity. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Jews once asked for a sign, and He answered -- &quot;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&quot; -- referring to the temple of His body. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">On another occasion He gave the sign of the Prophet Jonah: &quot;As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale&#39;s belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Paul says, &quot;Declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If He had not been divine,&quot; says one, &quot;the sins of any one of us would have been a gravestone too heavy for Him to throw off; the claims of Jehovah&#39;s justice would have been bands of death too strong for Him to burst.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What would Christianity be without the resurrection? It would descend to the level of any of the other religious systems of the world. If Christ never rose from the dead, how do His words differ from those of Plato? Other men besides Christ have lived beautiful lives and have left behind them beautiful precepts to guide their followers. We should have to class Christ with these. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">&quot;HOW ARE THE DEAD RAISED? AND WITH WHAT BODY DO THEY COME?&quot; </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Turning back to the chapter, we find that Paul next deals with the question of how the dead can be raised and with what body they come. He says, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: But God&quot; -- and all things are possible with God -- &quot;giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;So also,&quot; continues Paul, &quot;is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual The first man is of the earth, earthy. the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We see the truth of Paul&#39;s illustration in the world around us. The analogy of nature does not indeed furnish a proof of the resurrection, but it affords illustrations of many things that are just as hard to explain -- yet we do not deny the facts. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Take a little black flower seed and sow it. After it has been planted some time, dig it up. If it is whole, you know that it has no life; but if it has begun to decay, you know that life and fruitfulness will follow. There will be a resurrected life, and out of that little black seed will come a beautiful fragrant flower. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Here is a disgusting grub, crawling along the ground. By and by old age overtakes it, and it begins to spin its own shroud, to make its own sepulchre, and it lies as if in death. Look again, it has shuffled off its shroud, it has burst its sepulchre open, and it comes forth a beautiful butterfly, with different form and habits. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">So with our bodies. They die, but God will give us glorified bodies in their stead. This is the law of the new creation as well as of the old: light after darkness; life after death; fruitfulness and glory after corruption and decay. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Thank God, we are to gain by death. We are to have something that death cannot touch. When this earthly body is raised, all the present imperfection will be gone. Jacob will leave his lameness. Paul will have no thorn in the flesh. We shall enter a life that deserves the name of life, happy, glorious, everlasting -- the body once more united to the soul, no longer mortal, subject to pain and disease and death, but glorified, incorruptible, &quot;fashioned like unto his glorious body,&quot; everything that hinders the spiritual life left behind. We are exiles now, but then we who are faithful shall stand before the throne of God, joint heirs with Christ, kings and priests, citizens of that heavenly country. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A bright young girl of fifteen was suddenly cast upon a bed of suffering, completely paralyzed on one side, and nearly blind. She heard the family doctor say to her parents as they stood by the bedside, &quot;She has seen her best days, poor child!&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No, doctor,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;my best days are yet to come, when I shall see the King in His beauty.&quot; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">OUR HOPE </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That is our hope. We shall not sink into annihilation. Christ rose from the dead to give us a pledge of our own rising. The resurrection is the great antidote for death. Nothing else can take its place. Riches, genius, worldly pleasures or pursuits, none can bring us consolation in the dying hour. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;All my possessions for a moment of time,&quot; cried Queen Elizabeth when dying. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I have provided in the course of my life for everything except death, and now, alas! I am to die unprepared&quot; were the last words of Cardinal Borgia. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Compare with these the last words of one of the early disciples: &quot;I am weary. I will now go to sleep. Good night!&quot; He had the sure hope of awaking in a brighter land. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">At the Battle of Inkerman a soldier was just able to crawl to his tent after he was struck down. When found, he was lying upon his face, his open Bible before him, his hand glued fast to the page by his life blood which covered it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When his hand was lifted, the letters of the printed page were clearly traced upon it; and with the ever-living promise in and on his hand, they laid him in a soldier&#39;s grave. The words were: &quot;I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I want a religion that can comfort even in death, that can unite me with my loved ones. Oh, what gloom and darkness would settle upon this world if it were not for the glorious doctrine of the resurrection! Thank God, the glorious morning will soon break. For a little while God asks us to be the watchtower, faithful to Him and waiting for the summons. Soon our Lord will come to receive His own, whether they be living or dead. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">The Lord&#39;s Work</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">What men want in doing the Lord&#39;s work is </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">(1) Courage, (2) Enthusiasm, (3) Perseverance, (4) Sympathy.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csE5F3F462">1. Courage.</span><span class="csC57700C4"> - </span><span class="csA7555675">The man who is afraid, who holds down his head like a bulrush, is not the worker whom God will bless; but God gives courage to him whom He means to use. I have been all along with young men, and a great portion of my work these fifteen years has been among them, and I find that they generally fail for want of courage. There is any quantity of young men in Edinburgh just now whose lives are a blank to them, and who have not discovered that God sends us to do work for Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He can qualify them for that work. John Wesley said, &quot;Give me thirty men of faith, and I shall storm the citadel of Satan and win it for Christ;&quot; and he did it too. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Talk of Alexander being a great conqueror, he was nothing compared with that little man, Saul of Tarsus. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Once I had been fishing long, and caught nothing, and I almost got discouraged. My Sabbath services were barren one day, and I was greatly disheartened. My heart was down, and my head was down. In came a brother. &quot;How does the work go on with you?&quot; asked of a fellow-worker. &quot;Splendidly,&quot; he said. &quot;Great blessing on Sabbath.&quot; I told him my state of mind. He said, &quot;Did you ever study the life and character of Noah?&quot; &quot;Yes; I know it by heart.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;study it again.&quot; And I did so, and found in him wonderful courage. For one hundred and twenty years that the ark was building, he labored to get men to believe in God&#39;s righteousness. He did not get one, and I said, &quot;What have I to be discouraged about after that?&quot; So I went down to the prayer-meeting, and a man behind me clasped me by the hand, and said. &quot;Pray for me, for I am in great trouble.&quot; And I thought what would Noah have given for encouragement like that! And a man rose up, and told that a hundred young men had just come to Christ in a neighboring town. What would old Noah have said to that? One hundred and twenty years, and no fruit at all; and yet he had courage to go on preaching! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">All at once the clouds were all gone from my mind. If you get discouraged, keep it to yourself; don&#39;t tell any one about it; for you will just discourage others if you do. Be strong and very courageous if you would do anything for God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csE5F3F462">2. Enthusiasm.</span><span class="csC57700C4"> - </span><span class="csA7555675">We need more enthusiasm. The more we have the better. I have a great admiration for Garibaldi [who unified Italy in the 1870s], though I cannot, of course, approve of all his acts. When put in prison he said, &quot;It were better that fifty Garibaldis should perish, than that Rome should not be free.&quot; This was the cause getting above the man; that is what we want. We want to forget ourselves. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There are one hundred thousand men waiting now to be brought to Christ, to be invited to come to Him, and shall we hang back? Let us have enthusiasm. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This formalism that abounds at the present day, is the worst ism of all - it is worse than all the infidelity and skepticism of the land. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember reading in some history of the ninth century of a young general who with only five hundred men came - up against a king with twenty thousand. And the king sent to him to say that it was the height of folly to resist with his handful of men. The general called in one of his men, and said, &quot;Take that sword and drive it to your heart.&quot; And the man took the weapon, and drove it to his heart, and fell dead. He said to another, &quot;Leap into yonder chasm,&quot; and the man instantly obeyed. Then, turning to the messenger, he said, &quot;Go back and tell your king that we have five hundred such men. We will die but we will never surrender.&quot; The messenger returned, and his tale struck terror into the hearts of the king&#39;s soldiers, so that they fled like chaff before the wind. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God says, &quot;One shall chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight.&quot; Let us have confidence in God. When men are in earnest they carry everything before them. The world don&#39;t read the Bible, but they read you and me.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csE5F3F462">3. Perseverance.</span><span class="csC57700C4"> - </span><span class="csA7555675">The men who have been successful are not those who work by fits and starts, but three hundred and sixty-five days in the year. By the grace of God, these eighteen years I have been kept working for God. People complain how cold other people are: that is a sign that they are cold themselves. Keep your own heart warm, as if there were no other but you in the world. Keep working all the time at steady, constant work. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">For the last eleven years I have not let a day pass without saying something to somebody of Christ. Make it a rule that never a day pass without speaking for Christ. People won&#39;t like it. If you are a living witness for Christ it makes people mad against you. You will suffer persecution, and be spoken against, and yet they will send for such a man first when they are in trouble or on their death-bed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The man that is popular with the world is not a friend of Jesus. You cannot serve two masters. The world hates Christ, and if you are a friend of the world you cannot be a friend of His. You may be sure that something is wrong with you when everybody is your friend. Every man here can win souls for Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The public-houses in America, are called &quot;saloons.&quot; There is a hall with a bar, and behind, a dining-room, and above, sleeping-apartments, and in these saloons the young men congregate at night, and drink and gamble. There was a terribly wicked man who kept a saloon, whose children I was very anxious to draw to my Sabbath-school. So one day I called on this man and said, &quot;Mr. Bell, I want you to let your children, come to the Sabbath-school.&quot; He was terribly angry, said he did not believe in the Bible, school or anything else, and ordered me to leave the house.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Soon after I went down again and called on this man, and asked him to go to church, and again he was very angry. He said that he had not been at church for nineteen years, and would never go again, and he would rather see his boy a drunkard and his daughter a harlot than that they should attend the Sabbath-school. A second time I was forced to leave the house.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Two or three days after I called again, and he said, &quot;Well, I guess you are a pretty good-natured sort of man, and different from the rest of Christians, or you would not come back;&quot; so seeing him in a good humor, I asked him what he had to say against Christ, and if he had read His life: and he asked me what I had to say against Paine&#39;s &quot;Age of Reason,&quot; and if I had read it. I said I had not read it: whereupon he said he would read the New Testament, if I would read the &quot;Age of Reason,&quot; to which I at once agreed, though he had the best bargain: and I did so. I did not like it much, and would not advise any person to read it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I asked Mr. Bell to come to church, but he said they were all hypocrites that went to church. This he would do, however: I might come to his house if I liked, and preach. &quot;Here, in this saloon!&quot; &quot;Yes! but look here, you are not to do all the talking;&quot; he said that he and his friends would have their say as well as I. I agreed that they might have the first forty-five minutes, and I the last fifteen of the hour, which he thought fair, and that was settled.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The day came, and I went to keep my appointment, but I never in all my life met such a crowd as when on the day appointed I went to that saloon - such a collection of infidels, deists, and reprobates of all kinds I never saw before. Their oaths and language were horrible. Some of them seemed as if they had come on leave of absence from the pit. I never was so near hell before. They began to talk in the most blasphemous way; some thought one thing, some another; some believed there was a God - others not; some thought there was such a man as Jesus Christ - others that there never was; some didn&#39;t believe anything. They couldn&#39;t agree, contradicted each other, and very nearly came to fighting with one another before their time had expired.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I had brought down a little boy, an orphan with me, and when I saw and heard such blasphemy I thought I had done wrong to bring him there. When their time was up, I said that we Christians always began service with prayer to God. &quot;Hold,&quot; said they; &quot;two must be agreed first.&quot; &quot;Well, here are two of us.&quot; And so I prayed, and then the little boy did so, and I never heard a prayer like that in all my life. It seemed as if God was speaking through that little boy. With tears running down his cheeks he besought God, for Christ&#39;s sake, to take pity on all these poor men; and that went to their very hearts. I heard sobs throughout the hall, and one infidel went out at this door and another at that; and Mr. Bell came up to me and said, &quot;You can have my children, Mr. Moody.&quot; And the best friend that I have in Chicago to-day is that same Joshua Bell, and his son has come out for Christ and as a worker for Him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There was a family which for fourteen years I had tried to draw to Christ, but they would not come, and I had almost given them up as hopeless. We have a custom on New Year&#39;s Day in America of calling on our friends and acquaintances, and wishing them the compliments of the season. Last New Year&#39;s Day I thought I should call on the old doctor, which I did, and I offered up just a short prayer. That week he and his wife came to Christ, and next week his son, and a few days after his daughter, and now the whole family are converted.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;This one thing I do,&quot;</span><span class="csA7555675"> said Paul. He had received thirty-nine stripes, and if he had other thirty-nine stripes to receive, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;This one thing I do&quot;</span><span class="csA7555675"> forgetting the things that &quot;are behind, I press towards the mark.&quot; A terrible man he was - this man of one thing and one aim, and determined to go on doing it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;To every man </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">his</span><span class="csA7555675"> work&quot; (Mark 13:34). If blessing don&#39;t come this week, it will come the next, only persevere. Be of good courage, Christ will strengthen your heart.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csE5F3F462">4. Sympathy. -</span><span class="csD5FB87F7"> </span><span class="csA7555675">to touch the hearts of men is needed too. Some men have courage, perseverance, and zeal, but their hearts are as cold as an icicle. Christ might have been born in a palace had He chosen, but poor men would have said He had not come for them; but He was born in a manger, lower than their own rank of life. The minister who speaks to people as if he were separate from them, that tells them what </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">they</span><span class="csA7555675"> should do, this and that, will not carry them with him. To speak to men from a higher platform is not the way to do them good. It should be what </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">we</span><span class="csA7555675"> do, - we poor sinners, and you. The milk of human kindness is a great element in bringing souls to Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We have, in Chicago, a meeting for strangers; and it is most blessed. Every Monday night, seventy-five a hundred young men newly arrived in the city, assemble to find friends. A young man coming from the country to a situation, or to college in town, feels very lonely. He walks the street, and has no one, of all the crowds, to speak to him, and he is miserable. That is the time when his heart is softest; then, if any one speaks to him or shows him acts of kindness, he never forgets it. The devil watches for friendless youths like those; and the ensnaring paths of vice seem refuges from loneliness. Such a young man, walking along the street, sees a big brown paper pasted on a boarding, or at a railway station, or somewhere else, having painted on it, &quot;Strangers&#39; Meeting to-night. All strangers invited to attend.&quot; So he goes, and meets a kind look and words of friendship, and it is better to him than anything in the world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">During our [civil] war, there was a Southern man who came over to a Wisconsin regiment, saying he could not fight to uphold slavery. Some time after, the mail from the north came in, and all the men got letters from their relations, and universal joy prevailed. This Southern man said he wished he were dead; he was most unhappy, for there were no letters for him. His mother was dead, and his father and brothers would have shot him if they could, for going against them. This man&#39;s tent-mate was very sorry for his friend, and when he wrote to his mother in Wisconsin, he just told her all about it. His mother sat down and wrote to her son&#39;s friend. She called him her son, and spoke to him like a mother. She told him, when the war was over that he must come to her, and that her home would be his. When the letter reached the regiment, the chaplain took it down to where this man was standing, and told him it was for him; but he said it was a mistake, that nobody would write to him; he had no friends, it must be for someone else. He was persuaded to open it, and when he read it, he felt such joy. He went down the lines, saying, </span><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;I&#39;ve got a mother!&quot;</span><span class="csA7555675"> When afterwards the regiment was disbanded, and the men were returning to their homes, there was none who showed so much anxiety as this man to get to his mother in Wisconsin.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There are hundreds of young men who want mothers, and any kindness done to them will not lose its reward.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">The Reward of the Faithful</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can speak from experience - I have been in the Lord&#39;s service for twenty one years, and I want to testify that He is a good paymaster - that He pays promptly.&nbsp; Oh, I think I see faces before me light up at these words.&nbsp; You have been out in the harvest fields of the Lord, and you know this to be true. To go out and labor for Him is a thing to be proud of - to guide a poor, weary soul to the way of life, and turn his face towards the golden gates of Zion.&nbsp; The Lord&#39;s wages are better than silver and gold, because he says that the loyal soul shall receive a crown of glory.&nbsp; If the Mayor of Chicago gave out a proclamation stating that he had work for the men, women, and children of the city, and he would give them a dollar a day, people would say this was very good of the Mayor.&nbsp; This money, however, would fade away in a short time.&nbsp; But here is a proclamation coming directly from the Throne Of Grace to every man, woman, and child in the wide world to gather into God&#39;s vineyard, where they will find treasures that will never fade, and these treasures will be crowns of everlasting life; and the laborer will find treasures laid up in his Father&#39;s house, and when, after serving faithfully here, he will be greeted by friends assembled there. Work for tens of thousands of men, women, and children!&nbsp; Think of it, and the reward. These little children, my friends, are apt to be over looked; but they must be led to Christ - Children have done a great deal in the vineyard.&nbsp; They have led parents to Jesus.&nbsp; It was a little girl that led Naaman to Christ.&nbsp; Christ can find useful work for these little ones.&nbsp; He can see little things, and we ought to pay great attention to them.&nbsp; As I was coming along the street today I thought that if I could only impress upon you all that we have come here as to a vine yard, to reap and to gather, we shall have a glorious harvest, and we want every class to assist us.&nbsp; The first class we want is the Ministers. There was one thing that pleased me this morning, and that was the eight thousand people who came to this building, and the large number of Ministers who seized me by the hand, with the tears trickling down their cheeks, and who gave me a &quot;God bless you!&quot; It gave me a light heart.&nbsp; There are some Ministers who get behind the posts, as if they were ashamed of being seen in our company and of our meetings. They come to criticize the sermon and pick it to pieces.&nbsp; No effort is required to do this.&nbsp; We don&#39;t want the Ministers to criticize but to help us, and tell us when we are wrong.&nbsp; There was one Minister in this city who did me a great deal of good when I first started out.&nbsp; When I commenced to teach the Word of God I made very many blunders.&nbsp; I have learned that in acquiring anything a man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must make many blunders.&nbsp; If a man is going to learn any kind of trade - carpenter&#39;s, plumber&#39;s, painter&#39;s - he will make any amount of mistakes. Well, this Minister, an old man, used to take me aside and tell me my errors. So we want the Ministers to come to us and tell us of our blunders, and if we get them to do this with us, a spiritual fountain will break over every Church in the city.&nbsp; Many Ministers have said to me, &quot;What do you want us to do?&quot; The Lord must teach us what our work shall be.&nbsp; Let every child of God come up to these meetings, and say, &quot;Teach me, O God, what I can do to help these men and women who are inquiring the way to be saved,&quot; and at the close of the meetings draw near to them and point out the way.&nbsp; If men and women are to be converted in great meetings, it is by personal dealings with them. What we want is personal contact with them.&nbsp; If a number of people were sick, and a doctor prescribed one kind of medicine for them all, you would think this was wrong.&nbsp; This audience is spiritually diseased, and what we want is that Christian workers will go to them and find out their trouble.&nbsp; Five minutes private consultation will teach them. What we want is to get at the people.&nbsp; Every one has his own particular burden; every family has a different story to tell. Take the gospel of the Lord to them and show its application; tell them what to do with it, so as to answer their own cases; let the Minister come into the inquiry room.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">An old man - a Minister in Glasgow, Scotland was one of the most active in our meetings.&nbsp; When he would be preaching elsewhere he would drive up in a cab with his Bible in his hand.&nbsp; It made no difference what part of Glasgow he was preaching in, he managed to attend nearly every one of our services. The old man would come in and tenderly speak to those assembled, and let one soul after another see the light. His congregation was comparatively small when we got there, but, by his painstaking efforts to Minister to those in search of the Word, when we left Glasgow his Church could not hold the people who sought admission, and I do not know of any man who helped us like Dr. Andrew Bonner.&nbsp; He was always ready to give the weak counsel and point the way out to the soul seeking Christ. If we have not Ministers enough, let those we have come forward, and their elders and Deacons will follow them.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The next class we want to help us to reach the people is the Sunday school teachers, and I value their experience next to that of the Ministers.&nbsp; In the cities where we have been, teachers have come to me and said, &quot;Mr.&nbsp; Moody, pray for my Sunday school scholars,&quot; and I just took them aside and pointed out their duties and showed how they themselves ought to be able to pray for their pupils.&nbsp; Next meeting very often they would come, and the prayer would go up from them, &quot;God bless my scholars.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In one city we went to, a Sunday school superintendent came to his Minister and said: &quot;I am not fit to gather sinners to life eternal; I cannot be superintendent any longer.&quot; The Minister asked, &quot;What is the reason?&quot; and the man said, &quot;I am not right with God.&quot; Then the Minister advised him that the best thing, instead of resigning, was to get right with God.&nbsp; So he prayed with that teacher that the truth would shine upon him; and God lit up his soul with the Word.&nbsp; Before I left that town, the Minister told me all doubt had fled from that superintendent&#39;s mind, and he had gone earnestly to work and gathered, from the time of his conversion, over six hundred scholars into the school of his Church.&nbsp; &quot;God can bless, of course, in spite of schools and teachers; but they are the channels of salvation.&nbsp; Bring your classes together, and pray to God to convert them.&nbsp; We have from three thousand to five thousand teachers here.&nbsp; Suppose they said: &quot;I will try to bring my children to Christ,&quot; what a reformation we should have! Don&#39;t say that that boy is too small, or that girl is too puny or insignificant.&nbsp; Every one is valuable to the Lord.&nbsp; A teacher, whom I found at our services when she ought to have been attending to her class, upon my asking why she was at our meeting, said: &quot;Well, I have a very small class - only five little boys.&quot; &quot;What,&quot; said I, &quot;you have come here and neglected these little ones!&nbsp; Why, in that little tow head may be the seeds of a reformation.&nbsp; There may be a Luther, a Wheaton, a Wesley, or a Bunyan among them, You may be neglecting a chance for them, the effects of which will follow them through life.&quot; If you do not look to those things, teachers, some one will step into your vineyard and gather the riches you would have. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look what that teacher did in Southern Illinois.&nbsp; She had taught a little girl to love the Savior, and the teacher said to her: &quot;Can&#39;t you get your father to come to the Sunday school?&quot; This father was a swearing, drinking man, and the love of God was not in his heart. But under the tuition of that teacher, the little girl went to her father, and told him of Jesus&#39; love, and led him to that Sunday school.&nbsp; What was the result?&nbsp; I heard before leaving for Europe, that he had been instrumental in founding over seven hundred and eighty Sabbath schools in Southern Illinois.&nbsp; And what a privilege a teacher has - a privilege of leading souls to Christ.&nbsp; Let every Sabbath school teacher say: &quot;By the help of God I will try to lead my scholars to Christ.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It seems to me that we have more help in our revivals from young men, except from mothers, than from any other class.&nbsp; The young men are pushing, energetic workers.&nbsp; Old men are good for counsel, and they should help, by their good words, the young men in making Christianity aggressive.&nbsp; These billiard halls have been open long enough. There is many a gem in those places, that only needs the way pointed out to fill their souls with love of Him.&nbsp; Let the young men go plead with them, bring them to the Tabernacle, and don&#39;t let them go out without presenting the claims of Christ, and show them His never dying love.&nbsp; Take them by the hand and say: &quot;I want you to become a Christian.&quot;&nbsp; What we want is a hand-to-hand conflict with the billiard saloons and drinking halls.&nbsp; Do not fear, but enter them and ask the young men to come. I know that some of you say, in a scornful way: &quot;We will never be allowed to enter; the people who go there will cast us out.&quot; This is a mistake.&nbsp; I know that I have gone to them and remonstrated, and have never been unkindly treated.&nbsp; And some of the best workers have been men who have been proprietors of these places, and men who have been constant frequenters.&nbsp; There are young men there breaking their mothers&#39; hearts, and losing themselves for all eternity. The Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ asks you to seek them out.&nbsp; If we cannot get them to come here, let the building be thrown aside, and let us go down and hunt them up, and tell them of Christ and Heaven. If we get someone to preach to, let us preach, even if it be to one person.&nbsp; Christ preached one of His most wonderful sermons to the woman at the well; and shall we not be willing to go to one, as He did, and tell that one of salvation?&nbsp; And let us preach to men, even if they are under the influence of liquor. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I may relate a little experience.&nbsp; In Philadelphia, at one of our meetings, a drunken man rose up.&nbsp; Till that time I had no faith that a drunken man could be converted.&nbsp; When any one approached he was generally taken out.&nbsp; This man got up and shouted, &quot;I want to be prayed for.&quot; The friends who were with him tried to draw him away, but he shouted only louder, and for three times he repeated his request.&nbsp; His call was attended to, and he was converted.&nbsp; God has power to convert a man even if he is drunk. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have still another lesson.&nbsp; I met a man in New York who was an earnest worker, and I asked him to tell me his experiences.&nbsp; He said he had been a drunkard for over twenty years.&nbsp; His parents had forsaken him, and his wife had cast him off and married some one else. He went into a lawyer&#39;s office in Poughkeepsie, mad with drink.&nbsp; This lawyer proved a good Samaritan, and reasoned with him and told him he could be saved.&nbsp; The man scouted the idea.&nbsp; He said: &quot;I must be pretty low when my father and mother, my wife and kindred cast me off, and there is no hope for me here or hereafter.&quot; But this good Samaritan showed him how it was possible to secure salvation; got him on his feet, got him on his beast, like the good Samaritan of old, and guided his face toward Zion.&nbsp; And this man said to me: &quot;I have not drank a glass of liquor since.&quot; He is now leader of a young men&#39;s meeting in New York.&nbsp; I asked him to come up last Saturday night to Northfield, my native town, where there are a good many drunkards, thinking he might encourage them to seek salvation, he came, and brought a young man with him.&nbsp; They held a meeting, and it seemed as if the power of God rested upon that meeting when these two men went on telling what God had done for them - how He had destroyed the works of the devil in their hearts, and brought peace and unalloyed happiness to their souls.&nbsp; These grog shops here are the works of the devil - they are ruining men&#39;s souls every hour.&nbsp; Let us fight against them, and let our prayers go up in our battle, &quot;Lord, manifest Thy power in Chicago this coming month.&quot; It may seem a very difficult thing for us, but it is a very easy thing for God to convert rum sellers. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A young man in New York got up and thrilled the meeting with his experience.&nbsp; &quot;I want to tell you,&quot; he said, &quot;that nine months ago a Christian came to my house and, said he, wanted me to become a Christian.&nbsp; He talked to me kindly and encouragingly, pointing out the error of my ways, and I became converted.&nbsp; I had been a hard drinker, but since that time I have not touched a drop of liquor.&nbsp; If any one had asked who the most hopeless man in that town was they would have pointed to me.&quot; Today this young man is the superintendent of a Sabbath school.&nbsp; Eleven years ago, when I went to Boston, I had a cousin who wanted a little of my experience.&nbsp; I gave him all the help I could, and he became a Christian.&nbsp; He did not know how near death was to him.&nbsp; He wrote to his brother and said: &quot;I am very anxious to get your soul to Jesus.&quot; The letter somehow went to another city, and lay from the 28th of February to the 28th of March - just one month. He saw it was in his brother&#39;s handwriting, and tore it open and read the above words.&nbsp; It struck a chord in his heart, and was the means of converting him - And this was the Christian who led this drunken young man to Christ.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This young man had a neighbor who had drank for forty years, and he went to that neighbor and told him what God had done for him, and the result was another conversion. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I tell you these things to encourage You to believe that the drunkards and saloon keepers can be saved - There is work for you to do, and by and by the harvest shall be gathered, and what a scene will be on the shore when we hear the Master on the throne shout, &quot;Well done!

I will go to America and be rid of them.&quot; &quot;But, my boy,&quot; she said, &quot;God is on the sea, and in America, and He hears my prayers for you.&quot; Well, he came to this country, and as they led into the port of New York some of the sailors told him that Moody and Sankey were holding meeting in the Hippodrome.&nbsp; The moment he landed he started for our place Of meeting, and there he found Christ.&nbsp; He became a most earnest worker, and he wrote to his mother and told her that her prayers had been answered; that he had been saved, and that he had found his mother&#39;s God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Mothers and fathers, lift up your hearts in prayer, that there may be hundreds of thousands saved in this city. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was in London, there was one lady dressed in black up in the gallery.

The principal charge against Christ was: &quot;This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Who would have such a man around him as John Bunyan in his time? He, a Bedford tinker, couldn&rsquo;t get inside one of the princely castles.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I was very much amused when I was over in England. They had erected a monument to John Bunyan, and it was unveiled by lords and dukes and great men. While he was on earth, they would not have allowed him inside the walls of their castles, yet he was made one of the mightiest instruments in the spread of the Gospel.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No book that has ever been written comes so near the Bible as John Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress; and yet the author was a poor Bedford tinker.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Thus it is with God. He picks up some poor lost tramp and makes him an instrument to turn hundreds and thousands to Christ.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">George Whitefield, standing in his tabernacle in London and with a multitude gathered about him, cried out, &quot;The Lord Jesus will save the Devil&rsquo;s castaways!&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Two poor, abandoned wretches standing outside in the street heard his silvery voice ring out on the air. Looking into each other&rsquo;s faces, they said, &quot;That must mean you and me.&quot; They wept and rejoiced. They drew near and looked in at the door at the face of the earnest messenger, the tears streaming from his eyes as he pled with the people to give their hearts to God. One of them wrote him a little note and sent it to him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Later that day, as he sat at the table of Lady Huntington, his special friend, someone present said, &quot;Mr. Whitefield, did you not go a little too far today when you said that the Lord would save the Devil&rsquo;s castaways?&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Taking the note from his pocket, he gave it to Lady Huntington. &quot;Will you read that note aloud?&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">She read: &quot;Mr. Whitefield: Two poor lost women stood outside your tabernacle today and heard you say that the Lord would save the Devil&rsquo;s castaways. We seized upon that as our last hope. Now we write to tell you that we rejoice now in believing in Him, and from this good hour we shall endeavor to serve Him who has done so much for us.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">2. The &quot;I Will&quot; of Cleansing</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The next &quot;I will&quot; is found in Luke, chapter 5. We read of a leper who came to Christ and said, &quot;Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.&quot; The Lord touched him, saying, &quot;I will: be thou clean,&quot; and immediately the leprosy left him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Any man or woman full of the leprosy of sin who reads this, if you will but go to the Master and tell all your case to Him, He will speak to you as He did to that poor leper: &quot;I will: be thou clean,&quot; and the leprosy of your sins will flee from you.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Lord and the Lord alone can forgive sins. If you say to Him, &quot;Lord, I am full of sin; Thou canst make me clean&quot;; &quot;Lord, I have a terrible temper; Thou canst make me clean&quot;; &quot;Lord, I have a deceitful heart. Cleanse me, O Lord; give me a new heart. O Lord, give me the power to overcome the flesh and the snares of the Devil!&quot;; &quot;Lord, I am full of unclean habits&quot;&ndash;if you come to Him with a sincere spirit, you will hear the voice, &quot;I will: be thou clean.&quot; It will be done.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The God who created the world out of nothing, who by a breath put life into the world&ndash;do you think if He says, &quot;Thou shalt be clean,&quot; you will not be clean?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, you can make a wonderful exchange today. You can have spiritual health in the place of sinsickness; you can get rid of everything that is vile and hateful in the sight of God. The Son of God comes down and says, &quot;I will take away your leprosy and give you health in its stead. I will take away that terrible sin disease that is ruining your body and soul and give you My righteousness in its stead. I will clothe you with the garments of salvation.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Is it not wonderful! That&rsquo;s what He means when He says, &quot;I will.&quot; Oh, lay hold on this &quot;I will&quot;!</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">3. The &quot;I Will&quot; of Confession</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now turn to Matthew 10:32: &quot;Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven&quot;: the &quot;I will&quot; of confession.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That&rsquo;s the next thing that takes place after a man is saved. When we have been washed in the blood of the Lamb, we get our mouths opened. We have to confess Christ here in this dark world and tell His love to others. We are not to be ashamed of the Son of God.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A man thinks it a great honor when he has achieved a victory that causes his name to be mentioned in the English Parliament or in the presence of the queen and her court.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">How excited we used to be during the war when some general did something extraordinary and someone got up in Congress to confess his exploits! How the papers used to talk about it!</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In China the highest ambition of the successful soldier is to have his name written in the palace or temple of Confucius.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But just think of having your name mentioned in the kingdom of Heaven by the Prince of Glory, by the Son of God, because you confessed Him here on earth! Confess Him here; He will confess you yonder.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If you wish to be brought into the clear light of liberty, you must take your stand on Christ&rsquo;s side. Many Christians go groping about in darkness and never get into the clear light of the kingdom because they are ashamed to confess the Son of God. We are living in a day when men want a religion without the cross, the crown but not the cross. But if we are to be disciples of Jesus Christ, we have to take up our crosses daily&ndash;not once a year or on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, but daily. And if we take up our crosses and follow Him, we shall be blessed in the very act.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A newly converted man in New York came to pray with me. His burden was that he was afraid to confess Christ. It seemed that down at the bottom of his trunk he had a Bible. He wanted to get it out and read it to the companion with whom he lived, but he was ashamed to do it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">After he had carried the burden for a whole week and after a terrible struggle, he made up his mind, &quot;I will take my Bible out tonight and read it.&quot; He did. Soon he heard the footsteps of his roommate coming upstairs. His first impulse was to put the Bible away, but then he decided he would face his companion with it in hand.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">His roommate came in. Seeing John at his Bible, he said, &quot;Are you interested in these things?&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Yes,&quot; John replied.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;How long has this been?&quot; asked his companion.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Exactly a week,&quot; he answered. &quot;For a whole week I have tried to get out my Bible to read to you, but I have not done so till now.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well,&quot; said his friend, &quot;it is a strange thing. I was converted on the same night, and I too was ashamed to take my Bible out.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You are ashamed to show your Bible and say, &quot;I have lived a godless life for all these years, but I will commence now to live a life of righteousness.&quot; You are ashamed to open your Bible and read that blessed psalm, &quot;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.&quot; You are ashamed to be seen on your knees.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No man can be a disciple of Jesus Christ without bearing his cross. A great many want to know how it is Christ has so few disciples whilst Muhammad has so many. The reason is, Muhammad gives no cross to bear.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There are so few who will come out to take their stand.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I was struck during the Civil War with the fact that there were so many who could go to the cannon&rsquo;s mouth without trembling but who had no courage to take up their Bibles to read them at night. They were ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the power of God unto salvation.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csD5FB87F7">&quot;But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.&quot;&ndash;Matt. 10:32,33.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC57700C4">4. The &quot;I Will&quot; of Service</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The next is the &quot;I will&quot; of service.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There are a good many Christians who have been quickened and aroused to say, &quot;I want to do some service for Christ.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Well, Christ says, &quot;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is no Christian who cannot help to bring someone to the Saviour. Christ says, &quot;And I, if I be lifted up&hellip;, will draw all men unto me&quot;; and our business is just to lift up Christ.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Our Lord said, &quot;Follow me, Peter, and I will make you a fisher of men&quot;; and Peter simply obeyed. On that day of Pentecost we see the result. I doubt if Peter ever caught so many fish in one day as he did men on that day. It would have broken every net they had on board if they had had to drag up three thousand fish.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I read some time ago of a man who took passage in a stagecoach. There were first-, second- and third-class passengers. But when he looked into the coach, he saw all the passengers sitting together without distinction. He could not understand it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">By and by they came to a hill. The coach stopped. The driver called out, &quot;First-class passengers keep their seats. Second-class passengers get out and walk. Third-class passengers get behind and push.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the church we have no room for first-class passengers&ndash;people who think salvation means an easy ride all the way to Heaven. We have no room for second-class passengers&ndash;people who are carried most of the time, and who, when they should be showing their faith by their works, go trudging on giving never a thought to helping their fellows along. All church members ought to be third-class passengers&ndash;ready to dismount and push with a will.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">John Wesley&rsquo;s definition of a church: &quot;All at it and always at it.&quot; Every Christian is to be a worker. He need not be a preacher or an evangelist to be useful. He may be useful in business. See what power an employer has with his employees! Often a man can be as useful in a business sphere as in another.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is one reason&ndash;and a great reason&ndash;why so many do not succeed at Christian service. I have been asked by a great many good men, &quot;Why is it we don&rsquo;t have any results? We work hard, pray hard, preach hard, yet the success does not come.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I tell them, &quot;Because you spend all your time mending nets. No wonder you never catch anything.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The great matter is to give invitations and compel sinners to come and thus pull the net in and see if you have caught anything. If you are always mending and setting the net, you won&rsquo;t catch many fish. Who ever heard of a man&rsquo;s going out to fish and setting his net, then letting it stop there and never pulling it in? Everybody would laugh at such a man&rsquo;s folly.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A minister in England came to me one day and said, &quot;I wish you would tell me why we ministers don&rsquo;t succeed better than we do.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I brought before him this idea of pulling in the net: &quot;You have to pull in your nets. There are many ministers in Manchester who can preach much better than I can, but I pull in the net.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many people have objections to giving invitations, but I urge upon them the importance of offering people the chance to make a decision.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The minister said, &quot;I never did pull in my net; but I will try next Sunday.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He did so, and eight anxious inquirers went into his study.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The next Sunday he came down to tell me he had never had such a Sunday in his life. He had met with marvelous blessing.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The next time he drew the net, there were forty. And when he came to see me later, he said to me joyfully, &quot;Moody, I have had eight hundred conversions this last year! It is a great mistake I did not begin earlier to pull in the net.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friends, if you want to catch men, just present the Gospel and pull in the net. If you only catch one, it will be something. It may be a little child, but I have known a little child to convert a whole family. You don&rsquo;t know what is in that little dull-headed boy in the inquiry room. He may become a Martin Luther, a reformer who shall make the world tremble.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God uses the weak things of this world to confound the mighty. God&rsquo;s promise is as good as a bank note. And here is one of Christ&rsquo;s promissory notes: &lsquo;If you follow Me, I will make you fishers of men.&rsquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Will you not lay hold of the promise and trust it and follow Him now?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If a man preaches the Gospel faithfully, he ought to expect results then and there. It is the privilege of God&rsquo;s children to reap the fruit of their labor three hundred sixty-five days in the year.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well, but is there not a sowing time as well as a harvest?&quot; you ask.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Yes, there is; but then, you can sow with one hand and reap with the other.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What would you think of a farmer who went on sowing all the year round and never thought of reaping? I repeat: we want to sow with one hand and reap with the other. And if we look for the fruit of our labors, we shall see it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I, if I be lifted up&hellip;, will draw all men unto me.&quot; We must lift Christ up, then seek men out and bring them to Him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You must use the right kind of bait. A good many don&rsquo;t do this, then they wonder why they are not successful. You see them getting up all kinds of entertainment with which to try to catch men. They go the wrong way to work.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This perishing world wants Christ and Him crucified. There&rsquo;s a void in every man&rsquo;s bosom that wants filling up, and if we only approach him with the right kind of bait, we shall catch him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This poor world needs a Saviour; and if we are going to be successful in catching men, we must preach Christ crucified&ndash;not His life only, but His death. And if we are only faithful in doing this, we shall succeed. Why? Because there is His promise: &lsquo;If you follow Me, I will make you fishers of men.&rsquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That promise holds just as good to you and me as it did to His disciples and is as true now as it was in their time.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">5. The &quot;I Will&quot; of Comfort</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The next &quot;I will&quot; is in John 14:18: &quot;I will not leave you comfortless.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is a sweet thought that Christ has not left us alone in this dark wilderness here below. Although He has gone up on high and taken His seat by the Father&rsquo;s throne, He has not left us comfortless.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In other words, He said, &quot;I will not leave you orphans.&quot; He did not leave Joseph. When they cast him into prison, &quot;God was with him.&quot; When Daniel was cast into the den of lions, they had to put the Almighty in with him. They were so bound together that they could not be separated.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If we have Christ with us, we can do all things. Let us not be thinking how weak we are. Let us lift up our eyes to Him and think of Him as our Elder Brother who has all power given to Him in Heaven and on earth. He says, &quot;Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some of our children and friends leave us, and it is a very sad hour. But the believer and Christ shall never be separated! He is with us here, and we shall be with Him in person by and by. We shall see Him in His beauty. But not only is He with us, but He has sent us the Holy Ghost. Let us honor the Holy Spirit by acknowledging that He is here in our midst. He has power to give sight to the blind, liberty to the captive, and to open the ears of the deaf that they may hear the glorious words of the Gospel.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">6. The &quot;I Will&quot; of Resurrection</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then there is another &quot;I will&quot; in John 6:40; it occurs four times in the chapter: &quot;I will raise him up at the last day.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I rejoice to think that I have a Saviour who has power over death. My blessed Master holds the keys of death and Hell. I pity the poor unbeliever and infidel who has no hope in the resurrection. But every child of God can open that chapter and read the promise, and his heart leaps within him for joy.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The tradesman generally puts the best specimens of his wares in the window to show us the quality of his stock. When Christ was down here, He gave us a specimen of what He could do. He raised three from the dead, that we might know what power He had&ndash;(1) Jairus&rsquo; daughter, (2) the widow&rsquo;s son, and (3) Lazarus of Bethany. He raised all three so every doubt might be swept away from our hearts.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">How dark and gloomy this world would be if we had no hope in the resurrection. But when we Christians lay our little children down in the grave, it is not without hope. We have seen them in the terrible struggle with death; but there has been one star to illumine the darkness and gloom&ndash;the thought that though the happy circle has been broken on earth, it shall be completed again in yon world of heavenly light.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You who have lost a loved one, rejoice as you read this &quot;I will&quot;! Those who have died in Christ shall come forth again by and by. The darkness shall flee away, and the morning light of the resurrection shall dawn upon us. It is only a little while, and the voice of Him who has said it shall come, shall be heard in the grave&ndash;&quot;I will raise him up at the last day.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Precious promise!

When he was seventeen, he had a long run of typhoid fever, and he never fully recovered from it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I did everything I could to bring him to Christ. He was a young man of considerable promise. I know no one who could sit down and discuss against the divinity of Christ like that man. I was not any match for him in argument. But day by day I preached to him as best I knew how.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I think I never loved a man on earth as I loved that brother. (I never knew what it was to love a father, because he died before I remember.) Because he was sickly, that drew my love and sympathy toward him; and oh, how my heart yearned for his salvation!</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">After preaching one night, I said, &quot;Now if any of this audience would like to take up his cross and follow Christ, I would like him to rise.&quot; I cannot tell you what a thrill of joy filled my soul when that brother of mine arose! It seemed the happiest night of my life. I was full of joy and thankfulness.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Afterwards my brother and I worked together for a time. We talked of the Gospel. And in the summer we sat upon the hillside and talked of the old home.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">After a year had passed, I went to Chicago. He was to go with me. He bid me good-bye, and I said, &quot;Samuel, I will see you in a few days, so I will only say good-bye till then.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A few days after, a telegram came, saying, &quot;Samuel is dead.&quot; I traveled a thousand miles to bury him. I got more comfort out of that promise, &quot;I will raise him up at the last day,&quot; than anything else in the Bible. How it cheered me! How it lighted up my path! As I went into the room and looked upon the lovely face of that brother, how that passage ran through my soul: &quot;Thy brother shall rise again.&quot; Thank God for that promise! It is worth more than the world to me.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When we laid him in the grave, it seemed as if I could hear the voice of Jesus Christ saying, &quot;Thy brother shall rise again.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Blessed promise of the resurrection! Blessed &quot;I will&quot;! &quot;I will raise him up at the last day.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC57700C4">7.

Many a believer&rsquo;s countenance begins to light up at the thought that he shall see the King in His beauty by and by.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Yes, there is a glorious day before us in the future. Some think that on the first day we are converted we have everything. To be sure, we get salvation for the past and peace for the present; but there is the glory for the future in store. That&rsquo;s what kept Paul rejoicing. He said, &lsquo;These light afflictions, these few stripes, these few brickbats and stones that they throw at me&ndash;why, the glory that is beyond excels them so much that I count them as nothing, nothing at all, so that I may win Christ.&rsquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And so, when things go against us, cheer up! Remember that the night will soon pass away, and the morning will dawn upon us. Death never comes there. It is banished from that heavenly land. Sickness, pain and sorrow come not there to mar that grand and glorious Home where we shall be by and by with the Master. God&rsquo;s family will be all together there.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Glorious future, my friends! Yes, glorious day! And it may be a great deal nearer than many of us think.

One chapter tells us all we know about him. One short sight of his career is all we have. He bursts in upon the scene and then disappears. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE EASTERN FEAST </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We are told that he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before them. In those days a feast in Eastern countries would sometimes last for six months. How long this feast had been going on we are not told, but in the midst of it, he &quot;commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">While this impious act was being committed, &quot;in the same hour came forth fingers of a man&#39;s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king&#39;s palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.&quot; We are not told at what hour of the day or the night it happened. Perhaps it was midnight. Perhaps nearly all the guests were more or less under the influence of drink; but they were not so drunk but that they suddenly became sober as they saw something that was supernatural--a handwriting on the wall, right over the golden candlestick. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Every face turned deathly pale &quot;The king&#39;s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.&quot; In haste he sent for his wisest men to come and read that handwriting on the wall. They came in one after another and tried to make it out; but they could not interpret it. The king promised that whoever could read it should be made the third ruler in the kingdom; that he should have gifts, and that a gold chain should be put around his neck. But the wise men tried in vain. The king was greatly troubled. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">At last, in the midst of the consternation, the queen came in, and she told the monarch, if he would only send for one who used to interpret the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar, he could read the writing and tell him the interpretation thereof. So Daniel was sent for. He was very familiar with it. He knew his Father&#39;s handwriting. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;This is the writing that was written, Mene. Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. This is the interpretation of the thing: Mene-- God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it. Tekel-- Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting. Peres-- Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians&quot; (Dan 5:25-28). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If someone had told the king an hour before that the time had come when he must step into the balances and be weighed, he would have laughed at the thought. But the vital hour had come. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The weighing was soon over. The verdict was announced, and the sentence carried out. &quot;In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Mede took the kingdom&quot; (Dan 5:30-31). Darius and his army came marching down those streets. There was a clash of arms. Shouts of war and victory rent the air. That night the king&#39;s blood mingled with the wine of the banquet hall. Judgment came upon him unexpectedly, suddenly: and probably ninety-nine out of every hundred judgments come in this way. Death comes upon us unexpectedly; it comes upon us suddenly. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Perhaps you say: &quot;I hope Mr. Moody is not going to compare me with that heathen king.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I tell you that a man who does evil in these gospel days is far worse than that king. We live in a land of Bibles. You can get the New Testament for a nickel, and if you haven&#39;t got a nickel, you can get it for nothing. Many societies will be glad to give it to you free. We live in the full blaze of Calvary. We live on this side of the cross, but Belshazzar lived more than five hundred years on the other side. He never heard of Jesus Christ. He never heard about the Son of God. He never heard about Cod except, perhaps, in connection with his father&#39;s remarkable vision. He probably had no portion of the Bible, and if he had, probably he didn&#39;t believe it. He had no godly minister to point Him to the Lamb of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Don&#39;t tell me that you are better than that king. I believe that he will rise in judgment and condemn many of us. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">All this happened long centuries ago. Let us get down to this century, to this year, to ourselves. We will come to the present time. Let us imagine that now, while I am preaching, down come some balances from the throne of God. They are fastened to the very throne itself. It is a throne of equity, of justice. You and I must be weighed. I venture to say this would be a very solemn audience. There would be no tiring There would be no indifference. No one would be thoughtless. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some people have their own balances. A great many are making balances to be weighed in. But after all we must be weighed in God&#39;s balances, the balances of the sanctuary. It is a favorite thing with infidels to set their own standard, to measure themselves by other people. But that will not do in the Day of Judgment. Now we will use God&#39;s law as a balance weight. When men find fault with the lives of professing Christians, it is a tribute to the law of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Tekel.&quot; It is a very short text. It is so short I am sure you will remember it: and that is my object, just to get people to remember God&#39;s own Word. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">GOD&#39;S HANDWRITING </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let me call your attention to the fact that God wrote on the tables of stone at Sinai as well as on the wall of Belshazzar&#39;s palace. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">These are the only messages to men that God has written with His own hand. He wrote the commandments out twice, and spoke them aloud in the hearing of Israel. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If it were known that God Himself were going to speak once again to man, what eagerness and excitement there would be! For nearly nineteen hundred years He has been silent. No inspired message has been added to the Bible for nearly nineteen hundred years. How eagerly all men would listen if God should speak once more. Yet men forget that the Bible is God&#39;s own Word, and that it is as truly His message today as when it was delivered of old. The law that was given at Sinai has lost none of its solemnity. Time cannot wear out its authority or the fact of its authorship. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can imagine someone saying, &quot;I won&#39;t be weighed by that law. I don&#39;t believe in it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now men may cavil as much as they like about other parts of the Bible, but I have never met an honest man that found fault with the Ten Commandments. Infidels may mock the Lawgiver and reject Him who has delivered us from the curse of the law, but they can&#39;t help admitting that the commandments are right. Renan said that they are for all nations, and will remain the commandments of God during all the centuries. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If God created this world, He must make some laws to govern it. In order to make life safe we must have good laws; there is not a country the sun shines upon that does not possess laws. Now this is God&#39;s law. It has come from on high, and infidels and skeptics have to admitthatitis pure. Legislatures nearly all over the world adopt it as the foundation of their legal systems. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the the simple: the statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes (Ps 19:7-8). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now the question for you and me is-- are we keeping these commandments? Have we fulfilled all the requirements of the law? If God made us, as we know He did, He had a right to make that law; and if we don&#39;t use it aright it would have been better for us if we had never had it, for it will condemn us. We shall be found wanting. The law is all right, but are we right? </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">AN INFIDEL&#39;S TESTIMONY </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is related of a clever infidel that he sought an acquaintance with the truths of the Bible, and began to read at the books of Moses. He had been in the habit of sneering at the Bible, and in order to be able to refute arguments brought by Christian men, he made up his mind, as he knew nothing about it, to reed the Bible and get some idea of its contents. After he had reached the Ten Commandments, he raid to a friend: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I will tell you what I used to think. I supposed that Moses was the leader of a horde of bandits; that, having a strong mind, he acquired great influence over a superstitious people; and that on Mount Sinai he played off some sort of fireworks to the amazement of his ignorant followers, who imagined in their fear and superstition that the exhibition was supernatural. I have been looking into the nature of that law. I have been trying to see whether I could add anything to it, or take anything from it, so as to make it better. Sir, I cannot! It is perfect! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;The first commandment directs us to make the Creator the object of our supreme love and reverence. That is right. If He be our Creator, Preserver, and supreme Benefactor, we ought to treat Him, and none other, as such. The second forbids idolatry. That certainly is right. The third forbids profanity. The fourth fixes a time for religious worship. If there be a God, He ought surely to be worshipped. It is suitable that there should be an outward homage significant of our inward regard. If God be worshipped, it is proper that some time should be set apart for that purpose, when all may worship Him harmoniously, and without interruption. One day in seven is certainly not too much, and I do not know that it is too little. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;The fifth commandment defines the peculiar duties arising from family relations. Injuries to our neighbor are then classified by the moral law. They are divided into offenses against life, chastity, property, and character; and I notice that the greatest offense in each class is expressly forbidden. Thus the greatest injury to life is murder; to chastity, adultery; to property, theft; to character, perjury. Now the greatest offense must include the least of the same kind. Murder must include the least of the same kind. Murder must include every injury to life; adultery every injury to purity, and so of the rest. And the moral code is closed and perfected by a command forbidding every improper desire in regard to our neighbors. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I have been thinking. Where did Moses get that law? I have read history. The Egyptians and the adjacent nations were idolaters; so were the Greeks and Romans; and the wisest or best Creeks or Romans never gave a code of morals like this. Where did Moses obtain that law, which surpasses the wisdom and philosophy of the most enlightened ages? He lived at a period comparatively barbarous; but he has given a law in which the learning and sagacity of all subsequent time can detect no flaw. Where did he obtain it? He could not have soared so far above his age as to have devised it himself. I am satisfied where he obtained it. It came down from heaven. It has convinced me of the truth of the religion of the Bible.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The former infidel remained to his death a firm believer in the truth of Christianity. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We call it the &quot;Mosaic&quot; law, but it has been well said that the commandments did not originate with Moses, nor were they done away with when the Mosaic law was fulfilled in Christ, and many of its ceremonies and regulations abolished. We can find no trace of the existence of any lawmaking body in those early times, no parliament, or congress that built up a system of laws. It has come down to us complete and finished, and the only satisfactory account is that which tells us that God Himself wrote the commandments on tables of stone. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">BINDING TODAY </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some people seem to think we have got beyond the commandments. What did Christ say? &quot;Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets; I am not come to destroy but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one title shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&quot; The commandments of God given to Moses in the Mount at Horeb are as binding today as ever they have been since the time they were proclaimed in the hearing of the people. The Jews said the law was not given in Palestine (which belonged to Israel), but in the wilderness, because the law was for all nations. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Jesus never condemned the law and the prophets, but He did condemn those who did not obey them. Because He gave new commandments, it does not follow that He abolished the old. Christ&#39;s explanation of them made them all the more searching. In His Sermon on the Mount, He carried the principles of the commandments beyond the mere letter. He unfolded them and showed that they embraced more, that they are positive as well as prohibitive. The Old Testament closes with these words: &quot;Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse&quot; (Mal 4:4-6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Does that look as if the law of Moses was becoming obsolete? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The conviction deepens in me with the years that the old truths of the Bible must be stated and restated in the plainest possible language. I do not remember ever to have heard a sermon preached on the commandments. I have an index of two thousand five hundred sermons preached by Spurgeon, and not one of them selects its text from the first seventeen verses of Exodus 20. The people must be made to understand that the Ten Commandments are still binding, and that there is a penalty attached to their violation. We do not want a gospel of mere sentiment. The Sermon on the Mount did not blot out the Ten Commandments. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When Christ came He condensed the statement of the law into this form: &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind and with all thy strength . . . [and] thy neighbor as thyself&quot; (Mk 12:30,31). Paul said: &quot;Love is the fulfilling of the law&quot; (Ro 13:10). But does this mean that the detailed precepts of the Decalogue are superseded and have become back numbers? Does a father cease to give children rules to obey because they love him? Does a nation burn its statute books because the people have become patriotic? Not at all. And yet people speak as if the commandments do not hold for Christians because they have come to love God. Paul said: &quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law&quot; (Ro 3:31). It still holds good. The Commandments are necessary. So long as we obey, they do not rest heavy upon us; but as soon as we try to break away, we find they are like fences to keep us within bounds. Horses need bridles even after they have been properly broken in. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;We know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&quot; (1 Ti 1:8-10). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, my friend, are you ready to be weighed by this law of God? A great many people say that if they keep the commandments they do not need to be forgiven and saved through Christ. But have you kept them? I will admit that if you perfectly keep the commandments, you do not need to be saved by Christ; but is there a man in the wide world who can truly say that he has done this? Young lady, can you say: &quot;I am ready to be weighed by the law7 Can you, young man? Will you step into the scales and be weighed one by one by the Ten Commandments? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now face these Ten Commandments honestly and prayerfully. See if your life is right, and if you are treating God fairly. God&#39;s statutes are just, are they not? If they are right, let us see if we are right. Let us get alone with God and read His law-- read it carefully and prayerfully, and ask Him to forgive us our sin and what He would have us to do. </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">

			<span class="csE76D6F74">FEELING AFTER GOD </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Philosophers are agreed that even the most primitive races of mankind reach out beyond the world of matter to a superior Being. It is as natural for man to feel after God as it is for the ivy to feel after a sup port. Hunger and thirst drive man to seek for food, and there is a hunger of the soul that needs satisfying, too. Man does not need to be commanded to worship, as there is not a race so high or so low in the scale of civilization but has some kind of god. What he needs is to be directed aright. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This is what the first commandment is for. Before we can worship intelligently, we must know what or whom to worship. God does not leave us in ignorance. When Paul went to Athens, he found an altar dedicated to &quot;The Unknown God,&quot; and he proceeded to tell of Him whom we worship. When God gave the commandments to Moses, He commenced with a declaration of His own character, and demanded exclusive recognition. &quot;I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me&quot; (Ex 20:2-3). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Dr. Dale says these words have great significance. The Jews &quot;knew Jehovah as the God who had held back the waves like a wall while they fled across the sea to escape the vengeance of their enemies; they knew Him as the God who had sent thunder, and lightning, and hail, plagues on cattle, and plagues on men, to punish the Egyptians and to compel them to let the children of Israel go; they knew Him as the God whose angel had slain the firstborn of their oppressors, and filled the land from end to end with death, and agony, and terror. He was the same God, so Moses and Aaron told them, who by visions and voices, in promises and precepts, had revealed Himself long before to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We learn what men are from what they say and from what they do. A biography of Luther gives us a more vivid and trustworthy knowledge of the man than the most philosophical essay on his character and creed. The story of his imprisonment and of his journey to Worms, his Letters, his Sermons, and his Table Talk, are worth more than the most elaborate speculations about him. The Jews learned what God is, not from theological dissertations on the Divine attributes, but from the facts of a Divine history. They knew Him for themselves in His own acts and in His own words.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Someone asked an Arab: &quot;How do you know that there is a God?&quot; &quot;How do I know whether a man or a camel passed my tent last night?&quot; he replied. God&#39;s footprints in nature and in our own experience are the best evidence of His existence and character. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">ISRAELITES EXPOSED TO DANGER </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Remember to whom this commandment was given, and we shall see further how necessary it was. The forefathers of the Israelites had worshiped idols, not many generations back. They had recently been delivered out of Egypt, a land of many gods. The Egyptians worshipped the sun, the moon, insects, animals, etc. The ten plagues were undoubtedly meant by God to bring confusion upon many of their sacred objects. The children of Israel were going up to take possession of a land that was inhabited by heathen, who also worshipped idols. There was therefore great need of such a commandment as this. There could be no right relationship between God and man in those days any more than today, until man understood that he must recognize God alone, and not offer Him a divided heart. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If He created us, He certainly ought to have our homage. Is it not right that He should have the first and only place in our affections? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">NO COMPROMISE This is one matter in which no toleration can be shown. Religious liberty is a good thing, within certain limits. But it is one thing to show toleration to those who agree on essentials, and another, to those who differ on fundamental beliefs. They were willing to admit any god to the Roman Pantheon. One reason the early Christians were persecuted was that they would not accept a place for Jesus Christ there. Napoleon is said to have entertained the idea of having separate temples in Paris for every known religion, so that every stranger should have a place of worship when attracted toward that city. Such plans are directly opposed to the divine one. God sounded no uncertain note in this commandment. It is plain, unmistakable, uncompromising. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We may learn a lesson from the way a farmer deals with the little shoots that spring up around the trunk of an apple tree. They look promising, and one who has not learned better might welcome their growth. But the farmer knows that they will draw the life-sap from the main tree, injuring its prospects so that it will produce inferior fruit. He therefore takes his axe and his hoe, and cuts away these suckers. The tree then gives a more plentiful and finer crop. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">GOD&#39;S PRUNING-KNIFE </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Thou shalt not&quot; is the pruning-knife that God uses. From beginning to end, the Bible calls for wholehearted allegiance to Him. There is to be no compromise with other gods. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It took long years for God to impress this lesson upon the Israelites. He called them to be a chosen nation. He made them a peculiar people. But you will notice in Bible history that they turned away from Him continually, and were punished with plague, pestilence, war, and famine. Their sin was not that they renounced God altogether, but that they wanted to worship other gods beside Him. Take the case of Solomon as an example of the whole nation. He married heathen wives who turned away his heart after other gods, and built high places for their idols, and lent countenance to their worship. That was the history of frequent turnings of the whole nation away from God, until finally He sent them into captivity in Babylon and kept them there for seventy years. Since then the Jews have never turned to other gods. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Hasn&#39;t the church to contend with the same difficulty today? There are very few who in their hearts do not believe in God, but what they will not do is give Him exclusive right of way. Missionaries tell us that they could easily get converts if they did not require them to be baptized, thus publicly renouncing their idols. Many a person in our land would become a Christian if the gate was not so strait. Christianity is too strict for them. They are not ready to promise full allegiance to God alone. Many a professing Christian is a stumbling block because his worship is divided. On Sunday he worships God; on weekdays God has little or no place in his thoughts. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">FALSE GODS IN AMERICA TODAY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">YOU don&#39;t have to go to heathen lands today to find false gods. America is full of them. Whatever you make most of is your god. Whatever you love more than God is your idol. Many a man&#39;s heart is like some Kafirs&#39; huts, so full of idols that there is hardly room to turn around. Rich and poor, learned and unlearned, all classes of men and women are guilty of this sin. &quot;The mean man boweth down, and me great man humbleth himself&quot; (Is 2:9). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A man may make a god of himself, of a child, of a mother, of some precious gift that God has bestowed upon him. He may forget the Giver and let his heart go out in adoration toward the gift. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many make a god of pleasure; that is what their hearts are set on. If some old Greek or Roman came to life again and saw man in a drunken debauch, would he believe that the worship of Bacchus had died out? If he saw the streets of our large cities filled with harlots, would he believe that the worship of Venus had ceased? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Others take fashion as their god. They give their time and thought to dress. They fear what others will think of them. Do not let us flatter ourselves that all idolaters are in heathen countries. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">With many it is the god of money. We haven&#39;t got through worshiping the golden calf yet. If a man will s+ll his principles for gold, isn&#39;t he making it a god? If he trusts in his wealth to keep him from want and to supply his needs, are not riches his god? Many a man says, &quot;Give me money, and I will give you heaven. What care I for all the glories and treasures of heaven? Give me treasures here! I don&#39;t care for heaven! I want to be a successful businessman.&quot; How true are the words of Job: &quot;If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; if I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had begotten much; if I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above&quot; (Job 31: 24-28). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But all false gods are not as gross as these. There is the atheist. He says that he does not believe in God; he denies His existence, but he can&#39;t help setting up some other god in His place. Voltaire said, &quot;If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent one.&quot; So the atheist speaks of the Great Unknown, the First Cause, the Infinite Mind, etc. Then there is the deist. He is a man who believes in one God who caused all things; but he doesn&#39;t believe in revelation. He only accepts such truths as can be discovered by reason. He doesn&#39;t believe in Jesus Christ, or in the inspiration of the Bible. Then there is the antheist, who says: &quot;I believe that the whole universe is God. He is in the air, the water, the sun, the stars&quot; the liar and the thief included. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">MOSES FAREWELL MESSAGE </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let me call your attention to a verse in the thirty- second chapter of Deuteronomy, thirty-first verse: &quot;For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.&quot; These words were uttered by Moses, in his farewell address to Israel. He had been with them forty years. He was their leader and instructor. All the blessings of heaven came to them through him. And now the old man is about to leave them. If you have never read his speech, do so. It is one of the best sermons in print. I know few sermons in the Old or New Testament that compare with it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can see Moses as he delivers this address. His natural activity has not abated. He still has the vigor of youth. His long white hair flows over his shoulders, and his venerable beard covers his breast. He throws down the challenge: &quot;Their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Has the human heart ever been satisfied with these false gods? Can pleasure or riches fill the soul that is empty of God? How about the atheist, the deist, the pantheist? What do they look forward to? Nothing! Man&#39;s life is full of trouble; but when the billows of affliction and disappointment are rising and rolling over them, they have no God to call upon. They shall &quot;cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble&quot; (Jer 11:12). Therefore I contend &quot;their rock is not as our Rock.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friends, when the hour of affliction comes, they call in a minister to give consolation. When I was settled in Chicago, I used to be called out to attend many funerals. I would inquire what the man was in his belief. If I found out he was an atheist, or a deist, or a pantheist, when I went to the funeral and in the presence of his friends, said one word about that man&#39;s doctrine, they would feel insulted. Why is it that in a trying hour, when they have been talking all the time against God--why is it that in the darkness of affliction they call in believers in that God to administer consolation? Why doesn&#39;t the atheist preach no hereafter, no heaven, no God in the hour of affliction? This very fact is an admission that &quot;their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The deist says there is no use in praying, because nothing can change the decrees of deity; God never answers prayer. Is his rock as our Rock? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Bible is true. There is only one God. How many men have said to me: &quot;Mr. Moody, I would give the world if I had your faith, your consolation, the hope you have with your religion.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Isn&#39;t that a proof that their rock is not as our Rock? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some years ago I went into a man&#39;s house, and when I commenced to talk about religion he turned to his daughter and said: &quot;You had better leave the room. I want to say a few words to Mr. Moody.&quot; When she had gone, he opened a perfect torrent of infidelity upon me. &quot;Why did you send your daughter out of the room before you said this?&quot; I asked. &quot;Well,&quot; he replied, &quot;I did not think it would do her any good to hear what I said.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Is his rock as our Rock? Would he have sent his daughter out if he really believed what he said? </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">NO CONSOLATION EXCEPT IN GOD </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No. There is no satisfaction for the soul except in the God of the Bible. We come back to Paul&#39;s words and get consolation for time and eternity: &quot;We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth (as there be gods many, and lords many), but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him&quot; (I Co 8:4- 6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friend, can you say that sincerely? Is all your hope centered on God in Christ? Are you trusting Him alone? Are you ready to step into the scales and be weighed against this first commandment? </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">WHOLEHEARTED ALLEGIANCE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God will not accept a divided heart. He must be absolute monarch. There is not room in your heart for two thrones. Christ said: &quot;No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon&quot; (Mt 6: 24). Mark you, He did not say, &quot;No man shall serve ... Ye shall not serve&quot; but &quot;No man can serve.. .Ye cannot serve.&quot; That means more than a command; it means that you cannot mix the worship of the true God with the worship of another god any more than you can mix oil and water. It cannot be done. There is not room for any other throne in the heart if Christ is there. If worldliness should come in, godliness would go out. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The road to heaven and the road to hell lead in different directions. Which master will you choose to follow? Be an out-and-out Christian. Him only shall you serve. Only thus can you be well pleasing to God. The Jews were punished with seventy years of captivity because they worshiped false gods. They have suffered nineteen hundred years because they rejected the Messiah. Will you incur God&#39;s displeasure by rejecting Christ too? He died to save you. Trust Him with your whole heart, for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe that when Christ has the first place in our hearts--when the kingdom of God is first in everything--we shall have power, and we shall not have power until we give Him His rightfulplace. If we let some false god come in and steal our love away from the God of heaven, we shall have no peace or power. </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Second Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt nor bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, which we have just considered, points out the one true object of worship; this commandment, is to tell us the right way in which to worship. The former commands us to worship God alone; this calls for purity and spirituality as we approach Him. The former condemns the worship of false gods; this prohibits false forms. It relates more especially to outward acts of worship; but these are only the expression of what is in the heart. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Perhaps you will say that there is no trouble about this weight. We might go off to other ages or other lands and find people who make images and bow down to them; but we have none here. Let us see if this is true. Let us step into the scales and see if we can turn them when weighed against this commandment. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe this is where the battle is fought. Satan tries to keep us from worshiping God aright, and from making Him first in everything. If I let some image made by man get into my heart and take the place of God the Creator, it is a Sin. I believe that Satan is willing to have us worship anything, however sacred--the Bible, the crucifix, the church--if only we do not worship God Himself. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You cannot find a place in the Bible where a man has been allowed to bow down and worship anyone but the God of heaven and Jesus Christ His Son. In the book of Revelation when an angel came down to John, he was about to fall down and worship him, but the angel would not let him. If an angel from heaven is not to be worshiped, when you find people bowing down to pictures, to images, even when they bow down to worship the cross, it is a sin. There are a great many who seem to be carried away with these things. &quot;Thou shalt have no other gods before me.&quot; &quot;Thou shalt not bow down thyself to any graven image.&quot; God wants us to worship Him only, and if we do not believe that Jesus Christ is God manifest in the flesh we should not worship Him. I have no more doubt about the divinity of Christ than I have that I exist. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Worship involves two things: the internal belief, and the external act. We transgress in our hearts by having a wrong conception of God and of Jesus Christ before ever we give public expression in action. As someone has said, it is wrong to have loose opinions as well as to be guilty of loose practices. That is what Paul meant when he said: &quot;We ought not to think , that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver, or stone, graven by art and man&#39;s device&quot; (Acts 17:29, italics added). The opinions that some people hold about Christ are not in accordance with the Bible and are real violations of this second commandment. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A QUESTION</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The question at once arises--is this commandment intended to forbid the use of drawings and pictures of created things altogether? Some contend that it does. They point to the Jews and the Muslims as a proof. The Jews have never been much given to art. The Muslims to this day do not use designs of animals, etc., in patterns. But I do not agree with them. I think God only meant to forbid images and other representations when these were intended to be used as objects of religious veneration. &quot;Thou shalt not make unto thee ... Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.&quot; In Exodus we are told that God ordered the bowls of the golden candlestick for the tabernacle to be made &quot;like unto almonds, with a knop and a Aower&quot; (Ex 25:33); and the robe of the ephod had a hem on which they were to put a bell and a pomegranate alternately. How could God order something that broke this second commandment? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe that this commandment is a call for spiritual worship. It is in line with Christ&#39;s declaration to that Samaritan woman, &quot;God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth&quot; (Jn 4:24). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This is precisely what is difficult for men to do. The apostles were hardly in their graves before people began to put up images of them, and to worship relics. People have a desire for something tangible, something that they can see. That is why there is a demand for ritualism. Some people are born Puritans; they want a simple form of worship. Others think they cannot get along without forms and ceremonies that appeal to the senses. And many a one whose heart is not sincere before God takes refuge in these forms, and eases his conscience by making an outward show of religion. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The second commandment is to restrain this desire and tendency. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God is grieved when we are untrue to Him. God is love, and He is wounded when our affections are transferred to anything else. The penalty attached to this commandment teaches us that man has to reap what he sows, whether good or bad; and not only that, but his children have to reap with him. Notice that punishment is visited upon the children unto the third or the fourth generation, while mercy is shown unto thousands, or (as it is more correctly) unto the thousandth generation. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE FOLLY OF IMAGES</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Think for a moment, and you will see how idle it is to try to make any representation of God. Christians have tried to paint the Trinity, but how can you depict the invisible? Can you draw a picture of your own soul or spirit or will? Moses impressed it upon Israel that when God spake to them out of the midst of the fire they saw no manner of similitude, but only heard His voice. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A [manmade] picture or [manmade] image of God must degrade our conception of Him. It fastens us down to one idea, whereas we ought to grow in grace and in knowledge. It makes God finite. It brings Him down to our level. It has given rise to the horrible idols of India and China, because they fashion these images according to their own notions. How would the president feel if Americans made such hideous objects to resemble him as they make of their gods in heathen countries? Isaiah bore down with tremendous irony upon the folly of idol-makers: upon the smith who fashioned gods with tongs and hammers; and upon the carpenter who took a tree, and used part of it for a fire to warm himself and roast his meat, and made part of it in the figure of a man with his rule and plane and compass, and called it his god and worshiped it. &quot;A deceived heart hath turned him aside.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A man must be greater than anything he is able to make or manufacture. What folly then to think of worshiping such things! The tendency of the human heart to represent God by something that appeals to the senses is the origin of all idolatry. It leads directly to image-worship. At first there may be no desire to worship the thing itself, but it inevitably ends in that. As Dr. Mac Laren says: &quot;Enlisting the senses as allies of the spirit is risky work. They are apt to fight for their own hand when they once begin, and the history of all symbolical and ceremonial worship shows that the experiment is much more likely to end in religion than in spiritualizing sense.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If, every day, I bow before a crucifix in prayer, if I address it as though it were Christ, though I know it is not, I shall come to feel for it a reverence and love which are of the very essence of idolatry.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Did you ever stop to think that the world has not a single [manmade] picture of Christ that has been handed down to us from His disciples? Who knows what He was like? The Bible does not tell us how He looked, except in one or two isolated general expressions as when it says, &quot;His visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.&quot; We don&#39;t know anything definite about His features, the color of His hair and eyes, and the other details that would help to give a true representation. What artist can tell us? He left no keepsakes to His disciples. His clothes were seized by the Roman soldiers who crucified Him. Not a solitary thing was left to be handed down among His followers. Doesn&#39;t it look as if Christ left no relies lest they should be held sacred and worshiped? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">History tells us further that the early Christians shrank from making pictures and statues of any kind of Christ. They knew Him as they had seen Him after His resurrection, and had promises of His continued presence that pictures could not make any more real. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have seen very few pictures of Christ that do not repel me more or less. I sometimes think that it is wrong to have pictures of Him at all. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Speaking of the crucifix Dr. Dale says: &quot;It makes our worship and our prayer unreal. We are adoring a Christ who does not exist. He is not on the cross now, but on the throne. His agonies are past forever. He has risen from the dead. He is at the right hand of God. If we pray to a dying Christ, we are praying not to Christ Himself, but to a mere remembrance of Him. The injury which the crucifix has inflicted on the religious life of Christendom, in encouraging a morbid and unreal devotion, is absolutely incalculable. It has given us a dying Christ instead of a living Christ, a Christ separated from us by many centuries instead of a Christ nigh at hand.&quot; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE INDWELLING CHRIST</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No one can say that we have nowadays any need of such things. &quot;Behold I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.&quot; If Christ is in our hearts, why need we set Him before our eyes? &quot;Where two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.&quot; If we take hold of that promise by faith, what need is there of outward symbols and reminders? If the King Himself is present, why need we bow down before statues supposed to represent Him? To fill His place with an image, someone has said, is like blotting the sun out of the heavens and substituting some other light in its place: &quot;You cannot see Him through chinks of ceremonialism; or through the blind eyes of erring man; or by images graven with art and man&#39;s device; or in cunningly devised fables of artificial and perverted theology. Nay, seek Him in His own Word, in the revelation of Himself which He gives to all who walk in His ways. So you will be able to keep that admonition of the last word of all the New Testament revelation: little children, keep yourselves from idols&quot; (1 Jn 5:21 ). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe many an earnest Christian would be found wanting if put in the balances against this commandment &quot;Tekel&quot; is the sentence that would be written against them, because their worship of God and of Christ is not pure. May God open our eyes to the danger that is creeping more and more into public worship throughout Christendom! Let us ever bear in mind Christ&#39;s words in the fourth chapter of John&#39;s Gospel, which show that true spiritual worship is not a matter of special times and special places because it is of all times and all places: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall &quot; neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father... . But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth&quot; (Jn 4:21-24). </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Third Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Thou shall nor take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I WAS GREATLY AMAZED not long ago in talking to a man who thought he was a Christian, to find that once in a while, when he got angry, he would swear. Isaid: &quot;My friend, I don&#39;t see how you can tear down with one hand what you are trying to build up with the other. I don&#39;t see how you can profess to be a child of God and let those words come out of your lips.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He replied: &quot;Mr. Moody, if you knew me you would understand. I have a very quick temper. I inherited it from my father and mother, and it is uncontrollable; but my swearing comes only from the Iips.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When God said, &quot;I will not hold him guiltless that takes my name in vain,&quot; He meant what He said, and I don&#39;t believe anyone can be a true child of God who takes the name of God in vain. What is the grace of God for, if it is not to give me control of my temper so that I shall not lose control and bring down the curse of God upon myself? When a man is born of God, God takes the &quot;swear&quot; out of him. Make the fountain good, and the stream will be good. Let the heart be right; then the language will be right; the whole life will be right. But no man can serve God and keep His law until he is born of God. There we see the necessity of the new birth. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">To take God&#39;s name &quot;in vain&quot; means either (1) lightly, without thinking, flippantly; or (2) profanely, deceitfully. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">USING GOD&#39;S NAME IRREVERENTLY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I think it is shocking to use God&#39;s name with so little reverence as is common nowadays, even among professing Christians. We are told that the Jews held it so sacred that the covenant name of God was never mentioned amongst them except once a year by the high priest on the Day of Atonement, when he went into the holy of holies. What a contrast that is to the familiar use Christians make of it in public and private worship! We are apt to rush into God&#39;s presence and rush out again without any real sense of the reverence and awe that is due Him. We forget that we are on holy ground. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Do you know how often the word &quot;reverend&quot; occurs in the Bible? Only once. And what is it used in connection with? God&#39;s name. Psalm 11:9: &quot;holy and reverend is his name.&quot; So important did the Jewish rabbi consider this commandment that they said the whole world trembled when it was first proclaimed on Sinai. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">USING GOD&#39;S NAME PROFANELY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But though there is far too much of this frivolous, familiar use of God&#39;s name, the commandment is broken a great deal more by profanity. Taking the name of God in vain is blasphemy. Is there a swearing man who reads this? What would you do if you were put into the balances of the sanctuary, if you had to step in opposite to this third commandment? Think a moment Have you been taking God&#39;s name in vain today? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I do not believe men would ever have been guilty of swearing unless God had forbidden it. They do not swear by their friends, their fathers or mothers, their wives or children. They want to show how they despise God&#39;s law. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A great many men think there is nothing in swearing. Bear in mind that God sees something wrong in it, and He says He will not hold men guiltless, even though society does. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I met a man sometime ago who told me he had never sinned in his life. He was the first perfect man I had ever met. I thought I would question him, and began to measure him by the law. I asked him: &quot;Do you ever get angry?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;sometimes I do; but I have a right to do so. It is righteous indignation.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Do you swear when you get angry?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He admitted he did sometimes. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Then,&quot; I asked, &quot;are you ready to meet God?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;because I never mean anything when I swear.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose I steal a man&#39;s watch and he comes after me. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Yes,&quot; I say, &quot;I stole your watch and pawned it, but I did not mean anything by it. I pawned it and spent the money, but I did nor mean anything by it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You would smile at and deride such a statement. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ah, friends! You cannot trifle with God in that way. Even if you swear without meaning it, it is forbidden by God. Christ said: &quot;Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment; for by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned&quot; (Mt 12:36, 37). You will be held accountable whether your words are idle or blasphemous. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A SENSELESS HABIT</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The habit of swearing is condemned by all sensible persons. It has been called &quot;the most gratuitous of all sin,,&quot; because no one gains by it; it is &quot;not only sinful, but useless.&quot; An old writer said that when the accusing angel, who records men&#39;s words, flies up to heaven with an oath, he blushes as he hands it in. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When a man blasphemes, he shows an utter contempt for God. I was in the army during the war, and heard men cursing and swearing. Some godly woman would pass along the ranks looking for her wounded son, and not an oath would be heard. They would not swear before their mothers, or their wives, or their sisters; they had more respect for them than they had for God! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Isn&#39;t it a terrible condemnation that swearing held its own until it came to be recognized as a vulgar thing, a sin against society? Men dropped it then, who never thought of its being a sin against God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There will be no swearing men in the kingdom of God. They will have to drop that sin, and repent of it, before they see the kingdom of God. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">HOW TO KEEP FROM SWEARING</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Men often ask: &quot;How can I keep from swearing?&quot; I will tell you. If God puts His love into your heart, you will have no desire to curse Him. If you have much regard for God, you will no more think of cursing Him than you would think of speaking lightly or disparagingly of a mother whom you love. But the natural man is at enmity with God and has utter contempt for His law. When that law is written on his heart, there will be no trouble in obeying it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was out west about thirty years ago, I was preaching one day in the open air, when a man drove up in a fine turn-out, and after listening a little while to what I was saying, he put the whip to his fine-looking steed, and away he went, I never expected to see him again, but the next night he came back, and he kept on coming regularly night after night. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I noticed that his forehead itched--you have noticed people who keep putting their hands to their foreheads?--he didn&#39;t want any one to see him shedding tears--of course not! It is not a manly thing to shed tears in a religious meeting, of course! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">After the meeting I said to a gentleman: &quot;Who is that man who drives up here every night? Is he interested?&quot; &quot;Interested! I should think not! You should have heard the way he talked about you today.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;that is a sign he is interested.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If no man ever has anything to say against you, your Christianity isn&#39;t worth much. Men said of the Master, &quot;He has a devil,&quot; and Jesus said that if they had called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I asked where this man lived, but my friend told me not to go to see him, for he would only curse me. I said: &quot;It takes God to curse a man; man can only bring curses on his own head.&quot; I found out where he lived and went to see him. He was the wealthiest man within a hundred miles of that place, and had a wife and seven beautiful children. Just as I got to his gate I saw him coming out of the front door. I stepped up to him and said: &quot;This is Mr. ~, I believe?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He said, &quot;Yes, sir; that is my name.&quot; Then he straightened up and asked-- &quot;What do you want?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I would like to ask you a question, if you won&#39;t be angry.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well, what is it?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I am told that God has blessed you above all men in this part of the country; that He has given you wealth, a beautiful Christian wife, and seven lovely children. I do not know if it is true, but I hear that all He gets in return is cursing and blasphemy&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He said, &quot;Come in; come in.&quot; I went in. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;what you said out there is true. If any man has a fine wife I am the man, and I have a lovely family of children, and God has been good to me. But do you know, we had company here the other night, and I cursed my wife at the table and did not know it till after the company had gone. I never felt so mean and contemptible in my life as when my wife told me of it. She said she wanted the floor to open and let her down out of her seat. If I have tried once, I have tried a hundred times to stop swearing. You preachers don&#39;t know anything about it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Yes,&quot; I said,&#39; know all about it; I have been a drummer.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;you don&#39;t know anything about a businessman&#39;s troubles. When he is harassed and tormented the whole time, he can&#39;t help swearing.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; I said, &quot;he can. I know something about it. I used to swear myself.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;What! You used to swear?&quot; he asked; &quot;how did you stop?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I never stopped.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Why, you don&#39;t swear now, do you?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No; I have not sworn for years.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;How did you stop?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I never stopped. It stopped itself.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He said, &quot;I don&#39;t understand this.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;I know you don&#39;t. But I came up to talk to you, so that you will never want to swear as long as you live.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I began to tell him about Christ in the heart; how that would take the temptation to swear out of a man. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;how am I to get Christ?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Get right down here and tell Him what you want.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;I was never on my knees in my Life. I have been cursing all the day, and I don&#39;t know how to pray or what to pray for.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;it is mortifying to have to call on God for mercy when you have never used His name except in oaths; but He will not turn you away. Ask God to forgive you if you want to be forgiven.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then the man got down and prayed-- only a few sentences, but thank God, it is the short prayers, after all, which bring the quickest answers. After he prayed he got up and said: &quot;What shall I do now?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I said, &quot;Go down to the church and tell the people there that you want to be an out-and-out Christian.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I cannot do that,&quot; he said; &quot;I never go to church except to some funeral.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Then it is high time for you to go for something else,&quot;I said. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">After a while he promised to go, but did not know what the people would say. At the next church prayer meeting, the man was there, and I sat right in front of him. He stood up and put his hands on the settee, and he trembled so much that I could feel the settee shake. He said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;My friends, you know all about me. If God can save a wretch like me, I want to have you pray for my salvation.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That was thirty odd years ago. Sometime ago I was back in that town, and did not see him; but when I was in California, a man asked me to take dinner with him. I told him that I could not do so, for I had another engagement. Then he asked if I remembered him, and told me his name. &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;tell me, have you ever sworn since that night you knelt in your drawing-room, and asked God to forgive you?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;I have never had a desire to swear since then. It was all taken away.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He was not only converted, but became an earnest, active Christian, and all these years has been serving God. That is what will take place when a man is born of the divine nature. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Is there a swearing man ready to put this commandment into the scales, and step in to be weighed? Suppose you swear only once in six months or a year--suppose you swear only once in ten years--do you think God will hold you guiltless for the act? It shows that your heart is not clean in God&#39;s sight. What are you going to do, blasphemer? Would you not be found wanting? You would be like a feather in the balance. </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Fourth Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant. nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">THERE HAS BEEN an awful letting-down in this country regarding the Sabbath during the last twenty-five years, and many a man has been shorn of spiritual power, like Samson, because he is not straight on this question. Can you say that you observe the Sabbath properly? You may be a professed Christian: are you obeying this commandment? Or do you neglect the house of God on the Sabbath day, and spend your time drinking and carousing in places of vice and crime, showing contempt for God and His law? Are you ready to step into the scales? Where were you last Sabbath? How did you spend it? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I honestly believe that this commandment is just as binding today as it ever was. I have talked with men who have said that it has been abrogated, but they have never been able to point to any place in the Bible where God repealed it. When Christ was on earth, He did nothing to set it aside; He freed it from the traces under which the scribes and Pharisees had put it, and gave it its true place. &quot;The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.&quot; It is just as practicable and as necessary for men today as it ever was--in fact, more than ever, because we live in such an intense age. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Sabbath was binding in Eden, and it has been in force ever since. The fourth commandment begins with the word remember, showing that the Sabbath already existed when God wrote this law on the tables of stone at Sinai. How can men claim that this one commandment has been done away with when they will admit that the other nine are still binding? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe that the Sabbath question today is a vital one for the whole country. It is the burning question of the present time. If you give up the Sabbath the church goes; if you give up the church the home goes; and if the home goes the nation goes. That is the direction in which we are traveling. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The church of God is losing its power on account of so many people giving up the Sabbath, and using it to promote selfishness. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">HOW TO OBSERVE THE SABBATH</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Sabbath&quot; means &quot;rest,&quot; and the meaning of the word gives a hint as to the true way to observe the day. God mated after creation, and ordained the Sabbath as a rest for man. He blessed it and hallowed it Remember the rest-day to keep it holy. It is the day when the body may be refreshed and strengthened after six days of labor, and the soul drawn into closer fellowship with its Maker. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">True observance of the Sabbath may be considered under two general heads: cessation from ordinary secular work, and religious exercises. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">1. CESSATION FROM SECULAR WORK</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A man ought to turn aside from his ordinary employment one day in seven. There are many whose occupation will not permit them to observe Sunday, but they should observe some other day as a Sabbath. Saturday is my day of rest, because I generally preach on Sunday, and I look forward to it as a boy does to a holiday. God knows what we need. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ministers and missionaries often tell me that they take no rest-day; they do not need it because they are in the Lord&#39;s work. That is a mistake. When God was giving Moses instructions about the building of the tabernacle, He referred especially to the Sabbath, and gave injunctions for its strict observance; and later, when Moses was conveying the words of the Lord to the children of Israel, he interpreted them by saying that not even were sticks to be gathered on the Sabbath to kindle fires for smelting or other purposes. Inspite of their zeal and haste to erect the tabernacle, the workmen were to have their day of rest. The command applies to ministers and others managed in Christian work today as much as to those Israelite workmen of old. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">WORKS OF NECESSITY AND OF EMERGENCY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In judging whether any work may or may not be lawfully done on the Sabbath, find out the reason and object for doing it. Exceptions are to be made for works of necessity and works of emergency. By &quot;works of necessity&quot; I mean those acts that Christ justified when He approved of leading one&#39;s ox or ass to water. Watchmen, police, stokers on board steamers, and many others have engagements that necessitate their working on the Sabbath. By &quot;works of emergency&quot; I mean those referred to by Christ when He approved of pulling an ox or an ass out of a Pt on the Sabbath day. In case of fire or sickness a man is often called on to do things that would not otherwise be justifiable. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A Christian man was once urged by his employer to work on Sunday. &quot;Does not your Bible say that if your ass falls into a pit on the Sabbath, you may pull him out?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the other; &quot;but if the ass had the habit of falling into the same pit every Sabbath, I would either fill up the pit or sell the ass.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Every man must settle the question as it affects unnecessary work, with his own conscience. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No man should make another work seven days in the week. One day is demanded for rest. A man who has to work the seven days has nothing to look forward to, and life becomes humdrum. Many Christians are guilty in this respect. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">SABBATH TRAVELING</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Take, for instance, the question of Sabbath traveling. I believe we are breaking God&#39;s laws by using the cars on Sunday and depriving conductors and others of their Sabbath. Remember, the fourth commandment expressly refers to the &quot;stranger that is within thy gates.&quot; Doesn&#39;t that touch Sabbath travel? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But you ask, &quot;What are we to do? How are we to get to church?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I reply, on foot. It will be better for you. Once when I was holding meetings in London, in my ignorance I made arrangements to preach four times in different places one Sabbath. After I had made the appointments I found I had to walk sixteen miles; but I walked it, and I slept that night with a clear conscience. I have made it a rule never to use the cars, and if I have a private carriage, I insist that horse and man shall rest on Monday. I want no hackman to rise up in judgment against me. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friends, if we want to help the Sabbath, let business men and Christians never patronize cars on the Sabbath. I would hate to own stock in those companies, to be the means of taking the Sabbath from these men, and have to answer for it at the day of judgment. Let those who are Christians at any rate endeavor to keep a conscience void of offense on this point. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">SABBATH TRADING</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There are many who are inclined to use the Sabbath in order to make money faster. This is no new sin. The prophet Amos hurled his invectives against oppressors who said, &quot;When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Covetous men have always chafed under the restraint, but not until the present time do we find that they have openly counted on Sabbath trade to make money. We are told that many street car companies would not pay if it were not for the Sabbath traffic, and the Sabbath edition of newspapers is also counted upon as the most profitable. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The railroad men of this country are breaking down with softening of the brain, and die at the age of fifty or sixty. They think their business is so important that they must run their trains seven days in the week. Businessmen travel on the Sabbath so as to be on hand for business Monday morning. But if they do so God will not prosper them. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Work is good for man and is commanded, &quot;Six days shalt thou labor&quot;; but overwork and work on the Sabbath takes away the best thing he has. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">NECESSARY AND BENEFICIAL</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The good effect on a nation&#39;s health and happiness produced by the return of the Sabbath, with its cessation from work, cannot be overestimated. It is needed to repair and restore the body after six days of work. It is proved that a man can do more in six days than in seven. Lord Beacons field said: &quot;Of all divine institutions, the most divine is that which secures a day of rest for man. I hold it to be the most valuable blessing conceded to man. It is the cornerstone of all civilization, and its removal might affect even the health of the people.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Mr. Gladstone recently told a friend that the secret of his long life is that amid all the pressure of public cares he never forgot the Sabbath, with its rest for the body and the soul. The constitution of the United States protects the president in his weekly day of rest. He has ten days, &quot;Sundays excepted,&quot; in which to consider a bill that has been sent to him for signature. Every workingman in the republic ought to be as thoroughly protected as the president. If workingmen got up a strike against unnecessary work on the Sabbath, they would have the sympathy of a good many. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Our bodies are seven-day clocks,&quot; says Talmage, &quot;and they need to be wound up, and if they are not wound up they run down into the grave. No man can continuously break the Sabbath and keep his physical and mental health. Ask aged men, and they will tell you they never knew men who continuously broke the Sabbath who did not fail in mind, body, or moral principles.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">All that has been said about rest for man is true for working animals. God didn&#39;t forget them in this commandment, and man should not forget them either. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">2. RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But &quot;rest&quot; does not mean idleness. No man enjoys idleness for any length of time. When one goes on a vacation, one does not lie around doing nothing all that time. Hard work at tennis, hunting, and other pursuits fills the hours. A healthy mind must find something to do. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Hence the Sabbath rest does not mean inactivity. &quot;Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.&quot; The best way to keep off bad thoughts and to avoid temptation is to engage in active religious exercises. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">As regards these, we should avoid extremes. On the one hand we find a rigor in Sabbath observance that is nowhere commanded in Scripture, and that reminds one of the formalism of the Pharisees more than of the spirit of the Gospel. Such strictness does more harm than good. It repels people and makes the Sabbath a burden. On the other hand, we should jealously guard against a loose way of keeping the Sabbath. Already in many cities it is profaned openly. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was a boy, the Sabbath lasted from sundown on Saturday to sundown on Sunday, and I remember how we boys used to shout when it was over. It was the worst day in the week to us. I believe it can be made the brightest day in the week. Every child ought to be reared so that he shall be able to say that he would rather have the other six days weeded out of his memory than the Sabbath of his childhood. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">PUBLIC WORSHIP</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Make the Sabbath a day of religious activity. First of all, of course, is attendance at public worship. &quot;there is a discrepancy,&quot; says John McNeill, &quot;between our creed about the Sabbath day and our actual conduct. In many families, at ten o&#39;clock on the Sabbath, attendance at church is still an open question. There is no open question on Monday morning--&#39;John, will you go to work today&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A minister rebuked a farmer for not attending church, and said, &quot;You know, John, you are never absent from market.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Oh,&quot; was the reply, &quot;we must go to market.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Someone has said that without the Sabbath, the Church of Christ could not, as a visible organization, exist on earth. Another has said that &quot;we need to be in the drill of observance as well as in the liberty of faith.&quot; Human nature is so treacherous that we are apt to omit things altogether unless there is some special reason for doing them. A man is not likely to worship at all unless he has regularly appointed times and means for worship. Family and private devotions are almost certain to be omitted altogether unless one gets into the habit and has a special time set apart daily. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A REMINISCENCE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember blaming my mother for sending me to church on the Sabbath. On one occasion the preacher had to send someone into the gallery to wake me up. I thought it was hard to have to work in the field all the week and then to be obliged to go to church and hear a sermon I didn&#39;t understand. I thought I wouldn&#39;t go to church any more when I got away from home; but I had got so in the habit of going that I couldn&#39;t stay away. After one or two Sabbaths, back again to the house of God I went. There I first found Christ, and I have often said since, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Mother, I thank you for making me go to the house of God when I didn&#39;t want to go.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Parents, if you want your children to grow up and honor you, have them honor the Sabbath day. Don&#39;t let them go off fishing and getting into bad company, or it won&#39;t be long before they will come home and curse you. I know few things more beautiful than to see a father and mother coming up the aisle with their daughters and sons, and sitting down together to hear the Word of God. It is a good thing to have the children, not in some remote loft or gallery, but in a good place, well in sight. Though they cannot understand the sermon now, when they get older they won&#39;t desire to break away, they will continue attending public worship in the house of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But we must not mistake the means for the end. We must not think that the Sabbath is just for the sake of being able to attend meetings. There are some people who think they must spend the whole day at meetings or private devotions. The result is that at nightfall they are tired out, and the day has brought them no rest. The number of church services attended ought to be measured by the person&#39;s ability to enjoy them and get good from them, without being wearied. Attending meetings is not the only way to observe the Sabbath. The Israelites were commanded to keep it in their dwellings as well as in holy convocation. The home, that center of so great influence over the life and character of the people, ought to be made the scene of true Sabbath observance. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">HOME OBSERVANCE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Jeremiah classified godless families with the heathen: &quot;Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate&quot; (10:25). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many mothers have written to me at one time or another to know what to do to entertain their children on the Sabbath. The boys say, &quot;I do wish &#39;twas night,&quot; or, &quot;I do hate the Sabbath,&quot; or, &quot;I do wish the Sabbath were over.&quot; It ought to be the happiest day in the week to them, one to be looked forward to with pleasure. In order to this end, many suggestions might be followed. Make family prayers especially attractive by having the children learn some verse or story from the Bible. Give more time to your children than you can give on weekdays, reading to them and perhaps taking them to walk in the afternoon or evening. Show by your conduct that the Sabbath is a delight, and they will soon catch your spirit. Set aside some time for religious instruction, without making this a task. You can make it interesting for the children by telling Bible stories and asking them to guess the names of the characters. Have Sunday games for the younger children. Picture books, puzzle maps of Palestine, and such things can be easily obtained. Sunday albums and Sunday clocks are other devices. Set aside attractive books for the Sabbath, not letting the children have these during the week. By doing this, the children can be brought to look forward to the day with eagerness and pleasure. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">PRIVATE OBSERVANCE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Apart from public and family observance, the individual ought to devote a portion of the time to his own edification. Prayer, meditation, reading, ought not to be forgotten. Think of men devoting six days a week to their body, which will soon pass away, and begrudging one day to the soul, which will live on and on forever! Is it too much for God to ask for one day to be devoted to the growth and training of the spiritual senses, when the other senses are kept busy the other six days? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If your circumstances permit, engage in some definite Christian work, such as teaching in Sunday school, or visiting the sick. Do all the good you can. Sin keeps no Sabbath, and no more should good deeds. There is plenty of opportunity in this fallen world to perform works of mercy and religion. Make your Sabbath down here a foretaste of the eternal Sabbath that is in store for believers. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You want power in your Christian life, do you? You want Holy Ghost power? You want the dew of heaven on your brow? You want to see men convicted and converted? I don&#39;t believe we shall ever have genuine conversions until we get straight on this law of God. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">SABBATH DESECRATION</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Men seem to think they have a right to change the holy day into a holiday. The young have more temptations to break the Sabbath than we had forty years ago. There are three great temptations: first the trolley car, that will take you off into the country for a nickel to have a day of recreation; second, the bicycle, which is leading a good many Christian men to give up their Sabbath and spend the day on excursions; and the third, the Sunday newspaper. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Twenty years ago Christian people in Chicago would have been horrified if anyone had prophesied that all the theaters would be open every Sabbath; but that is what has come to pass. If it had been prophesied twenty years ago that Christian men would take a wheel and go off on Sunday morning and be gone all day on an excursion, Christians would have been horrified and would have said it was impossible; but that is what is going on today all over the country. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">With regard to the Sunday newspaper, I know all the arguments that are brought in its favor--that the work on it is done during the week, that it is the Monday paper that causes Sunday work, and so on. But there are two hundred thousand newsboys selling the paper on Sunday. Would you like to have your boy one of them? Men are kept running trains in order to distribute the papers. Would you like your Sabbath taken away from you? If not, then practice the Golden Rule, and don&#39;t touch the papers. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Their contents make them unfit for reading any day, not to say Sunday. Some New York dailies advertise Sunday editions of sixty pages. Many dirty pieces of scandal in this and other countries are raked up and put into them. &quot;Eight pages of fud&quot;- that is splendid reading for Sunday, isn&#39;t it? Even when a so-called sermon is printed, it is completely buried by the fiction and news matter. It is time that ministers went into their pulpits and preached against Sunday newspapers if they haven&#39;t done it already. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Put the man in the scales that buys and reads Sunday papers. After reading them for two or three hours he might go and hear the best sermon in the world, but you couldn&#39;t preach anything into him. His mind is filled up with what he has read, and there is no room for thoughts of God. I believe that the archangel Gabriel himself could not make an impression on an audience that has its head full of such trash. If you bored a hole into a man&#39;s head, you could not inject any thoughts of God and heaven. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I don&#39;t believe that the publishers would allow their own children to read them. Why then should they give them to my children and to yours? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A merchant who advertises in Sunday papers is not keeping the Sabbath. It is a master-stroke of the devil to induce Christian men to do this in order to make trade for Monday. But if a man makes money, and yet his sons are ruined and his home broken up, what has he gained? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Ladies buy the Sunday papers and read the advertisements of Monday bargains to see what they can buy cheap. Just so with their religion. They are willing to have it if it doesn&#39;t cost anything. If Christian men and women refused to buy them, if Christian merchants refused to advertise in them, they would soon die out, because that is where they get most of their support. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">They tell me the Sunday paper has come to stay, and I may as well let it alone. Never! I believe it is a great evil, and I shall fight it while I live. I never read a Sunday paper, and wouldn&#39;t have one in my house. They are often sent me, but I tear them up without reading them. I will have nothing to do with them. They do more harm to religion than any other one agency I know. Their whole influence is against keeping the Sabbath holy. They are an unnecessary evil. Can&#39;t a man read enough news on weekdays without desecrating the Sabbath? We had no Sunday papers till the war came, and we got along very well without them. They have been increasing in size and in number ever since then, and I think they have been lowering their tone ever since. If you believe that, help to fight them too. Stamp them out, beginning with yourself. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">PUNISHMENT OR BLESSING? </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No nation has ever prospered that has trampled the Sabbath in the dust. Show me a nation that has done this and I will show you a nation that has got in it the seeds of ruin and decay. I believe that Sabbath desecration will carry a nation down quicker than anything else. Adam brought marriage and the Sabbath with him out of Eden, and neither can be disregarded without suffering. When the children of Israel went into the Promised Land, God told them to let their land rest every seven years, and He would give them as much in six years as in seven. For four hundred and ninety years they disregarded that law. But mark you, Nebuchadnezzar came and took them oh into Babylon, and kept them seventy years in captivity, and the land had its seventy sabbaths of rest. Seven times seventy is four hundred and ninety. So they did not gain much by breaking this law. You can give God His day, or He will take it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">On the other hand, honoring the fourth commandment brings blessing: &quot;If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words [thine own as contrasted with what God enjoins]: then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father, for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it&quot; (Is 58:13-14). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I do not know what will become of this republic if we give up our Christian Sabbath. If Satan can break the conscience down on one point, he can break it down on all. When I was in France in 1867, I could wt tell one day from the other. On Sunday, stores were open and buildings were erected, the same as on other days. See how quickly that country went down. One hundred years ago France and England stood abreast in the march of nations. Where do they stand today? France undertook to wipe out the Sabbath, and has pretty nearly wiped itself out, while England belts the globe. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A FIRM STAND</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We have a fighting chance to save this nation, and what we want is men and women who have moral courage to stand up and say: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No, I will not touch the Sunday paper, and all the influence I have I will throw dead against it. I will not go away on Saturday evening if I have to travel on Sunday to get back. I will not do unnecessary walk on the Sabbath. I will do all I can to keep it holy as God commanded.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But someone says: &quot;Mr. Moody, what are you going to do? I have to work seven days a week or starve.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then starve! Wouldn&#39;t it be a grand thing to have a martyr in the nineteenth century? &quot;The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church.&quot; Someone says the seed is getting very low; it has been a long time since we have had any seed. I would give something to erect a monument to such a martyr for his fidelity to God&#39;s law. I would go around the world to attend his funeral. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We want today men who will make up their minds to do what is right and stand by it if the heavens tumble on their heads. What is to become of Christian Associations and Sunday schools, of churches and Christian Endeavor societies, if the Christian Sabbath is given up to recreation and made a holiday? Hasn&#39;t the time come to call a halt if men want power with God? Let men call you narrow and bigoted, but be man enough to stand by God&#39;s law, and you will have power and blessing. That is the kind of Christianity we want just now in this country. Any man can go with the crowd, but we want men who will go against the current. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Sabbath-breaker, are you ready to step into the scales? </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Fifth Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">WE ARE LIVING in dark days on this question too. It really seems as if the days the apostle Paul wrote about are upon us: &quot;In the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection,.. despisers of those that are good&quot; (2 Ti 3:1-3). If Paul were alive today, could he have described the present state of affairs more truly? There are perhaps more men in this country that are breaking the hearts of their fathers and mothers and trampling on the law of God than in any other civilized country in the world. How many sons treat their parents with contempt and make light of their entreaties? A young man will have the kindest care from parents; they will watch over him and care for all his wants, and some bad companion will come in and sweep him away from them in a few weeks. How many young ladies have married against their parents wishes and have gone off and made their own life bitter! I never knew one case that did not turn out badly. They invariably bring ruin upon themselves unless they repent. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">BEGIN IN THE HOME</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The first four commandments deal with our relations to God. They tell us how to worship and when to worship; they forbid irreverence and impiety in word and act. Now God turns to our relations with each other, and isn&#39;t it significant that He deals first with family life? &quot;God is going to show us our duty to our neighbor. How does He begin? Not by telling us how kings ought to reign, or how soldiers ought to fight, or how merchants ought to conduct their business, but how boys and girls ought to behave at home.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We can see that if their home life is all right, they are almost sure to fulfill the law in regard to both God and man. Parents stand in the place of God to their children in a great many ways until the children arrive at years of discretion. If the children are true to their parents, it will be easier for them to be true to God. He used the human relationship as a symbol of our relationship to Him both by creation and by grace. God is our Father in heaven. We are His offspring. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">On the other hand, if they have not learned to be obedient and respectful at home, they are likely to have little respect for the law of the land. It is all in the heart; and the heart is prepared at home for good or bad conduct outside. The tree grows the way the twig is bent. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Honour thy father and thy mother.&quot; That word honor, means more than mere obedience--a child may obey through fear. It means love and affection, gratitude, respect. We are told that in the East the words &quot;father&quot; and &quot;mother&quot; include those who are &quot;superiors in age, wisdom and in civil or religious station,&quot; so that when the Jews were taught to honor their father and mother it included all who were placed over them in these relations, as well as their parents Isn&#39;t there a crying need for that same feeling today? The lawlessness of the present time is a natural consequence of the growing absence of a feeling of respect for those in authority. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">HONOR THY MOTHER</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It has been pointed out as worthy of notice that this commandment enjoins honor for the mother, and yet in eastern countries the present-day woman is held of little account. When I was in Palestine a few years ago, the prettiest girl in Jericho was sold by her father in exchange for a donkey. In many ancient nations, just as in certain parts of heathendom today, the parents are killed off as soon as they become old and feeble. Can&#39;t we see the hand of God here, raising the woman to her rightful position of honor out of the degradation into which she had been dragged by heathenism? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.&quot; I believe that we must get back to the old truths. You may make light of it and laugh at it, young man, but remember that God has given this commandment, and you cannot set it aside. If we get back to this law, we shall have power and blessing. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">TEMPORAL BLESSING OR CURSE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe it to be literally true that our temporal condition depends on the way we act upon this commandment. &quot;Honour thy father and mother, (which is the first commandment with promise), that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on the earth.&quot; &quot;Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&quot; &quot;Cursed is he that setteth light by his father or mother.&quot; &quot;Whoso curseth his father or mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It would be easy to multiply texts from the Bible to prove this truth. Experience teaches the same thing. A good, loving son generally turns out better than a refractory son. Obedience and respect at home prepare the way for obedience to the employer, and are joined with other virtues that help toward a prosperous career, crowned with a ripe, honored old age. Disobedience and disrespect for parents are often the first steps in the downward track. Many a criminal has testified that this is the point where he first went astray. I have lived over sixty years, and I have learned one thing if I have learned nothing else-- that no man or woman who dishonors father or mother ever prospers. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Young man, young woman, how do you treat your parents? Tell me that, and I will tell you how you an going to get on in life. When I hear a young man speaking contemptuously of his grey-haired father or mother, I say he has sunk very low indeed. When I see a young man as polite as any gentleman can be when he is out in society, but who snaps at his mother and speaks unkindly to his father, I would not give the snap of my finger for his religion. If there is any man or woman on earth that ought to be treated kindly and tenderly, it is that loving mother or that loving father. If they cannot have your regard through life, what reward are they to have for all their care and anxiety? Think how they loved you and provided for you in your early days. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A MOTHER&#39;S LOVE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let your mind go back to the time when you were ill. Did your mother neglect you? When a neighbor came in and said, &quot;Now, mother, you go and lie down; you have been up for a week; I will take your place for a night&#39;-did she do it? No; and if the poor worn body forced her to it at last, she lay watching, and if she heard your voice, she was at your side directly, anticipating all your wants, wiping the perspiration away from your brow. If you wanted water, how soon you got it! She would gladly have taken the disease into her own body to save you. Her love for you would drive her to any lengths. No matter to what depths of vice and misery you have sunk, no matter how profligate you have grown, she has not turned you out of her heart. Perhaps she loves you all the more because you are wayward. She would draw you back by the bands of a love that never dies. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">FILIAL INGRATITUDE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was in England, I read of a man who professed to be a Christian, who was brought before the magistrate for not supporting his aged father. He had let him go to the workhouse. My friends, I&#39;d rather be content with a crust of bread and a drink of water than let my father or mother go to the workhouse. The idea of a professing Christian doing such a thing! God have mercy on such a godless Christianity as that! It is a withered-up thing, and the breath of heaven will drive it away. Don&#39;t profess to love God and do a thing like that. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A friend of mine told me of a poor man who had sent his son to school in the city. One day the father was hauling some wood into the city, perhaps to pay his boy&#39;s bills. The young man was walking down the street with two of his school friends, all dressed in the very height of fashion. His father saw him, and was so glad that he left his wood, and went to the sidewalk to speak to him. But the boy was ashamed of his father, who had on his old working clothes, and spurned him, and said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I don&#39;t know you.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Will such a young man ever amount to anything? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Never! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember a very promising young man whom I had in the Sunday school in Chicago. His father was a confirmed drunkard, and his mother took in washing to educate her four children. This was her eldest son, and I thought that he was going to redeem the whole family. But one day a thing happened that made him go down in my estimation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The boy was in the high school, and was a very bright scholar. One day he stood with his mother at the cottage door--it was a poor house, but she could not pay for their schooling, and feed and clothe her children, and hire a very good house too, out of her earnings. When they were talking a young man from the high school came up the street, and this boy walked away from his mother. Next day the young man said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Who was that I saw you talking to yesterday?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Oh, that was my washerwoman.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I said: &quot;Poor fellow! He will never amount to anything.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That was a good many years ago. I have kept my eye on him. He has gone down, down, down, and now he is just a miserable wreck. Of course he would go down. Ashamed of his mother who loved him and toiled for him, and bore so much hardship for him! I cannot tell you the contempt I had for that one act. Let us look at... </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A BRIGHTER PICTURE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some years ago I heard of a poor woman who sent her boy to school and college. When he was to graduate, he wrote his mother to come, but she sent back word that she could not because her only skirt had already been turned once. She was so shabby that she was afraid he would be ashamed of her. He wrote back that he didn&#39;t care how she was dressed and urged so strongly that she went. He met her at the station, and took her to a nice place to stay. The day came for his graduation, and he walked down the broad aisle with that poor mother dressed very shabbily, and put her into one of the best seats in the house. To her great surprise he was the valedictorian of the class, and he carried everything before him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He won a prize, and when it was given to him, he stepped down before the whole audience, and kissed his mother, and said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Here, mother, here is the prize. It is yours. I would not have had it if it had not been for you.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Thank God for such a man! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The one glimpse the Bible gives us of thirty out of the thirty-three years of Christ&#39;s life on earth shows that He did not come to destroy this fifth commandment. The secret of all those silent years is embodied in that verse in Luke&#39;s Gospel-- &quot;And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them.&quot; Did He not set an example of true filial love and care when in the midst of the agonies of the cross He made provision for His mother? Did He not condemn the miserable evasions of this law by the Pharisees of His own day: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.... Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free. And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; making the word of God of none effect by your tradition, which ye have delivered&quot; (Mk 7:6-13). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have read of one heathen custom in China, which would do us credit in this so-called Christian country. On every New Year&#39;s morning each man and boy, from the emperor to the lowest peasant, is said to pay a visit to his mother, carrying her a present varying in value according to his station in life. He thanks her for all she has done for him and asks a continuance of her favor another year. Abraham Lincoln used to say: &quot;All I have I owe to my mother.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I would rather die a hundred deaths than have my children grow up to treat me with scorn and contempt. I would rather have them honor me a thousand times over than have the world honor me. I would rather have their esteem and favor than the esteem of the whole world. And any man who seeks the honor and esteem of the world, and doesn&#39;t treat his parents right, is sure to be disappointed. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">AN EXHORTATION</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Young man, if your parents are still living, treat them kindly. Do all you can to make their declining years sweet and happy. Bear in mind that this is the only commandment that you may not always be able to obey. As long as you live, you will be able to serve God, to keep the sabbath, to obey all the other commandments; but the day comes to most men when father and mother die. What bitter feelings you will have when the opportunity has gone by if you fail to show them the respect and love that is their due! How long is it since you wrote to your mother? Perhaps you have not written home for months, or it may be for years. How often I get letters from mothers urging me to try to influence their sons! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Which would you rather be--a Joseph or an Absalom? Joseph wasn&#39;t satisfied until he had brought his old father down into Egypt. He was the greatest man in Egypt, next to Pharaoh; he was arrayed in the finest garments; he had Pharaoh&#39;s ring on his hand, and a gold chain about his neck, and they cried before him, &quot;Bow the knee.&quot; Yet when he heard Jacob was coming, he hurried out to meet him. He wasn&#39;t ashamed of the old man with his shepherd&#39;s clothes. What a contrast we see in Absalom. That young man broke his father&#39;s heart By his rebellion, and the Jews are said to throw a stone at Absalom&#39;s pillar to the present day, whenever they pass it, as a token of their horror of Absalom&#39;s unnatural conduct. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Come, now, are you ready to be weighed? If you have been dishonoring your father and mother, step into the scales and see how quickly you will be found wanting. See how quickly you will strike the beam. I don&#39;t know any man who is much lighter than one who treats his parents with contempt. Do you disobey them just as much as you dare? Do you try to deceive them? Do you call them old-fashioned, and sneer at their advice? How do you treat that venerable father and praying mother? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You may be a professing Christian, but I wouldn&#39;t give much for your religion unless it gets into your life and teaches you how to live. I wouldn&#39;t give a snap of my finger for a religion that doesn&#39;t begin at home and regulate your conduct--toward your parents. </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Sixth Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Thou shalt not kill. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I USED TO SAY: &quot;What is the use of taking up a law like this in an audience where, probably, there isn&#39;t a man who ever thought of, or ever will commit, murder?&quot; But as one gets on in years, he sees many a murder that is not outright killing. I need not kill a person to be a murderer. If I get so angry that I wish a man dead, I am a murderer in God&#39;s sight. God looks at the heart and says he that hateth his brother is a murderer. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">First, let us see what this commandment does not mean. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It does not forbid the killing of animals for food and for other reasons. Millions of rams and lambs and turtledoves must have been killed every year for sacrifices under the Mosaic system. Christ Himself ate of the Passover lamb, and we are told definitely of cases where He ate fish and provided it for His disciples and the people to eat. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It does not forbid the killing of burglars or attackers in self-defense. Directly after the giving of the Ten Commandments, God laid down the ordinance that if a thief be found breaking in and be smitten that he die, it was pardonable. Did not Christ justify this idea of self-defense when He said: &quot;If the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up&quot; (Mt 24:43). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It does not forbid capital punishment. God Himself set the death penalty upon violations of each of the first seven commandments, as well as for other crimes. God said to Noah after the deluge, &quot;Whoso sheddeth man&#39;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed&quot; (Gen 9:2);and the reason given is just as true today as it was then--&quot;for in the image of God made he man.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What it does forbid is the wanton, intentional taking of human life under wrong motives and circumstances. Man is made in God&#39;s image. He is built for eternity. He is more than a mere animal. His life ought therefore to be held sacred. Once taken, it can never be restored. In heathen lands human life is no more sacred than the life of animals; even in Christian lands there are heartless and selfish men who hold it cheap; but God has invested it with a high value. An infidel philosopher of the eighteenth century said: &quot;In the sight of God, every event is alike important; and the life of a man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster.&quot; &quot;Where is the crime,&quot; he asked, &quot;of turning a few ounces of blood out of their channel?&quot; Such language needs no answer. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE VALUE OF MAN</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let me give you a passage from H. L. Hastings: &quot;A friend of mine visited the Fiji Islands in 1844, and what do you suppose an infidel was worth there then? You could buy a man for a musket, or if you paid money, for seven dollars, and after you had bought him you could feed him, starve him, work him, whip him, or eat him--they generally ate them, unless they were so full of tobacco they could not stomach them! But if you go there today you could not buy a man for seven million dollars. There are no men for sale there now. What has made the difference in the price of humanity? The twelve hundred Christian chapels scattered over that island tell the story. The people have learned to read that Book which says: &#39;Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold,.. but with the precious blood of Christ(1 Pe 1:18-19); and since they learned that lesson, no man is for sale there.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Men tell me that the world is getting so much better. We talk of our American civilization. We forget the alarming increase of crime in our midst. It is said that there is no civilized country on the globe where murder is so frequently committed and so seldom punished. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">SUICIDE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is that other kind of murder that is increasing at an appalling rate among us--suicide. There have been infidels in all ages who have advocated it&#39;s a justifiable means of release from trial and difficulty; yet thinking men, as far back as Aristotle, have generally condemned it as cowardly and unjustifiable under any conditions. No man has a right to take his own life from such motives any more than the life of another. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It has been pointed out that the Jewish race, the people of God, always counted length of days as a blessing. The Bible does not mention one single instance of a good man committing suicide. In the four thousand years of Old Testament history it records only four suicides, and only one suicide in the New Testament. Saul, king of Israel, and his armorbearer, Ahithophel, Zimri and Judas Iscariot are the five cases. Look at the references in the Bible to see what kind of men they were. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">OTHER KINDS OF MURDER</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But I want to speak of other classes of murderers that are very numerous in this country, although they are not classified as murderers. The man who is the cause of the death of another through criminal carelessness is guilty. The man who sells diseased meat; the saloonkeeper whose drink has maddened the brain of a criminal; those who adulterate food; the employer who jeopardizes the lives of employees and others by unsafe surroundings and conditions in harmful occupations-they are all guilty of blood where life is lost as a consequence. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was in England in 1892, I met a gentleman who claimed that they were ahead of us in the respect they had for the law. &quot;We hang our murderers,&quot; he said, &quot;but there isn&#39;t one out of twenty in your country that is hung.&quot; I said, &quot;You are greatly mistaken, for they walk about these two countries unhung.&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I will tell you what I mean,&quot; I said; &quot;the man that comes into my house and runs a dagger into my heart for my money, is a prince compared with a son that takes five years to kill me and the wife of my bosom. A young man who comes home night after night drunk, and when his mother remonstrates, curses her grey hairs and kills her by inches, is the blackest kind of a murderer.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That kind of thing is going on constantly all around us. One young man at college, an only son, whose mother wrote to him remonstrating against his gambling and drinking habits, took the letters out of the post-office, and when he found that they were from her, he tore them up without reading them. She said, &quot;I thought I would die when I found I had lost my hold on that son.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If a boy kills his mother by his conduct, you can&#39;t call it anything else than murder. and he is as truly guilty of breaking this sixth commandment as if he drove a dagger to her heart. If all young men in this country who are killing their parents and their wives by inches, should be hung this next week, there would be a great many funerals. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">How are you treating your parents? Come, are you killing them? This sixth commandment follows very naturally after the fifth, &quot;Honor thy father and dry mother.&quot; Don&#39;t put any thoughts in their pillows and make their last days miserable. Bear in mind that the commandment refers not only to shooting a man down in cold blood; but he is the worst murderer who goes on, month after month, year after year, until he has crowded the life out of a sainted mother and put a godly father under the sod. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE WORDS OF CHRIST</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let us look once again at the Sermon on the Mount, that men think so much of, and see what Christ had to say: &quot;Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca [an expression of contempt], shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool [an expression of condemnation], shall be in danger of hell fire (Mt 5:21-22). &quot;Three degrees of murderous guilt,&quot; as has been said, &quot;all of which can be manifested without a blow being struck: secret anger; the spiteful jeer; the open, unrestrained outburst of violent, abusive speech.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Again, what does John say? &quot;Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him&quot; (1 Jn 3:15). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Did you ever in your heart wish a man dead? That was murder. Did you ever get so angry that you wished any one harm? Then you are guilty. I may be addressing someone who is cultivating an unforgiving spirit. That is the spirit of the murderer, and needs to be rooted out of your heart. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We can only read men&#39;s acts--what they have done. God looks down into the heart. That is the birthplace and home of the evil desires and intentions that lead to the transgression of all God&#39;s laws. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Listen once more to the words of Jesus: &quot;From within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy,pride, foolishness&quot; (Mk 7:21-22). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">May God purge our hearts of these evil things, if we are harboring them! Ah, if many of us were weighed now, we should find Belshazzar&#39;s doom written against us--&quot;Tekel--wanting!&#39;&#39; </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Seventh Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Thou shalt not commit adultery. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">AN ENGLISH ARMY-OFFICER in India who had been living an impure life went around one evening to argue religion with the chaplain. During their talk the officer said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Religion is all very well, but you must admit that there are difficulties--about the miracles, for instance.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The chaplain knew the man and his besetting sin, and quietly looking him in the face, answered: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Yes, there are some things in the Bible not very plain, I admit: but the seventh commandment is very plain.&quot; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">PLAIN SPEAKING</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I would to God I could pass over this commandment, but I feel that the time has come to cry aloud and spare not. Plain speaking about it is not very fashionable nowadays. &quot;Teachers of religion have by common consent banished from their public teaching all advice, warning or allusion in regard to love between the sexes,&quot; says Dr. Stalker. These themes are left to poets and novelists to handle. In an autobiography recently published in England, the writer attributed no small share of the follies and vices of his earlier years to his never having heard a plain, outspoken sermon on this seventh commandment. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But though men are inclined to pass it by, God is not silent or indifferent in regard to it. When I hear anyone make light of adultery and licentiousness, I take the Bible and see how God has let His curse and wrath come down upon it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot; (Ex 20:14); &quot;For this is a heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase&quot; (Job 31:11-12); &quot;By means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? So he that goeth in to his neighbor&#39;s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent&quot; (Pr 6: 26:28);&quot;Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away&quot; (Pr 6:32- 33). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fomicators,.. nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind . . . shall inherit the kingdom of God&quot; (1 Co 6:9-10); &quot;But fornication, and all uncleanness, . . . let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person . . . hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them&quot; (Eph 5:5-6); &quot;Whoremongers ... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death&quot; (Rev 21:8). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">These are a few of the threatenings and warnings contained in the old Book, up to its closing chapter. It speaks plainly, without compromise. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">MARRIAGE AND THE HOME</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This commandment is God&#39;s bulwark around marriage and the home. Marriage is one of the institutions that existed in Eden; it is older than the Fall. It is the most sacred relationship that can exist between human beings, taking precedence even of the relationship of the parent and child. Someone has pointed out that as in the beginning God created one man and one woman, this is the true order for all ages. Where family ties are disregarded and dishonored, the results are always fatal. The home existed before the church, and unless the home is kept pure and undefiled, there can be no family religion, and the church is in danger. Adultery and licentiousness have swept nation after nation out of existence. Did it not bring fire and brimstone from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah? What carried Rome into ruin? The obscene frescoes and statues at Pompeii and Naples tell the tale. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Where there is no sacredness around the home, population dwindles; family virtues disappear; the children are corrupt from their very birth; the seeds of sure decay are already planted. In 1895 there were twenty-five thousand divorces in this country. I was an one of the fashionable sheets of a prominent city some time ago, where every family except two in the whole street had either a son or a daughter that had been divorced. Divorce and debauchery go hand in hand. We are not gaining much in turning away from this old law, are we? </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE DEVIL&#39;S COUNTERFEIT</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Lust is the devil&#39;s counterfeit of love. There is nothing more beautiful on earth than a pure love, and there is nothing so blighting as lust. J do not know of a quicker, shorter way down to hell than by adultery and the kindred sins condemned by this commandment. The Bible says that with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, but &quot;whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart&quot; (Ho 4: 11). Lust will drive all natural affection out of a man&#39;s heart. For the sake of some vile harlot he will trample on the feelings and entreaties of a sainted mother and beautiful wife and godly sister. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Young man, are you leading an impure life? Suppose God&#39;s scales should drop down before you, what would you do? Are you fit for the kingdom of heaven? You know very well that you are not. You bathe yourself. When you look upon that pure wife or mother, you say, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;What a vile wretch I am! The harlot is bringing me down to an untimely and dishonored grave.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">May God show us what a fearful sin it is! The idea of making light of it! I do not know of any sin that will make a man run down to ruin more quickly. I am appalled when I think of what is going on in the world; of so many young men living impure lives, and talking about the virtue of women as if it didn&#39;t amount to anything. This sin is coming in upon us like a hood at the present day. In every city there is an army of prostitutes. Young men by hundreds are being utterly ruined by this accursed sin. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I think that the most infernal thing that shines on in America is the way a woman is treated after she has been ruined by a man, often under fair promises of marriage. Someone said that when the prodigal son came home he had the best robe and the fatted calf, but what does the prodigal daughter get? Although she may have been more sinned against than sinning, she is cast out and ostracized by society. She is condemned to an almost hopeless life of degradation and shame, sinking step by step into a loathsome grave, unless she hurries her doom by suicide. But the wretch who has ruined her in body and soul holds his head as high as ever, and society attaches no stain to him. If he had failed to pay his gambling debts, or was detected cheating at cards, he would promptly be dropped by society; but he may boast of his implore life, and his companions will think nothing of it. Parents who would not allow their daughters to become acquainted with a man who is rude in manners, sometimes do not hesitate to accept the society of men who are known to be impure. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Talk about stealing--a man who steals the virtue of a woman is the meanest thief that ever was on the face of the earth! One who goes into your house and steals your money is a prince compared with a vile libertine who takes the virtue of your sister, or steals the affection of your wife, and robs you of her; no sneak thief that ever walked the earth is so mean as he. How men pass laws to protect their property, but when that which is far nearer and dearer to them than money is taken, it is made light of! If a man should push a young lady into the river and she should be drowned, the law would lay hold of him, and he would be tried for murder and hung. But if he wins her affection and ruins her, and then casts her off, isn&#39;t he worse than a murderer? There are some sins that are worse than murder, and that is one of them. If someone should treat your wife or sister so,you would want to shoot him as you would a dog. Why do you not respect all women as you do your mother and sister? What law of justice forgives the obscene bird of prey, while it kicks out of its path the soiled and bleeding dove? </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">GOD&#39;S COMING JUDGMENT</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">God has appointed a day when this matter will be set right. &quot;Be not deceived; God is not mocked: whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap&quot; (Gal 6:7). He will render to every man according to his deeds. You may walk down the aisle of the church and take your seat, thinking that no one knows of your sin. But God is on the throne, and He will surely bring you to judgment. Do you believe that God will allow this infernal thing to go on-- women bearing all the blame while guilty men go unpunished? God has appointed a day when He will judge this world in righteousness, and the day is fast approaching. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If you are guilty of this sin, do not let the day pass until you repent. If you are living in some secret sin or are fostering impure thoughts, make up your mind that by the grace of God you will be delivered. I don&#39;t believe a man who is guilty of this sin is ever going to see the kingdom of God unless he repents in sackcloth and ashes, and does all he can to make restitution. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">AN EVIL HARVEST</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Even in this life adultery and uncleanness bring their awful results, both physical and mental. The pleasure and excitement that lead so many astray at the beginning soon pass away, and only the evil remains. Vice carries a sting in its tail, like the scorpion. The body is sinned against, and the body sooner or later suffers. &quot;Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body&quot; (1 Co 6:18), said Paul. Nature herself punishes with nameless diseases, and the man goes down to the grave rotten, leaving the effects of his sin to blight his posterity. There are nations whose manhood has been eaten out by this awful scourge. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It drags a man lower than the beasts. It stains the memory. I believe that memory is &quot;the worm that never dies,&quot; and the memory is never cleansed of obscene stories and unclean acts. Even if a man repents and reforms he often has to fight the past. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Lust gave Samson into the power of Delilah, who robbed him of his strength. It led David to commit murder and called down upon him the wrath of God, and if he had not repented he would have lost heaven. I believe that if Joseph had responded to the enticement of Potiphar&#39;s wife, his light would have gone out in darkness. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It ends in one or other of two ways: either in remorse and shame because of the realization of the loss of purity, with a terrible struggle against a hard taskmaster; or in hardness of heart, brutalizing of the finer senses, which is a more dreadful condition. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We hear a good deal about intemperance nowadays. That sin advertises itself; it shows its marks upon the face and in the conduct. But this hides itself away under the shadow of the night. A man who tampers with this evil goes on step by step until his character is blasted, his reputation ruined, his health gone, and his life made as dark as hell. May God wake up the nation to see how this awful sin is spreading! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Will anyone deny that the house of the strange woman is &quot;the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death,&quot; as the Bible says? Are there not men whose characters have been utterly ruined for this life through this accursed sin? Are there not wives who would rather sink into their graves than live? Many a man went with a pure woman to the altar a few years ago and promised to love and cherish her. Now he has given his affections to some vile harlot and brought ruin on his wife and children! </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">ARE YOU GUILTY? </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Young man, young woman, are you guilty, even in thought? Bear in mind what Christ said: &quot;Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart&quot; (Mt 5: 27-28). How many would repent but that they are tied hand and foot, and some vile harlot whose feet are fastened in hell, clings to him and says: &quot;If you give me up, I will expose you!&quot; Can you step on the scales and take that harlot with you? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If you are guilty of this awful sin, escape for your life. Hear God&#39;s voice while there is yet time. Confess your sin to Him. Ask Him to snap the fetters that bind you. Ask Him to give you victory over your passions. If your right eye offends, pluck it out. If your right hand offends, cut it oh. Shake yourself like Samson, and say: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;By the grace of God I will not go down to an adulterer&#39;s grave.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is hope for you, adulterer. There is hope for you, adulteress. God will not turn you away if you truly repent. No matter how low down in vice and misery you may have sunk, you may be washed, you may be sanctified, you may be justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Remember what Christ said to that woman which was a sinner, &quot;Thy sins are forgiven ... thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace&quot; (Lk 7:47); and to that woman that was taken in adultery, &quot;Go, and sin no more&quot; (Jn 8:11). </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Eighth Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Thou shalt not steal. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">DURING THE TIME of slavery, a slave was preaching with great power. His master heard of it, and sent for him, and said: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I understand you are preaching?&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the slave. &quot;Well, now,&quot; said the master, &quot;I will give you all the time you need, and I want you to prepare a sermon on the Ten Commandments, and to bear down especially on stealing, because there is a great deal of stealing on the plantation.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The slave&#39;s countenance fell at once. He said he wouldn&#39;t like to do that; there wasn&#39;t the warmth in that subject there was in others. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have noticed that people are satisfied when you preach about the sins of the patriarchs, but they don&#39;t like it when you touch upon the sins of today. That is coming too near home. But we need to have these old doctrines stated over and over again in our churches. Perhaps it is not necessary to speak here about the grosser violations of this eighth commandment, because the law of the land looks after these; but a man or woman can steal without cracking safes and picking pockets. Many a person who would shrink from taking what belongs to another person thinks nothing of stealing from the government or from large public corporations, such as street car companies. If you steal from a rich man it is as much a sin as stealing from a poor man. If you lie about the value of things you buy, are you not trying to defraud the storekeeper? &quot;It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth&quot; (Pr 20:14). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">On the other hand, many a person who would not steal himself, holds stock in companies that make dishonest profits; but &quot;though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished&quot; (Pr 11:21). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A young man in our Bible Institute in Chicago got on the streetcar, and before the conductor came around to take the fare, they reached the Institute, and he jumped oh without paying his fare. In thinking over that act he said: &quot;That was not just right. I had my ride, and I ought to pay the fare.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He remembered the face of the conductor, and he went to the car barns and paid him the five cents. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well,&quot; the conductor said, &quot;you are a fool not to keep it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No,&quot; the young man said, &quot;I am not. I got the ride, and I ought to have paid for it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;But it was my business to collect it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;No, it was my business to hand it to you.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The conductor said, &quot;I think you must belong to that Bible Institute.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have heard few things said of the Institute that pleased me so much as that one thing. Not long after that the conductor came to the Institute and asked the student to come to see him. A cottage meeting was started in his house; and not only himself but a number of others around there were converted as a result of that one act. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You can hardly take up a paper now without reading of some cashier of a bank who has become a defaulter, or of some large swindling operation that has ruined scores, or of some breach of trust, or fraudulent failure in business. These things are going on all over the land. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I would to God that we could have all gambling swept away. If Christian men take the right stand, they can check it and break it up in a great many places. It leads to stealing. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">WHERE THE STREAM STARTS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The stream generally starts at home and in the school. Parents are woefully lax in their condemnation and punishment of the sin of stealing. The child begins by taking sugar, it may be. The mother makes light of it at first, and the child&#39;s conscience is violated without any sense of wrong. By and by it is not an easy matter to check the habit, because it grows and multiplies with every new commission. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The value of the thing that is stolen has nothing to say to the guilt of the act. Two people were once arguing upon this point, and one said: &quot;Well, you will not contend that a theft of a pin and of a dollar are the same to God?&quot; &quot;When you tell me the difference between the value of a pin and of a dollar to God,&quot; said the other, &quot;I will answer your question.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The value or amount is not what is to be considered, but whether the act is right or wrong. Partial obedience is not enough: obedience must be entire. The little indulgences, the small transgressions are what drive religion out of the soul. They lay the foundation for the grosser sin. If you give way to little temptations, you will not be able to resist when great temptations come to you. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">GOD&#39;S WEIGHTS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Extortioner, are you ready to step into the scales? What will you do with the condemnation of God-- &quot;Thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God&quot; (Eze 22: 12)? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Employer, are you guilty of sweating your employees? Have you defrauded the hireling of his wages? Have you paid starvation wages? &quot;Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates (Deu 24:14). What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord God of hosts (Is 3:15). Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth&quot; (Ja 5:4). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And you, employee, have you been honest with your employer? Have you robbed him of his due by wasting your time when he was not looking? If God should summon you into His presence now, what would you say? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let the merchant step into the scales. See if you will prove light when weighed against the law of God. Are you guilty of adulterating what you sell? Do you substitute inferior grades of goods? Are your advertisements deceptive? Are your cheap prices made possible by defrauding your customers either in quantity or in quality? Do you teach your clerks to put a French or an English tag on domestic manufactures, and then sell them as imported goods? Do you tell them to say that the goods are all wool when you know they are half cotton? Do you give short weight or measure? See what God says in His Word: &quot;Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?&quot; (Mic 611; &quot;Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small: thou shalt not have in thy house divers measures, a great and a small. But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee&quot; (Deu 25:13-16). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in mete yard, in weight, or in measure. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah and a just hin, shall ye have&quot; (Lev 19:35-36). Are you like those who said: &quot;When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit? that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheatl (Amos 8:5-6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Show me a people whose trade is dishonest,&quot; said Froude, &quot;and I will show you a people whose religion is a sham.&quot; Unless your religion can keep you honest in your business, it isn&#39;t worth much; it isn&#39;t the right kind. God is a God of righteousness, and no true follower of His can swerve one inch to the right or left without disobeying Him. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">STOLEN GOODS A BURDEN</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I heard of a boy who stole a cannonball from a navy yard. He watched his opportunity, sneaked into the yard, and secured it. But when he had it, he hardly knew what to do with it. It was heavy, and too large to conceal in his pocket, so he had to put it under his hat. When he got home with it, he dared not show it to his parents, because it would have led at once to his detection. He said in after years it was the last thing he ever stole. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The story is told that one of Queen Victoria&#39;s diamonds valued at six-hundred thousand dollars was stolen from a jeweler&#39;s window, to whom it had been given to set. A few months afterward a miserable man died a miserable death in a poor lodging-house. In his pocket was found the diamond and a letter telling how he had not dared to sell it lest it lead to his discovery and imprisonment. It never brought him anything but anxiety and pain. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Everything you steal is a curse to you in that way. The sin overreaches itself. A man who takes money that does not belong to him never gets any lasting comfort. He has no real pleasure, for he has a guilty conscience. He cannot look an honest man in the face. He loses peace of mind here, and all hope of heaven hereafter. &quot;As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool&quot; (Jer 17:11). &quot;That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such&quot; (1 Th 4:6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I may be speaking to some clerk who perhaps took five cents today out of his employer&#39;s drawer to buy a cigar; perhaps he took ten cents to get a shave, and thinks he will put it back tomorrow--no one will ever know it. If you have taken a cent, you are a thief. Do you ever think how those little stealings may bring you to ruin? Let your employer find it out. If he doesn&#39;t take you into court, he will discharge you. Your hopes will be blasted, and it will be hard work to get up again. Whatever condition you are in, do not take a cent that does not belong to you. Rather than steal, go up to heaven in poverty--go up to heaven from the poorhouse. Be honest rather than go through the world in a gilded chariot of stolen riches. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">RESTITUTION</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If you have ever taken money dishonestly, you need not pray God to forgive you and fill you with the Holy Ghost until you make restitution. If you have not got the money now to pay back, will to do it, and God accepts the willing mind. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many a man is kept in darkness and unrest because he fails to obey God on this point. If the plough has gone deep, if the repentance is true, it will bring forth fruit. What use is there in my coming to God until I am willing to make it good, like Zacchaeus, if I have done any man wrong or have taken anything from him falsely? &quot;If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him&quot; (Eze 33:15-16). Confession and restitution are the steps that lead up to forgiveness. Until you tread those steps, you may expect your conscience to be troubled, your sin to haunt you. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I was preaching in British Columbia some years ago, and a young man came to me and wanted to become a Christian. He had been smuggling opium into the States. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well, my friend,&quot; I said, &quot;I don&#39;t think there is any chance for you to become a Christian until you make restitution.&quot; He said, &quot;If I attempt to do that, I will fall into the clutches of the law, and I will go to the penitentiary.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I replied, &quot;you had better do that than go to the judgment-seat of God with that sin upon your soul, and have eternal punishment. The Lord will be very merciful if you set your face to do right.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He went away sorrowful, but came back the next day, and said: &quot;I have a young wife and child, and all the furniture in my house I have bought with money I have got in this dishonest way. If I become a Christian, that furniture will have to go, and my wife will know it.&quot; &quot;Better let your wife know it, and better let your home and furniture go.&quot; &quot;Would you come up and see my wife?&quot; he asked, &quot;I don&#39;t know what she will say.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I went up to see her, and when I told her, the tears trickled down her cheeks, and she said: &quot;Mr. Moody, I will gladly give everything if my husband can become a true Christian.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">She took out her pocketbook, and handed over her last penny. He had a piece of land in the United States, which he deeded over to the government. I do not know in all my backward track of any living man who has had a better testimony for Jesus Christ than that man. He had been dishonest, but when the truth came to him that he must make it right before God would help him, he made it right and then God used him wonderfully. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">No amount of weeping over sin and saying that you feel sorry is going to help it unless you are willing to confess, and make restitution. </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">

		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Thou shalt nor bear false witness against thy neighbour. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">TWO OUT OF THE Ten Commandments deal with sins that find expression by the tongue-the third commandment, which forbids taking God&#39;s name in vain, and this ninth commandment, which forbids false witness against our neighbor. This twofold prohibition ought to impress us as a solemn warning, especially as we find that the pages of Scripture are full of condemnation of sins of the tongue. The Psalms, Proverbs, and the epistle of James deal largely with the subject. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">TRUTH NECESSARY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Organized society of a degree higher than that of the herding of animals and Rocking of birds depends so much upon the power of speech, that without it we may say society would be impossible. Language is an essential element in the social fabric. To fulfill its purpose it must be trustworthy. Words must command confidence. Anything which undermines the truth takes (as it were) the mortar out of the building, and if general, must mean ruin. Paul said, &quot;Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another&quot; (Eph 4:25). Note the reason given-- &quot;we are members one of another.&quot; All community, all union and fellowship would be shattered if a man did not know whether to believe his neighbor or not. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The transgressions of this commandment are very varied in form, and very frequent. Men and women of all ages have to guard against them. They include some of the most besetting sins. David said in his haste, &quot;All men are liars&quot; (Ps 116:11). Someone has remarked that if he had been living nowadays, he might say it without haste and not be very far wide of the truth. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">PERJURY</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The bearing of false witness is forbidden, but this must not be limited merely to testimony given in the law court or under oath. Isn&#39;t it a condemnation that men have to be put under oath in order to make sure of their speaking the truth? As a legal offense, perjury-- the bearing of false witness when under oath-- is one of the most serious crimes that can be committed. Nearly every civilized nation visits it : with heavy punishment. Unless promptly checked, it would shake the very foundation of justice. Lying-- uttering or acting falsehood-- and slander-- the spreading of false reports tending to destroy the reputation of another-- are two of the most common violations of this commandment. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">LYING</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We have got nowadays so that we divide lies into white lies and black lies, society lies, business lies, etc. The Word of God knows no such letting-down of the standard. A lie is a lie, no matter what are the circumstances under which it is uttered, or by whom. I have heard that in Slam they sew up the mouth of a confirmed liar. I am afraid if that was the custom in America, a good many would suffer. Parents should begin with their children while they are young and teach them to be strictly truthful at all times. There is a proverb: &quot;A lie has no legs.&quot; It requires other lies to support it. Tell one lie and you are forced to tell others to back it up. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">SLANDER</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You don&#39;t like to have anyone bear false witness against you, or help to ruin your character or reputation; then why should you do it to others? How public men are slandered in this country! None escape, whether good or bad. Judgment is passed upon them, their family, their character, by the press and by individuals who know little or nothing about them. If one-tenth that is said and written about our public men were true, half of them should be hung. Slander has been called &quot;tongue murder.&quot; Slanders are compared to flies that always settle on sores, but do not touch a man&#39;s good parts. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If the archangel Gabriel should come down to earth and mix in human affairs, I believe his character would be assailed inside of forty-eight hours. Slander called Christ a gluttonous man and a wine- bibber. He claimed to be the Truth, but instead of worshiping Him, men took Him and crucified Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When anyone spoke evil of another in the presence of Peter the Great, he used promptly to stop him, and say: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Well, now, has he not got a bright side? Tell me what you know good of him. It is easy to splash mud, but I would rather help a man to keep his coat clean.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I need not stop to run through the whole catalog of sins that are related to these three. False rumor, exaggeration, misrepresentation, insinuation, gossip, equivocation, holding back of the truth when it is due and right to tell it, disparagement, perversion of meaning: these are common transgressions of this ninth commandment, differing in form and degree of guilt according to the motive or manner of their expression. They bear false witness against a man before the tribunal of public opinion-- court whose judgment none of us escapes. As so much of our life is passed in public view, any untruth that leads to a false judgment is a grievous wrong. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A TEST OF TRUE RELIGION</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Government of the tongue is made the test of true religion by James. &quot;If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man&#39;s religion is vain&quot; (Ja 1: 26). &quot;For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and be able also to bridle the whole body&quot; (Ja 3:2). Just as a doctor looks at the tongue and can tell the condition of the bodily health, so a man&#39;s words are an index of what is within. Truth will spring from a good heart: falsehood and deceit from a corrupt heart. When Ananias kept back part of the price of the land, Peter asked him, &quot;Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost&quot; (Ac 5:3)? Satan is the father of lies and the promoter of lies. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">FOR GOOD OR EVIL The tongue can be an instrument of untold good or incalculable evil. Someone has said that a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. &quot;Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully&quot; (Ps 52:2); &quot;They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders poison is under their lips&quot; (Ps 140:3); &quot;The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked&quot; (Pr 10:11); &quot;A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit&quot; (Pr 15:4). Bishop Hall said that the tongues of busybodies are like the tails of Samson&#39;s foxes-- they carry firebrands and are enough to set the whole field of the world in a flame. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Behold, we put bits in the horses mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind: but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth&quot; (Ja 3:3-14). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Blighted hopes and blasted reputations are whims to its awful power. In many cases the tongue has murdered its victims. Can we not all recall cases where men and women have died under the wounds of calumny and misrepresentation? History is full of such cases. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">WORDS NEVER CALLED BACK</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The most dangerous thing about it is that a word once uttered can never be obliterated. Someone has said that lying is a worse crime than counterfeiting. There is some hope of following up bad coins until they are all recovered; but an evil word can never be overtaken. The mind of the hearer or reader has been poisoned, and human devices cannot reach in and cleanse it. Lies can never be called back. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A woman who was well known as a scandalmonger, went and confessed to the priest. He gave her a ripe thistle-top, and told her to go out and scatter the seeds one by one. She wondered at the penance, but obeyed; then she came and told the priest. He next told her to go and gather again the scattered seeds. Of course she saw that it was impossible. The priest used it as an object lesson to cure her of the sin of scandalous talk. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">THE FATE OF THE LIAR AND SLANDERER</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">These sins are devilish, and the Bible is severe in its denunciations of them. It contains many solemn warnings. &quot;Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD Will abhor the bloody and deceitful man&quot; (Ps 5:6). The mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off&quot; (Ps 101:5); &quot;Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are His delight&quot; (Pr 12:22); &quot;By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned&quot; (Mt 12:37); &quot;All liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death&quot; (Rev 21:8). &quot;Whosoever loveth and maketh a lie&quot; shall in no wise enter into the new Jerusalem (Rev 22:15). </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">HOW TO OVERCOME</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;But, Mr. Moody,&quot; you say, &quot;how can I check myself? How can I overcome the habit of lying and gossip?&quot; A lady once said to me that she had got so into the habit of exaggerating, that her friends said they could never understand her. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The cure is simple, but not very pleasant. Treat it as a sin, and confess it to God and the man whom you have wronged. As soon as you catch yourself lying, go straight to the person and confess you have lied. Let your confession be as wide as your transgression. If you have slandered or lied about anyone in public, let your confession be public. Many a person says some mean, false thing about another in the presence of others, and then tries to patch it up by going to that person alone. That is not making restitution. I need not go to God with confession until I have made it right with that person, if it is in my power to do so; He will not hear me. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Hannah Moore&#39;s method was a sure cure for scandal. Whenever she was told anything derogatory of another, her invariable reply was: &quot;Come, we will go ask if it be true.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The effect was sometimes ludicrously painful. The talebearer was taken aback, stammered out a qualification, or begged that no notice might be taken of the statement. But the good lady was inexorable. Off she took the scandalmonger to the scandalized to make inquiry and compare accounts. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is not likely that anybody ventured a second time to repeat a gossipy story to Hannah Moore. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friend, how is it? If God should weigh you against this commandment, would you be found wanting? &quot;Thou shalt not bear false witness.&quot; Are you innocent or guilty? </span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs22A4A3A6">The Tenth Commandment</span></h3>
		<h3 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs81CFE3A8">Thou shalt nor covet thy neighbour&#39;s house, thou shalt not cover thy neighbour&#39;s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour&#39;s. </span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">IN THE TWELFTH CHAPTER Of Luke, our Saviour lifted two danger signals. &quot;Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy&quot; (v. 1), and &quot;Take heed, and beware of covetousness&quot; (v. 15). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The greatest dupe the devil has in the world is the hypocrite; but the next greatest is the covetous man, &quot;for a man&#39;s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth&quot; (Lk 12:15). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I believe this sin is much stronger now than ever before in the world&#39;s history. We are not in the habit of calling it a sin. In his first epistle to the Thessalonians Paul speaks of a &quot;cloak of covetousness&quot; (2:5). Covetous men use it as a cloak and call it prudence and foresight. Who ever heard it confessed as a sin? I have heard many confessions, in public and private, during the past forty years, but never have ] heard a man confess that he was guilty of this sin. The Bible does not tell of one man who ever recovered from it, and in all my experience I do not recall many who have been able to shake it off after it had fastened on them. A covetous man or woman generally remains covetous to the very end. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We may say that covetous desire plunged the human race into sin. We can trace the river back from age to age until we get to its rise in Eden. When Eve saw that the forbidden fruit was good for food and that it was desirable to the eyes, she partook of it, and Adam with her. They were not satisfied with alt that God had showered upon them, but coveted the wisdom of gods which Satan deceitfully told them might be obtained by eating the fruit. She saw, she desired, then she took! Three steps from innocence into sin. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A SEARCHING COMMANDMENT</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It would be absurd for such a law as this to be placed upon any human statute book. It could never be enforced. The officers of the law would be powerless to detect infractions. The outward conduct may be regulated, but the thoughts and intents of a man are beyond the reach of human law. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But God can see behind outward actions. He can read the thoughts of the heart. Our innermost life, invisible to mortal eye, is laid bare before Him. We cannot deceive Him by external conformity. He is able to detect the least transgression and shortcoming, so that no man can shirk detection. God cannot be imposed upon by the cleanness of the outside of the cup and the platter. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Surely we have here another proof that the Ten Commandments are not of human origin, but must be divine. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This commandment, then, did not, even on the surface, confine itself to visible actions, as did the preceding commandments. Even before Christ came and showed their spiritual sweep, men had a commandment that went beneath public conduct and touched the very springs of action. It directly prohibited-- not the wrong act, but the wicked desire that prompted the act. It forbade the evil thought, the unlawful wish. It sought to prevent-- not only sin, but the desire to sin. In God&#39;s sight it is as wicked to set covetous eyes as it is to lay thieving hands upon anything that is not ours. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And why? Because if the evil desire can be controlled, there will be no outbreak in conduct. Desires have been called &quot;actions in the egg.&quot; The desire in the heart is the first step in the series that ends in action. Kill the evil desire, and you successfully avoid the ill results that would follow upon its hatching and development. Prevention is better than cure. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We must not limit covetousness to the matter of money. The commandment is not thus limited; it reads, &quot;Thou shalt not covet ... anything.&quot; That word &quot;anything&quot; is what will condemn us. Though we do not join the race for wealth, have we not sometimes a hungry longing for our neighbor&#39;s goodly lands, fine houses, beautiful clothes, brilliant reputation, personal accomplishments, easy circumstances, comfortable surroundings? Have we not had the desire to increase our possessions or to change our lot in accordance with what we see in others? If so, we are guilty of having broken this law. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">GOD&#39;S THOUGHTS ABOUT COVETOUSNESS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let us examine a few of the Bible passages that bear down on this sin, and see what are God&#39;s thoughts about it. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God&quot; (1 Co 6:9-10, italics added). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Notice that the covetous are named between thieves and drunkards. We lock up thieves and have no mercy on them. We loathe drunkards and consider them great sinners against the law of God as well as the law of the land. Yet there is far more said in the Bible against covetousness than against either stealing or drunkenness. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Covetousness and stealing are almost like Siamese twins-- they go together so often. In fact we might add lying, and make them triplets. The covetous person is a thief in the shell. The thief is a covetous person out of the shell. Let a covetous person see something that he desires very much; let an opportunity of taking it be offered; how very soon he will break through the shell and come out in his true character as a thief. The Greek word translated covetousness means &quot;an inordinate desire of getting.&quot; When the Gauls tasted the sweet wines of Italy, they asked where they came from and never rested until they had overrun Italy. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God&quot; (Eph 5:5). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There we have the same truth repeated; but notice that covetousness is called idolatry. The covetous man worships mammon, not God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens&quot; (Ex 18:21, italics added). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Isn&#39;t it extraordinary that Jethro, the man of the desert, should have given this advice to Moses? How did he learn to beware of covetousness? We honor men today if they are wealthy and covetous. We elect them to office in church and state. We often say that they will make better treasurers just because we know them to be covetous. But in God&#39;s sight a covetous man is as vile and black as any thief or drunkard. David said: &quot;The wicked boasteth of his heart&#39;s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth&quot; (Ps 10:3). I am afraid that many who profess to have put away wickedness also speak well of the covetous. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A SORE EVIL</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? The sleep of the labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich, will not suffer him to sleep. There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt&quot; (Ec 5:10-13). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Isn&#39;t that true? Is the covetous man ever satisfied with his possessions? Aren&#39;t they vanity? Does he have peace of mind? Don&#39;t selfish riches always bring hurt? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The folly of covetousness is well shown in the following extract: If you should see a man that had a large pond of water, yet living in continual thirst, nor suffering himself to drink half a draught for fear of lessening his pond; if you should see him wasting his time and strength in fetching more water to his pond, aIways thirsty, yet always carrying a bucket of water in his hand, watching early and late to catch the glimpse of rain, gaping after every cloud, and running greedily into every mire and mud in hopes of water, and always studying how to make every ditch empty itself into the pond; if you should see him grow grey in these anxious labors, and at last end a thirsty life by falling into his own pond, would you not say that such a one was not only the author of his own disquiet, but was foolish enough to be reckoned among madmen? But foolish and absurd as this character is,it does not represent half the follies and absurd disquiets of the covetous man.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have read of a millionaire in France who was a miser. In order to make sure of his wealth, he dug a cave in his wine cellar so large and deep that he could go down into it with a ladder. The entrance had a door with a spring lock. After a time, he was missing Search was made, but they could find no trace of him. At last his house was sold, and the purchaser discovered this door in the cellar. He opened it, went down, and found the miser lying dead on the ground in the midst of his riches. The door must have shut accidentally after him, and he perished miserably. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A TEMPTATION AND A SNARE</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;They that will be [that is, desire to be] rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition&quot; (1 Ti 6:9). The Bible speaks of the deceitfulness of two things-- &quot;the deceitfulness of sin&quot; and &quot;the deceitfulness of riches.&quot; Riches are like a mirage in the desert which has all the appearance of satisfying and lures the traveler on with the promise of water and shade; but he only wastes his strength in the effort to reach it. So riches never satisfy: the pursuit of them always turns out a snare. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Lot coveted the rich plains of Sodom, and what did he gain? After twenty years spent in that wicked city, he had to escape for his life, leaving all his wealth behind him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">What did the thirty pieces of silver do for Judas? Weren&#39;t they a snare? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Think of Balaam. He is generally regarded as a false prophet, but I do not find that any of his prophecies that are recorded are not true; they have been literally fulfilled. Up to a certain point his character shone magnificently, but the devil finally overcame him by the bait of covetousness. He stepped over a heavenly crown for the riches and honors that Balak promised him. He went to perdition backwards. His face was set toward God, but be backed into hell. He wanted to die the death of the righteous, but he did not live the life of the righteous. It is sad to see so many who know God miss everything for riches. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then consider the case of Gehazi. There is another man who was drowned in destruction and perdition by covetousness. He got more out of Naaman than he asked for, but he also got Naaman&#39;s leprosy. Think how he forfeited the friendship of his master Elisha, the man of God! So today lifelong friends are separated by this accursed desire. Homes are broken up. Men are willing to sell out peace and happiness for the sake of a few dollars. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Didn&#39;t David fall into foolish and hurtful lusts? He saw Bathsheba, Uriah&#39;s wife, and she was &quot;very beautiful to look upon,&quot; and David became a murderer and an adulterer. The guilty longing hurled him into the deepest pit of sin. He had to reap bitterly as he had sowed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I heard of a wealthy German out West who owned a lumber mill. He was worth nearly two millions of dollars, but his covetousness was so great that he once worked as a common laborer carrying railroad ties all day. It was the cause of his death. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it&quot; (Jos 7:20-21, italics added) . </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He saw-- he coveted-- he took-- he hid! The covetous eye was what led Achan up to the wicked deed that brought sorrow and defeat upon the camp of Israel. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We know the terrible punishment that was meted out to Achan. God seems to have set danger signals at the threshold of each new age. It is remarkable how soon the first outbreaks of covetousness occurred. Think of Eve in Eden, Achan just after Israel had entered the Promised Land, Ananias and Sapphira in the early Christian church. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">A ROOT EXTRACTOR</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows&quot; (1 Ti 6:10). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This tenth commandment has therefore been aptly called a &quot;root-extractor,&quot; because it would tear up and destroy this root. No one but God can rid us of it. Matthew tells us that the deceitfulness of riches chokes the Word of God. Like the Mississippi river, which chokes up its mouth by the amount of soil it carried down. Isn&#39;t that true of many businessmen today? They are so engrossed with their affairs that they have not time for religion. They lose sight of their soul and its eternal welfare in their desire to amass wealth. They do not even hesitate to sell their souls to the devil. How many a man says, &quot;We must make money, and if God&#39;s law stands in the way, brush it aside.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The word &quot;lucre&quot; occurs five times in the New Testament, and each time it is called &quot;filthy lucre.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;A root of all kinds of evil.&quot; Yes, because what will not men be guilty of when prompted by the desire to be rich? Greed for gold leads men to commit violence and murder, to cheat and deceive and steal. It turns the heart to stone, devoid of all natural affection, cruel, unkind. How many families are wrecked am the father&#39;s will! The scramble for a share of the wealth smashes them to pieces. Covetous of rank and position in society, parents barter sons and daughters in ungodly marriage. Bodily health is no consideration The uncontrollable fever for gold makes men renounce all their settled prospects and undertake hazardous journeys--no peril can drive them back. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It destroys faith and spirituality, turning men&#39;s minds and hearts away from God. It disturbs the peace of the community by prompting to acts of wrong. Covetousness has more than once led nation to war against nation for the sake of gaining territory or other material resources. It is said that when the Spaniards came over to conquer Peru, they sent a &quot;: message to the king, saying, &quot;Give us gold, for we Spaniards have a disease that can only be cured by gold.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Dr. Boardman has shown how covetousness leads to the transgression of every one of the commandments, and I cannot do better than quote his words: *Coveting tempts us into the violation of the first commandment, worshiping mammon in addition to Jehovah. Coveting tempts us into a violation of the second commandment, or idolatry. The apostle Paul expressly identifies the covetous man with an idolater: &quot;Covetousness, which is idolatry.&#39; Again: Coveting tempts us into violation of the third commandment, or sacrilegious falsehood: for instance, Gehazi, lying on the matter of his interview with Naaman the Syrian, and Ananias and Sapphira perjuring themselves in the matter of the community of goods. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Again: Coveting tempts us into the violation of the fourth commandment, or Sabbath-breaking. It is covetousness which encroaches on God&#39;s appointed day of sacred rest, tempting us to run trains for merely secular purposes, to vend tobacco and liquors, to hawk newspapers. Again: Coveting tempts us into the violation of the fifth commandment, or disrespect for authority; tempting the young man to deride his early parental counsels, the citizen to trample on civic enactments. Again: Covetousness tempts us into violation of the sixth commandment, or murder. Recall how Judas&#39; love of money lured him into the betrayal of his divine Friend into the hand of His murderers, his lure being the paltry sum of, say, fifteen dollars. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Again: Covetousness tempts us into the Violation of the seventh commandment, or adultery. Observe bow Scripture combines greed and lust. Again: Covetousness tempts us into the violation of the eighth commandment, or theft. Recall how it tempted Achan to steal a goodly Babylonish mantle, (two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight. Again: Covetousness tempts Us into the violation of the ninth commandment, or having false witness against our neighbor. Recall how the covetousness of Ahab instigated his wife Jezebel to employ sons of Belial to bear blasphemous and fatal testimony against Naboth, saying, &quot;Thou didst curse God and the king.&quot; </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">

I think I can tell you. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the first place, make up your mind that by the grace of God you will overcome the spirit of selfishness. You must overcome it, or it will overcome you. Paul said: &quot;Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: for which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience&quot; (Col 3:5-6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I heard of a rich man who was asked to make a contribution on behalf of some charitable object. The text was quoted to him, &quot;He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again&quot; (Pr 19:17). He said that the security might be good enough, but the credit was too long. He was dead within two weeks. The wrath of God rested upon him as he never expected. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If you find yourself getting very miserly, begin to scatter, like a wealthy farmer in New York state I heard of. He was a noted miser, but he was converted. Soon after, a poor man who had been burned out and had no provisions, came to him for help. The farmer thought he would be liberal and give the man a ham from his smokehouse. On his way to get it, the tempter whispered to him: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Give him the smallest one you have.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">He had a struggle whether he would give a large or a small ham, but finally he took down the largest he could find. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;You are a fool,&quot; the devil said. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;If you don&#39;t keep still,&quot; the farmer replied, &quot;I will give him every ham I have in the smokehouse.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Mr. Durant told me he woke up one morning to find that he was a rich man, and he said that the greatest struggle of his life then took place as to whether he would let money be his master, or he be master of money; whether he would be its slave, or make it a slave to him. At last he got the victory, and that was how Wellesley College came to be built. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the next place, cultivate the spirit of contentment. &quot;Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me&quot; (Heb 13:5-6). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Contentment is the very opposite of covetousness, which is continually craving for something it does not possess. &quot;Be content with such things as ye have&quot; (Heb 13:5), not worrying about the future, because God has promised never to leave or forsake you. What does the child of God want more than this? I would rather have that promise than all the gold of the earth. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Would to God that we might be able to say with Paul, &quot;I have coveted no man&#39;s silver, or gold, or apparel&quot; (Ac 20:33). The Lord had made him partaker of His grace, and he was soon to be a partaker of His glory, and earthly things looked very small. &quot;Godliness with contentment is great gain,&quot; he wrote to Timothy; &quot;having food and raiment therewith let us be content&quot; (1 Ti 6:6, 8). Observe that he puts godliness first. No worldly gain can satisfy the human heart. Roll the whole world in, and still there would be room. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">May God tear the scales off our eyes if we are blinded by this sin. Oh, the folly of it, that we should set our heart&#39;s affections upon anything below! For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. &quot;Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him&quot; (Ps 49:16-17). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The Handwriting Blotted Out WE HAVE NOW CONSIDERED the Ten Commandments, and the question for each one of us is-- are we keeping them? If God should weigh us by them, would we be found wanting or not wanting? Do we keep the law, the whole law? Are we obeying God with all our heart? Do we render Him a full and willing obedience? </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">ONE LAW, NOT TEN</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">These Ten Commandments are not ten different laws; they are one law. If I am being held up in the air by a chain with ten links and I break one of them, down I come, just as surely as if I break the whole ten. If I am forbidden to go out of an enclosure, it makes no difference at what point I break through the fence. &quot;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all&quot; (la 2: 10). The golden chain of obedience is broken if one link is missing. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We sometimes hear people pray to be preserved from certain sin, as if they were in no danger of committing others. I firmly believe that if a man begins by willfully breaking one of these commandments it is much easier for him to break the others. I know of a gentleman who had a confidential clerk and insisted on his going down Sunday morning to work on his books. The young man had a good deal of principle, and at first refused; but he was anxious to keep in the good graces of his employer and finally yielded. He had not done that a great while before he speculated in stocks, and became a defaulter for one hundred and twenty thousand dollars. The employer had him arrested and put in the penitentiary for ten years, but I believe he was just as guilty in the sight of God as that young man, for he led him to Cake the fist step on the downward road. You remember the story of a soldier who was smuggled into a fortress in a load of hay, and opened the gates to his comrades. Every sin we commit opens the door for other sins. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">ALL HAVE COME SHORT</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">For fifteen hundred years man was under the law, and no one was equal to it. Christ came and showed that the commandments went beyond the mere letter; and can anyone since say that he has been able to keep them in his own strength? As the plummet is held up, we see how much we are out of the perpendicular. As we measure ourselves by that holy standard, we find how much we are lacking. As a child said, when reproved by her mother and told that she ought to do right: &quot;How can I do right when there is no right in me?&quot; &quot;All have sinned and come short of the glory of God&quot; (Ro 3:23), &quot;There is none righteous, no, not one&quot; (Ro 3:10). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I do not say that all are equally guilty of gross violations of the commandments. It needs a certain amount of reckless courage openly to break a law, human or divine; but it is easy to crack them, as the child said. It has been remarked that the life of many professors of religion is full of fractures that result from little sins, little acts of temper and selfishness. It is possible to crack a costly vase so finely that it cannot be noticed by the observer; but let this be done again and again in different directions, and some day the vase will go to pieces at a touch. When we hear of someone who has had a lifelong reputation for good character and consistent living, suddenly falling into some shameful sin, we are shocked and puzzled. If we knew all, we would find that only the fall has been sudden, that he has been sliding toward it for years. Away back in his life we should find numerous cracked commandments. His exposure is only the falling of the vase to pieces. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">FALSE WEIGHTS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Men have all sorts of weights that they think are going to satisfy, but they will find that they are altogether vanity, and lighter than vanity. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The moral man is as guilty as the rest. His morality cannot save him. &quot;Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish&quot; (Lk 13:3, 5). &quot;Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven&quot; (Mt 18:3). I have often heard good people say that our meetings were doing good, they were reaching the drunkards, and gamblers, and harlots; but they never realized that they needed the grace of God for themselves. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Nicodemus was probably one of the most moral men of his day. He was a teacher of the law. Yet Christ said to him: &quot;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot; It is much easier to reach thieves and drunkards and vagabonds than self-righteous Pharisees. You do not have to preach to those men for weeks and months to convince them that they are sinners. When a man learns that he has need of God and that he is a sinner, it is very easy to reach him. But the self-righteous Pharisee needs salvation as much as any drunkard that walks the streets. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I read of a minister traveling in the South who obtained permission to preach in the local jail. A son of his host went with him. On the way back the young man who was not a Christian, said to the minister: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;I hope some of the convicts were impressed. Such a sermon as that ought to do them good.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Did it do you good? the minister asked. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Oh, you were preaching to the convicts&quot; the young man answered. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The minister shook his head, and said: &quot;I preached Christ, and you need Him as much as they.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If you do not repent of your sins and ask Him for mercy, there is no hope for you. Let me ask you to take this question home to yourself. If a summons would come at midnight for you to be &quot;weighed in the balances,&quot; what would become of your soul? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Many are only making a profession. Are you ready to be weighed-- ready to step into the scales? A great many would be found like those five foolish virgins. When the hour came, they would be found with no oil in their lamps. If you have only an empty lamp, or are living on mere formalism, I beg of you to give it up. Give up that dead, cold, miserable lukewarmness. God will have none of it. Are you lusting to your good works? Do you drink your Bible, your crucifix, your prayers, your churchgoing will help you? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Or do you set your hope upon your education, your wealth, your earthly distinctions? What will your university education amount to, and all your wealth and honors, if you go down through lust and passion and covetousness, and lose your soul at last? We are not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold but with the precious blood of Christ. If you have not Christ when God weighs you, &quot;Tekel&quot; will be your sentence. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">DO NOT DESPAIR</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can imagine that you are saying to yourself, &quot;If we are to be judged by these laws, how are we going to be saved? Nearly every one of them has been broken by us-- in spirit, if not in letter.&quot; I almost hear you say: &quot;I wonder if Mr. Moody is ready to be weighed. Would he like to put those tests to himself?&quot; With all humility I reply that if God commanded me to step into the scales now, I am ready. &quot;What!&quot; you say, &quot;haven&#39;t you broken the law? Yes, I have. I was a sinner before God, the same as you; but forty years ago I pled guilty at His bar. I cried for mercy, and He forgave me. If I step into the scales, the Son of God has promised to be with me. I would not dare to step in without Him. If I did, how quickly the scales would fly up! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">CHRIST IS ALL Christ kept the law. If He had ever broken it, He would have to die for Himself; but because He was a Lamb without spot or blemish, His atoning death is efficacious for you and me. He had no sin of His own to atone for, and so God accepted His sacrifice. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth. We are righteous in God&#39;s sight, because the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ is unto all and upon all them that believe. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If we had to live forever with our sins in the handwriting of God on the wall, it would be hell on earth. But thank God for the Gospel we preach! If we repent, our sins will all be blotted out. &quot;You, being dead in your sins . . . hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross&quot; (Col 2:13-14). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">LOVE, THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW If the love of God is shed abroad in your heart, you will be able to fulfill the law. Paul reduced the commandments to one: Love is the fulfilling of the law&quot; (Ro 13:10). Someone has written the following: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Love to God will admit no other God. Love resents everything that debases its object by representing it by an image. Love to God will never dishonor His name. Love to God will reverence His day. Love to parents makes one honor them. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Hate, not love, is a murderer. Lust, not love, commits adultery. Love will give, but never steal. Love will not slander or lie. Love&#39;s eye is not covetous. </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="csE76D6F74">ARE YOU READY? </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is the height of madness to turn away and run the risk of being called by God to judgment and have no hope in Christ. Now is the day and hour to accept salvation, and then He will be with you. Do you step aside and say: &quot;I&#39;m not ready yet. I want a little more time to prepare, to turn the matter over in my mind&quot;? Well, you have time, but bear in mind it is only the present; you do not know that you will have tomorrow. Wasn&#39;t Belshazzar cut off suddenly? Would he have believed that that was going to be his last night, that he would never see the light of another sun? That banquet of sin didn&#39;t close as he expected. As long as you delay you are in danger. If you don&#39;t enter into the kingdom of heaven by God&#39;s way, you cannot enter at all. You must accept Christ as your Saviour, or you will never be fit to be weighed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friend, do you have Him? Will you remain as you are and be found wanting, or will you accept Christ and be ready for the summons? &quot;This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life: and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life&quot; (1 Jn. 5:11, 12). </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">To the Afflicted</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If I were to ask this audience what Christ came into this world for, every one of you would say to save sinners, and then you would stop.&nbsp; A great many think that is all Christ came to do - to save sinners. Now, we are told that He came, to be sure, to &quot;seek and save that which was lost&quot;; but then He came to do more.&nbsp; He came to heal the broken hearted.&nbsp; In that eighteenth verse of the fourth chapter of Luke, which I read to you last night, He said that the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him, and that He was anointed to preach the Gospel to the poor, and in the next sentence He tells us, He is sent </span><span class="cs33C45E07">to heal the broken hearted</span><span class="csA7555675">. In another place we are told He came into the world to declare who the Father was, and reveal Him to the sons of men. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Tonight I want to take up this one thought - that Christ was sent into the world to heal the broken hearted.&nbsp; When the Prince of Wales came to this country a few years ago, the whole country was excited as to his purpose.&nbsp; What was his object in coming here?&nbsp; Had he come to look into our republican form of government, or our institutions, or was it simply to see and be seen?&nbsp; He came and he went without telling us what he came for. When the Prince of Peace came into this dark world, He did not come in any private way.&nbsp; He tells us that He came, not to see and be seen, but to &quot;seek and save that which was lost&quot; and also &quot;to heal the broken hearted.&quot; And in the face of this announcement, it is a mystery to me why those who have broken hearts will rather carry them year in and year out, than just bring them to this Great Physician. How many men in Chicago are just going down to their graves with a broken heart?&nbsp; They have carried their hearts weighted with trouble for years and years, and yet when they open the Scriptures they can see the passage telling us that He came here for the purpose of healing the broken hearted.&nbsp; He left Heaven and all its glory to come to the world - sent by the Father, He tells us, for the purpose of healing the broken hearted. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You will find, my friends, that there is no class of people exempt from broken hearts.&nbsp; The rich and the poor suffer alike. There was a time when I used to visit the poor, that I thought all the broken hearts were to be found among them, but within the last few years I have found there are as many broken hearts among the learned as the unlearned, the cultured as the uncultured, the rich as the poor.&nbsp; If you could but go up one of our avenues and down another, and reach the hearts of the people, and get them to turn out their whole story, you would be astonished at the wonderful history of every family. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I remember a few years ago I had been out of the city for some weeks.&nbsp; When I returned I started out to make some calls.&nbsp; The first place I went to I found a mother, her eyes red with weeping.&nbsp; I tried to find out what was troubling her, and she reluctantly opened her heart and told me all. She said, &quot;Last night my only boy came home about midnight drunk.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know that he was addicted to drunkenness, but this morning I found out that he has been drinking for weeks, and,&quot; she continued, &quot;I would rather have seen him laid in the grave than have him brought home in the condition I saw him in last night.&quot; I tried to comfort her as best I could when she told me her sad story.&nbsp; When I went away from that house I didn&#39;t want to go into any other house where there was family trouble.&nbsp; The very next house I went to, however, where some of the children who attended my Sunday school resided, I found that death had been there and laid his hand on one of them.&nbsp; The mother spoke to me of her afflictions, and brought to me the playthings and the little shoes of the child, and the tears trickled down that mother&#39;s checks as she related to me her sorrow. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I got out as soon as possible, and hoped I should see no more family trouble that day. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The next visit I made was to a home where I found a wife with a bitter story.&nbsp; Her husband had been neglecting her for a long time, &quot;and now,&quot; she said, &quot;he has left me, and I don&#39;t know where he has gone.&nbsp; Winter is coming on, and I don&#39;t know what is going to become of my family,&quot; I tried to comfort her, and prayed with her, and endeavored to get her to lay all her sorrows on Christ.&nbsp; The next home I entered I found a woman crushed and broken hearted.&nbsp; She told me her boy had forsaken her, and she had no idea where he had gone. That afternoon I made five calls, and in every home I found a broken heart.&nbsp; Every one had a sad tale to tell, and if you visited any home in Chicago you would find the truth of the saying, that &quot;there is a skeleton in every house.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I suppose while I am talking, you are thinking of the great sorrow in your own bosom.&nbsp; I do not know anything about you, but if I came round to every one of you, and you were to tell me the truth, I would hear a tale of sorrow.&nbsp; The very last man I spoke to last night was a young mercantile man, who told me his load of sorrow had been so great, that many times during the last few weeks he had gone down to the lake and had been tempted to plunge in and end his existence.&nbsp; His burden seemed too much for him.&nbsp; Think of the broken hearts in Chicago tonight!&nbsp; They could be numbered by hundreds - yea, by thousands.&nbsp; All over this city are broken hearts.&nbsp; If all the sorrow represented in this great city was written in a book, this building couldn&#39;t hold that book, and you couldn&#39;t read it in a long life time. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This earth is not a stranger to tears, neither is the present the only time when they could be found in abundance. From Adam&#39;s days to ours tears have been shed, and a wail has been going up to Heaven from the broken hearted.&nbsp; And I say it again, it is a mystery to me how all those broken hearts can keep away from Him who has come to heal them.&nbsp; For six thousand years that cry of sorrow has been going up to God.&nbsp; We find the tears of Jacob put on record, when he was told that his own son was no more.&nbsp; His sons and daughters tried to give him comfort, but he refused to be comforted.&nbsp; We are also told of the tears of King David.&nbsp; I can see him, as the messenger brings the news of the death of his son, exclaiming in anguish, &quot;O, Absalom, my son, would that I had died for thee!&quot; And when Christ came into the world the first sound He heard was woe - the wail of those mothers in Bethlehem; and from the manger to the Cross, He was surrounded with sorrow.&nbsp; We are told that He often looked up to Heaven and sighed. I believe it was because there was so much suffering around Him. It was on His right hand and on His left - everywhere on earth; and the thought that He had come to relieve the people of the earth of their burdens, and so few would accept Him, made Him sorrowful.&nbsp; He came for that purpose.&nbsp; Let the hundreds of thousands just cast their burdens on Him.&nbsp; He has come to bear them, as well as our sins.&nbsp; He will bear our griefs and carry our sorrows.&nbsp; There is not a burdened son of Adam in Chicago who cannot but be freed if he will only come to Him. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let me call your attention to this little word &quot;sent.&quot; &quot;He hath sent me.&quot; Take your Bibles and read about those who have been sent by God, and one thought will come to you - that no man who has ever been sent by God to do His work has ever failed.&nbsp; No matter how great the work, how mighty the undertaking; no matter how many difficulties had to be encountered, when they were sent from God they were sure to succeed. God sent Moses down to Egypt to bring 3,000,000 people out of bondage.&nbsp; The idea would have seemed absurd to most people.&nbsp; Fancy a man with an impediment in his speech, without an army, without Generals, with no record, bringing 3,000,000 people from the power of a great nation like that of the Egyptians.&nbsp; But God sent him, and what was the result?&nbsp; Pharaoh said they should not go, and the great king and all his army were going to prevent them.&nbsp; But did he succeed?&nbsp; God sent Moses and he didn&#39;t fail. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We find that God sent Joshua to the walls of Jericho, and he marched around the walls, and at the proper time those walls came tumbling down and the city fell into his hands.&nbsp; God sent Eliab to stand before Ahab, and we read the result; Samson and Gideon were sent by God and we are told in the Scriptures what they accomplished, and so all through the word we find that when God sent men they have never failed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, do you think for a moment that God&#39;s own Son sent to us is going to fail?&nbsp; If Moses, Elijah, Joshua, Gideon, Samson, and all these mighty men sent by God succeeded in doing their work, do you think the Son of Man is going to fail?&nbsp; Do you think, if He has come to heal broken hearts, He is going to fail?&nbsp; Do you think there is a heart so bruised and broken that can&#39;t be healed by Him?&nbsp; He can heal them all, but the great trouble is that men won&#39;t come.&nbsp; If there is a broken heart here tonight just bring it to the Great Physician, if you break an arm or a leg, you run off and get the best physician.&nbsp; If you have a broken heart, you needn&#39;t go to a doctor or Minister with it; the best physician is the Great Physician.&nbsp; In the days of Christ they didn&#39;t have hospitals or physicians as we have now.&nbsp; When a man was sick he was taken to the door, and the passersby prescribed for him.&nbsp; If a man came along who had had the same disease as the sufferer he just told him what he had done to get cured - I remember I had a disease for a few months, and when I recovered if I met a man with the same disease I had to <br/>tell him what cured me. I could not keep the prescription all to myself. When He came there and found the sick at their cottage door, the sufferers found more medicine in His words than there was in all the prescriptions of that country. He is a mighty physician who has come to heal every wounded heart in this building and in Chicago tonight.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You needn&#39;t run to any other physician.&nbsp; The great difficulty is that people try to get some other physician - they go to this creed and that creed, to this doctor of Divinity and that one, instead of coming directly to the Master.&nbsp; He has told us that His mission is to heal the broken hearts, and if He has said this, let us take Him at His word and just ask Him to heal. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I was thinking today of the difference between those who know Christ when trouble comes upon them, and those who know Him not.&nbsp; I know several members of families in this city who are just stumbling into their graves over trouble.&nbsp; I know two widows in Chicago who are weeping and moaning over the death of their husbands, and their grief is just taking them to their graves.&nbsp; Instead of bringing their burdens to Christ they mourn day and night, and the result will be that in a few weeks or years at most their sorrow will take them to their graves, when they ought to take it all to the Great Physician. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Three years ago a father took his wife and family on board that ill fated French steamer.&nbsp; They were going to Europe, and when out on the ocean another vessel ran into her and she went down.&nbsp; That mother when I was preaching in Chicago used to bring her two children to the meetings every night.&nbsp; It was one of the most beautiful sights I ever looked on, to see how those little children used to sit and listen, and to see the tears trickling down their cheeks when the Savior was preached.&nbsp; It seemed as if nobody else in that meeting drank in the truth as eagerly as those little ones.&nbsp; One night when an invitation had been extended to all to go into the inquiry room, one of these little children said: &quot;Mamma, why can&#39;t I go in, too?&quot; The mother allowed them to come into the room, and some friend spoke to them, and to all appearances they seemed to understand the plan of Salvation as well as their elders.&nbsp; When that memorable night came, that mother went down and came up without her two children. Upon reading the news I said: &quot;It will kill her,&quot; and I quitted my post in Edinburgh - the only time I left my post on the other side - and went down to Liverpool to try and comfort her.&nbsp; But when I got there, I found that the Son of God had been there before me, and instead of me comforting her she comforted me.&nbsp; She told me she could not think of those children as being in the sea; it seemed as if Christ had permitted her to take those children on that vessel only that they might be wafted to Him, and had saved her life only that she might come back and work a little longer for Him.&nbsp; When she got up the other day at a mothers&#39; meeting in Farwell Hall, and told her story, I thought I would tell the mothers of it the first chance I got.&nbsp; So if any of you have some great affliction, if any of you have lost a loved and loving father, mother, brother, husband, or wife, come to Christ, because God has sent Him to heal the broken hearted. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some of you, I can imagine, will say, &quot;Ah, I could stand that affliction; I have something harder than that.&quot; I remember a mother coming to me and saying, &quot;It is easy enough for you to speak in that way; if you had the burden that I&#39;ve got, you couldn&#39;t cast it on the Lord.&quot; &quot;Why, is your burden so great that Christ can&#39;t carry it?&quot; I asked.&nbsp; &quot;No, it isn&#39;t too great for Him to carry; but I can&#39;t put it on Him.&quot; &quot;That is your fault,&quot; I replied; and I find a great many people with burdens who, rather than just come to Him with them, strap them tighter on their backs and go away staggering under their load. I asked her the nature of her trouble, and she told me, &quot;I have an only boy who is a wanderer on the face of the earth.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know where he is.&nbsp; If I only knew where he was I would go round the world to find him.&nbsp; You don&#39;t know how I love that boy.&nbsp; This sorrow is killing me.&quot; &quot;Why can&#39;t you take him to Christ?&nbsp; You can reach Him at the Throne, even though He be at the uttermost part of the world.&nbsp; Go tell God all about your trouble, and He will take away this, and not only that, but if you never see him on earth, God can give you faith that you will see your boy in Heaven.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">And then I told her of a mother who lived down in the southern part of Indiana.&nbsp; Some years ago her boy came up to this city.&nbsp; He was a moralist.&nbsp; My friends, a man has to have more than morality to lean upon in this great city.&nbsp; He hadn&#39;t been here long before he was led astray.&nbsp; A neighbor happened to come up here and found him one night in the streets drunk.&nbsp; When that neighbor went home at first he thought he wouldn&#39;t say anything about it to the boy&#39;s father, but afterwards he thought it was his duty to tell.&nbsp; So in a crowd in the street of their little town, he just took that father aside, and told him what he had seen in Chicago.&nbsp; It was a terrible blow.&nbsp; When the children had been put to bed that night he said to his wife: &quot;Wife, I have bad news.&nbsp; I have heard from Chicago today.&quot; The mother dropped her work in an instant, and said: &quot;Tell me what it is.&quot; &quot;Well, our son has been seen on the streets of Chicago drunk.&quot; Neither of them slept that night, but they took their burden to Christ.&nbsp; About daylight the mother said: &quot;I don&#39;t know how, I don&#39;t know when or where, but God has given me faith to believe that our son will be saved and will never come to a drunkard&#39;s grave.&quot; One week after, that boy left Chicago.&nbsp; He couldn&#39;t tell why - an unseen power seemed to lead him to his mother&#39;s home, and the first thing he said on coming over the threshold was, &quot;Mother, I have come home to ask you to pray for me&quot;; and soon after he came back to Chicago a bright and a shining light.&nbsp; If you have got a burden like this, fathers, mothers, bring it to Him and cast it on Him and He, the Great Physician, will heal your broken hearts. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can imagine again some of you saying, &quot;How am I to do it?&quot; My friends, go to Him as a personal friend.&nbsp; He is not a myth.&nbsp; What we want to do is to treat Christ as we treat an earthly friend.&nbsp; If you have sins, just go and tell Him all about them; if you have some great burden, &quot;Go bury thy sorrow,&quot; bury it in His bosom. If you go to people and tell them of your cares, your sorrows, they will tell you they haven&#39;t time to listen. But He will not only hear your story, however long it be, but will bind your broken heart up.&nbsp; Oh, if there is a broken heart here tonight, bring it to Jesus, and I tell you upon authority, He will heal you.&nbsp; He has said He will bind your wounds up - not only that, He will heal them. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">During the war I remember of a young man, not 20, who was court-martialed down in the front and sentenced to be shot.&nbsp; The story was this: The young fellow had enlisted.&nbsp; He was not obliged to, but he went off with another young man.&nbsp; They were what we would call &quot;chums.&quot; One night this companion was ordered out on picket duty and he asked the young man to go for him.&nbsp; The next night he was ordered out himself, and having been awake two nights, and not being used to it, fell asleep at his post, and for the offense he was tried and sentenced to death.&nbsp; It was right after the order issued by the President that no interference should be allowed in cases of this kind.&nbsp; This sort of thing had become too frequent, and it must be stopped. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When the news reached the father and mother in Vermont, it nearly broke their hearts.&nbsp; The thought that their son should be shot was too great for them.&nbsp; They had no hope that he would be saved by anything they could do.&nbsp; But they had a little daughter who had read the life of Abraham Lincoln and knew how he loved his own children, and she said: &quot;If Abraham Lincoln knew how my father and mother loved my brother be wouldn&#39;t let him be shot,&quot; That little girl thought this over and made up her mind to go and see the President.&nbsp; She went to the White House, and the sentinel, when he saw her imploring looks, passed her in, and when she came to the door and told the private secretary that she wanted to see the President he could not refuse her. She came into the chamber and found Abraham Lincoln surrounded by his generals and counselors, and when he saw the little country girl he asked her what she wanted.&nbsp; The little maid told her plain simple story - how her brother, whom her mother and father loved very dearly, had been sentenced to be shot. How they were mourning for him, and if he was to die in that way it would break their hearts.&nbsp; The President&#39;s heart was touched with compassion, and he immediately sent a dispatch canceling the sentence and giving the boy a parole so that he could come home and see that father and mother.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I just tell you this to show you how Abraham Lincoln&#39;s heart was moved by compassion for the sorrow of that father and mother, and if he showed so much, do you think the Son of God will not have compassion upon you sinner, if you only take that crushed, bruised heart to Him?&nbsp; He will read it.&nbsp; Have you got a drunken husband?&nbsp; Go tell him. He can make him a blessing to the Church and to the world.&nbsp; Have you a profligate son?&nbsp; Go take your story to him, and he will comfort you, and bind up and heal your sorrow.&nbsp; What a blessing it is to have such a Savior.&nbsp; He has been sent to heal the broken hearted.&nbsp; May the text, if the sermon doesn&#39;t, reach everyone here tonight, and may every crushed, broken, and bruised heart be brought to that Savior, and they will hear His comforting words.&nbsp; He will comfort you as a mother comforts her child if you will only come in prayer and lay all your burdens before Him. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">What Must I Do To Be Saved? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose you do not want to hear a sermon (on this last night) so much as you want to know how to be saved. I want, if I can, to answer that question, &quot;What must I do to be saved?&quot; There is no question that can come before us in this world that is so important; and I think that there is not a man in this audience to-night who does not feel interested in it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I heard a man, when he was going out the other night, saying: &quot;I do not believe in sudden conversion. I do not believe what the preacher said to-night, that a man could come in here a sinner, and go out a Christian.&quot; Now, I want to say that I do not believe in any other conversion. I do not believe that there ever has been a conversion in the world that was not instantaneous, and I want you to mark this: not but what many cannot tell the day nor the hour when they were converted. I will admit that: they may not know the time; but that does not change the great fact that there was a time when they passed from death unto life; that there was a time when they were born [ABCOG: begotten] into the kingdom of God. There must have been a minute when their name was written in the Book of Life. There must have been a time when they were ere lost, and a time when they were saved; but we may not be conscious when the change takes place. I believe the conversion of some is like the rising of the sun, and of others like the flashing of a meteor. But both are instantaneous, really, in the sight of God. There must be a time when life begins to rise; when the dead soul begins to live.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, this evening I want to take up some of the Bible illustrations. In the first place, there is the ark. There was a minute when Noah was outside of the ark, and another minute when he was inside. And, bear in mind, it was the ark that saved Noah: it was not his righteousness; it was not his feelings; it was not his tears; it was not his prayers. It was the ark that saved him. If he had tried to make an ark of his feelings, or of his prayers, or of his life, he would have been swept away: he would have been drowned with the rest. But, you see, it was the ark that saved him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When I was in Manchester, I went into the gallery one Sunday night to have a talk with a few inquirers; and while I was talking, a business man came in, and took his seat on the outskirts of the audience. I think, at first, he had come merely to criticize, and that he was a little skeptical. At last I saw he was in tears. I turned to him, and said, &quot; My friend, what is your difficulty?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;Mr. Moody, the fact is, I cannot tell.&quot; I said, &quot;Do you believe you are a sinner?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes; I know that.&quot; I said, &quot;Christ is able to save you&quot;; and I used one illustration after another, but he did not see it. At last I thought of the ark, and I said: &quot;Was it Noah&#39;s feelings that saved him? Was it Noah&#39;s righteousness that saved him, or was it the ark?&quot; &quot;I see it, now,&quot; said he; &quot;I see it.&quot; He got up and shook hands with me, and said: &quot;Good-night: I must go. I have to go away by the train to-night; but I was determined to be saved before I went. I see it now.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A few days after, he came and touched me on the shoulder, and said, &quot;Do you know me? &quot; I said, &quot;I know your face, but do not remember where I have seen you.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you not remember the illustration of the ark? I said, &quot; Yes.&quot; &quot;It has been all light ever since,&quot; said he. &quot;I understand it now. Christ is the Ark; He saves me; and I must get inside Him.&quot; When I went down to Manchester again, and talked to the young friends there, I found he was the brightest light among them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let me take another illustration. There was the blood in Goshen. God says, &quot;When I see the blood I will pass over you.&quot; Now He does not say, &quot;When I see Moses&#39; feelings, or the feelings of the people, I will pass over you&quot;; or, &quot;When I see you praying and weeping, I will pass over you&quot;; but, &quot;When I see the blood I will pass over you.&quot; It was the blood that saved them, not their righteousness. And a little child by that blood in Goshen was just as safe as Moses or Aaron or Joshua or Caleb. It was the blood that saved them. Look! there is the Jew taking the hyssop. He dips it in the blood, and strikes it on the doorpost. One minute it is not there: the next it is there. The moment the blood is there they are saved. God says, &quot;When I see the blood I will pass over you.&quot; Some people say, &quot;If I were only as good as that minister I should feel so safe&quot; or, &quot;If I were only as good as that mother in Israel who has been praying fifty years for the poor and unfortunate, should I not feel very safe? &quot; My friends, if you are behind the blood, you are as safe as any man or woman who has been praying for fifty years. It is not their righteousness and good works that are going to save them. They never saved any one. God says, &quot;When I see the blood I will pass over you.&quot; [ABCOG: Moody understands &quot;pass over&quot; to mean &quot;bypass&quot;. It can also mean &quot;hover over to protect&quot;] And when I am sheltered behind the blood, then I am saved; and if I am not sheltered behind the blood, I am not saved. That was instantaneous, was not it? God says, &quot;When I see the blood, it shall be a token, and I will not enter.&quot; Death came down and passed over Egypt; and where the blood was on the doorpost he passed by; but where the blood could not be found, in he went and took the victim away. The great palaces could not keep out death; wealth and position could not keep out death. He went and took the Crown Prince of Egypt; he took the richest and the poorest, the highest and the lowest. Death makes no distinction, except a man is behind the blood.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">My friends, be wise to-night, and get behind the blood. The blood has been shed. The blood is on the mercy-seat; and while it is there you can be saved. God is imputing to His Son your trespasses and sins. He says, &quot;I will look at the blood on the mercy-seat.&quot; Press in, my friends; make haste and get in tonight; for the Master of the house will rise up by-and-by and shut to the door, and then there will be no hope.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Take another case. When Israel went over Jordan, God told Joshua to have six cities of refuge; three on each side of Jordan. They were to be built on a hill, where they could be seen at a great distance, and the gates were to be kept open day and night. All obstacles were to be kept out of the way, the highway was to be kept in repair, the bridges and everything in good condition, so that nothing should hinder a poor man flying to the city of refuge. If a man killed another in those days, it was considered a great disgrace if the nearest relative did not take vengeance. &quot;An eye for an eye, and a booth for a tooth.&quot; If a man killed another, the next kinsman was bound to put him to death. But if he could escape to a city of refuge he was tried, and if it was found he had not intentionally killed the man, he might live.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now for my illustration. Suppose I have killed a man. I am out away in the woods working, and my axe slips out of my hand, and kills the man working with me. I know that his kinsman, his brother, is not far away. The news will soon reach him that I have killed his brother. What shall I do? I start for the city of refuge, over there away on the hill, ten miles off. I run - and we are told that in those days there used to be signposts with the word &quot; Refuge,&quot; written in great red letters, so that a man might read as he ran; he need not stop. I have been told that there was a finger pointing towards the city, and a man who could not read might see the hand. A man does not have to learn to read before he can be saved. I see that hand; it is pointing to the city of refuge. The gate is wide open, but it is ten miles away. I leap over the highway. I do not look behind, to the right hand or to the left. I do not listen to this man or to that man, but, like John Bunyan, I put my fingers in my ears. The avenger has drawn his sword, and is on my track. I leap over into the highway; and, pretty soon, I can hear him behind me, Away I go, over that bridge, across that stream, up that mountain, along that valley, - but I can hear him coming nearer and nearer. There is the watchman; I can see him on the wall of the city. He gives notice to the inhabitants that a refugee is coming. I see the citizens on the wall of the city watching, and when I get near I hear them calling, &quot;Run, run! Escape, escape! He is very near you! Run! escape!&quot; I press on; leap through the gate of the city; and at last I am safe. One minute I am outside, and the next I am inside. One minute I am exposed to that sword; it may come down upon me at any minute: the next minute I am safe. Do I feel any difference? I feel I am behind the walls: that is the difference. It is a fact. There I am. The avenger can come up to the gates of the city, but he cannot come in. He cannot lay his sword upon me. The law of the land shields me now. I am under the protection of that city; I have saved my life; but I had no time for lingering.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A great many of you are trying to get into the city of refuge, and there are enemies trying to stop you, But do not listen to them. Your friends tell you to escape. Make haste! Delay not for a single moment!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In our country, before the war, when we had slavery, the slaves used to keep their eye on the north star. If a slave escaped to the Northern States, his old master could come and take him back into slavery. But there was another flag on American soil, and if they could only get under that flag they were for ever free. It is called the Union Jack. If they could only get as far north as Canada they were free; therefore they kept looking towards the north star. But they knew if they only got into the Northern States, there might be some one ready to take them back. So it is with every poor sinner who wants to come to Christ. Many men do all they can to hinder him; others will cheer him on. Let us help every man towards the north star. A man has escaped: perhaps he swims across the Mississippi river, or crosses the Ohio river in a little canoe. The master hears of it, and he takes his hounds and sets them on his track, and begins to hunt him down. The slave hears the hounds; and he knows that his master is coming to take him back to slavery. The line is a mile or two away. He escapes as fast as he can. He runs with all his might for the frontier, over hedges and ditches and rivers; away he goes for Canada. By-and-by he comes in sight of Canada. He can see that flag floating in front of him; and he knows that if he can only cross the line before his master and the hounds overtake him, he will be free for ever.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">How the poor black man runs! leaping and bounding along; and at last, with one bound, he goes over the line. He is free! One minute he is a slave; the next minute he is a free man, under the flag of Queen Victoria, the British flag! (cheers [ABCOG: by British crowd]) - don&#39;t cheer, my friends, but come to Christ - and your laws say that no man under that flag shall be a slave. One minute he is a slave; the next minute he is a free man. One minute it is possible for his old master to drag him back; the next minute he shouts, &quot;Free!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If Christ tells us that we are free, we are free. My friends, Christ is calling to-night. Get out of the devil&#39;s territory as quick as you can. No slave in the Southern States had so hard a master as yours, nor so mean a master as Satan. Take my advice tonight, and escape for the liberty of your soul.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can imagine some of you saying &quot;I do not see how a man is really going to be converted all at once.&quot; Let me give you another illustration. Look down there. There are two soldiers. Now, if you bring those soldiers up to this platform, and ask them how they became soldiers, they will tell you this - that one moment they were citizens, and the next minute soldiers. What was it that made them soldiers? It was when they took the Queen&#39;s shilling. The moment they received that shilling they ceased to be citizens, and they became soldiers. Before they received that shilling they could go where they pleased; the next minute they came under the government and under the regulations of the army, and they must go where Queen Victoria sends them. They did not have to wait for the uniform. The minute they received the shilling they became soldiers. What made them soldiers? Receiving the shilling. What makes a man a Christian? Receiving Christ. &quot;He came unto His own, and His own received Him not: but as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, the gift of God is eternal life. Who will have the gift to-night? When I was down in Manchester I asked that question, and a man shouted in the meeting, &quot;I will! &quot; Who will have it now? Is not there some man here in London, as there was in Manchester, who will say that he will have the gift? Is it not a wonder to have to plead with so many to take the gift? &quot;The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life.&quot; Who will have the gift now? (Many responses of &quot;I will&quot;; &quot;I will.&quot;)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can imagine one man down there who says &quot;How about repentance? How about getting into the ark or the city of refuge before repentance?&quot; My friend, let me ask you what is repentance? It is right-about-face! I think these soldiers understand that expression. Some one has said that every one is born with his back to God, and that conversion turns him right round. If you want to be converted, and want to repent, I will tell you what you should do. Just get out of Satan&#39;s service, and get into the Lord&#39;s. Leave your old friends, and unite yourself with God&#39;s people.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In a few days, if nothing happens, I expect to go to Liverpool. If, when I am in the train, my friend Mr. Shipton says, &quot;Moody, you are going in the wrong train, - that train is going to Edinburgh&quot; - I should say, &quot;Mr. Shipton, you have made a great mistake; somebody told me the train was going to Liverpool. You are wrong, Mr. Shipton; I am sure you are wrong.&quot; Then Mr. Shipton would say, &quot;Moody, I have lived here forty years, and I know all about the trains. He must have been very ignorant or very vicious who told you that train goes to Liverpool.&quot; Mr. Shipton at last convinces me, and I get out of that train and get into the one going to Liverpool. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Repentance is getting out of one train and getting into the other. You are in the wrong train; you are in the broad path that takes you down to the pit of hell. Get out of it to-night. Right-about-face! Who will turn his feet towards God? &quot;Turn ye, for why will ye die?&quot; In the Old Testament the word is &quot;turn.&quot; In the New Testament the word is &quot;repent.&quot; &quot;Turn ye, for why will ye die, O house of Israel?&quot; God does not want any man in this audience to perish, but He wants all to be saved. You can be saved now if you will.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is another illustration I wish I had time to dwell upon and that is about looking. There is that serpent in the wilderness. &quot;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man also be lifted up, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; Look here! Just give me your attention for a few minutes. &quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; How long does it take a man to believe? Or, if you will, how long does it take a man to look? Some people say they believe in educating people to be Christians. How long do you educate children to look? You hear the mother say, &quot;Look,&quot; and the little child looks. It does not take a child three months to learn to look. Look and live! You need not go to college to learn how to look. There is not a child here but knows how to look. Christ says, &quot;Look unto me; for I am [ABCOG: the way to] God, and there is none else.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is the brazen serpent on the pole.

It is God who cures it, and the looking is the condition. It is obedience; and that is what God will have.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">One moment the poor sufferer is dying; the next there comes a thrill of life through his veins, and he lives: he is well.

As He walks through the garden in the cool of the day, you can hear Him calling &ldquo;Adam! Adam! Where art thou?&rdquo; It was the voice of grace, of mercy, and of love. Adam ought to have taken the seeker&rsquo;s place, for he was the transgressor. He had fallen, and he ought to have gone up and down Eden crying, &ldquo;My God! my God! where art Thou?&rdquo; But God left heaven to seek through the dark world for the rebel who had fallen &mdash; not to hurl him from the face of the earth, but to plan him an escape from the misery of his sin. And he finds him &mdash; where? Hiding from his Creator among the bushes of the garden. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The moment a man is out of communion with God, even the professed child of God, he wants to hide away from Him. When God left Adam in the garden, he was in communion with his Creator, and God talked with him; but now that he has fallen, he has no desire to see his Creator, he has lost communion with his God. He cannot bear to see Him, even to think of Him, and he runs to hide from God. But to his hiding place his Maker follows him. &ldquo;Where art thou, Adam? Where art thou?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Six thousand years have passed away, and this text has come rolling down the ages. I doubt whether there has been anyone of Adam&rsquo;s sons who has not heard it at some period or other of his life &mdash; sometimes in the midnight hour stealing over him &mdash; &ldquo;Where am I? Who am I? Where am I going? and what is going to be the end of this?&rdquo; I think it is well for a man to pause and ask himself that question. I would have you ask it, little boy; and you, little girl; and you, old man with locks turning gray, and eyes growing dim, and natural force abating, you who will soon be in another world. I do not ask you where you are in the sight of your neighbors; I do not ask you where you are in the sight of your friends; I do not ask you where you are in the sight of the community in which you live. It is of very little account where we are in the sight of one another, it is of very little account what men think of us; but it is of vast importance what God thinks of us &mdash; it is of vast importance to know where men are in the sight of God; and that is the question now. Am I in communion with my Creator, or out of communion? If I am out of communion, there is no peace, no joy, no happiness. No man on the face of the earth, who was out of communion with his Creator, ever knew what peace, and joy, and happiness, and true comfort are. He is a foreigner to it. But when we are in communion with God, there is light all around our path. So ask yourselves this question. Do not think I am preaching to your neighbors, but remember I am trying to speak to you, to everyone of you as if you were alone. It was the first question put to man after his fall, and it was a very small audience that God had &mdash; Adam and his wife. But God was the preacher; and although they tned to hide, the words came home to them. Let them come home to you now. You may think that your life is hid, that God does not know anything about you. But he knows our lives a great deal better than we do; and His eye has been bent upon us from our earliest childhood until now. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&ldquo;Where art thou?&rdquo; I should like to divide my audience into three classes &mdash; the professed Christians, the Backsliders, and the Ungodly. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">First, I would like to ask the professors this question, or rather let God ask it &mdash; Where art thou? What is my position in the church, and among my circle of acquaintance? Do my friends know me to be, out and out, on the Lord&rsquo;s side? You may have been a professing Christian for twenty years, perhaps thirty, perhaps forty years. Well, where are you tonight? Are you making progress towards heaven? And can you give a reason for the hope that is within you? Suppose I were to ask those who were really Christians here to rise, would you be ashamed to stand up? Suppose I should ask every professed child of God here, &ldquo;If you should be cut down by the hand of death, have you good reason to believe you would be saved?&rdquo; Would you be willing to stand up before God and man, and say that you have good reason to believe you are passed from death unto life? Or would you be ashamed? Run your mind back over the past years: would it be consistent for you to say, &ldquo;I am a Christian;&rdquo; and would your life correspond with your profession? It is not what we say so much as how we live. Actions speak louder than words. Do your shopmates know that you are a Christian? Do your family know? Do they know you to be out and out on the Lord&rsquo;s side? Let every professed Christian ask, Where am I in the sight of God? Is my heart loyal to the King of heaven? Is my life here as it should be in the community I live in? Am I a light in this dark world? Christ says, &ldquo;Ye are My witnesses.&rdquo; Christ was the Light of the world, and the world would not have the true Light; the world rose up and put out the Light, and now Christ says, &ldquo;I leave you down here to testify of Me; I leave you down here as My witnesses.&rdquo; That is what the apostle meant when he said that Christians are to be living epistles, known and read of all men. Then, am I standing up for Jesus as I should in this dark world? If a man is for God, let him say so. If a man is for God, let him come out and be on God&rsquo;s side; and if he is for the world, let him be in the world. This serving God and the world at the same time &mdash; this being on both sides at the same time &mdash; is just the curse of Christianity at the present time. It retards the progress of Christianity more than any other thing. &ldquo;If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I have heard of a great many people who think if they are united to the church, and have made one profession, that will do for all the rest of their days. But there is a cross for everyone of us daily. Oh, child of God, where are you? If God should appear to you tonight in your bedroom and put the question, what would be your answer? Could you say, &ldquo;Lord, I am serving Thee with my whole heart and strength; I am improving my talents and preparing for the kingdom to come?&rdquo; When I was in England in 1867, there was a merchant who came over from Dublin, and was talking with a business man in London; and as I happened to look in, he introduced me to the man from Dublin. Alluding to me, the latter said to the former, &ldquo;Is this young man all O O?&rdquo; Said the London man, &ldquo;What do you mean by O O?&rdquo; Replied the Dublin man, &ldquo;Is he Out-and-Out for Christ?&rdquo; I tell you it burned down into my soul. It means a good deal to be O O for Christ; but that is what all Christians ought to be, and their influence would be felt on the world very soon, if men who are on the Lord&rsquo;s side would come out and take their stand, and lift up their voices in season and out of season. As I have said, there are a great many in the church who make one profession, and that is about all you hear of them; and when they come to die you have to go and hunt up some musty old church records to know whether they were Christians or not. God won&rsquo;t do that. I have an idea that when Daniel died, all the men in Babylon knew whom he served. There was no need for them to hunt up old books. His life told his story. What we want is men with a little courage to stand up for Christ. When Christianity wakes up, and every child that belongs to the Lord is willing to speak for Him, is willing to work for Him, and, if need be, willing to die for Him, then Christianity will advance, and we shall see the work of the Lord prosper. There is one thing which I fear more than anything else, and that is the dead cold formalism of the Church of God. Talk about the isms! Put them all together, and I do not fear them so much as dead, cold formalism. Talk about the false isms! There is none so dangerous as this dead, cold formalism, which has come right into the heart of the Church. There are so many of us just sleeping and slumbering while souls all around are perishing. I believe honestly that we professed Christians are all half asleep. Some of us are beginning to rub our eyes and to get them half-opened, but as a whole we are asleep. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There was a little story going the round of the American press that made a great impression upon me as a father. A father took his little child out into the field one Sabbath, and, it being a hot day, he lay down under a beautiful shady tree. The little child ran about gathering wild flowers and little blades of grass, and coming to its father and saying, &ldquo;Pretty! pretty!&rdquo; At last the father fell asleep, and while he was sleeping the little child wandered away. When he awoke, his first thought was, &ldquo;Where is my child?&rdquo; He looked all around, but he could not see him. He shouted at the top of his voice, but all he heard was the echo of his own voice. Running to a little hill, he looked around and shouted again. No response! Then going to a precipice at some distance, he looked down, and there upon the rocks and briars, he saw the mangled form of his loved child. He rushed to the spot, took up the lifeless corpse and hugged it to his bosom, and accused himself of being the murderer of his child. While he was sleeping his child had wandered over the precipice. I thought as I heard that, what a picture of the church of God! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">How many fathers and mothers, how many Christian men, are sleeping now while their children wander over the terrible precipice right into the bottomless pit of hell. Father, where is your boy tonight? It may be just out there in some public house; it may be reeling through the streets; it may be pressing onwards to a drunkard&rsquo;s grave. Mother, where is your son? Is he in the house of the publican drinking away his soul &mdash; everything that is dear and sacred to him? Do you know where your boy is? Father, you have been a professed Christian for forty years; where are your children tonight? Have you lived so godly, and so Christ-like, that you can say, Follow me as I followed Christ? Are those children walking in wisdom; are they on their way to glory; have they been gathered into the fold of Christ; are their names written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life? How many fathers and mothers today would be able to answer? Did you ever stop to think that you were to blame; that you had not been faithful to your children? Depend upon it, as long as the church is living so much like the world, we cannot expect our children to be brought into the fold. Come, O Lord, and wake up every mother, and may everyone of us who are parents feel the worth of the souls of the children that God has given us. May they never bring our gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, but may they become a blessing to the church and to the world. Not long ago the only daughter of a wealthy friend of mine sickened and died. The father and mother stood by her dying bed. He had spent all his time in accumulating wealth for her; she had been introduced into gay and fashionable society; but she had been taught nothing of Christ. As she came to the brink of the river of death, she said, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you help me; it is very dark, and the stream is bitter cold.&rdquo; They wrung their hands in grief, but could do nothing for her; and the poor girl died in darkness and despair. What was their wealth to them? And yet, you mothers and fathers are doing the same thing in London today, by ignoring the work God has given you to do. I beseech you, then, each one of you, begin to labor now for the souls of your children! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A young man, some time ago, lay dying, and his mother thought he was a Christian. One day, passing his room door she heard him say, &ldquo;Lost! lost! lost!&rdquo; The mother ran into the room and cried, &ldquo;My boy, is it possible you have lost your hope in Christ, now you are dying?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, mother, it is not that; I have a hope beyond the grave, but I have lost my life. I have lived twenty-four years, and done nothing for the Son of God, and now I am dying. My life has been spent for myself; I have lived for this world, and now, while I am dying, I have given myself to Christ; but my life is lost.&rdquo; Would it not be said of many of us, if we should be cut down, that our lives have been almost a failure &mdash; perhaps entirely a failure as far as leading anyone else to Christ is concerned? Young lady! are you working for the Son of God? Are you trying to win some soul to Christ? Have you tried to get some friend or companion to have her name written in the book of life? Or would you say, &ldquo;Lost, lost! long years have rolled away since I became a child of God, and I have never had the privilege of leading one soul to Christ?&rdquo; If there is one professed child of God who never had the joy of leading even one soul into the kingdom of God, oh! let him begin at once. There is no greater privilege on earth. And I believe, my friends, there has never been a time, in our day, at least, when work for Christ was more needed than at present. I do not believe there ever was in your day or mine a time when the Spirit of God was more poured out upon the world. There is not a part of Christendom where the work is not being carried on; and it looks very much as if the glad tidings were just going to take, as it were, a fresh start, and go round the globe. Is it not time that the Church of God should wake up and come to the help of the Lord as one man, and strive to beat back those dark waves of death that roll through our streets, bearing upon their bosom the noblest and the best we have? Oh, may God wake up the Church! And let us trim our lights, and go forth and work for the kingdom of His Son. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, Secondly, let me talk a little while to those who have gone back into the world &mdash; to the Backslider. It may be you came to some great city a few years ago a professed Christian. You were member of a church once, and a teacher in the Sabbath school, perhaps; but when you came among strangers you thought you would just wait a little &mdash; perhaps take a class by and by. So you gave up teaching in the Sunday school; you gave up all work for Christ. Then in your new church you did not receive the attention or the warm welcome that you expected. and you got into the habit of staying away. You have gone so far now, that you are found in the theater, perhaps, and the companion of blasphemers and drunkards. Perhaps I am speaking now to someone who has been away from his father&rsquo;s house for many years. Come, now, backslider, tell me, are you happy? Have you had one happy hour since you left Christ? Does the world satisfy you, or those husks that you have got in the far country? I have traveled a good deal, but I never found a happy backslider in my life. I never knew a man who was really born of God that ever could find the world satisfy him afterwards. Do you think the Prodigal Son was satisfied in that foreign country? Ask the prodigals in this city if they are truly happy. You know they are not. &ldquo;There is no peace, saith my God to the wicked.&rdquo; There is no joy for the man in rebellion against his Creator. Supposing he has tasted the heavenly gift, and been in communion with God, and had sweet fellowship with the King of Heaven, and had pleasant hours of service for the Master, but has backslidden, is it possible that he can be happy? If he is, it is good evidence he was never really converted. If a man has been born again, and has received the heavenly nature, this world can never satisfy the cravings of his nature. Oh, backslider, I pity you! But I want to tell you that the Lord Jesus pities you a good deal more than anyone else can. He knows how bitter your life is; He knows how dark your life is; He wants you to come home. Oh, backslider, come home tonight! I have a loving message from your Father. The Lord wants you, and calls you back tonight Come home, oh wanderer, this night; return from the dark mountains of sin.&rdquo; Return, and your Father will give you a warm welcome. I know that the devil has told you that God won&rsquo;t have anything to do with you, because you have wandered away. If that is true, there would be very few men in heaven. David backslid; Abraham and Jacob turned away from God; I do not believe there is a saint in heaven but at some time of his life with his heart has backslidden from God. Perhaps not in his life, but in his heart. The prodigal&rsquo;s heart got into the far country before his body got there. Backslider! tonight come home. Your Father does not want you to stay away. Think you the prodigal&rsquo;s father was not anxious for him to come home all those long years he was there? Every year the father was looking and longing for him to return home. So God wants you to come home. I do not care how far you have wandered away; the great Shepherd will receive you back into the fold tonight. Did you ever hear of a backslider coming home, and God not willing to receive him? I have heard of earthly fathers and mothers not being willing to receive back their sons; but I defy any man to say he ever knew a really honest backslider want to get home, but God was willing to take him in. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A number of years ago, before any railway came into Chicago, they used to bring in the grain from the Western prairies in wagons for hundreds of miles, so as to have it shipped off by the Lakes. There was a father who had a large farm out there, and who used to preach the gospel as well as attend to his farm. One day, when church business engaged him, he sent his son to Chicago with grain. He waited and waited for his boy to return, but he did not come home. At last he could wait no longer, so he saddled his horse and rode to the place where his son had sold the grain. He found that he had been there and got the money for the grain; then he began to fear that his boy had been murdered and robbed. At last, with the aid of a detective, they tracked him to a gambling den, where they found that he had gambled away the whole of his money. In hopes of winning it back again, he then had sold the team, and lost that money too. He had fallen among thieves, and like the man who was going to Jericho, they stripped him, and then they cared no more about him. What could he do? He was ashamed to go home to meet his father, and he fled. The father knew what it all meant. He knew the boy thought he would be very angry with him. He was grieved to think that his boy should have such feelings towards him. That is just exactly like the sinner. He thinks because he has sinned, God will have nothing to do with him. But what did that father do? Did he say, &ldquo;Let the boy go?&rdquo; No, he went after him. He arranged his business and started after the boy. That man went from town to town, from city to city. He would get the ministers to let him preach, and at the close he would tell his story. &ldquo;I have got a boy who is a wanderer on the face of the earth somewhere.&rdquo; He would describe his boy and say, &ldquo;If you ever hear of him or see him, will you not write to me?&rdquo; At last he found that he had gone to California, thousands of miles away. Did that father say &ldquo;Let him go?&rdquo; No; off he went to the Pacific coast, seeking the boy. He went to San Francisco, and advertised in the newspapers that he would preach at such a church on such a day. When he had preached he told his story, in hopes that the boy might have seen the advertisement and come to the church. When he had done, away under the gallery there was a young man who waited until the audience had gone out; then he came towards the pulpit. The father looked, and saw it was that boy, and he ran to him, and pressed him to his bosom. The boy wanted to confess what he had done, but not a word would the father hear. He forgave him freely, and took him to his home once more. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Oh, prodigal, you may be wandering on the dark mountains of sin, but God wants you to come home. The devil has been telling you lies about God; you think he will not receive you back. I tell you, He will welcome you this minute if you will come. Say, &ldquo;I will arise and go to my Father.&rdquo; May God incline you to take this step. There is not one whom Jesus has not sought far longer than that father. There has not been a day since you left Him but he has followed you. I do not care what the past has been, or how black your life, He will receive you back. Arise then, O backslider, and come home once more to your Father&rsquo;s house. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Not long ago, in Edinburgh, a lady who was an earnest Christian worker, found a young woman whose feet had taken hold of hell, and who was pressing onwards to a harlot&rsquo;s grave. The lady begged her to go back to her home, but she said no, her parents would never receive her. This Christian woman knew what a mother&rsquo;s heart was; so she sat down and wrote a letter to the mother, telling her how she had met her daughter, who was sorry, and wanted to return. The next post brought an answer back, and on the envelope was written, &ldquo;Immediately &mdash; immediately!&rdquo; That was a mother&rsquo;s heart. They opened the letter. Yes, she was forgiven. They wanted her back, and they sent money for her to come immediately. Sinner, that is the proclamation, &ldquo;Come immediately&rdquo;. That is what the great and loving God is saying to every wandering sinner &mdash; immediately. Yes, backslider, come home tonight. He will give you a warm welcome, and there will be joy in heaven over your return. Come now, for everything is ready. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A friend of mine said to me some time ago, Did you ever notice what the prodigal lost by going into that country? He lost his food. That is what every poor backslider loses. They get no manna from heaven. The Bible is a closed book to them; they see no beauty in the Word of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then the prodigal lost his work. He was a Jew, and they made him take care of swine; that was all loss for a Jew. So every backslider loses his work. He cannot do anything for God; he cannot work for eternity. He is a stumbling block to the world. My friend, do not let the world stumble over you into hell. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The prodigal also lost his testimony. Who believed him? I can imagine some of these men came along, natives of that country, and they saw this poor prodigal in his rags, barefooted and bareheaded. There he stands among the swine and someone says to another, &ldquo;Look at that poor wretch.&rdquo; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;do you call me a poor wretch? My father is a wealthy man; he has got more clothes in his wardrobe than you ever saw in your life. My father is a man of great wealth and position.&rdquo; Do you suppose these men would believe him? &ldquo;That poor wretch the son of a wealthy man!&rdquo; Not one of them would believe him. &ldquo;If he had such a wealthy father he would go to him.&rdquo; So with the backsliders; the world does not believe that they are the sons of a King. They say, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they go to Him, if there is bread enough and to spare? Why don&rsquo;t they go home?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then, another thing the prodigal lost was his home. He had no home in that foreign country. As long as his money lasted, he was quite popular in the public house and among his acquaintances; he had professed friends, but as soon as his money was gone, where were his friends? That is the condition of every poor backslider in London. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But now I can imagine someone saying, &ldquo;There would be little use of me attempting to come back. In a few days I should just be where I was again. I should like very much to go to my Father&rsquo;s home again, but I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t stay there.&rdquo; Well, just picture this scene. The poor prodigal has got home, and the father has killed the fatted calf; and there they are, sitting at the table eating. I can imagine that was about the sweetest morsel he ever got &mdash; perhaps the nicest dinner he ever had in his life. His father sits opposite; he is full of joy, and his heart is leaping within him. All at once he sees his boy weeping. &ldquo;My son, what are you weeping for? Are you not glad to have got home?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes, father; I never was so glad as I am today: but I am so afraid I will go back into that foreign country!&rdquo; Why, you cannot imagine such a thing! When you have got one meal in your Father&rsquo;s house, you will never be inclined to wander away again. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now let me speak to the Third class. &ldquo;If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?&rdquo; Sinner, what is to become of you? How shall you escape? &ldquo;Where art thou?&rdquo; Is it true that you are living without God and without hope in the world? Did you ever stop to think what would become of your soul if you should be taken away by a sudden stroke of illness &mdash; where you would stand in eternity? I read that the sinner is without God, without hope, and without excuse. If you are not saved, what excuse will you have to give? You cannot say that it is God&rsquo;s fault. He is only too anxious to save you. I want to tell you tonight that you can be saved if you will. If you really want to pass from death to life, if you want to become an heir of eternal life, if you want to become a child of God, make up your mind this night that you will seek the kingdom of God. I tell you, upon the authority of this Word, that if you seek the kingdom of God you will find it. No man ever sought Christ with a heart to find Him who did not find Him. I never knew a man make up his mind to have the question settled, but it was settled soon. This last year there has been a solemn feeling stealing over me. I am what they call in the middle of life, in the prime of life. I look upon life as a man who has reached the top of a hill, and just begins to go down the other side. I have got to the top of the hill, if I should live the full term of life &mdash; threescore years and ten &mdash; and am just on the other side. I am speaking to many now who are also on the top of the hill, and I ask you, if you are not Christians, just to pause a few minutes, and ask yourselves where you are. Let us look back on the hill that we have been climbing. What do you see? Yonder is the cradle. It is not far away. How short life is! It all seems but as yesterday. Look along up the hill, and yonder is a tombstone; it marks the resting place of a loved mother. When that mother died, did you not promise God that you would serve Him? Did you not say that your mother&rsquo;s God should become your God? And did you not take her hand in the stillness of the dying hour, and say, &ldquo;Yes, mother, I will meet you in heaven!&rdquo; And have you kept that promise? Are you trying to keep it? Ten years have rolled away: fifteen years &mdash; but are you any nearer God? Did the promise work any improvement in you? No, your heart is getting harder: the night is getting darker; by and by death will be throwing its shadows round you. My friend, Where art thou? Look again. A little further up the hill there is another tombstone. It marks the resting place of a little child. It may have been a little lovely girl &mdash; perhaps her name was Mary; or it may have been a boy &mdash; Charley; and when that child was taken from you, did you not promise God, and did you not promise the child, that you would meet it in heaven? Is the promise kept? Think! Are you still fighting against God? Are you still hardening your heart? Sermons that would have moved you five years ago &mdash; do they touch you now? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Once more look down the hill. Yonder there is a grave; you cannot tell how many days, or weeks, or years it is away, you are hastening towards that grave. Even should you live the life allotted to man, many of you are near the end, you are getting very feeble, and your locks are turning gray. It may be the coffin is already made that this body shall be laid in; it may be that the shroud is already waiting. My friend, is it not the height of madness to put off salvation so long? Undoubtedly I am speaking to some who will be in eternity a week from now. In a large audience like this, during the next week death will surely come and snatch some away; it may be the speaker, or it may be someone who is listening. Why put off the question another day? Why say to the Lord Jesus again tonight, &ldquo;Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for Thee?&rdquo; Why not let him come in tonight? Why not open your heart, and say, &ldquo;King of Glory, come in?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Will there ever be a better opportunity? Did not you promise ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty years ago that you would serve God? Some of you said you would do it when you got married and settled down; some of you said you would serve Him when you were your own master. Have you attended to it? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You know there are three steps to the lost world; let me give you their names. The first is Neglect. All a man has to do is to neglect salvation, and that will take him to the lost world. Some people say, &ldquo;What have I done!&rdquo; Why, if you merely neglect salvation, you will be lost. I am on a swift river, and lying in the bottom of my little boat. Down yonder, ten miles below, is the great cataract. Everyone that goes over it perishes. I need not row the boat down; I have only to pull in the oars, and fold my arms and neglect. So all that a man has to do is to fold his arms in the current of life, and he will drift onwards and be lost. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The second step is Refusal. If I met you at the door and pressed this question on you, you would say, &ldquo;Not tonight, Mr. Moody, not tonight;&rdquo; and if I repeated, &ldquo;I want you to press into the kingdom of God,&rdquo; you would politely refuse: &ldquo;I will not become a Christian tonight, thank you; I know I ought, but I won&rsquo;t tonight.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then the last step is to Despise it. Some of you have already got on the lower round of the ladder. You despise Christ. You hate Christ, you hate Christianity; you hate the best people on the earth and the best friends you have got; and if I were to offer you the Bible, you would tear it up and put your foot upon it. Oh, despisers! you will soon be in another world. Make haste and repent and turn to God. Now, on which step are you, my friend; neglecting, or refusing, or despising? Bear in mind that a great many are taken off from the first step; they die in neglect. And a great many are taken away refusing. And a great many are on the last step, despising salvation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">A few years ago they neglected, then they got to refuse; and now they despise Christianity and Christ. They hate the sound of the church bell; they hate the Bible and the Christian; they curse the very ground that we walk on. But one more step and they are gone. Oh ye despisers, I set before you life and death; which will you choose? When Pilate had Christ on his hands, he said, &ldquo;What shall I do with him?&rdquo; and the multitude cried out, &ldquo;Away with Him! crucify Him!&rdquo; Young men, is that your language tonight? Do you say, &ldquo;Away with this gospel! Away with Christianity! Away with your prayers, your sermons, your gospel sounds! I do not want Christ?&rdquo; Or will you be wise and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I want Thee, I need Thee, I will have Thee?&rdquo; Oh, may God bring you to that decision! </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">Christian Love</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">IT speaks in Galatians about love, the fruit of the Spirit being love, joy, peace, gentleness, long suffering, meekness and temperance. The way this writer has put it -- and I think it is very beautiful -- is that joy is love exultant, peace is love in repose, and long suffering is love enduring. It is all love, you see, a gentleness is love in society, and goodness is love in action, and faith is love on the battle-field, and meekness is love at school, and temperance is love in training.<br/><br/>Now there are a great many that have got love and they hold the truth. I should have said they have got truth, but they don&#39;t hold it in love, and they are very unsuccessful in working for God. They are very harsh, and God cannot use them. Now let us hold the truth, but let us hold it in love. People will stand almost any kind of plain talk if you only do it in love. If you do it in harshness it bounds back and they won&#39;t receive it. So what we want is to have the truth and at the same time hold it in love.<br/><br/>Then there is another class of people in the world that have got the truth, but they love so much that they give up the truth because they are afraid it will hurt some one&#39;s feelings. That is wrong. We want the whole truth anyway. We don&#39;t want to give it up, but hold it in love, and I believe one reason why people think God don&#39;t love them is because they have not this love. I met a lady in the inquiry-room today, and I could not convince her that God loved her, for she said that if He did love her He would not treat her as He had. And I believe people are all measuring God with their own rule, as I said the other day, and we are not sincere in our love, and we very often profess something we really don&#39;t possess. Very often we profess to have love for a person when we do not, and we think God is like us.<br/><br/>Now God is just what He says He is, and He wants His children to be sincere in love; not to love just merely in word and in tongue, but to love in earnest. -That is what God does. You ask me why God loves. You might as well ask me why the sun shines. It can&#39;t help shining, and neither can He help loving, because He is love Himself; and any one that says He is not love does not know anything about love. If we have got the true love of God shed abroad in our hearts we will show it in our lives. We will not have to go up and down the earth proclaiming it. We will show it in everything we say or do.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs52DB4310">VERY NICE TO THEIR FACES</span><span class="csAE32C027"> </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is a good deal of what you might call sham love. People profess to love you very much, when you find it is all on the surface. It is not heart love. Very often you are in a person&#39;s house, and the servant comes in and says such a person is in the front room, and she says: &quot;Oh, dear, I am so sorry he has come, I can&#39;t bear the sight of him ;&quot; and she&#39;ll get right up and go into the other room and say, &quot;Why, how do you do? I am very glad to see you! &quot; [Laughter.] There is a good deal of that sort of thing in the world.<br/><br/>I remember, too, I was talking with a man one day and an acquaintance of his came in, and he jumped up at once and shook him by the hand-why I thought he was going to shake his hand out of joint, he shook so hard-and he seemed to be so glad to see him and wanted him to stay, but the man was in a great hurry and could not stay, and he coaxed him and urged him to stay, but the man said no, he would come another time; and after that man went out my companion turned to me and said, &quot;Well, he is an awful bore, and I am glad he&#39;s gone.&quot; Well, I began to feel that I was a bore, too, and I got out as quickly as I could. [Laughter.] That is not real love. That is love with the tongue while the heart is not true. Now, let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth. That is the kind of love God gives us, and He wants the same in return.<br/><br/>Now, there is another side to this truth. A man was talking to me out here the other day that he didn&#39;t believe there was any love at all; that Christians professed to have love, but he didn&#39;t believe men could have two coats, and I think he reflected on me, because I had on my overcoat at the time and he hadn&#39;t got any. I looked at him and said: &quot;Suppose I should give you one of my coats, you would drink it up before sundown. I love you too much to give you my coat and have you drink it up.&quot;<br/><br/>A good many people are complaining now that Christians don&#39;t have the love they ought to have, but I tell you it is no sign of want of love that we don&#39;t love the lazy man. I have no sympathy with those men that are just begging twelve months of the year. It would be a good thing, I believe, to have them die off. They are of no good. I admit there are some that are not real, and sincere, and true, but there are many that would give the last penny they had to help a man who really needed help. But there are a good many sham cases-men that won&#39;t work, and the moment they get a penny they spend it for drink. To such men it is no charity to give. A man that won&#39;t work should be made to work. I believe there is a great deal more hope of a drunkard or a murderer or a gambler than there is of a lazy man.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs52DB4310">TOO LAZY TO STAY CONVERTED</span><span class="csAE32C027"> </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I never heard of a lazy man being converted yet, though I remember talking once with a minister in the backwoods of Iowa about lazy men. He was all discouraged in his efforts&#39; to convert lazy men, and I said to him, &quot;Did you ever know a lazy man to be converted?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said he; &quot;I knew of one, but he was so lazy that he didn&#39;t stay converted but about six weeks.&quot; And that is as near as I ever heard of a lazy man being converted, and if there are any here today saying they don&#39;t love us because we don&#39;t give them any money, I say we love them too well. We don&#39;t give to them because it is ruin.<br/><br/>Some years ago I picked up several children in Chicago and thought I would clothe them and feed them, and I took special interest in those boys to see what I could make of them. I don&#39;t think it was thirty days before the clothes had all gone to whisky and the fathers had drank it all up. One day I met one of the little boys for whom I bought a pair of boots only the day before. There was a snow-storm coining up and he was barefooted. &quot;Mike,&quot; says I, &quot;how&#39;s this? Where are your boots ?&quot; &quot;Father and mother took them away,&quot; said he. There is a good deal that we think is charity that is really doing a great deal of mischief; and the people must not think because we don&#39;t give them money to aid them in their poverty that we don&#39;t love them, for the money would go into their pockets to get whiskey with.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs52DB4310">POVERTY SOMETIMES A BLESSING</span><span class="csAE32C027"> </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">It is no sign that we are all hypocrites and insincere in our love that we don&#39;t give money. I believe if the prodigal son could have got all the money he wanted in that foreign country he would never have come home, and it was a good thing for him that he did get hard up and to live on the husks that the swine ate. And it is a good think that people should suffer. If they get a good living without work, they will never work. We can never make anything of them. God has decreed that man shall earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, and not live on other people.<br/><br/>But I am getting away from the subject. I only wanted to touch upon this subject because a good many are complaining that Christian people don&#39;t help them. I have sometimes fifteen or twenty letters a day, coming from Kansas, and Europe even, asking us to take up a collection. They say: &quot;Here is a poor woman. Just get the people to give a penny apiece.&quot; Suppose we began doing that sort of thing. We should have to have somebody to look up this man or this woman and find if they are worthy. If we took up one collection, we would have to take up five hundred. I never found a person true to Christ but what the Lord would take care of them. I think it is a good thing for people to suffer a little until they come back to God. They will find that God will take care of them that love Him. A great many say, &quot;Oh, I love God.&quot; It is easy enough, to say this, but if you do love God He knows about it, be assured. He knows how much you love Him. You may deceive your neighbors, and think you love God, and assume a good deal of love, when there is really no love in your heart.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now it says in Corinthians 8: &quot;But if any man love God, the same is known of him.&quot; God is looking from heaven down into this world just to find that one man. God knows where he lives, the number of his house, and the name of the street he lives in. In fact, He has the very hairs of your head numbered, and He will take good care of you. He will not let any of His own children come to want, He will not let any of those that come to want suffer, He will provide for their wants if they are only sincere, but He don&#39;t want any sham work, When the Lord was here He was all the time stripping those Pharisees of their miserable selfrighteousness. They professed great love for Him while their hearts were far from God. Let us not profess to love God with our tongue and lips, while our lives are far from it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs52DB4310">DON&#39;T KNOW THEIR OWN MINDS</span><span class="csAE32C027"> </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Another class say, &quot;I don&#39;t know whether I love God or not. I am really anxious to know whether or not I love God.&quot; Now, if you are really anxious it won&#39;t take you long to find out. You cannot love God and the world at the same time, because they abhor each other. They are at enmity, always have been and always will be. It is the world that crucified God&#39;s Son; it was the world that put God&#39;s Son to death. Therefore, if we love the world it is a pretty good evidence that the love of the Father is not in us. We may say our prayers and go through some religious performances, but our hearts are not right with God because we cannot love God and the world at the same time. We have got to get the world under our feet and the love of God must be first in our hearts or else we have not got the love of God.<br/><br/>The command we have is that he who loveth God loveth his brother also. Now, if we have got our heart full of enmity and jealousy and malice toward any of God&#39;s children it is a sure sign that the love of God is not in our hearts. To love a man that loves me that don&#39;t require any goodness; the greatest infidel can do that; but to love a man that reviles me and lies about me and slanders me-that takes the grace of God. I may not associate with him, but I may love him. I may hate the sin, but love the sinner, And that is one of the tests by which to find out whether you have love in your heart. The first impulse of the young convert is to love every one, and to do all the good he can, and that is the sign that a man has been born from above, born of God, and that he has got real love in his heart; and these tests God gives us that we may know.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs52DB4310">CHRISTIAN LOVE OPPOSED TO WORLDLINESS</span><span class="csAE32C027"> </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The question is, do you love the world? Had you rather go to a theatre than to prayer-meeting? Had you rather go to a dance than to commune with the godly? If so it is, then it is a good sign that you have not been converted and not born of God. That is a test. People want to know whether they love God or not; let them turn to that test and they will find out If your heart is set on the world and you had rather not be with God&#39;s people, it is a sure sign that you have not been born of God.<br/><br/>Well, there is another class of people who say, &quot;I don&#39;t see if God really loves me and I love Him, why I am called upon t have so many afflictions and troubles.&quot; Just turn a moment to the 8th chapter of Romans, the 28th verse: &quot;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are called according to His purpose.&quot; It is not a few things; not a part of them, but all work together for good. Give a man constant prosperity and how quickly he turns away from God, and so it is a little trouble here, and a little reverse here, and some prosperity there, and taken all together it is the very thing we need.<br/><br/>If you just take your Bibles you will find that God loves you. There is no one in this wide world, sinner, that loves you as God loves you. You may think your father loves you, or your mother loves you, or a brother or a sister, but let me tell you you can multiply it by ten thousand times ten thousand before it can equal&quot; God&#39;s love. &quot;While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Can you have greater proof of God&#39;s love and Christ&#39;s love? &quot;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&quot; Christ laid down his life for his enemies. Ah, my friends, it will take all eternity for us to find out the height and breadth and length and depth of God&#39;s love.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h4 class="csCCB07714">
			<span class="cs52DB4310">PROTECTED BY THE FLAG</span><span class="csAE32C027"> </span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">How men with an open Bible can say that God don&#39;t love them is more than I can understand. But the devil is deceitful and puts that into their heads. Let me beg you, beg you, go to Calvary and there you may just for a moment catch a glimpse of God&#39;s love. There was a man came from Europe to this country a year or two ago, and he became dissatisfied and went to Cuba in 1867 when they had a great civil war there. Finally he was arrested for a spy, court-martialed, and condemned to be shot. He sent for the American Consul and the English Consul, and went on to prove to them that he was no spy. These two men were thoroughly convinced that the man was no spy, and they went to one of the Spanish officers and said, This man you have condemned to be shot is an innocent man.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; the Spanish officer says, &quot;the man has been legally tried by our laws and condemned, and the law must take its course and the man must die.&quot;<br/><br/>And the next morning the man was led out; the grave was already dug for him, and the black cap was put on him, and the soldiers were there ready to receive the order, &quot;Fire,&quot; and in a few moments the man would be shot and be put in that grave and covered up, when who should rise up but the American Consul, who took the American flag and wrapped it around him, and the English Consul took the English flag and wrapped it around him, and they said to those soldiers, &quot;Fire on those flags if you dare!&quot; Not a man dared; there were two great governments behind those flags. And so God says, &quot;Come under my banner, come under, the banner of love, come under the banner of heaven.&quot; God will take good care of all that come under His banner.<br/><br/>Oh, my friends, come under the banner of heaven today. This banner is a banner of love. May it float over every soul here, is the prayer of my heart. God don&#39;t will the death of any who will come under His banner of love. It is pure love, and sinner, may the love of God bring you into the fold is the prayer of my heart. I read once of a young man who left his father, and at last that father died and the boy came to the funeral, and there was not a tear that flowed over his cheeks during all the funeral. He saw that father laid down into the grave, and he did not shed a tear. When they came to break the will, and the boy heard that the father had dealt kindly with him and had given him some property, he began to shed tears. When that boy heard his father&#39;s will read, his heart was broken, and he came to his father&#39;s God.<br/><br/>0 sinner, if you want to find out God&#39;s love, take this last will and testament of Jesus Christ. He showed his love by going to Calvary; He showed his love by His death agony there. He loves you with an. everlasting love; He don&#39;t want you to perish. O, may you love Him in return.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs7F250666">Prayers By Dwight L.

We read from the very beginning that he was moved with compassion, as this good Samaritan, when he met this poor, wounded and dying man. O God, give us the spirit of the good Samaritan! May we go from this building and hunt up many to-night, and tell them of Christ and heaven. May we go to the homes of the poor drunkards; may we go to the homes and hearts of gamblers, the homes of the fallen, the despised and the outcast, and tell them of Christ and heaven. O Spirit of God! come down upon this assembly, and may the Church of God find out who their neighbors are. And, O God, we pray thee that they may be filled with the Spirit of Christ, and that they may go and tell others the story of the cross. And, O God, we pray thee that hundreds and thousands in this city may be working to win souls to Christ. We pray that great things may be done in Boston the coming Sabbath. And not only on the Sabbath, O God; we will not wait for the Sabbath, but to-night, as thy servants meet in the different churches, O God, do thou meet with them! and we pray thee that there may be a quickening in the churches all over Boston, and all around in its vicinity. Do thou wake them up, that there may be a great work for them to do. Arid we pray that the day may be not far distant when many souls may be brought to Christ, and when this building shall be filled with those who are lost and want to be saved; and that the cry may go out from many anxious hearts. &quot;What shall I do to be saved?&quot; O Spirit of God, come down upon the assembly now, that the hearts of God&#39;s people may be made one; and that they may all be brought to God and all be glorifiers and honorers of Christ! May we be holy ourselves and consecrate to him our best service. Now we pray for a numerous meeting tonight. May these Christian young men be fired with the Holy Spirit from on high. May they be like Joshua, strong in the faith, men of God. May the Christian young men of Boston be known for their piety. And O Lord, we pray thee that drunkards by hundreds and thousands may be saved by the regenerating power of God. May they be touched by the Holy Spirit, and may power be given them to overcome their terrible appetite. We pray that this meeting we had this noon may be the means of saving many, and that thou wilt bless it, as well as those we have in the future. We pray, O God, that many may go out every day and pray for these men, and show them the way of salvation. In the saloons, the billiard saloons, O God, mayest thou pour out thy mercy and make many men tremble for what they were about to do. O God, as we tarry at the second meeting, we pray that the Spirit of God may come upon us, and that this great audience may be hushed by the power of God. May we hear the voice of Jesus to-night! and as we listen may we be ready to go out and do his bidding. For thy name&#39;s sake. Amen.</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Our Heavenly Father, we thank thee for this beautiful Sabbath morning. We thank thee for the privilege we have of meeting with these friends and talking with them about thee and about thy work. Now, O Lord Jesus, give us a love for souls, give us a burning passion for souls. May that be the desire of our hearts; to lead some soul out of darkness to the light, out of bondage to liberty, to lead some poor wanderer out of the darkness of this world to the blessed gospel. Thou hast witnessed this scene, these hundreds who have said that by thy grace they will try to lead one soul to thee. God, make us wise in all our work, and help us to bring some soul to thee. Help us to talk to people and to go right to work; and may we speak with power to these that have risen here and said they want God. May they not leave this house until their names are written in the Lamb&#39;s book of life, until they know that they have passed from death unto life. Make hare thine arm to help us, and may this be a token of a great and mighty harvest in the city of Boston. Quicken every one of those that have risen. God help us to pray for each other and around our family altars; in our closets, may there be one wail of united prayer to God; and may we see wonders and be made successful in winning souls to thee. Bless these teachers, as they go to their classes to-day; speak through them, use them in winning some souls to thee. We pray for thy blessing to rest upon the superintendents; may the grace of God come upon them afresh, and may the mighty power of God rest down upon them. And as they stand before their schools, may they be quickened with the mighty power of God, and thy Spirit speak through them. We pray for the ministers. Be with them; and as they stand up to preach thy blessed truth, may the Spirit of God speak through them and bless their efforts. And as we come together to-morrow, may there be glad tidings coming in from all parts of Boston; and may the work commence right here this morning, and flow over the city.

Help us, O Lord, to walk humbly, prayerfully, consistently on, in the dust of our pilgrimage so that men may not stumble over us and say, &quot;They profess only; they never do anything.&quot; o God, help us to live up to what we profess, through thee, in Christ Jesus, and may it be shown in each one of us. We pray for any that may have backslidden in this assembly, who may have wandered from God. This day fill them with regret that they ever turned their backs on thee. We pray that thou, O Lord, may meet them this day in this Tabernacle, and turn their faces to thee again. O God, they have wandered from thee; but do thou grant that this day they may meet the Lord of eternal life. We pray for those also without God and without hope. We pray for the unsaved in this assembly. O God, let them meet thee here and now. O God! touch their hearts. Open their eyes, that they may see their sin and know how great the sin is that possesses them; for Satan has blinded their eyes, O God, and they have abandoned thee. Make them to know how hard their hearts are. Open their eyes this day. O Lord, may the angels rejoice over souls saved this afternoon. May the wanderers, who have drawn back and rejected thee for years, open the door of their hearts and welcome thee in. We pray that the power coming forth from this meeting may be felt on the shores of eternity. O God of Adam and God of our Fathers, hear our cry and bring salvation; and may many this day receive the gift of God, and come down to this house and testify. We pray that thy blessing may rest on these mothers gathered here to-day. If they have children, who are rushing down to death and ruin, may God hear their cry, and may their children be turned from darkness to light, from Satan to thee. We pray that thy blessing may rest richly on those who have gone to the overflow meeting. May the Spirit of God be poured out on this church and on all thy churches; and may many be drawn to thee and love thee. May the work go on through Boston, we pray thee, and all through New England; and Christ shall have the glory.

O God, keep us from this way, so that we may not be seeking sacred things for ourselves, but that we may bow ourselves in the dust before thee today. Help us to draw near to thee.

We pray that the Holy Spirit may reveal to each one of us all our sins, that we may turn away from them and hate them with a perfect hatred; that thy Spirit may came with power upon our hearts and fill them with holy desires. O God, we pray thee that thy blessing may rest on a11 the churches of New England, upon this day of fasting and prayer. We pray that thy blessing may rest on all the fathers and mothers closeted with thee to-day, as they pour out their hearts in prayer for their children. O God, hear and answer their prayer, and may the joyful tidings of souls redeemed be coming in from all over New England before long. Let the summons of grace be everywhere heard, that the wilderness may blossom and the solitary places be made glad. O God, we pray thee that the churches in New England may be blest, that the mothers, heartbroken on account of their children, may be comforted, and may those who were in darkness see the blessed light of the sun. O God, come in power upon us, and pass through New England, that a cry may be raisedhear ye in Boston-&quot;Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&quot; God, hear our supplications here to-day, and answer our prayers; answer the many prayers that are going up to thee. Come, Holy Spirit, in thy mighty power, and convict our hearts of sin, and melt them and turn them from darkness to light.

Bring back the wanderers. Oh, may the prayers of thy people be answered, and may there be a great harvest of souls here to-night. Go with us now, as we go to the inquiry room. May there be hundreds seeking the kingdom of God. O God of grace, hear our prayer, answer our cry, and save scores and hundreds to-night. (Amen! Amen!) We pray for the young men&#39;s meetings.

May we see hundreds to-night flocking into the kingdom of God. We pray for the young men who are just starting out on the voyage of life. Many of them are ambitious; many of them want to make a name; many of them are seeking wealth and pleasure and position. O God! may they seek thy kingdom to-night. If there is any poor drunkard here, may he give up his cup and seek the Lord. Oh, may there be many who shall turn to Christ and live. Help those fathers arid mothers who have unsaved children to pray now. Help these husbands to pray for unconverted wives, and these wives to pray for unconverted husbands. Heavenly Father, we know we may plant and others may water, but thou must give the increase. We cannot bring one soul into thy kingdom. O Son of God, let thy pitying eye rest on every lost soul here to-night. We pray thee, that they may no longer resist the Holy Ghost. Let this unequal warfare cease to-night. Wilt thou go with us, as we go to yonder church? May it be crowded with earnest seekers. May many cry out, &#39;What shall we do to be saved?&#39; We pray that thy blessing may rest upon the young men&#39;s meeting. May the Holy Spirit be there, leading young men away from the doubts and temptations of this great city to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world. And now, Holy Father, we once more lift up our hearts in prayer for a great blessing on the meeting tomorrow at 12 o&#39;clock. O Son of God, may these poor drunkards hear how they shall be saved. Yea, may they believe to-night on the Lord Jesus and be saved. May they not wait until tomorrow. Oh, may there be a shout in the camp of the King to-morrow. May hundreds of drunkards be reclaimed to-morrow. O Son of God, visit this city of Boston; shake it to its very centre, and turn the hearts of the people back to thyself.

Give us a strong faith in thee and in thy Word. Help us to realize what we have read about thee, that nothing is too hard for thee. We know that thou art able to reach infidels, scoffers, pantheists and atheists; that thou canst reach the abandoned and fallen and lift them &#39;up, and purify them in the precious blood of thy Son. And we pray that thou wilt do great things here in Boston during the coming days; may they be days of thy power. We ask not for the power of man, but for the power of God. May we have the Holy Ghost power in all our meetings. We pray that the Spirit of the living God may be here; and if there are any men or women that have come into this meeting who are thoughtless about their souls, we know that God is in our midst and may they so realize it, that there shall be a cry going up from the camp, from these scoffers and these infidels, asking, What shall I do to be saved? We pray that the fear of God may fall upon Boston, and upon the hearts of the people. We thank thee for what we saw in the inquiry-room last night. We thank thee that thou hast commenced the work in the hearts of the people, and for the cry already coming up of, &quot;What must we do to be saved?&quot; Move right along in thy mighty power; and may the day be not far distant when there shall be a great multitude saved in Boston. And may the waves of salvation go out of this city all over the land; and may all New England be reached. May there not be a town in New England but shall receive a blessing from on high. We pray that on the day specially set apart for fasting and prayer there may be a prayer going up from many a closet and family altar to-morrow that shall reach heaven. May we not limit thy power O God, but expect great and mighty things. If there are fathers and mothers anxious for unsaved children, may they spend to-morrow morning in fasting and prayer; and they in their prayer say, &quot;Search us O God and see if there be any evil way in us. Turn us away from evil things so that thou mayest hear and answer our prayers; for thou hast said that, if we regard and cherish iniquity in our hearts, thou wilt not hear and answer prayer. Help us each and every one to turn away from every sin, that we may lift up clean hands to thee, and our hearts be pure in thy sight, so that thou wilt answer our supplications. We pray for heaven&#39;s blessing upon the woman&#39;s meeting to-day. May the power of God be in that meeting. And we pray that the power of God may also be manifested at the young men&#39;s meeting, which is to take place this evening, and also for the meeting here this afternoon at 3 o&#39;clock. When we shall talk about the Holy Spirit, let the Holy Ghost come down upon us and remain in our midst; and may our hearts be all on fire with the holy fire; and Christ shall have the praise and the glory.

O God, hear our cry, for thy Son&#39;s sake, and answer our prayer, and the prayers of these dear friends for the unsaved. We know how sin has blinded them, how Satan has deceived them. We pray thee, O God, that thou wilt come and open their eyes, and show them their true condition, and plead with them for their salvation.

May these friends for whom they are praying be saved. We pray that thy blessing may rest on all that was said and sung here and in the pulpits of Boston yesterday. May it be sown in good soil and spring up and bear fruit abundantly; and may hundreds and thousands be turned to thee. O Spirit of the Master, let thy work go on mightily in this city, and turn many from darkness to light. Now we pray that the words spoken here yesterday may be remembered. May thy word not return to thee void, but accomplish that for which thou didst send it.

May those who have not found peace find it now; while they are pouring out their hearts in prayer may the answer come, and may they be saved and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ. We thank thee for that blessed meeting of yesterday. Grant that many may rise up in eternity and thank God that he has led them to these meetings. Now we come to ask a blessing upon the meeting that is to take place here to-night. Bless, we pray thee, Mr. Cook, who is to preach. May the Spirit of God come upon him and anoint him with power from on high; and mayst thou give him physical strength and power; and grant that the Spirit may speak through him to-night, that many hearts may be broken, and the cry may arise from husbands and brothers and friends, &quot;What shall I do to be saved?&quot; May the King be with us to-night in the camp, and may his presence be felt, and may many be drawn to God. We pray thee that thy blessing may rest upon the friends meeting inquirers, that they may explain to them the way of the Lord and how to be saved for Christ.

May every one of us who profess to be followers of the Lord Jesus Christ act up to what we profess. May our eyes be opened to know where we stand, so that we may see ourselves, if we will, in the light of eternity. O God, keep us from self deception-from professing what we do not believe.

But we pray that the Holy Spirit to-night may unstop the deaf ears, that they may hear the glorious news of the gospel to-night. We pray for those who are weary and heavy laden, that they may cast down their burdens at the feet of Jesus; and that they may hear the meek and gentle voice of the Lord Jesus saying, &quot;Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest,&quot; May the weary find rest here to-night; and if there are any that are heavy laden on account of sin, may they accept the Lamb of God to-night, who taketh away the sin of the world.

If I asked you to come to Christ, you would be ready to give some excuse for not accepting the invitation. I never saw an unsaved man in my life but had some excuse - never! and if you don&#39;t have one ready, Satan will be right by you to help you to make one. He is good at that sort of thing. That has been his occupation the last six thousand years - helping men to make excuses.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;And they all with one consent began to make excuse.&quot; (Luke 14:18)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Just bear in mind, these men were invited to a feast, and not to funeral. They were not invited to go to prison. They were not invited to a hospital, or to a madhouse; but they were invited to feast. Now, when a man prepares a feast, there is a great rush to see who will get the best seats; but when God prepares His feast, the chairs would all be empty, if His disciples did not go out to compel people to come in. No sooner did the King send out His invitations than the excuses began to rain in. &quot;And they all, with one consent, began to make excuse.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">All at it, and always at it. Did you ever stop to think, my friends, what would take place if God should take every man at his own word who wants to be excused? If He were to say, &quot;I will excuse you&quot; and with the next breath take them all out of the world? If every one in this audience should be taken at his word, who makes excuses in this respect, and if God should say, &quot;Cut him down, let him cumber the ground no longer, hew him down,&quot; (Luke 13:7) there would be a very terrible state of things in London. If every man in London, and every woman who wanted to be excused, and is saying so, - if God should take them at their word, and say, &quot;I will excuse you,&quot; oh! my friends, there would be a great many shops not opened tomorrow.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The public-houses [bars], for instance, would be closed; for I never saw a publican [bar-keeper] in my life, but what wanted to be excused. He knows he cannot go on with his hellish traffic, if he accepts this invitation. He would have to stop that at once. Many of your cabmen [taxi drivers] do not want to come to the feast, because they would have to stop their business on the Sabbath. There would be a great many of your princely merchants that would be gone. They do not want to accept the invitation, because they think, if they do, they cannot make money so fast. They are carrying on some business which would then have to be stopped, because they accepted this invitation. There would be a very sad state of things taking place. Those that were left would have to be busy burying the dead. It would be a very solemn time, if God should take men at their word, and just excuse them. You let some terrible disease lay hold of a man, and half his excuses are gone at once.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Every kind of excuse is given; but that man does not live who can give a good excuse.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Let any man get an invitation from Queen Victoria to go down to Windsor Castle, to some banquet; and there is not a man but would consider it a great honor to receive such an invitation. But only think of the invitation that I bring tonight! It comes from the King of kings. The marriage supper of the Lamb is going to take place, and God wants every man in this assembly to be present. I cannot speak for the rest of you; but if I know my own heart, I would be rather torn limb from limb - I would rather have my heart torn out of me - than be absent from that marriage supper. I have missed a good many appointments in my time, but, by the grace of God, I mean to make sure of keeping that one.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">These men all began to say, &quot;I pray thee have me excused.&quot; Let us take up that first man&#39;s excuse. What was it? He had bought some ground, and he must needs go and see it. Why did he not, if he were a good business man, go and look at the ground before he bought it? It was not going to make the ground any better for him to go and look at it. He had not made a partial bargain and might withdraw. He was not afraid that some one might step in ahead of him and get the ground from him, and so he would lose it: it was not anything of this kind; but he had bought the ground, and must needs go and see it. It is a strange time to go and see ground, just at supper time. I think the ground would have looked all the better after he had been to the feast. But the fact is, my friends, he did not believe it was a feast; and that is the trouble to-day. Men do not believe the Gospel is a feast.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The second man is approached by the messenger, who says, &quot;My lord has made a great feast, and he wants to have you come to it.&quot; &quot;Take back to your lord the message, that I cannot be there. I have bought five yoke of oxen [for plowing], and I have got to go and prove [test] them.&quot; Why did not he prove his oxen before he bought them? That is the time to prove oxen; but now he has bought them, let them stand in the stall. The trade is already closed; the bargain is already made; the oxen are bought. They are his, and now he can go and prove them at any time. A queer time to prove oxen, at supper time! He had better have proved them in the morning, and so have been ready to go to the feast in the evening.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The third man had married a wife, and therefore he could not come. Why not take his wife along with him? A young bride likes to go to a feast - no one better. He might have taken her: and if she was not willing, then let her stay at home. You smile, you laugh at this, but you can see plainly what these excuses were. They were simply falsehoods, just manufactured to ease their consciences.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">That boy down in the audience sees how absurd these excuses were; for the fact was, they did not want to go to the feast; and it would have been a good deal more honest for them to have said; &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to your lord&#39;s feast, and I will not go.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Now, I would just like to take up some of the popular excuses of the present day. I do not doubt but there are hundreds of you who say to-night, &quot;If I could accept that invitation, Mr. Moody, I would like to be a Christian; but, sir, I have tried, and I find it is a very hard thing.&quot; Well, now let us look at that excuse. Do you mean to say that God is a hard Master? Do you say it is a hard thing to serve God? and do you say that Satan is an easy master, and that it is easier to serve him than God? Is it honest, - is it true? If it is, then I must confess that I have not read my Bible right; because I read it this way: - &quot;The way of the transgressor is hard.&quot; (Prov. 13:15)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">If you doubt it, young men, look at the convicts in that prison; right in the bloom of manhood; right in the prime of life. He has been there for ten years, and must remain there for ten years more, - twenty years taken out of his life, and the thought that when he comes out of that miserable cell, be comes out a branded convict! Do you think that man will tell you &quot;the way of the transgressor has been easy&quot;?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Go and ask the poor drunkard, - the man who is bound hand and foot, and is a slave to the infernal cup, and is hastening on to a drunkard&#39;s grave and to a drunkard&#39;s hell, - ask him if he has found the way of the transgressor easy, and the devil an easy master. Go ask the libertine - go ask that gambler - go ask the most abandoned man you have got in London, - ask them all, if they have found the devil an easy master.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose we were to take the most faithful follower of the devil, and put him into the witness-stand, and let him testify; do you think the most faithful follower of the devil would tell you that he is an easy master? Why, there is not a young man here but knows in his heart the devil is a hard master.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The best way to settle this question is to find out by the testimony of those that have served both masters. I do not think any man has a right to judge until he has served both masters. If I heard a man condemn a master, I should be very apt to ask if he had served him; and if he had not, he could not very well testify. I am speaking to many to-night who have served both masters. Many of you have served Christ; and many of you, before you were brought into the fold of Christ, served the devil. I would like to ask the young men here to-night that are Christ&#39;s, - that have served Christ, - I would like to ask you, who have been brought into the kingdom of God and found Christ, - is Jesus a hard Master? [Loud cries of No.] I thought you would say no. I knew you would. I never heard a man say, &quot;I have served Christ for five years, or more, and found Him a very hard Master.&quot; You never will say that.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">One of the greatest lies that has come out of the pit of hell is, that Christ is a hard Master. It is a lie, and has been so from the foundation of the world. Oh, young man, I beg of you, do not believe the devil when he says that God is a hard Master. It is false, my friends; and to-night let me brand that excuse as one of the devil&#39;s own lies, that lie has been retailing up and down the earth for six thousand years.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Look how poor Adam suffered, because he believed the devil&#39;s lies! Look at poor Judas! Did he find the devil an easy master? See him throwing down the thirty pieces of silver! (Matt. 27:5) Why, he got so tired of the devil&#39;s service that he hanged himself twenty-four hours after he entered it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then there is another very popular excuse. I can imagine a good many would say; &quot;Well, Mr. Moody, the fact is, I want to be saved.&quot; Of course you do! You would not be coming here at this time - at some inconvenience, many of you - if you did not want to be saved. But you say, &quot;The fact is, Mr. Moody, I don&#39;t know that I am elected. If I thought I was elected I would come. I know that I cannot come unless I am elected and I really want to come very much, but I don&#39;t know that I am one of the elect.&quot; Now, I have heard that till I have got sick and tired of it. I want to say to every unconverted man in this hall to-night that you have no more to do with the doctrine of election than you have with the government of China. I am not saying this in haste; I weigh well my words. I say that no unconverted man has anything to do with the doctrine of election. You have to do with the word whosoever. Now, the invitation is, &quot;Whosoever will, let him come to this feast.&quot; (Rev. 22:17)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">To-night, my friends, let me say that you are invited, every one of you; and if you don&#39;t come, it will be because you won&#39;t, not because God does not want you, or has not given you the power to come. With the invitation there comes the power. Christ said to the withered man, &quot;Stretch out thy hand.&quot; (Mark 3:5) The man might have said that he had not the power; but with the invitation there came the power. And so it is here.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose I walked up the street to-night, and I stepped up to the door of this Camberwell Hall to go in, and a man stopped me, and I said to him, &quot;Why not let me in?&quot; &quot;Where&#39;s your ticket? &quot; &quot;I have got none.&quot; &quot;But no one is admitted without a ticket.&quot; &quot;Then I cannot go in, I suppose?&quot; &quot;No; it is for a certain class - those that have got tickets.&quot; I go along farther - up to the Exeter Hall and there is an anniversary meeting of some society. I step in, and a policeman pushes me back. I say, &quot;I want to go in&quot;; and he says, &quot;You cannot go in here unless you have got a ticket. None but members can be admitted to-night.&quot; I do not happen to be a member of the society, and I cannot go in. I go an along a little farther, and come to another meeting; and there, perhaps, they are Quakers. The policeman stops me, and says, &quot;Nobody admitted but Quakers.&quot; I am not a Quaker, and cannot go in. Farther on I find a soldiers&#39; meeting. I cannot go in because I am not a soldier, and none but soldiers are admitted. But I go farther on, for I find written up in great big letters, &quot;Whosoever will, let him come in.&quot; In I go: that means me. Now God has headed His invitation with whosoever, in great burning letters; and if you will go in, God will receive you to-night. He wants you to come this hour - this very minute.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">&quot;Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.&quot; I have an idea that the Lord Jesus Christ saw how men were going to stumble over that doctrine of election; for, after He had been back in heaven for thirty or forty years, and John was in the Spirit on the Lord&#39;s Day, in the Isle of Patmos, Jesus came to him and said, &quot;John, write this,&quot; and he wrote. Again He said; &quot;John, before you close the book, put in this - The Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&quot; (Rev. 22:17) That for ever has settled in my mind, the doctrine of election.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Another excuse is: &quot;I can&#39;t understand the Bible.&quot; Men are giving that as the reason why they do not accept the invitation to be at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Now, I want to say I never met a skeptic or infidel who had read the Bible through. I heard a man say the other day to another man, &quot; Have you read such a book?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;What is your opinion of it?&quot; &quot;Well, I only read it through once, and I would not like to give my opinion without reading it more carefully.&quot; But men can give their opinion about God&#39;s Book without reading it. They read a chapter here and there, and say, &quot;Oh, the Book is so dark and mysterious!&quot; and because they cannot understand it by reading a few chapters, they condemn the whole of it. The Word of God tells us plainly that the natural man cannot understand spiritual things. It is a spiritual book, and speaks of spiritual things; and a man must be born of the Spirit before he can understand the Bible. What seems very dark and mysterious to you now will all be light and clear when ye are born of the Spirit.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You say, &quot;If that is so, how am I to understand how to be saved?&quot; I will tell you. When God puts salvation before a sinner, He puts it so plain that a man who runs can read, and a wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein. There are a great many things in the Book which are dark and mysterious; but when it comes to the plan of salvation, God has put it so plain that that little girl ten years old can understand it, if she will.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You understand what it is to come. &quot;Come unto me, all ye that labour.&quot; (Matt. 11:28) You know what it is to take a gift. &quot;He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.&quot; (John 1:11-12) &quot;The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.&quot; (Rom. 6:23) You know what it is to believe in a man. Well, &quot;believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&quot; (Acts 16:31) You know what it is to put trust and confidence in a man. Now, put your trust and confidence in the living God, and you are saved. You are saved by casting yourself unreservedly upon the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">When God puts salvation before a man, He puts it so plain and simple that if he is willing to come as a little child, he can come.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Suppose I should send my little boy, five years old, to school to-morrow morning, and when he came home I should say, &quot;Can you read, write, spell? Do you understand all about arithmetic, geometry, algebra?&quot; The little fellow would look, at me, and say, &quot;Why, Papa, why do you talk that way? I have been trying all day to learn the A B C.&quot; Supposing I replied &quot;If you have not finished your education you need not go to the school any more,&quot; - what would you say? You would say; &quot;Moody has gone mad.&quot; Well, there is about as much sense in that as in the way that infidels talk about the Bible. They take it up, read a chapter, and say &quot;Oh, it is so dark and mysterious, we cannot understand it.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">This blessed Book is given to be a lamp to our feet and a light to our path (Psa. 119:105) to guide the way to those eternal mansions (John 14:2). It never was given to keep men out of the kingdom of God. That is the devil&#39;s work - trying to make you believe the Word of God is not true. I tell you the only way we can overcome the enemy of our souls is by the written Word of God; and the devil knows that, and so he comes up, and says - &quot;it is full of lies; it is dark and mysterious; it contradicts itself: don&#39;t you believe it.&quot; He knows the moment a man goes to the Word of God and believes it, he finds liberty to his soul, and gets beyond Satan&#39;s reach; he gets a weapon in his hand with which to conquer the devil; he overcomes the enemy of his salvation.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The devil does not want you to find that out, and whispers this lie; and you believe it rather than the Word of God. Young man, your mother is right: the Bible is true, and you had better accept it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Keep this in mind : you will never stand up before the bar of God, and say, the Bible kept you out of the kingdom. It may sound very well here, now; you may be satisfied to give that for an excuse down here, to-night; but you will not be satisfied to give it in the Courts of Heaven; - you will not stand up in the great Judgment Day and say the Bible kept you out of the kingdom.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Then there is another class. Some people say &quot;I haven&#39;t any doubt about the Word of God; but the fact is, there are some men in the Church who are hypocrites; therefore I don&#39;t purpose to go into the Church.&quot; I am not asking you to come into the Church - not but what I believe in churches - but I am asking you to the marriage supper of the Lamb; I am inviting you to this feast; we will talk about the Church by-and-by.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">We want you to come to Christ first; then we will talk to you about the Church. But you say; &quot;Here are some hypocrites.&quot; So there are; and I can imagine you saying; &quot;Oh yes - there is a man up here in one of the churches that cheated me out of &pound;5 a few years ago; you are not going to catch me in the company of such hypocrites,&quot; Well, my friend, if you want to get out of the company of hypocrites, you had better get out of the world as quick as you can. One of the twelve apostles turned out to be a hypocrite; and there is no doubt there will be hypocrites in the Church to the end of time. But &quot;what is that to thee?&quot; says Christ to Peter: &quot;follow thou Me.&quot; We do not ask you to follow hypocrites, we ask you to follow Christ; we do not ask you to believe in hypocrites, we ask you to believe in Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Another thing - if you want to get out of the company of hypocrites you had better make haste and come to Christ. There will be no hypocrites at the marriage supper of the Lamb; they will all be in hell, and you will be there with them if you do not make haste and come to Christ. That excuse would sound strange, would it not? We very often hear men give it down here, but it would sound very strange before Jehovah - a man saying, &quot;I know You invited me to be at the marriage supper of Your Son, but I did not accept it because I knew, there were some hypocrites that professed the Gospel.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is another class who say; &quot;I know there are hypocrites. but they don&#39;t have any influence over me.&quot; If I could go to the door as you go out to-night, and take you by the hand and say, &quot;My friend, why not accept of the invitation to-night?&quot; If you would say, &quot;I pray to be excused to-night; I have not time. I have got some very pressing business to-morrow morning to attend to, and I have to go home to bed as quick as possible, to get my night&#39;s rest. You will have to excuse me.&quot; And the mothers here would say, &quot;I have to go home and put the children to bed; you really must excuse me&quot;;- &quot;very pressing business&quot;;- &quot;no time.&quot; Thousands of men in London say they have not time. Thanks be to God! it don&#39;t take time: it takes decision.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But what have you done with all the time God has given you? Your locks [hair] are turning grey, your eye is growing dim, and that temple of your body is coming down: what have you done with all those years? Is it true you have not time? What did you do with the three hundred and sixty-five days last year? No time? - what have you done with it all? Have not you had time to accept of this invitation? Why, men spend fifteen or twenty years to get an education, that they may go out to earn a living for this frail body that is soon to be eaten up with worms; or five years to learn a trade, that they may earn a living; and yet they have not five minutes to seek their souls&#39; salvation!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">You &quot;have no time.&quot; Is it true? You know it is a lie; and if you go out to-night unsaved, it will not be because you have not time, but because you won&#39;t accept the invitation. God says, &quot;Seek first the kingdom of God.&quot; (Matt. 6:33) That is the first thing to do. Supposing you do not get so much money to-morrow, and get Christ, is not that worth more than money? Better for a man to be sure of salvation than to have the wealth of the world rolled to his feet!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But there is another excuse coming up from some one in the gallery. A man says, &quot;My heart is so hard.&quot; Well, that is just the very reason you ought to come. If you had not a hard heart you would not need a Savior. Can you soften your heart? Can you break your heart? Did not God invite the hard-hearted? Did not Christ come to seek and to save that which was lost? It is just because men&#39;s hearts are hard that they need a Savior. That is no excuse at all. God invites you, and you won&#39;t stand tip and tell the Great King you did not accept His the invitation because you had a hard heart. He invites &quot;whosoever&quot;; and you can come along with your hard heart.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">In the North there was a minister talking to a man in the inquiry room. He said, &quot; My heart is so hard, it seems as if it was chained; and I cannot come.&quot; &quot; Ah! &quot; said the minister, &quot;Come to Christ, chain and all&quot;; and he just came to Christ, and Christ snapped the fetters, and set him free right there. If you are bound hand and foot by Satan, that is the work of God to break the fetters; you cannot break them. Thanks be to God! He can break the fetters and set the captive souls free to-night. I do not care how hard the heart is: the Lord can save to the uttermost; He bids you come just as you are. Oh, this old excuse - &quot;I am so bad!&quot;; Away with it! Paul said he was the &quot;chief&quot; of sinners; and if the chief has obtained mercy there is hope for everybody else.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">The devil makes us believe that we are good enough without salvation, if he can; and if he cannot make us believe that, he says, &quot;You are so bad the Lord won&#39;t have you&quot;; and so he tries to make people believe, because they are so bad, Christ won&#39;t have anything to do with them. God invites you to come just as you are. I know a great many people want to come, but they are trying to get better and to get ready to come. Now mark you, my friend, the Lord invites you to come just as you are; and if you could make yourself better, you would not be any more acceptable to Him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Do not put these filthy rags of self-righteousness about you. God will strip every rag from you when you come to Him, and He will clothe you with glorious garments. When our [civil] war was going on, we would sometimes go to the recruiting office and see a man come in with a silk hat, broadcloth coat, calfskin boots - his suit might be worth $100; and another man would come in whose clothes were not worth a pound; but they both had to strip, and put on the uniform of the country. And so when we go into Christ&#39;s vineyard we must put on the livery of heaven, and be stripped of every rag of our own. However bad you are, come just as you are, and the Lord will receive you.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some say; &quot;I would like to become a Christian; but I have a prejudice against these special meetings, and against Americans, and against a layman too. If it was a regular minister, if it was our regular minister, I would accept the invitation.&quot; If that is your difficulty, I can help you out of that. You can just get up, and go out of the hall, and run right over to your minister, and have a talk with him; your minister would be most glad to see and talk and pray with you. And if you say do not want to be converted in a special meeting, there are regular meetings in all the churches throughout London.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">But if you say There is a great awakening here in London,&quot; and you do not want to be converted in that way; then jump into a train, and go to some town where there is no revival. We can find you some place where there is no revival, and some church where there is not much of the revival spirit. If you really want to go, don&#39;t give that for an excuse. How wise the devil is! When the Church is cold, and everything is dead, men say, &quot; Oh, well, if there was only some life in the Church I might become a Christian, - if we could only just have a wave from heaven.&quot; Then when the wave does come, they say, &quot; Oh no; we are afraid of excitement, and afraid of these special meetings. We are afraid there will be something done that won&#39;t be just in accordance with our ideas of propriety.&quot; - My friend, it is God who is working. He prepares the way.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is another class here who say: &quot;I would like to come, but then I do not feel.&quot; That is, I think, the very worst excuse, and the most common excuse we have. I wish sometimes the word could be abolished, - feel! feel! You go into the inquiry room. &quot;Well, Mr. Moody, I do not feel this and that.&quot; Why, supposing my friend, Mr. Stone [organizer of the meeting] should invite me to go to his house to-morrow to dinner, and I say to Mr. Stone, &quot;I should like to go very much, but I don&#39;t know that I feel right.&quot; &quot;Well&quot;, he says, &quot;what do you mean? Do you mean you don&#39;t want to go to my house?&quot; &quot;Oh no, I want to go.&quot; (That is what men say: &quot;Oh yes, we want to be saved.&quot;) &quot;What do you mean, Mr. Moody? Do you mean that you do not know you will be well to-morrow? Do you think you will be sick?&quot; &quot;I expect to be well to-morrow, if I live.&quot; &quot;Well, what do you mean by feeling?&quot; &quot;Well, I do not know just how I&#39;ll feel. I would like very much to go to your house to dinner tomorrow, but I don&#39;t know that I will feel just right.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t understand you, Mr. Moody - I am not talking about feeling; I invite you to come to my house to dinner.&quot; &quot;Well, I would like to come very much, but the fact is, I do not know how I will feel to-morrow.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I can imagine my friend saying, &quot;What has come over Moody? I think the fellow has gone mad. I asked him to my house to dinner, and he says he would like to come, but he does not know that he will feel right; he talked about feeling all the time.&quot; Of course you would say be has gone mad. But that is the way people talk now. You speak to them about coming to the kingdom of God, and they say; &quot;I do not know that I feel just right.&quot; Away with your feelings. God is above feeling. We cannot control our feelings? If I could, I would feel good all the time - never catch me feeling bad at anything! I am sure if I could control my feelings I never would have any bad feelings; I would always have good feelings.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Bear in mind, Satan may change our feelings fifty times a day, but he cannot change the Word of God; and what we want is to build our hopes of the kingdom of heaven upon the Word of God. When a poor sinner is coming up out of the pit, and just ready to get his feet upon the Rock of Ages, the devil sticks out a plank of feeling and says; &quot;Get on that&quot;; and when he puts his feet on that, down he goes again.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Take one of these texts - &quot;Verily, I say unto you, he that hearest my word and believeth on Him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death into life.&quot; (John 5:24) My friend, that is worth more than all the feelings that you can have in a whole lifetime. I would a thousand times rather stand on that verse than on the best frame of feeling. I took my stand there twenty years ago. The dark waves of hell have come dashing up against me; the waves of persecution have surged around me doubts, fears, and unbelief have assailed me; but I have been able to stand right there. It is a sure footing for eternity. It was true eighteen hundred years ago, and it is true to-night. That Rock is higher than my feeling. What we want is to get our feet upon the Rock, and then the Lord will put a new song into our mouths.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">There is another class, who say they cannot believe. Not long ago, a man said to me; &quot;I cannot believe.&quot; I said &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;Well, I cannot believe.&quot; I said, &quot;Who&quot;&#39; He stammered and stuttered, and I said; &quot; Who cannot you believe, - God?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, I believe God. I cannot believe myself,&quot; &quot;Well, you do not want to believe yourself. Your heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked (Jer. 17:9). Put no confidence in the flesh. Don&#39;t believe yourself; call yourself a liar, and let God be true. Believe in God, and say as Job said; &#39;Though He slay me I will trust Him.&#39;(Job 13:15)&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Some men seem to talk as if it was a great misfortune that they do not believe. Bear in mind, it is the damning sin of the world. &quot;When He, the Comforter, is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me.&quot; That is the sin of the world - &quot;because they believe not on me.&quot; Why, that is the very root of sin - the very tree, and all the fruit! This is the tree that brings forth this bad fruit - it is the tree of unbelief.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">I wish I had time to go on with these excuses; for they are as numerous as the hairs on our heads. But if I could go on and exhaust them all, the devil would help to make more. You can just take them, tie them up in one bundle, and mark them lies - the whole of them. Not one of them is true. If your excuse is a good one, if it will stand the light of eternity; do not give it up for anything I have said. Hold it firm, take it to the bar of God, and tell it out to Him. But if you have an excuse that won&#39;t stand the piercing eye of God, I beg of you, as a friend, give it up - let your excuses go. Let them go to the four winds of heaven, and accept of the invitation now. It is a very easy thing for a man to excuse himself into hell, but he cannot excuse himself out.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Dare you make light of the invitation? Suppose you should just write out an excuse to the King of Heaven: &quot;While sitting in the Camberwell Hall, July 10th, 1875, I received a very pressing invitation from one of Your messengers to be present at the marriage supper of Your only-begotten Son. I pray Thee have me excused.&quot; Would you come up and sign that? Would you take your pen and put your name down to that excuse? I can imagine you saying, you would let your right hand forget its cunning, and your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth first. I doubt whether there is a man in this room who could be made to sign this excuse: but what will you do? Many of you will get up and go out of this hall, making light of the preacher, laughing at everything you have heard, paying no attention to the invitation. I beg of you, do not make light of this invitation. It is a loving God that invites you; but God is not to be mocked. Go, play with the forked lightning, trifle with any pestilence, any disease, rather than with God. God is not to be trifled with.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">Just let me write out another reply &quot;To the King of Heaven. While sitting in the Camberwell Hall, July 10th, 1875, I received a pressing invitation from one of Your servants to be present at the marriage supper of Your only-begotten Son. I hasten to reply, By the grace of God I will be present.&quot; Who will sign that? (Many replies of &quot;I will!&quot; &quot;I will!&quot;) Who will set to their seal to-night that God is true? Be wise to-night and accept of the invitation. Make up your mind now: do not go away till the question of eternity is settled.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA16174BA">--Excerpted from a sermon preached by Dwight L.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-Christ never preached any funeral sermons.<br/><br/>-His is a loving, tender hand, full of sympathy and compassion.<br/><br/>-Take your stand on the Rock of Ages. Let death, let the judgment come: the victory is Christ&#39;s and yours through Him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-The only man who ever suffered before Christ was that servant who had his ear cut off. But most likely in a moment afterward he had it on, and very likely it was a better ear than ever, because whatever the Lord does He does it well. No mm ever lost his life with Him.<br/><br/>- A great many people wonder why it was that Christ did not come at once to Martha and Mary, whom He loved, whenever He heard of their affliction. It was to try them, and it is the same with His dealings toward us. If He seems not to come to us in our affliction, it is only to test us.<br/><br/>- -When the Spirit came to Moses, the plagues came upon Egypt, and he had power to destroy men&#39;s lives; when the Spirit came upon Elijah, fire came down from heaven; when the Spirit came upon Gideon, no man could stand before him; and when it came upon Joshua, he moved around the city of Jericho and the whole city fell into his hands; but when the Spirit came upon the Son of Man, He gave His life; He healed the broken-hearted.<br/><br/>-No matter how low down you are; no matter what your disposition has been; you may be low in your thoughts, words, and actions; you may be selfish; your heart may be overflowing with corruption and wickedness; yet Jesus will have compassion upon you. He will speak comforting words to you; not treat you coldly or spurn you, as perhaps those of earth would, but will speak tender words, and words of love and affection and kindness. Just come at once. He is a faithful friend - a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-There cannot be any peace where there is uncertainty.<br/><br/>-There is no, knowledge like that of a man who knows he is saved, who can look up and see his &quot;title clear to mansions in the skies.&quot;<br/><br/>-I believe hundreds of Christian people are being deceived by Satan now on this point, that they have not got the assurance of salvation just because they are not willing to take God at His word.<br/><br/>-&quot;But,&quot; a man said to me, &quot;no one has come back, and we don&#39;t know what is in the future. It is all dark, and how can we be sure?&quot; Thank God! Christ came down from heaven, and I would rather have Him, coming as he does right from the bosom of the Father, than any one else. We can rely on what Christ says, and He says, &quot;He that believeth on Me shall not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; Not that we are going to have it when we die, but right here to-day.<br/><br/>-Now, I find a great many people who want some evidence that they have accepted the Son of God. My friends, if you want any evidence, take God&#39;s word for it. You can&#39;t find better evidence than that. You know that when the Angel Gabriel came down and told Zachariah he should have a son he wanted a further token than the angel&#39;s word. He asked Gabriel for it and he answered, &quot;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of the Lord.&quot; He had never been doubted, and he thundered out this to Zachariah. But he wanted a further token, and Gabriel said, &quot;You shall have a token: you shall be dumb till your son shall be given you.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-When we know our Bible: then his that God can use us.<br/><br/>-When we find a man meditating on the words of God, my friends, that man is full of boldness and is successful.<br/><br/>-When a man is filled with the Word of God you cannot keep him still, If a man has got the Word, he must speak or die.<br/><br/>-Let us have one day exclusively to study and read the Word of God. If we can&#39;t take time during the week, we will have Sunday uninterrupted.<br/><br/>-Now, as old Dr. Bonner, of Glasgow, said, Lord didn&#39;t sell Joshua how to use the sword, but He told him how he should meditate on the Lord day and night, and then he would have good success.&quot;<br/><br/>-One thing I have noticed in studying the Word of God, and that is, when a man is filled with the Spirit he deals largely with the Word of God, whereas the man who is filled with his own Ideas refers rarely to the Word of God. He gets along without it, and you seldom see it mentioned in his discourses.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-Now I am no prophet, nor the son of a prophet, but one thing I can predict; that every one of our new converts that goes to studying his Bible, and loves this book above every other book, is sure to hold out. The world will have no charm for him; he will get the world under his feet, because in this book he will find something better than the world can give him.<br/><br/>-What can botanists tell you of the lily of the valley? You must study this book for that. What can geologists tell you of the Rock of Ages, or mere astronomers about the Bright Morning Star? In those pages we find all knowledge unto salvation; here we read of the ruin of man by nature, redemption by the blood, and regeneration by the Holy Ghost These three things run all through and through them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-The most solemn truth in the gospel is that the only thing Christ left down here is His blood.<br/><br/>-A man who covers up the cross though he may be an intellectual man, and draw large crowds will have no ilk there, and his church will be but a gilded sepulcher.<br/><br/>-There is either of two things we must do. One is to send back the message to heaven that we don&#39;t want the blood 9t Christ to cleanse us of our sin, or else accept it.<br/><br/>-Into every house where the blood was not sprinkled, the destroying angel came. But wherever the blood was on doorpost and lintel, whether they had worked much, or whether they had worked none, God passed them over.<br/><br/>-A man who has not realized what the blood has done for him has not the token of salvation. It is told of Julian, the apostate, that while he was fighting he received an arrow in his side. He pulled it out, and, taking a handful of blood threw it into the air and cried, &quot;Galilean, Galilean, thou hast conquered.&quot;<br/><br/>-Look at that Roman soldier as he pushed his spear into the very heart of the God-man. What a hellish deed! But what was the next thing that took place? Blood covered the spear! Oh! thank God, the blood covers sin. There was the blood covering that spear-the very point of it. The very crowning act of sin brought out the crowning act of love; the crowning act of wickedness was the crowning act of grace.<br/><br/>-It is said that old Dr. Alexander, of Princeton College, when a young student used to start out to preach, always gave them a piece of advice. The old man would stand with his gray locks and his venerable face and say: &quot;Young man, make much of the blood in your ministry? Now, I have traveled considerable during the past few years, and never met a minister who made much of the blood and much of the atonement but God had blessed his ministry, and souls were born into the light by it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-There was never a sermon which you have listened to but in it Christ was seeking for you. I contend that a man cannot but find in every page of this book that Jesus Christ is seeking him through His blessed Word. This is what the Bible is for to seek out the lost.<br/><br/>-No man in the world should be so happy as a man of God. It is one continual source of gladness. He can l3ok up and say, &quot;God is my Father, Christ is my Saviour, and the Church is my mother.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-It is the greatest pleasure of living to win souls to Christ.<br/><br/>-I believe in what John Wesley used to say, &quot;All at it, and always at it,&quot; and that is what the Church wants to-day.<br/><br/>-If we were all of us doing the work that God has got for us to do, don&#39;t you see how the work of the Lord would advance?<br/><br/>-There is no man living that can do the work that God has got for me to do. No one can do it but myself. And if the work ain&#39;t done we will have to answer for it when we stand before God&#39;s bar.<br/><br/>-What makes the Dead Sea dead? Because it is all the time receiving, never giving out anything. Why is it that many Christians are cold? Because they are all the time receiving, never giving out anything.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-If Christ comes into our hearts we are not ashamed.<br/><br/>-I wish we had a few more women like the woman of Samaria, willing to confess what the Lord Jesus Christ had done for their souls.<br/><br/>-Believing and confessing go together; and you cannot be be saved without you take them both. &quot;With the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&quot; If you ever see the kingdom of heaven you have to &#39;take this way.<br/><br/>-Satan puts straws across our path and magnifies it and makes us believe it is a mountain, but all the devil&#39;s mountains are mountains of smoke; when you come up to them they are not there.<br/><br/>-I do not know anything that would wake up Chicago better than for every man and woman here who loves Him to begin to talk about Him to theft friends, and just to tell them what He has done for you. You have got a circle of friends. Go and tell them of Him.<br/><br/>-I can&#39;t help thinking of the old woman who started out when the war commenced with a poker in her hand. When asked what! she was going to do with it she said: &quot;I can&#39;t do much with it, but I can show what side I&#39;m on.&quot; My friends, even if you can&#39;t do much, show to which side you belong.<br/><br/>-I may say with truth that there is only about one in ten who professes Christianity who will turn round and glorify God with a loud voice. Nine out of ten are still born Christians. You never hear of them. If you press them hard with the question whether they are Christians they might say, &quot;Well, I hope so.&quot; We never see it in their actions; we never see it in their lives. They might belong to the church you go to, but you never see them at the prayer-meetings or taking any interest in the church affairs. They don&#39;t profess it among their fellows or in their business, and the result is that there are hundreds going on with a half hope, not sure whether their religion will stand them or not</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-It is our privilege to know that we are saved.<br/><br/>-We shall draw the world to Christ when we are filled with religion.<br/><br/>-He that overcometh shall inherit all things. God has no poor children.<br/><br/>-I hold to the doctrine of sudden conversion as I do to my life, and I would as quickly give up my life as give up this doctrine, unless it can be proved that it is not according to the word of God. Now, I will admit that light is one thing and birth is another. A soul must be born before it can see light A child must be born before it can be taught; it must be born before it can walk; it must be born before it can be educated.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-If you receive Him it will be well; if you reject Him and are lost it will be terrible.<br/><br/>-Thanks be to God, there is hope to-day; this very hour you can choose Him and serve Him.<br/><br/>-Now just think a moment and answer the question, &quot;What shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&quot;<br/><br/>-I believe in my soul that there are more at this day being lost for want of decision than for any other thing.<br/><br/>-One of two things you must do; you must either receive Him or reject Him. You receive Him here and He will receive you there; you reject Him here and He will reject you there.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-The mightiest man that ever lived could not deliver himself from his sins. If a man could have saved himself, Christ would never have come into the world.<br/><br/>-He came to deliver us from our sinful dispositions, and create in us pure hearts, and when we have Him with us it will not be hard for us. Then the service of Christ will be delightful.<br/><br/>-If you are under the power of evil, and you want to get under the power of God, cry to Him to bring you over to His service; cry to Him to take you into His army. He will hear you; He will come to you, and, if need be, He will send a legion of angels to help you to fight your way up to heaven. God will take you by the right hand and lead you through this wilderness, over death, and take you right into His kingdom. That&#39;s what the Son of Man came to do. He has never deceived us; just say here; &quot;Christ is ray deliverer.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-God will honor our faith.<br/><br/>-There is nothing on this earth that pleases Christ so much as faith.<br/><br/>-Faith is the foundation of all society. We have only to look around and see this.<br/><br/>-I believe there is no man in the world so constituted but he can believe in God&#39;s word. He simply tells you to believe in Him, and He will save you.<br/><br/>-When I was converted twenty years ago I felt a faith in God; but five years after I had a hundred times more faith, and five years ago I had more than eve; because I became better acquainted with Him. I have read up the Word, and I see that the Lord has done so and so, and then I have turned to where He has promised to perform it, and when I see this I have reason to believe in Him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-All you have got to do is to prove that you are a sinner, and I will prove that you have got a Saviour.<br/><br/>-Do you believe the Lord will call a poor sinner, and then cast him out? No! his word stands forever, &quot;Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out.&quot;<br/><br/>-If God put Adam out of this earthly Eden on account of one sin, do you think He will let us into the Paradise above with our tens of thousands sins upon us.<br/><br/>-The only charge they could bring against Christ down here was, that He was receiving bad men. They are the very kind of men He is willing to receive.<br/><br/>-&quot;Lord, you don&#39;t really mean that we shall preach the Gospel to those men that murdered you, to those men that took your life?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the Lord, &quot;go and preach the Gospel to those Jerusalem sinners.&quot; I can imagine Him saying: &quot;Go and hunt up that man that put the cruel crown of thorns upon My brow, and preach the Gospel to him. Tell him he shall have a crown in My kingdom without a thorn in it&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-We must not limit the mighty grace of God.<br/><br/>-Grace means undeserved kindness. It is the gift of God to man the moment he sees he is unworthy of God&#39;s favor.<br/><br/>-A man does not get grace till he comes down to the ground, till he sees he needs grace. When a man stoops to the dust and acknowledges that he needs mercy, then it is that the Lord will give him grace.<br/><br/>-If you are ready to partake of grace you have not to atone for your sins-you have merely to accept of the atonement. All that you want to do is to cry, &quot;God have mercy upon me,&quot; and you will receive the blessing.<br/><br/>-&quot;The grace of God hath power to bring salvation to all men,&quot; and if a man is unsaved it is because he wants to work it out; he wants to receive salvation in some other way than God&#39;s way; but we are told that &quot;he that climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.&quot;<br/><br/>-When we get full of this grace we want to see every one blessed-we want to see all the churches blessed, not only all the churches here, but in the whole country. That was the trouble with Christ&#39;s disciples. He had hard work to make them understand that His gospel was for every one, that it was a stream to flow out to all nations of the earth. They wanted to confine it to the Jews, and He had to convince them that it was for every living being.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-If you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you are free<br/><br/>-There is no sin in the whole catalogue of sins you can name but Christ will deliver you from it perfectly.<br/><br/>-We are led on by an unseen power that we have not got strength to resist, or else we are led on by the loving Son of God.<br/><br/>-The trouble is, people do not know that Christ is a Deliverer. They forget that the Son of God came to keep them from sin as as well as to forgive it.<br/><br/>-You say &quot;I am afraid I cannot hold out.&#39; Well, Christ will hold out for you. There is no mountain that He will not climb with you if you will; He will deliver you from your besetting sin.<br/><br/>-Satan rules all men that are in his kingdom Some he rules through lust. Some he rules through covetousness. Some he rules through appetite. Some he rules by their temper, but he rules them. And none will ever seek to be delivered until they get their eyes open and see that they have been taken captive.<br/><br/>-&#39;When Christ was on the earth there was a woman in the temple who was bowed almost to the ground with sin. Satan had - bound her for eighteen years; but after all these years of bondage Christ delivered her. He spoke one word and she was free. She got up and walked home. How astonished those at home must have been to see her walking in.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-Praise is not only speaking to the Lord on our own account, but it is praising Him for what He has done for others.<br/><br/>-If we have a praise church we will have people convened.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t care where it is, what part of the world it&#39;s in, if we have a praise church we&#39;ll have successful christianity.<br/><br/>-Every good gift that we have had from the cradle up has come from God. If a man just stops to think what he has to praise God for, he will find there is enough to keep him singing praises for a week.<br/><br/>-We have in our churches a great deal of prayer, but I think it would be a good thing if we had a praise meeting occasionally. If we could only get people to praise God for what He has done, it would be a good deal better than asking Him continually for something.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-All should work and ask God&#39;s guidance.<br/><br/>-The world knows little of the works wrought by prayer.<br/><br/>-Let us pray, and as we pray, let us make room for Jesus in our hearts.<br/><br/>-Unless the Spirit of God is with us, we cannot expect that our prayers will be answered.<br/><br/>-David was the last one we would have chosen to fight the giant, but he was chosen of God.<br/><br/>-Every one of our children will be brought into the ark, if we pray and work earnestly for them.<br/><br/>-The impression that a praying mother leaves upon her children is life-long. Perhaps when you are dead and gone your prayer will be answered.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">-I would rather go into the kingdom of heaven through the poor house than go down to hell in a golden chariot.<br/><br/>-I believe there are more young men who come to Boston who are lost because they cannot say no, than for any other reason.<br/><br/>-It ain&#39;t necessary to leave the things of this life when you follow Him. It is not necessary to give up your business, if it&#39;s a legitimate one, in order to accept Christ. But you musn&#39;t set your heart on the old nets by a good deal.<br/><br/>-A great many people want to bring theft faith, theft works, their good deeds to Him for salvation. Bring your sins, and He will bear them away into the wilderness of forgetfulness, and you will never see them again.<br/><br/>-Do you believe that He would send those men out to preach the gospel to every creature unless he wanted every creature to be saved? Do you believe He would tell them to preach it to people without giving people the power to accept it? Do you believe the God of heaven is mocking men by offering them his gospel and not giving them the power to take hold of it? Do you believe He will not give men power to accept this salvation as a gift? Man might do that, but God never mocks men. And when he says &quot;Preach the gospel to every creature,&quot; every creature can be saved if he will.<br/><br/>-Lift your eyes from off these puny Christians-from off these human ministers, and look to Christ. He is the Saviour of the world. He came from the throne to this earth: He came from the very bosom of the Father. God gave Him up freely for us, and all we have to do is to accept him as our Saviour. Look at Him at Gethsemane, sweating as it were great drops of blood; look at Him on the cross, crucified between two thieves; hear that piercing cry, &quot;Father, Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.&quot; And as you look into that face, as you look into those wounds on His feet or His hands, will you say He has not the power to save you? Will you say He has not the power so redeem you?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="csCCB07714">
