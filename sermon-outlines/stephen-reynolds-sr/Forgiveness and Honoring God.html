Forgiving an attacker, an enemy is the furthest thing from our minds.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mat. 5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mat. 6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Luke 6:27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Luke 6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">to</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the evil. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Romans 12:20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1&nbsp;Thes. 5:15 See that none render evil for evil unto any </span><span class="csC382D2BB">man;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all </span><span class="csC382D2BB">men</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Leviticus 19:18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I </span><span class="csC382D2BB">am</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Proverbs 24:17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Proverbs 25:21-22If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another difficult situation arises when we are confronted with leaders who make mistakes or who live wicked lives, committing unjust acts.

Should we honor or dishonor corrupt leaders?</span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;David and his men grieved over the news from the battlefield: a lesson on forgiving one&#39;s enemy (v.11-16).</span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;David composed a funeral song for Saul and his son Jonathan: a lesson on honoring God&#39;s anointed&mdash;His servant (v.17-27).</span></p><p class="csB745B03A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

When a leader commits wickedness or simply makes a wrong decision, he is to be corrected. Neither his mistake nor his wicked behavior is to be condoned. We are never to give license to nor indulge corruption, whether simple mistakes or wicked behavior. But while executing justice, discipline, and correction, we are to continue honoring the position of leadership, the office the leader holds. For most offices of leadership are essential for an orderly, peaceful, just, and productive society.</span></li></ul>
