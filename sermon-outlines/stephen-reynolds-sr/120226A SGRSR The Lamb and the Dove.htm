                                   32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the

which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 34 And I saw, and bare record that this is
the Son of God.</p>

1Co 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye
are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>I.            This Lamb is Christ
our Passover who was sacrificed for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1Pe 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know
that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from
your vain conversation received by tradition from your
fathers;                                                                                                         
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Isa 53:6 All we like sheep have
gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on
him the iniquity of us all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Isa 53:7 He was oppressed, and he
was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Ac 8:32  The place of the
scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and
like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1Pe 2:21 For even hereunto were
ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye
should follow his steps:                                         22 Who did no
sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:                                                 23
Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened
not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
righteously:                           24 Who his own self bare our sins in his
own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto
righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. 25 For ye were as sheep going
astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. 
(leader-Led, Guidance)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1Pe 5:3 Neither as being lords
over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>We as ministers must serve not
dominate without help of the Holy
Ghost.                                                                                                                                  
We as ministers must serve as a father to a child not dictate without
compassion.                                                                                                                             
How careful we need to be in reaction to the Lamb and the dove                                                                                                                          
What kind of person will the dove remain upon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Ro 8:14 For as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.                                                                                                                                    Lambs
must be led, The Lamb was one of the first animals that the human being began
to raise as a domestic animal                                                                                                                  Texas
leads sheep-raising, with over six million sheep being raised yearly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>1.  Australia takes the lead
among the sheep raising countries, 120 million sheep raised yearly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>2.  Russia takes second place,
with about 80 million</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>3.  Argentina with about 50

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>5.  England with about 20
million, holds tenth place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>In Ancient Egypt, the lamb was idolized.
It was one of the main idols of the Egyptian nation. We can therefore realize
the self sacrificing courage of the Jews in Egypt when they obeyed God’s
command, taking sheep - one lamb for each family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>II.           The nature of the
dove Harmless as Doves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Doves are gentle–Doves don’t get
rough, hiss, jeer, taunt, sneer, ridicule, disdain, scorn –Doves are
Harmless–Doves don’t strike at each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>A.  We should have the harmless,
gentle and peaceful nature of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Php 2:15 That ye may be blameless
and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
world;                                                                                     
Heb 7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Song 2:14 O my dove, that art in
the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy
countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance
is comely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Mt 3:16 And Jesus, when he was
baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were
opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and
lighting upon him:                                                                     Mr
1:10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and
the Spirit like a dove descending upon
him:                                                        Lu 3:22 And the
Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came
from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well
pleased.                                                                                           
John 1:32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven
like a dove, and it abode upon him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>B.   We should have Christ and
the Whole counsel of His Word as our foundation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>C.  “Wise as Serpents and
Harmless as Doves”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>(Two phrases in one)- bringing
out the Truth of a dual nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>·        Wise as Serpents-Perfect
Hatred - - - (fight of faith)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>·        Harmless as

tigers, Sheep not wolves, Sheep not serpents, *(Sheep not doves) Mt 10:16 Behold,
I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as
serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>

there first year and every year</p>
