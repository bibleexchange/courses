They were both guilty of the serious sin of adultery, a sin that affects so many lives. Under Jewish law it was considered so serious that the parties were to be stoned to death (<a class="csF6F71918" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Lev+20%3A10"><span>Leviticus 20:10</span></a></span><span class="csC05134DD">; Deut. 22:13-24). this sin speaks to the sin of every person.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;This sin was a work of darkness. All sin is, and most sin is actually done under the cover of darkness. An attempt is made to hide it from wife, husband, mother, father, employer, class-mate.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;The man and woman thought what we all often think&mdash;that their sin would never be discovered, that no one would ever find out. But they overlooked two things that we all ignore: in the vast majority of cases, sin has been discovered; and sin, the very act of it, is always seen by God.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;The sin took place at the time of the feast, where the atmosphere was party-like and where men and women were brought together by drinking and dancing and the indulgence of the crowd. Such an atmosphere corrupts even those with the best intentions and the highest morals.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who caught the woman in the act of adultery were </span><span class="csF1BA8D25">great sinners</span><span class="csC05134DD">.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were vindictive and revengeful. They wanted to strike out, to get back at her. She was publicly exposed. She should have been held in custody in some private place until judgment was passed, but she was unmercifully dragged before the public to expose her sin and to shame and punish her. Why? (She hurt her husband and loved ones so much that they struck out at her. Public exposure was his way to strike back at her). NO! NO! NO!</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">b.	They were vindictive and revengeful. They wanted to strike out and get at Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs48A80F63"><span class="csC05134DD">The man who committed adultery with her was not exposed. Why?</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have escaped, fled before they grabbed him.</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have been feared or bought his accusers off.</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have been released because, as is the case in so many societies, misbehavior (sin) by men was more acceptable than by women.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the guilt of the religionists and the public. When the accusers dragged the woman to the religionists, people all along the way joined in, as the case so often is. The religionists saw a chance to test Jesus, so they took the woman before Him, hoping to discredit Him.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jesus said the woman was not guilty, He would be breaking Jewish law and be leaving Himself open to the charge of being too lenient with sin.</span></p><p class="cs476EF7A8"><span class="cs589E30B5">&rArr;</span><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;&nbsp;If Jesus said the woman was guilty and should be killed, He would be breaking Roman law which did not consider adultery a sin worthy of death. He would also be criticized as lacking mercy and love, compassion and forgiveness.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csC05134DD">Note several things about the dark nature of man seen in these religionists and in the crowd who joined in the public exposure.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sinful spirit among all these involved, a spirit...</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of self-righteousness that lacked forgiveness</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of criticism that lacked love</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of judging that lacked compassion</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of censoring that lacked understanding</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of condemning that lacked sympathy</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of punishing that lacked restoration</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of cruelty that lacked curing</span></p><p class="cs8D62E0DE"><span class="csC05134DD">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;of destroying that lacked restoring</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was hypocrisy. They felt and claimed that they were religious, better than the woman, free from any sin serious enough to be exposed.
