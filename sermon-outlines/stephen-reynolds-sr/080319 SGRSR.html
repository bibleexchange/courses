		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We have a responsibility. Where god holds us responsible he has provided much. He has guaranteed to reward us if we remain faithful.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">v.25 While men slept the enemy sold tares</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God has given us a responsibility to guard the field and pay it careful attention. God has planted some good seed into our heart and into our life. We must guard against the enemies sowing of tares. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We have a responsibility. If we don&rsquo;t realize our responsibility we&rsquo;ll miss church, give excuse for un-involvement in things you once loved. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People let the devil come by and put wedges of doubt and questions in their mind. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t have time to spend with you today.&rdquo; Love brought into question because of tares and wedges. As important as our family and friends are and we have a responsibility in protecting those relationships. We must make sure our hearts and lives are guarded because there is an enemy that comes by and loves to sow tares. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People wanted to go in and gather up the tares quickly, but you cannot change people. You cannot fix their problems for them. (Mote beam and splinter in your eye lesson from Jesus applies here as well.) UNLESS THEY wake up and realize something is wrong with them (Matthew 11:28) they can&rsquo;t be changed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

We would have no problem with the enemy or the flesh if we kept our faith in working order through a dedicated and consistent prayer life. If you are going to have His gifts you must come to Him. Come and keep coming. In a place of worship, prayer, and praise to the Lord we have FELLOWSHIP with God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must share what God has given us to others. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If it is not the seed God has planted it is a tare. </span></p></body>
