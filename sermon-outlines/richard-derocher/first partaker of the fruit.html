It says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get this over with so we can get to the good stuff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csA33204DA" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">As we invite other to taste and see of God&rsquo;s good Word, we must partake ourselves so that its delicious and palatable taste is evident by our own demeanor. As we share, we partake. Our sincere ingestion of delectable truth will excite us and attract others to partake. When you sit and eat a delicious homemade apple pie, you freely give your complements to the baker, smile with delight and heartily anticipate each bite. This unforced and natural behavior causes a reaction in others hesitant to eat, &ldquo;I want some of he is having!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csA33204DA" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">The hearer needs to be convinced of the sincerity of the speaker&rsquo;s announcement of the scrumptious meal offered. Because of the sweetness and richness of truth, the speaker needs only to heartily enjoy each bite as the Lord gives it to him and he offers more of the same to the hearers.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Careful uses of pause and slowing down the speaker&rsquo;s pace, when done right, is like spoon feeding a baby. This gives the hearer time to digest and reflect upon what is said. If done right, the hearer will taste the scrumptious truth, begin to feel its effect and influence working inside, and hungrily anticipate more. The meat of God&rsquo;s word is a hearty meal and cannot be swallowed in a gulp, but each bite should be given time to settle and before another is forced upon the hearer&rsquo;s lips.</span></p></body>
