Notes:---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Who know not God at all
Who know God but are not comitted to God
Who Love God and Point things out that we need to let God touch and take out of our lives.



Leviticus is a tedious book.
The major theme of Leviticus is ATONEMENT and HOLINESS.
Holiness in three ways:
1. Sacrificial Ceremony
2. Obedient Living
3. Issues of Conduct and Daily Living

 1Co 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
 
 Keeping yourself pure and separate and in the midst of these lessons we find the warning concerning Molech.
 Molech is not God.

Text: 2 Kings 2:14-15
Title: The Message that is in the Mantle

2Ki 2:14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had 
smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.
 15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to
 meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.

 The mantle and the man are never separated. 
 
I. The Making of the Man
 
 Do Not become Confused in any of the Stages. Elisha did not become a prophet until he received the mantle.
 
 1. THE PREPARATION - He had the Touch but did not have the Mantle - Don't Mistake the Touch of the Mantle for the Anointing of the Mantle
 2. THE TASK of a Servant - How quickly we lend our hands to servanthood - Preaching is a small part of the ministry. - If the touch is real, you will be up to the task.
 3. THE TEST - When Elijah fasted, prayed, was persecuted, Elisha fasted, prayed, was persecuted

 
  
 II. The Counting of the Cost
 
 -Cuts the ties with HIs family
 -You do not get to dictate where the touch takes you.
 -Gilgal is the place of first anointings
 
 III. The Mark of the Miraculous
 
 Not enough to be a made Man, but must have the anointing of the Holy Ghost
