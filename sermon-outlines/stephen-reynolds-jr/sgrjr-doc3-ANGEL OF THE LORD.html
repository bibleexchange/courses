The Angel of the LORD appears to them and tells them she will conceive a son and gives instruction concerning his upbringing. After the Angel of the Lord departs, Manoah requests that He return again and give further instructions. He appears to his wife in a field and she runs and gets Manoah. Manoah asks the angel of the LORD for His name. The answer Manoah gets is, &ldquo;Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?&rdquo; The angel of the Lord disappears in the flames of the sacrifice they offered and appeared to them no more. Manoah declares, &ldquo;We shall surely die, because we have seen God.&rdquo; The Angel of the LORD is an Old Testament Theophany or appearance of Christ.</span></p></body>
