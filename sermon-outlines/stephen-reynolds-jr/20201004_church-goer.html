		<h1>Church Goer</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>There is an interruption to business as usual. Widespread sicknesses as resulted in a change in the usual pattern, but gives a moment to consider how values and our habits.</p>

		<blockquote>Hebrews 10:25 &mdash; Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</blockquote>

			<li>Playing Church</li>
			<li>THE Church</li>
			<li>Origin of Church Practices</li>
			<li>Church Goer (origin 1680's) A person who goes to church regularly. Used often by people who want to cast a disparaging remark about people who attend church. </li>
			<li>~50% Americans are Church Members (down from 70% in 1999)[larger percentange of people answer 'no religion' 8% to 19% BUT still has fallen 9% among those who say they are religious] 42% of millenials vs. 62% prev. generation (33% of ages 21-29 answer 'no religion')</li>
			<li>BELONGING: nondenominational Christians are less likely to belong to a church (57%) than Americans who identify with a specific Protestant denomination (70%).</li>
			<li>Although the rate at which Protestants attend church has held firm over the past six decades, the percentage of Americans identifying as Protestant has declined sharply, from 71% in 1955 to 47% in the mid-2010s.</li>
			<li>Why Would I attend church? - historically a place of education -comfort -direction</li>
			<li>Why Wouldn't I attend church? stigma -civil disobedience now -no curiousity,know it all already (the available of so much information from the convenience of a phone in our hand fools us into the thinking sometimes that hearing about something is somehow equal to EXPERIENCING SOMETHING - fear What are you afraid of? - not a safeplace anymore "sanctuary" (R.Catholic.)</li>
			<li>Why Together? CAn't I know God in a solitary way? Part of the answer is in our text: </li>

			<blockquote>Hebrews 10:19 &mdash; Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,  20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 21 And having an high priest over the house of God; 22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: 25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</blockquote>
