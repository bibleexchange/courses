This word is derived from the Gr. trias, first used by Theophilus (A.D. 168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas, first used by Tertullian (A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The propositions involved in the doctrine are these: </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs35E7652B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That God is one, and that there is but one God (De 6:4; 1Ki 8:60; Isa 44:6; Mr 12:29,32; Joh 10:30).</span></li><li class="cs35E7652B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That the Father is a distinct divine Person (hypostasis, subsistentia, persona, suppositum intellectuale), distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit. </span></li><li class="cs35E7652B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That Jesus Christ was truly God, and yet was a Person distinct from the Father and the Holy Spirit. 4. That the Holy Spirit is also a distinct divine Person.</span></li></ol>

(i.e., this is not a turkey but is a picture of a &nbsp;turkey) God in his fullness cannot be understood by the carnal mind. Never is right to lower God inorder for man to grasp Him. Only is is proper to reach forth to the invisible in faith and by faith laying hold of truth throught the revelation of the Spriti. IN this method God is not lowered, but man&rsquo;s understanding is enlightened and elevated. His vastness, his greatness, and His depth are not even attempted to be fully defined in this paper. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Is the doctrine of the Trinity paramount or of significant importance to divide over? The danger in rejecting the understanding of a triune God is in denying the Father or the Son. I John 2:22-24. It is an antichrist spirit which denies the deity of Christ. From eternity to eternity is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.

One begins in error when approaching Scripture with an opinion to prove right. The proper approach to Scripture is made with a mind to understand &ldquo;What saith the Scripture?&rdquo; What does it have to say for itself? For truth? For God? We would be safeguarded from the majority of error if we studied and learned truth in this manner. Do not attempt to prove God is one or God is three, by findind verses that prove your point, but clear the slate of your mind and allow the Spirit of God to open the Scripture to you and allow the Word to be your opinion. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A second error we often make is to declare we understand it all, when in reality we understand only part. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">My faith isn&rsquo;t in how I can explain truth or in the particular sentence regarding truth I may formulate, but my faith is wholly placed in the inerrant Word of God and that it is complete whereas my understanding is progressive and limited.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">What does the Scripture say about the essence of God?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="csB3CD4B93"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John 4:24 	God is a Spirit and they that worship Him, must worship Him in Spirit and in Truth</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB3CD4B93"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Luke 24:39	Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB3CD4B93"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John 1:18	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csB3CD4B93"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I John 4:12	No man hath seen God at any time.
