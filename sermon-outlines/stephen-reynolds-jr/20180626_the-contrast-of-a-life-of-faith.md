# The Life of Faith vs. the Life of Faithlessness

> Romans 1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

## Introduction

- So you are not convinced to dive in and give your life to Jesus?
- Are you UNCOMMITTED to God? On the fence?
- Have you considered what a life without Faith in God actually looks like?

Constrasting the life of faith and a life without faith.

What do you believe?
- "nothing."
- "i don't know"

Living a religious life is not the same as living by FAITH.

## What Does a Life Without Faith Look Like?

Loren Eiseley:&hellip;

"Man is the Cosmic Orphan. He is the only creature in the universe who asks, "Why?" Other animals have instincts to guide them, but man has learned to ask questions. "Who am I?" man asks. "Why am I here? Where am I going?" Since the Enlightenment, when **he threw off the shackles of religion**, man has tried to answer these questions without reference to God. But **the answers that came back were not exhilarating, but dark and terrible**. 

- "You are the accidental by-product of nature, a result of matter plus time plus chance. 
- There is no reason for your existence. 
- All you face is death."

Life without God, that is Faith in God, leads only to a grave. (wicked and good alike)

> DEFINITION "absurd": wildly unreasonable, illogical, or inappropriate, preposterous.

Life without Faith in God, concludes with death. No matter what happens in the mean time, eventually you will cease to exist.

We are prisoners who await our execution. 
Having no higher purpose, significance or value.

Advances in sciences like medicine&hellip;no permanent value because the universe is DOOMED. Life is absurd. We work and sacrifice to accomplish things that will not deter the outcome -- and ever expanding universe that will eventually just cease to exist with no memory or proof it had ever existed.

A life without faith in God, cannot meaningfully answer our greatest questions: Why Am I here? What is the Meaning and purpose of my life? AT best we can agree to a level of "SELF DELUSION"&hellip;let's PRETEND it all has meaning (evening though we know it doesn't) and fool ourselves.

> "in killing God, man has also killed himself"

Sin is a hard taskmaster!



## What Does the Life of Faith Look Like?

Biblical Christianity therefore provides the two conditions necessary for a meaningful, valuable, and purposeful life for man: God and immortality. Because of this, we can live consistently and happily.

Hebrews 11:

1. v.4 Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice

**The favor of God is what gives any WORK permanent value.**

2. v.5 Enoch was translated

**How horrible the world is&hellip; Enoch escaped it even bypassing the grave by faith.**

3. v.7 Noah Prepared an Ark and Became heir of Righteousness

**In the face of bad NEWS, there's always a PLAN and therefor a DESIGNER.**

> **Romans 8:28** And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

4. v.8 Abraham journeyed not knowing where to

By faith we access to an eternal strength to move forward even into the unknown with CONFIDENCE.

**ILLUSTRATION POEM:**

Each anxious, puzzled "Why?" 
From doubt or dread that grows, 
Finds answer in this thought; 
I know not, but He knows.

by Annie Johnson Flint

5. v.9 Abraham sojourned in the Land of Promise
6. v.17 Abraham offered Isaac
