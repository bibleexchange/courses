<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="70" data-line-end="71">(From a nineteen minute sermon delivered in 2015 by Scotland minister, Scott McKenna, to his Edinburgh congregation.) His subject was the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. He began with a question posed to him by a university student:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72">“Do you believe that Jesus died for your sins? Was not Christ’s death a part of God’s plan of salvation?”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="72" data-line-end="73">“With grace I said to her, “No, No, No! That’s ghastly theology. Don’t go there; you don’t want to go there.”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74">there were reasons why the student would have thought such a thing. It is an idea found everywhere in the church: in theology, in liturgy, in sermons, and in hymns. He then illustrated the standard Christian conception from the hymns</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="74" data-line-end="75">“In my view this theology is an <strong>obstacle to evangelism</strong> in the 21st century.”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="78">Christ dying in our place, suffering the penalty of our sins …  “it is well past sell-by date and in some respects quite immoral.”<br>
“It is time to depart from, to ditch this substitutionary atonement,”<br>
-“Substitutionary atonement makes sin, forgiveness, and entrance into the afterlife the center of faith, but what matters is our transformation,”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="78" data-line-end="79">“Jesus never called on his followers to believe in him as God.”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="79" data-line-end="80">“Christianity needs to let go of its crazy search for the original meaning [of the Bible] and let the Spirit speak now.”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="80" data-line-end="82">“We must discard outdated theology, though some of the hymns are fun to sing.”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="82" data-line-end="83">1Co 15:3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="84" data-line-end="86">Our problem was our sin and God’s solution to our problem was to deliver us from our sin, both its guilt and its power, through the death of Jesus Christ his Son.</li>
