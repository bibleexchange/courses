Affections 
What is a natural affection? (out of NATURE)

a - negative; stargo - to cherish affectionately; "without affection for kindred"

True Love

The Fire of Love

Lusts must be crucified - Gal 5:24

> Ga 5:24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.

> Ro 1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

 >Pr 6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
 
> Song 8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love [is] strong as death; jealousy [is] cruel as the grave: the coals thereof [are] coals of fire, [which hath a] most vehement flame.

>SOS 1:14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.

camphire is henna.

The "hennah" is meant, whose odorous flowers grow in clusters, of a color white and yellow softly blended; its bark is dark, the foliage light green. Women deck their persons with them. The loveliness of Jesus Christ

Rashi, a Jewish scholar from 11th c France, interpreted this passage that the clusters of henna flowers were a metaphor for forgiveness and absolution, showing that God forgave those who tested Him (the Beloved) in the desert.  

Henna was grown as a hedgerow around vineyards to hold soil against wind erosion in Israel as it was in other countries.  A henna hedge with dense thorny branches  protected a vulnerable, valuable crop such as a vineyard from hungry animals.  The hedge, which protected and defended the vineyard, also had clusters of fragrant flowers.  This would imply a metaphor for henna of a "beloved", who defends, shelters, and delights his lover.  In the first millennium BCE, in Canaanite Israel, henna was closely associated with human sexuality and love, and the divine coupling of goddess and consort.

The Roman soldiers garrisoned in Jerusalem during the first century CE commented that henna blossoming time was the best time to visit the poorer quarters, as the flowers' scent masked the usual stenches.

##engedi belonged to the tribe of judah

 Engedi; a fountain on the western shore of the Dead sea, where were gardens in ancient times.  1Sa 24:1

What does He mean to you?

> Joh 21:15 ¶ So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. 16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. (Only Jesus can do surgery on a man's heart like this.)
-Peter Had Denied Christ Three Times. Now given three times to express his love. (Triple Confession.)
-Thou Knowest -- Peter's failure was proof Christ understood his heart better than he did.

###Restored By Love (Lovest Thou Me? Feed My Sheep Restored to His Apostleship. Renewal of HIs Call and Reestablishment in his position. Peter had stepped OUT of the will of God.)

-God's Forgiveness is a covering and not a pedastal. 
The message of forgiveness is firstly, for the forgiver.??????? Christ's special attention to peter is not proof of his papalship. 

"JESUS WAS TO EASY ON PETER"....The goal was to prevent future repeat of Peter's failure and It worked.

###Labor of love - It is not to you to make them love you, but for you to care for them. (Feed My Sheep)

2 times Jesus uses (agapao) and the third time (phileo)
-To love affectionately, ardently, supremely, perfectly
	-phileo Christ challenges Peter's own Confession
	-Do You love me PERFECTLY? (2 x's) FAILURE
	-Do You love me DEARLY? (1 x) RESTORATION

Peter uses (phileo) all three times
-to love, to like, to regard, to feel friendship for another
	- Peter takes the lower seat and appeals to the omniscience of Christ (before he took the high seat)

1 time (to feed my lambs) and twice (to tend a flock, take care of, guide, govern --my sheep) I John 5:2 <<>As this is what Christ is doing for Peter even now. Provider for the young and Leader for the mature. Doing FOR the young and EXAMPLING for the mature.>

34 years later Peter was crucified.

After 3 Times: You are to me and to my work as nothing happened. For Christ Forgiven and Forgotten. (ie, the father with the prodigal. The son offered confession, the father offered covering and honor--not for his folly but for his REBIRTH--Lu 15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

Peter's Father was Jonas. Reminded him of his natural standing and having not natural claim to the honorable position with Christ.

MORE THAN THESE:

1) The Fish - earthly employment (but seems so out of sync with where Peter is at. He is not fishing because he lOVES to fish, he has slidden back and lost his connection with Christ.)

2) The Apostles (He had previously and so confidently boasted though every one else deny Christ He would not. He loved Christ Most. Matthew 26:33)

v.15 "thou knowest" - a humbled soul, no comparison with others here, instead a request for Christ's inspection of His Love

Lu 7:47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.

forgiven not because she wept much, but loved much.
