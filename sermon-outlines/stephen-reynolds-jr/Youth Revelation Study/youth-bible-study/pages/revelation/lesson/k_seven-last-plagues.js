<h1>O. 7 Last Plagues in Vials [15-16]</h1>

<p>Development of Final Judgment (Ch. 15)</p>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:5-8&mdash;And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 6 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction &quot;Another Sign&quot; (15:1)</h2>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:1&mdash;And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</blockquote>

<h3>The Time of the Sign</h3>

<p>The harvest of the grain and the vintage in Chapter 14, brings us to the end of this present age. So, the events in chapter 15 occur before or during the harvest.</p>

<h3>The Message of the Sign</h3>
<p>John sees another sign in Heaven. This is a &quot;sign&quot; just as in Revelation 12 John saw two signs: 1) The Sun-clothed Woman and 2) The Great Red Dragon. It with relevance to these that he calls this &quot;<u>another</u> sign&quot;.</p> 

<p>John uses the Greek word &quot;semeion&quot; in seven verses (12:1,3; 13:13,14; 15:1; 16:14; 19:20). &quot;Semeion&quot; means <i>a symbol or miraculous wonder</i>. The sign John sees here is a &quot;symbolic miracle or wonder&quot; Wonders and miracles are supernatural acts that prove a point or express a message. According to John 10:38, Jesus used miracles to communicate the message that He is God. </p>

<p>John does in fact see something, but as a sign, what John sees should be interpreted figuratively. John sees a wonder and the wonder with its details communicate a message. The detailed wonder John sees is symbolic, but the death and devastation it speaks of is very literal. Signs of healing accompany the preaching of the Gospel (Mark 16:17; 1 Corinthians 14:22); however, signs of death attend the end of the world.</p>

<h3>The Characteristics of the Sign</h3>

<p>John characterizes what he sees not only as a &quot;sign&quot;, but as &quot;great and marvellous&quot;. Respectively, these words are: </p>

<ul>
	<li>megas&mdash; large, mighty, strong (Matthew 8:24)</li>
	<li>thaumastos&mdash; wonderful, marvellous (1 Peter 2:9)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is <b>great</b> because it involves so much more in range and intensity than any catastrophe that has ever been. It is <b>marvellous</b> because of the unparalleled character of what it foretells. What it describes is altogether extraordinary and on an astounding scale.</p>

<h2>Tribulation Victors (15:2-4) </h2>

<p>Before giving the particulars of this great and marvellous sign, John interjects with another vision of a higher and more gracious order, though it is still connected with the outpouring of the plagues. When the wicked are cut off, the righteous will see it. When the plagues fall upon the anti-christ and his hosts, these victors are on high singing, harping and praising God, giving glory to God and to the Lamb!</p>

<h3>Their Position &mdash; The Sea of Glass</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:2&mdash;&hellip;a sea of glass mingled with fire&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>This reminds of the sea of glass in Revelation 4:6 which was spread out before the throne. There is a difference between these two verses. In Chapter 4, the sea of glass was &quot; like unto crystal&quot; in clearness, but in Chapter 15, the sea of glass is mingled with fire. Also, in Chapter 4, the sea appeared to be part of the pavement of heaven, but in Chapter 15, it appears as a mighty reservoir of just judgements about to be poured upon the world. The crystal sea is sort of base on which the whole celestial city is established&mdash;purity, vastness, strength. The sea mingled with fire is a sea of just judgements.</p>

<h3>Their Victory</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:2&mdash;&hellip;them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</blockquote>

<p>These will have complete victory over the beast (The Person), his image (The Doctrines), his mark (The System), and the number of his name (The Society). Their reward for victory is a position on the sea of glass in heaven, having harps and singing praises to God.</p>

<h3>Their Song</h3>

<p>Their song is an exultant testimony of God as victor.</p>

<h4>The Song of Moses</h4>

<p>We find Moses&apos; song in Exodus 15:1-11. It is a song celebrating deliverance from Egypt and the destruction of Pharaoh's host by God. The Book of Wisdom says that on this occasion in Exodus 15:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">God opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of infants eloquent</blockquote>

<p>As the Hebrews sang rejoicing by the Red Sea, so the Victorious Redeemed will sing by the Sea of Glass mingled with fire. God and therefore his saints will always have the last word!</p>

<h4>The Song of the Lamb</h4>

<p>The Song of the Lamb is redemption&apos;s song! ("I am Redeemed", "Thank God I am Free (saved, saved, saved)", "I've been to Calvary", etc. Here is recorded at least a part of their song.</p>

<blockquote>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</blockquote>

<h2>Seven Angels (vs. 5-6)</h2>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:5&mdash;&hellip;the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</blockquote>

<p>This tabernacle is in Heaven. The old tabernacle was merely a pattern of things in heaven (Hebrews 8:1-5; 9:23). The &quot;temple of the tabernacle&quot; references the inner tabernacle&mdash;the Most Holy Place or Holiest of All. It was in this tabernacle of testimony the Ark of the Testimony was kept. Therefore, these angels come from out of the Most Holy Place of Heaven&mdash;the throne of God was opened.</p>

<p>The angels are clothed in pure and white linen which speaks of righteousness. More important than their personal righteousness is the righteousness and holiness of the ministry these angels were to perform. As the priests ministered in the tabernacle in linen, speaking of Christ's righteousness and the ministry that they were performing, so these angels have a ministry.</p>

<p>They were girded with golden girdles. Gold speaks of Divinity and girdles speak of the truth.</p>

<blockquote>Revelation 1:13&mdash;And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</blockquote>

<p>Old Testament priest were girt with a girdle of a different material because it spoke of redemption, but the girdle here is of gold and the setting of Divine wrath. These priest-like angels have an administration of pouring out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>

<h2>The Giving of the Vials (vs. 7,8)</h2>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:7&mdash;And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</blockquote>

<p>Notice the mission of the Church in the judgement. One of the four beasts (a part of the church) gives the seven angels the seven golden vials full of the wrath of God.</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:2-3&mdash;Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</blockquote>

<p>Two other times scripture says the temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God was in 1 Kings 8:10,11 and Isaiah 6:1-4. &quot;No man was able to enter into the temple&quot;.</p>

<h1>Seven Last Plagues (Ch. 16)</h1>
<blockquote>Revelation 15:1&mdash;&hellip;in them is filled up the wrath of God.</blockquote>
<h2>Is This Prophecy Already Fulfilled?</h2>
<p>Some interpreters try to parallel these vials with definitive and mostly historical calamities:</p>
<ol>
	<li>FIRST: French Revolution in General</li>
	<li>SECOND: Naval Wars of the French Revolution</li>
	<li>THIRD: Battles of Napoleon in Italy</li>
	<li>FOURTH: Tyranny of Napoleon</li>
	<li>FIFTH: calamities which befell the city of Rome and the Pope in consequences of the French Revolution</li>
	<li>SIXTH: The wane of Turkish power and return of the Jews to Palestine along with the subtle influences of infidelity and popery.</li>
	<li>SEVENTH: Some further war with Romanism and disaster to the city of Rome.</li>
</ol>
<p>This line of interpretation leaves many difficult questions. Are France and Italy the whole earth? Has the tribulation hour even come yet? Are half a dozen naval battles the turning of the ocean into blood? Was Napoleon's artillery the sun scorch of blasphemers?</p>
<h2>What are these Vials?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 16:1&mdash;And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Vial&quot; is the Greek word &quot;phiale&quot; meaning a broad shallow cup. Phiale is used 12 times in the N.T. and all occurrences can be found in the book of Revelation.</p>
<ul>
<li>5:8 Vials full of prayers of the saints</li>
<li>15:7; 16; 17:1; 21:9 Seven Golden Vials full of the wrath of God</li>
</ul>
<p>The seven vials are full of the wrath of God. These seven vials are seven definitive and final judgments. (Revelation 15:1; 21:9 &quot; seven last plagues&quot;)</p>
<p>These plagues are not historical, but are the consummation of all plagues. The last will be the worst. The plagues of Egypt and other historical calamities are a mere rehearsal of that to come.</p>
<p>In the following actions, God&apos;s wrath is completely expressed. It climaxes and is ended. Not only does John describe these as the &quot;last&quot; plagues, but they are also seven in number which expresses completeness. By the time these seven plagues are accomplished, God&apos;s wrath upon the earth will be completed or satisfied.</p>
<p>The command to execute the plagues comes not just from the temple in general, but from out of the opened Holy of Holies in the temple of God in heaven (15:5; 16:1). In the Holy of Holies was kept the Ark which contained (Hebrews 9:3,4) a golden pot of manna, Aaron&apos;s rod that budded and two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. It is because of the Ark and its contents that this place is called &quot;the tabernacle of the testimony&quot; They were evidences or witnesses to the fact that the presence God was among his people.</p>
<p>As there are levels in the American Judicial system (District Court, Superior Court and Supreme Court) so, the fact that the Holiest place of the temple is involved speaks of an advanced judgment. this is it! There is no higher court or further level of appeal.</p>
<h2>What Events Lead Up to These Final Judgments?</h2>
<p>The order of these events are highlighted in the sequence we have found them in the scripture. As many of the events in chapters overlap others and some give further detail to events already discussed, this summary is not an attempt to create a chronological &quot;timeline&amp;quot. Following is a review of the truths as we discover them in reading through the Book of Revelation.</p>
<h3>Inspection, Remedy, Reward (Ch. 1-4)</h3>
<p>Christ made inspection and sent messages to His Church. Saints make corrections according to the Lord's warnings. Some hear and repent making themselves ready and others are spewed out of his mouth into 3 1/2 years of tribulation and awakening. Translated and Raptured believers are both seen around the throne of God.</p>
<h3>Seven Seals of a Book of Judgment Have Been Opened (Ch. 5 through 8:1)</h3>
<p>The Lamb of God was the only one worthy to open the Book and release its seals. These seals revealed calamities that are part of God's plan of judgment and not just the normal course of history. White, Red, Black and Pale Horses and their horseman revealed a moral war, Divine vengeance, famine, and a fourth part of the world dead. The Fifth Seal revealed the fact that the Tribulation Hour will involve many Christian martyrs. The Sixth Seal reveals fearful physical events&mdash;sun become black, moon became as blood, and stars fall. Finally, a silence falls over Heaven for one hour. </p>
<h3>Seven Trumpets Have Sounded (Ch. 8 through 11)</h3>
<p>Following the silence in Heaven, a Mystery Angel remembered the death of the martyrs. Seven other Angels then prepared to sound their trumpets. Not all at once, but one after another in increasing judgment their trumpets are sounded as the death of saints are a witness against the world. Since the servants of God now had been sealed (Ch. 7) the prohibition to not hurt the earth (7:3) is lifted. </p>
<h4>One, Two, Three, Four</h4>
<p>In the first four trumpets the blasts effected the material world: hail and fire mingled with blood devastate trees, grass and crops; a third part of the sea is made blood and a third both of its creatures and ships are destroyed; a third of the waters become poisonous (Wormwood); a third of the sun and moon and a third of the stars were darkened. </p>
<h4>Five, Six</h4>
<p>The door between the physical and spiritual worlds is opened: tormenting locusts are released from the bottomless pit; four bound fallen angels are released from the river Euphrates. </p>
<p>A Cloud Robed Angel declared possession of the earth and its people, proclaimed victory and held a scroll that revealed further bitter experiences to follow. The temple was measured for the reinstatement of the Jew. Two witnesses miraculously ministered and then were killed once their work was complete.</p>
<h4>Seven: The Coming of the Lord</h4>
<h3>Pre-Tribulation, Tribulation and Great Tribulation (Ch. 12 &amp; 13)</h3>
<p>John saw (Ch. 12) the signs of the Sun-clothed Woman, the Man Child, the Great Red Dragon, the War in Heaven, And the War with the Remnant of the Seed of the Woman. The eventual Period of Great Tribulation and the Rule of the Antichrist (Ch. 13) set the stage for these Seven Vials.</p>
<h2>The Results of the 7 Vials</h2>
<h3>ONE: The Followers of the Anti-christ, 16:2</h3>
<p>They will face noisome and grievous sores (Luke 16:20). These ulcers and stinging sores will be incurable.</p>
<h3>TWO: The Sea, vs. 3</h3>
<h3>THREE: The Rivers, vs. 4-7</h3>
<h3>FOUR: The Suns Heat Released, vs. 8-9</h3>
<h3>FIVE: The Throne of the Beast, vs. 10-11</h3>
<h3>SIX: The Gathering of the Nations (Armageddon, vs. 12-16)</h3>
<h3>SEVEN: The Judgment of the Nations, vs. 17-21</h3>
