<h1 id="I">I. Angels and 7 Trumpets [8:2-13; 9-10; 11:14-19]</h1>


{/*<!-- Angels fix numbering -->*/}

<h1>A Vision of Angels (8:2-5)</h1>

<h2>The Seven Angels, vs. 2</h2>

<p>They "stood before God" and are in harmony with his will and work. They are God&apos;s ministers and are in obedient submission to His will. They stand ready to do as He decrees and bear God&apos;s authority as His servants.</p>

<h3>They Are of Particular Rank and Distinction.</h3>
<p>They are of a Divine Order of angels. Angelic beings are not of one and the same grade or office.</p>

<h4>The Sons of God, in general, came before Him only at appointed times. Job 1:6;</h4> 
<h4>Yet, Jesus spake of some angels who "do always behold the face of their Father which is in heaven." Matt. 18:10.</h4>
<h4>In Colossians 1:16, Paul lists &quot;dominions, principalities, and powers&quot; as being among the celestial orders. </h4>
<h4>Daniel 10:13 speaks of some chief princes.</h4>
<h4>1 Thessalonians 4:16 and Jude 9 refer to arch angels.</h4> 

<h3>They Are Seven in Number.</h3>
<p>The Jews were familiar with seven angels of Divine Order by the names: 1) Gabriel, as he said to Zacharias; "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God." 2) In Luke 1:19 Michael is another, as he is ranked with Gabriel in the book of Daniel. In the book of Enoch, these are the names of the angels who watch: 3) Uriel, 4) Raphael, 5) Raguel, 6) Michael, 7) Sarakiel</p>

<h3>They Are Servants.</h3>
<p>They are standing. This is the position of service. The twenty-four elders are going to be sitting. The sitting position speaks of the dominion and rule of the heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.</p>
<p>Yet &quot;standing in the presence of God&quot; is to be above all other servants. In Esther 1:4, The 7 Persian princes who &quot;saw the kings face&quot;, were the highest officers of the realm, and next to the monarch in rank and power.</p>

<h3>They Were Given Seven Trumpets.</h3>
<h4>Trumpets are expressive instruments and God gave special directions in the use of the trumpet. The word &quot;trumpet&quot; can be found in 61 verses of the Bible. (Exodus 19:13; Levitucs 25:9; Psalm 47:5)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are an emblem of war. (Numbers 10:9; Jeremiah 4:19)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets were for the convocation of the people, and the moving of the camps of Israel. (Numbers 8)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets proclaimed the great festivals. (Numbers 10:10; Leviticus 23:24; 25:9; 2 Chronicles 29:27)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are used to announce royalty. (1 Kings 1:34,39; 2 Kings 9:13)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are associated with the majesty of God. (Ex. 19:16)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets were used in the overthrow of the ungodly. (Josh. 6:13-16)</h4>

<h2>The Mystery Angel, vs. 3-5</h2>
<p>John sees seven angels &quot;which stood before God&quot; and then he mentions &quot;another&quot; angel. Who is this &quot;angel&quot;?</p>

<h3>The Nature of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;Another&quot; (allos) means different. This same phrase is used in Revelation 7:2; 10:14-17; 18:1; 20:1. The word "angel" means messenger of God.</p>

<h3>The Office of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>
<p>This &quot;angel&quot; is the Angel of the Lord. He offers the prayers of saints. You cannot give something unless you have it. He had to receive them to give them. Angels do not receive worship, but &quot;the Angel of the Lord&quot; does. (Gen. 16:7,13; Ex. 3:2-5; Joshua 5:13-15).
</p>
<p>There are many passages in which the expression the &quot;angel of God&quot; or &quot;angel of the Lord&quot; is definitely for a manifestation of God Himself. Compare Genesis 22:11-12; 22:15-19; Exodus 3:2-6.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of The Angel</h3>
<p>Scripture itself presents us with details that tell us that this Angel is the Lord:</p>

<h4>The First Proof - He had &quot;a Golden censer&quot;</h4>
<img src='/images/censer.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>
<p>This instrument was used by the priests, in the ministry of the worship of God. However, it was used only by the high priest in the holy place. This indicating our great High Priest who is now entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. We remember that that this is a scene in Heaven.</p>

<h4>The Second Proof -He offers the Prayers of Saints before God.</h4>
<img src='/images/prayers.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>
<p>vs. 3 &quot;All Saints&quot;. There is no record of such an office found in the scripture as being assigned to angels, however, there is record of this office being executed by the Lord Jesus. Eph. 2:18 I Tim. 2:5 Heb. 7:25; Heb. 13:15 I Peter 2:5 I John 2:1;</p>

<h4>The Third Proof - He casts fire on the earth.</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/fire.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>
<p>Verse 5 tells us the fire is taken from the altar.</p>
<blockquote>Luke 12:49 -- I [Jesus] came to send fire upon the earth. </blockquote> 
<p>This fire is a symbol of the Divine Presence and Power. (Exodus 3:2 Deuteronomy 4:36 Psalm 50:3 97:3; Isaiah 66:15-16; Acts 2:3) </p>
<p>This fire is an Instrument of Divine Judgment. The action indicated here by the casting into the earth speaks of judgment. (Genesis 19:24; Leviticus 10:2; Numbers 11:1; 16:35; Malachi 4:1; 2 Kings 1:10; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 2 Peter 3:10)</p>

<h4>The Fourth Proof - To offer incense with prayers. vs. 3-4</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/cross.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>
<p>&quot;Given unto Him much Incense.&quot;It was given to Him through merit. For without His death and atoning work coupled with His pure and Holy life, there would be no force in prayer. God hears us because of Him. </p>

<p>The Compounding of the incense is given with great precision in the Old Testament. It was to be made of specific ingredients in exact proportion (Exodus 30:34). Any compound that did not meet the exact specifications given by God was to be rejected as strange incense (Exodus 30:9). It was to be tempered with salt as it was holy and was never to be used for ordinary purposes. Any one who tried to duplicate this incense for themselves was to be cut off from his people (Exodus 30:38).</p>

<h3>The Events Related To the Angel&apos;s Actions. vs. 5</h3>
<p>Notice carefully the order:</p>
<h4>Flash of Light - The Release</h4>
<h4>The Thundering Voice - The Messenger</h4>
<h4>The Shaking of the Earth - The Results</h4>

<h1>Introduction to The Seven Trumpets (8:6-11:19)</h1>
<p>We are looking at the final blasts of judgment upon a wicked and rebellious world.</p>

<h2>The Martyrs are Remembered</h2>
<p>The seventh and final seal has been broken from the Sealed Book (8:1). The prayers of all the saints have been accepted before God (8:3,4). Remember now,God has promised to avenge the martyred saints.
</p>
	<blockquote>Revelation 6:9-11 -- And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Matthew 18:6-7 -- But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</blockquote>
	
	<p>These martyred Believers are an important part of the judgments of God on the earth. It is not that the world has rejected these saints so much as they have rejected Christ.</p>

<blockquote>I Samuel 8:7 -- And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luke 10:16 -- He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</blockquote>

<p>Every Christian martyr is a testimony to the grace of God and a witness against this sinful world. The Greek word &quot;martus&quot; (martyr) means a witness or record. (see Matthew 18:16; Mark 14:63; Luke 24:48; Acts 1:8,22; 2:32; Hebrews 12:1; I Peter 5:1; Revelation 1:5.)</p>

<blockquote>Luke 24:46-48 -- And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48 And ye are witnesses of these things.</blockquote>

<h2>The Trumpets of Judgment Are Sounded</h2>

 <p>Time has now come for the final judgments.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 8:6 -- And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</blockquote> 

<p>Not all seven were to sound at once, but varied events followed each trumpet as it was sounded. God has prearranged the order and time for each to sound. There are none that are alike but there is a progression of greater judgment with each trumpet.</p>

<h1>The Sounding of Trumpets One, Two, Three and Four</h1>

<h2>The Sounding of The First Trumpet. Vs.7.</h2>
<h3>The nature of the judgment.</h3>
<p>"Hail and Fire mingled with blood." Micah 7:15; Jer. 23:7-8.
They were like the plagues of Egypt. Ex. 9:23-28; Joel 2:30.
"Hail" "Fire""Blood"Could it be the Blood that they rejected, will judge them.</p>
<h3>The Action of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>"They will cast upon the earth" "Ballo" cast; to throw; hurl (a violent or intense action).</p>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>The third part of threes was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.Every field and meadow stripped of its growing crops, and bloody and putrid blackness spread over all the world. This has somewhat of a correspondence to an earlier stage, under the sixth seal. Not to hurt earth, the sea, nor the trees, till the servants of God were sealed. The sealing now has been accomplished, the prohibition is lifted. (Revelation 7:3)</p>

<h2>The Sounding of the Second Trumpet. Vs. 8-9.</h2>
<h3>The Nature of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>Like a burning mountain " As it were a great mountain burning with fire." It looked like a burning mountain. It is not literally a mountain/volcano, but the image of a meteor.</p>
<h3>The Place of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>The Sea is the place of this plunging mass. "Was cast into the sea: " It would seem as if some particular sea was meant. If so, what sea? The Mediterranean Sea, which means the midland sea, or the middle of the earth. Around this sea the greatest recorded events of the world and of the Church have been enacted, and which is the central sea of all history, both sacred and profane.</p>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<h4>"The third part of the sea became blood."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life died."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the ships were destroyed." Burned, sunk, or dash ashore. Ex. 7:20; Psa. 78:44; 105:29; Hosea 4:1-3; Zeph. 1:3; Isa. 2;12-1###Here John sees the fulfillment of these predictions.</h4>

<h2>The Sounding of the Third Trumpet, Vs. 10-11.</h2>
<h3>The nature of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>"There fell a great star from heaven," - This star falls out of heaven. "Burning as it were a lamp." "Torch," - This star has a name. The Name of the star, vs 1 "The star is called wormwood""Wormwood" -"Absinthe " is a bitter; intoxicating, and poisonous herb. It produces convulsions, paralysis, and death.</p>
<h3>The Place of the Judgment. vs. 10</h3>
<p>"It fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. " Jer.9:13-15.</p>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<h4>vs. 11 "The'third part of the waters became wormwood. "</h4>
<h4>"Many men died of the waters."</h4>
<h4>"Because they were made bitter" - "Poisonous "</h4>

<h2>The Sounding of The Fourth Trumpet, vs. 12 -13.</h2>
<p>It doesn't say what it is - it only says what it effects and what those effects were.</p>
<h3>The Place of The Judgment vs. 12.</h3>
<h4>"The third part of the Sun was smitten ."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the Moon."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the Stars."</h4>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<h4>"The third part of them were darkened."</h4>
<h4>"The day shone not for a third part of it."</h4>
<h4>"The night likewise.</h4>
<p>Isa. 13:9-11; Eze. 32:7-8; Joel 2:10,30-31; 3:15; Zeph. 1: 14-16; Matt. 24: 29; Luke 21: 25.</p>
<h3>The Announcement of Greater Judgment, vs. 13.</h3>
<p>Is a .pre-announcement of the general character of what is to come, a fore warning of greater judgment to come.</p>
<h4>A Flying Messenger - "An angel flying through the midst of heaven."</h4>
<h4>Proclaiming with a loud voice: "Saying with a loud voice"</h4>
<h4>Terrible Judgments, "Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth."</h4>


<h1>The Sounding of The Fifth Trumpet - Rev. 9:1-11</h1>
<p>The fifth trumpet is different in character from the preceding four. All are blasts of judgment, and all belong to the "Great Day of the Lord." Thus far, the trumpets have blown only for the objects of physical nature, and wrought their effects through disturbances in the material world. But the trumpet now before us goes beyond the physical world and calls into action quite other agencies. The doors of separation between the earth and the prison of evil spirits are opened.</p>
<h2>What the Star Is - vs. 1.</h2>
<p>This is not a meteor for this star is an intelligent agent, he has ascribed to him distinctive characteristics that could not possibly be ascribed to anything but a living being.</p>
<h3>vs. 1 - "To him was given the key"</h3>
<h3>vs. 2 - "He opened the bottomless pit"</h3>
<h3>vs. 3 - "There came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth. "</h3>
<p>We must conclude that this is not a material but a spiritual star.It is a "Fallen Star"</p>
<h2>Who The Star Is - Isa. 14:12.</h2>
<p>Vs. 11 Says the "star" is the king over them, whose name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name "Apollyon"destroyer; devil; Satan.</p>
<h2>The Time of His Fall -</h2>
<p>At the time of the original creation, he fell into the condemnation of the devil. But in Revelations he fell from heaven to Earth. Just prior to the Rapture of the Church, the Devil is cast out. Rev. 12:7-9.</p>
<h2>The Key Given -</h2>
<h3>Key speaks of Power - And authority to use that power. Peter was given the keys to the kingdom the power to open the door of the Gospel. Christ had the keys of death and hell at His side.</h3>
<h3>The key is "given - Cannot go beyond what he is permitted. Evil would override the world.</h3>
<h2>What The Key Is For -</h2>
<p>"The Bottomless Pit." - The Release of the Locusts.</p>
<h2>What The Locusts Are -</h2>
<h3>Their Nature.</h3>
<p>Locusts have no king, Prov. 30:27.
They are supernatural, angelic beings.vs. 11.Jude 6; II Peter 2:4.</p>
<h3>Their Forms -</h3>
<p>"like unto horses"-"like unto men"-"have hair like a woman,"-"have teeth of lions" - " have breastplates of iron," - "have wings, " - "have tails"</p>
<h3>Their Intelligence</h3>
<p>They have a certain amount of intelligence. vs. ###Commands are given to them.</p>
<h3>Their Power -</h3>
<p>Is limited -vs. 4; The extent of their power is to horrify and torment, vs. 5.</p>
<h3>The Duration of their torment, vs. 5 and 10.</h3>

<h1>The Sounding of the Sixth Trumpet - Rev. 9:12-21</h1>
<h2>The Voice of this Judgment.</h2>
<blockquote>"I heard a voice."</blockquote>

<h3>The location of the voice-</h3>
<h4>"From the four horns of the golden altar."</h4>
<p>The place of intercession, prayer, petition and mercy. (Rev. 8:3-5; 1 Kings 1:50-53 )</p>
<h4>"Which is before God."</h4>
<p>This is a Divine judgment. As it comes from the presence of God, it has His sanction.</p>

<h3>Who the Voice Adresses</h3>
<p>"To the sixth angel" - vs. 14 The Sixth Angel sounds and The Voice responds.</p>

<h3>What the Voice was Saying.</h3>
<blockquote>Revelation 9:14 -- &hellip;Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</blockquote>

<h2>The Release of the Angels.</h2>
<h3>The Nature of the Angels.</h3>
<h4>They are fallen and bound angels. (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6)</h4>
<blockquote>2 Peter 2:4 -- For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</blockquote>

<h4>They are high ranking angels. They were over others.</h4>
<blockquote>Ephesians 6:2 -- For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</blockquote>

<h3>The Purpose of the Release.</h3>
<h4>To carry out judgment.</h4>
<p>"To slay the third part of men." vs. 15</p>
<blockquote>Isaiah 4:1 -- And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man&hellip;</blockquote>

<h4>To give men what they desired.</h4>
<p>They worshipped devils - vs. 20. God lets devils destroy them.</p>

<h3>The Time of their Release.</h3>
<p>Prepared for a specific hour, day, month, and year. For example: 9:00 am, 12th day of April 2014.</p>

<h2>The Vision of Horses and Horsemen - vs. 17.</h2>
<blockquote>"I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them."</blockquote>

<h3>Their Number (vs. 16)</h3>
<p>200,000 x 1,000 = 200,000,000. Two hundred million.</p>
<p>To place the size of this host in perspective consider the size of the worlds armies today. In 2013, The top five countries with the largest armies were China (2,285,000), United States of America (1,458,219), India (1,325,000), North Korea (1,106,000), and Russia (1,027,000).</p>

<h3>Their Nature</h3>
<p>These are no ordinary horses, but are executers of these four fallen Angels. These horses fulfill the will of these four fallen Angels and act on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Their Description- vs. 17.</h3>
<h4>"Having Breastplates of Fire." In Ephesians Breastplates of Righteousness -Here breastplates of fire&mdash;a symbol of Judgment</h4>
<h4>"Having breastplates of Jacinth" According to Elliott, the jacinth color, is the dark purple or blue the color of smoke.</h4>
<h4>"Having Breastplates of Brimstone."</h4>
<p>Brimstone is sulphur. A horrible burning.</p>
<h4>"Their heads were as the heads of Lions" - Heads speak of Authority or Rule - Lions speak of Power.</h4>
<h4>"Out of their mouth issued fire and smoke and brimstone." vs. 17.</h4>
<p>"By these three was the third part of men killed"</p>
<h3>The Place of their Power- vs. 19.</h3>
<p>"Their power is in their mouth and in their tails."</p>
<h2>The Condition of the World -</h2>

<h3>Unrepentant - vs. 20.</h3>

<p>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not.</p>


<h3>Worshipers of Demons.</h3>

<p>That they should not worship devils.</p>

<h3>Idolatrous - Idolatry in various forms: Idols of gold, silver, stone and wood.The world Church at this time is still flourishing, however she shall be destroyed by the ten kings that reign with the Anti-christ.</h3>
<h3>Wholesale Murders - vs. 21. Murderers will run Rampant.</h3>

<blockquote>Neither repented they of their murders. [plural].</blockquote>


<h4>Feticide - Abortions - Murder of unborn.</h4>
<h4>Infanticide - Abortions - Murder of new born.</h4>
<h4>Homicide - manslaughter - Murder of h4ving.</h4>
<h4>Suicide - manslaughter - Murder of ones self.</h4>
<h4>Fratricide - manslaughter - Murder of ones brother.</h4>
<h4>Matricide - manslaughter - Murder of ones mother.</h4>
<h4>Parricide - manslaughter - Murder of ones parent.</h4>
<h4>Euthanasia - manslaughter - Murder of the feeble - Mercy kilh4ng.
Murder" -"phonos" - to slay - slaughter.</h4>

<h3>Practice of Sorceries</h3>
<p>Foreseeing or Foretelh3ng of the future events by the aid of evil spirits; witchcraft, magic, enchantments. Impure practices with evil agencies, and particulary with poisonous drugs. "Sorcery" - "pharmakcia" - medication - "pharmacy" - Magic - sorcery -witchcraft -drugs.</p>

<h3>Practice of Fornication</h3>
<p>"Porneia" - Harlotry - adultery - incest
Unlawful lust of either sex.
Homosexuals -Similar tothe word swinish. While fornication is being h3censed by the opinion of Churchmen, God still hates it, and will judge it.</p>

<h3>Practice of Thievery</h3>
<p>"Theffs" - "Klemma" - Kepto - (maniac)Wholesale Robbery.</p>

 <h1>The Cloud-Robed Angel (10:1-11)</h1>
 <img src="/assets/revelation/sun-through-clouds.jpg" id="sun-through-clouds"/> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <blockquote>Revelation 10:1 -- And I saw another mighty angel come
 down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his
 head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars
 of fire:</blockquote>
 <p>The scene of the "Cloud-Robed Angel" is still part of the sixth
 trumpet that began in 9:13. It is not until 11:14 that the sixth
 trumpet (the second woe) is accomplished.</p>
 <h2 style={{clear:"both"}}>The Angel</h2>
 <h3>The Title Suggests Deity. - "another mighty angel"</h3>
 <h4>"another" </h4>
 <p>This Angel is distinct from the other angels mentioned as we have
 seen in Revelation 7:2 and 8:3. We should also note that the
 phrase "another angel" is also used several times in chapter 14
 and once in 18:1, but especially chapter 14 does not seem to give
 the same sense of the exceptionalism of the angel as in the other
 passages.</p>
 <h4>"mighty"</h4>
 <p>&nbsp;John the Revelator uses the title "another angel" in 9
 verses, but "mighty" (ischuros) angel is used only here in 10:1
 and in 18:21 where a mighty angel announces and describes the
 judgment of Babylon the Great. "Ischuros" (greek word) is used in
 7 verses by John and can be found in 25 verses throughout the New
 Testament. It is adjective describing what He is and not what He
 has. He is mighty,&nbsp; powerful,&nbsp; strong and boisterious.
 "Ischuros" can also be used to give a comparative sense: stronger,
 mightier, more powerful. </p>
 <blockquote>Matthew 3:11 -- I indeed baptize you with water unto
 repentance: but he that cometh after me is <b>mightier </b>than
 I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with
 the Holy Ghost, and with fire: </blockquote>
 <blockquote> Mt 12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's
 house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the <b>strong </b> man?
 and then he will spoil his house. </blockquote>
 <blockquote>1 Corinthians 10:22 -- Do we provoke the Lord to
 jealousy? are we <b>stronger </b>than he?</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Hebrews 6:18 -- That by two immutable things, in which
 it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a <b>strong </b>consolation,
 who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</blockquote>
 <h3>The Particulars Suggest Deity</h3>
 <p>Inspection of the particulars of the Angel suggest He is more
 than just "a messenger", but is "The Messenger". More convincing
 of the deity of this angel than His actual title ("another mighty
 angel") is the details of his description.
 </p>
 <h4>"clothed with a cloud"</h4>
 <p>Clothing speaks of Condition (Sinful or Righteous). For examples
 see: 2 Chronicles 6:41; Job 8:22; 29:14; Psalm 35:26; Psalm 104:1.
 In Ezekiel chapter one, the cloud and rainbow was a description of
 the glory of God.</p>
 <blockquote>Ezekiel 1:28 -- As the appearance of the bow that is in
 the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
 brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of
 the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and
 I heard a voice of one that spake.</blockquote>
 <p>Clouds also speak of Mystery (Indicating Deity). For examples
 see: Exodus 24:16;40:34; Lev. 16:2; Matt. 17:5.</p>
 <p>Clouds also speak of Judgment�. As clouds are indicators of a
 storm so the cloud here indicates a storm is coming! The storm is
 the judgments of God.
 </p>
 <h4> "a rainbow was upon His head"</h4>
 <p>The Rainbow is a Covenant Sign. God said in Genesis 9:13 that "I
 do set my bow in the cloud". The presence of this rainbow is sign
 of mercy which appears over the head of Him that is robed "with a
 cloud" which is sign of Judgment. In Judgment God Remembers Mercy!
 
 </p>
 <h4>"His face was as it were the sun"</h4>
 <p>In the first vision - Rev. 1:13-20. Mal. 4: 2 "Sun of Righteousness" Acts 26:13 "Above the brightness of the sun." </p>
 <h4>"His feet as pillars of fire"</h4>
 <p> This is an image of pureness and judgment. It is also an image
 of steadfastness and glorious majesty.
 </p>
 <h4>"And He had in his hand a little book open:"</h4>
 <p>Only ONE had proven worthy to open the book and release its
 seals!</p>
 <blockquote>Revelation 5:5 -- And one of the elders saith unto me,
 Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of
 David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven
 seals thereof.</blockquote>
 
	
	<h2>The Acts of the Angel </h2>
	
 <h3>Taking Possession</h3>
 <p>As described in Deuteronomy 11:24, He is taking possession of the earth and its people. "He set His right foot upon the sea". The sea or water is often people in Scripture (see Rev. 17:1, 15). "And His left foot on the earth". The earth is the place where the people dwell. Who is the world under dominion to now? Under the rule of Satan. (John 12:31; Luke 4:6; II Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2: 2) The Devil is in control
 now, but Jesus is soon to take over. He sets His foot upon the sea, and the land, and takes hold as His own.</p>
 <h3>Proclaiming Victory</h3>
 <p>"Cried with a loud voice," Not the cry of defeat or fear. But of
 POWER, VICTORY and TRIUMPH; John 11:43-44 At the grave of Lazarus.
 Could it be that He is Awakening the Dead? "As when a lion
 roareth." He is known as "The lion of the tribe of Judah" Judah-
 Praise -Victory -shouting in victory. Song writer said -"That
 breaks every chain." Also the Prophet said - "The Lord shall roar
 out of Zion " Jer. 25:29-31</p>
 <h3>Signaling Fulfillment.</h3>
 <p>"lifted up his hand to heaven" vs. 5. a signal of Readiness or
 Victory.</p>
 <blockquote>And sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever&hellip;
 &hellip;that there should be time no longer." vs. 6. </blockquote>
 <p>There should be "No more delay" (Amplified Version). There is
 reason now for delay. II Peter 3:9-10.</p>
 <h2>The Response to the Angel, vs. 3 "and when He had cried"</h2>
 <h3>Indication of (More) Judgment.</h3>
 <p>More severe. "Seven thunders uttered their voices" Seven
 (Complete) Thunders or Judgment.</p>
 <h3>Personality Ascribed.</h3>
 <p>They speak -"Uttered their voices" John was going to write what
 he heard.</p>
 <h3>A Command Given, vs. 4.</h3>
 <p>Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write
 them not.</p>
 <h2>The Scroll in the Angel's Hand, vs. 2a; 8-11.</h2>
 <h3>It is a Revelation, vs. 7.</h3>
 <p>"The mystery of God should be finished (complete, execute,
 conclude) as He hath declared to His servants the prophets."</p>
 <h3>The Nature of the Revelation.</h3>
 <p>It had been a mystery. "He had in His hand a little book." The
 Book mentioned in Rev. 5; No man could open it -no one else.</p>
 <p>It is a mystery that has been solved . "A little book open" The
 mystery that had been hid for ages is now revealed.</p>
 <h3>The Facts Related To The Revelation.</h3>
 <h4>"Go and take the little book". Faith is the factor that receives
 from God. Faith takes hold of truth.</h4>
 <h4>"Which is open" Was closed now opened .</h4>
 <h4>"In the hand of the Angel" In His hand -earned -merited.</h4>
 <p>Based on the merits of Calvary. "a Lamb as it had been slain"
 Chp. 5:6 We can only take the open Book - The Revelation of God -
 from the hand of Christ.</p>
 <h3>The Effects of The Revelation.</h3>
 <h4>"In my mouth sweet as Honey" </h4>
 <blockquote>Psa. 119:103 -- How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
 yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</blockquote>

<h1 id="J">J. Measure the Temple of God [11:1-2]</h1>

<h1>The Reinstating of the Jew (11:1-2)</h1>
<p>This chapter is a continuation of chapter 10. In 10:9, John ate the little book and was told he must prophesy again. In 11:1, John is given a reed. The measuring of the temple takes place during the Judgment of the Sixth Trumpet.</p>

<p>The history of the Jewish people is a message to the church first of warning and then of comfort:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Warning</li>
	<p>The warning is that no one will escape Divine judgment if they take for granted His blessing and count it as their inherent privilege instead of being conditional on a covenant relationship. The Jews so proudly boasted in Jesus' day "we are Abraham's Children" while their hearts were FAR from God (Isaiah 29:13). They backslide from being a covenant people to a people of entitlement.</p>
	
	<li>Comfort</li>
	<p>The comfort is that God is specializes RESTORATIONS! The Jews like an unfruitful branch were cut off and the Gentiles grafted in, but God has always had a mind to restore a repentant Israel. God's prophets have warned both of the dispersion of the Jews and their eventual reinstatement. This reinstatement includes their re-establishment in Palestine, but most importantly includes their restored relationship with God.</p>
</ul>

<h2>The Instrument Given</h2>
<h3>A Reed</h3>
<p>The instrument of judgment given to John is "A Reed" (Kalamos). This is not a "frail reed" as in Matthew 11:7, but is an instrument of measurement as in Isaiah 44:13, Amos 7:7 and Ezekial 40:5.</p>
<p>This reed is a "canon", "Law" or "rule". 3rd century church leader Origen used the word canon to refer to the "rule of faith". We can find the greek word "kanon" used five times in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 10:13,15,16; Galatians 6:16; Philippians 3:16).</p>

<blockquote>Philippians 3:16 -- Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</blockquote>

<p>Note that this is "A Reed" and not "The Reed". It is "A Law/Rule" and not "The Law/Rule". God is not instructing John to measure according to the Old Testament Law and Forms, but the standard of measurement is the New Covenant which God has written on hearts and not tables of stone. (Hebrews 8:8-13; Jeremiah 31:31-34 )</p>

<blockquote>2 Corinthians 3:3 -- Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</blockquote>

<h3>Like Unto a Rod</h3>
<p>This measuring reed is "like unto a rod" (Rhabdos) meaning a stick or wand, scepter (Matthew 27:9) or an instrument of chastisement (Matthew 27:30). Both Christ (Isaiah 11:4; Revelation 19:15) and the Overcomer (Revelation 2:27; 12:5) are described as ruling with a "rod of iron". </p>

<p>Although John is witnessing a fuller office of rule for the Overcomer, in one sense the rulership of the saints in the world is already evident. A look at the laws of America alone reveals the great influence of God, His Word and His people in the creation of these laws. 
</p><p>The Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, our currency, all 50 state constitutions and the Pledge of Allegiance all affirm the sovereign authority of God. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution both are premised on the need of the authority of law and not the authority of a man which is a Scriptural principle (Isaiah 8:19,20). For further study on Biblical influence on government consider: <a href='http://www.faithfacts.org/christ-and-the-culture/the-bible-and-government'>http://www.faithfacts.org/christ-and-the-culture/the-bible-and-government.</a></p>
<p>For more on &quot;Judgment by believers&quot; see Psalm 149:5-9 and I Corinthians 6:2.</p>

<h2>The Instrument's Purpose</h2>
<p>In 11:1, The angel commands John to "rise and measure". "Rise" (eqeiro) means to awaken, rouse or raise.</p>

<h3>To Set A Standard.</h3>
<p>Measuring indicates limits and the laying down of borders, dimensions, or boundaries. The "reed" is the standard of comparison or measurement. There are no gray areas or guesses here. Absolute determination and inspection is made.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the measuring is to answer the question how does the temple compare to the standard? Such inspection reveals changes if there are any. The command to measure suggests important changes have been made. The old has been done away and a new is coming into view. Jews had been cast off for their backslidings, but now God will bring them back (Romans 11:11-27). (Note: The Jews trapped in Judaism are confident in their bondage because they measure with an old/expired reed.)</p>

<h3>To Declare Ownership.</h3>
<p>Measuring also indicates appropriation. As when a person purchases a property and detailed surveying is made so here what is measured is claimed or owned (Joshua 1:3). God is marking His territory!
</p>

<blockquote>Hebrews 8:10 -- &hellip;I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</blockquote>

<h2>The Articles Measured (vs. 1)</h2>

<h3>"The Temple of God"</h3>
<blockquote>I Peter 4:17 -- For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</blockquote>

<p>There is both an earthly and spiritual Jerusalem or "City of God". (Nehemiah 11:1,18; Isaiah 52:1; Matthew 4:5; 27:52-53)</p>

<p>It is the earthly temple being measured here. No human judgement is needed for the heavenly temple. In Revelation 21:15 we see a "Golden Reed" is used to measure the New Jerusalem. This Golden Reed is a Divine measurement. As it is built by God according to His own blueprint, the measuring in 21:15 reveals its perfection. The measuring in chapter 11 results in judgement.</p>

<p>This temple in Revelation 11:1,2 will be judged and given to the Gentiles for a 3-1/2 years. (New Jerusalem will never be given to be trodden under foot.)</p>

<h3>"The Altar "</h3>
<h4>The Measuring reminds Israel of The demands and commands of God in regard to the "Altar."</h4>
<h4>Temple worship restored, vs. 1.</h4>
<h4>Sacrifice Restored. Dan.8:11-13; 11:31; 12:11.</h4>

<h3>The Worshippers</h3>
<h4>The Jew will return to worship. "That worship there"</h4>
<h4>The Jew will turn to God. Rom. 11:21-25.</h4>
<h2>That Which Is Not Measured.</h2>
<blockquote>vs. 2 "The court which is without the temple leave out" "Measure it not "</blockquote>
<h3>It is given unto the Gentiles for a time."42 months" Isa. 1:27; Zech. 13:9; 14:1-4.</h3>
<h3>God does not accept what will not meet the measurement.</h3>
<h3>The Judgment of the Gentiles is reserved for the future.</h3>


<h1 id="K">K. Two Witnesses [11:3-13]</h1>

<p>These two witnesses are not presented to John in vision. They are described to him by the glorious Angel, who is the Lord Jesus Himself. The account that is given here is not John's but Christ's, given in His own words.</p>

<p>Who, then, are these Two Witnesses? The connection in which the account is given may help to give us the answer. These Witnesses come upon us suddenly, in the midst of the scenes of the Judgment, and at a time when Christ is ready to take possession of the earth.</p>

<p>"After three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them."</p>
<h4>They Ascend into Heaven - vs. 12 "They ascended up to heaven"</h4>
<p>Who are They? Some believe Moses and Elijah. Some believe Enoch and Elijah. Some believe O.T. and N.T. Some believe a body of believers. Malachi 3:1-6; 4:1,5-6; Matt. 17:10-13; 11:14-15; Luke 1:15-17. John the baptist was a partial fulfillment - Mal. 4:6; Luke 1:17. Lev. 26:1,9; Jer. 14:22; Zech. 10:1,2; Hag. 1:9-11.
The Reason water to blood - Because of the bloody and oppressive tyranny. Moses in Egypt. The bloody persecution.</p>
<h3>They Are Merciful Witnesses.</h3>
<p>Though they appear in judgment, the message is a warning -
"To flee from the wrath to come" - But they will hot listen - II Thess. 2:9-11.</p>
<p>What have we identified the two witnesses to be? Now we continue&hellip;
Their Times -Their Doings -Their End</p>
<h2>The Times of These Two Witnesses.</h2>
<h3>They are not Gospel Times.</h3>
<h4>The Jew and his Temple.</h4>
<h4>Ministers- different from Gospel ministers. vs. 5.</h4>
<p>They kill -vs. 10 torment - deal out fiery judgment.Avenge the very wish to injure them. We are not to avenge ourselves.Not to smite and kill our enemies - but love them. Jesus was crucified Stephen was stoned. James was beheaded. Peter was crucified.Paul beaten -imprisoned - beheaded - Polycarp is burned.The Gospel is a thing of joy. Isa. 57:7.</p>
<h4>Their garments symbols of calamity and judgment. The heavens are shut - no rain -no grain. Waters are turned to blood.</h4>
<h3>They are very Evil Times.</h3>
<h4>Times of great affliction and sorrow for God's true ministers. Hell has incarnated itself upon earth.</h4>
<h4>From the Abyss has come the Beast. All the world wonder at -</h4>
<p>All worship and adore him - Not given to the worship of God.</p>
<h4>War rages against God's People. Rev. 12:13 They are overcome.</h4>
<p>The two witnesses are killed. How many more?</p>
<h4>They are times of Miracles, vs.3 The Two witnesses</h4>
<p>The Beast and False Prophet - lying signs and wonders. II Thess. 2:3-10.Deceiving the world - Rev. 13:12-13 Moses overcame the magicians.These overcome the witnesses vs. 7.</p>
<h2>The Work of These Two Witnesses.</h2>

<h2>The End of These Two Witnesses.</h2>
<p>Their career, though illustrious, and crowded with miracle from beginning to end, is very brief. vs. 3.They shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 3 -1/2 years.</p>
<h3>They Are Killed -vs. 7.</h3>
<p>Put to death. "When they shall have finished their testimony. "When their work is complete.</p>

<p>Some believe reference is made of crucifixion. The ordinary mode of execution (at this time) is by beheading. Rev. 20:4a.</p>
<h3>The Place of Death - vs. 8 "in the street&hellip;of the great city"</h3>
<p>They are denied burial. "Spiritually called Sodom and Egypt" This is further proof of the literalness of this prophesy. Jerusalem in Apostasy, is a Sodom. Isa. 1:9-10; 3:8-9; Deut. 32:30-33; Jer. 23:14.</p>
<h3>The Length of Their Death - vs. 1 3 -1/2 days.</h3>
