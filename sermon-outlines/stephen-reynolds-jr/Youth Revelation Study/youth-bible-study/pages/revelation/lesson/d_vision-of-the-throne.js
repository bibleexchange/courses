{/*<!-- chapter 4 end -->*/}

<h2>The Rapture</h2>

<blockquote>"Things which must be hereafter"</blockquote>
<p>This chapter begins a new vision, which constitutes the second section of the Revelation. It is related not to things on the earth, but to things in heaven, and to things following the period covered by the seven churches.</p>
<p>The Translation of the Bride has already taken place and this section begins with the rapture.</p>

<h3>He saw a door opened - v. 1 "A door opened in heaven"</h3>
<h3>He heard a voice -</h3>

<p>"Voice which I heard as it were of a trumpet." (I Thessalonians 4:16-18)</p>
<blockquote>Come up hither</blockquote>
<blockquote>I will shew thee things</blockquote>
<blockquote>Which must be hereafter</blockquote>
<p>After the Rapture of the Church.</p>
<h3>He was caught up -</h3>
<p>v. 2 "I was in the Spirit" Caught up in the Spirit.</p>
<p>"A throne was set in heaven" set/Keimai- to be out stretched.</p>

<blockquote>v. 3 "Jasper and a sardine stone"</blockquote>
<p>Crystalline and purple in hue. Royal.cBeautifully bright, red, carnation color.Flashing light or Flames like fire.</p>

<blockquote>Hebrews 12:29 -- God is a consuming fire.</blockquote>
<h3>The Throne is Encircled -</h3>
<h4>By a rainbow -</h4>
<blockquote>v. 3 "There was a rainbow round about the throne"</blockquote>
<p>Token of God's covenant. Genesis 9:11,17</p>
<p>An Emerald Rainbow</p>
<blockquote>"Insight like unto an emerald."</blockquote>
<p>"Emerald" - "light green"</p>
<p>The throne is a throne of judgment but not of destruction.</p>
<p>Judgment mingled with grace and mercy.</p>
<p>Life - Promise - Hope - "Emerald"</p>
<p>Over-spanning the appearance of consuming fire.</p>
<h4>By other thrones - v. 4</h4>
<p>"Seats" same word as thrones.</p>
<h3>By Elders -</h3>
<blockquote>"Four and twenty elders sitting"</blockquote>
<p>On the thrones - "round about the throne"</p>
<h4>By Living Creatures - vv. 6-9</h4>

<h3>The Throne is of Judgment</h3>
<blockquote>v. 5 And out of the throne proceeded</blockquote>
<h4>"Lightnings"</h4>
<p>Exodus9:23,28 Exodus19:16</p>
<h4>"Thunderings"</h4>
<p>I Samuel 7:10</p>
<h4>"Voices"</h4>
<p>I Samuel 12:17,18</p>

<p>It is a flaming indignation.</p>

<p>Seven - Completeness - Tribulation"Seven Spirits" - The fullness of the Spirit of God.</p>
<h3>The Throne Has A Pavement - v. 6</h3>
<p>Exodus 24:10 Revelation21:21</p>

<h2>The Four Living Creatures vv. 6-8</h2>
<h3>Who They Are Not</h3>
<h4>They are not angels. (5:8-10; 7:11; Hebrews 2:5)</h4>
<h4>They are not Israel. Israel in History - Revelation 4:1. Also these are from all nations. Revelation 5:9</h4>
<h4>They are not the Apostles, but tribes and people of all the earth.</h4>
<h4>They are not disembodied spirits, but are glorified subjects of grace.</h4>
<p>vv. 8,9 Enthroned - Crowned - Robed</p>
<h3>Who They Are</h3>
<p>Look at their characteristics revealed in the Scriptures</p>
<h4>The first creature was like a lion v. 7</h4>
<h4>The second creature was like a calf</h4>
<h4>The third creature had a face as a man</h4>
<h4>The fourth creature was like a flying eagle</h4>
<p>Four is representative of a larger number.</p>
<p>The Jewish writers tell us that the standard of each tribe of Israel took the color of the stone which represented it in the high priest's breastplate, and that there was wrought upon each a particular figure.</p>
<li>A Lion for Judah</li>
<li>A young ox for Ephraim</li>
<li>A Man for Reuben</li>
<li>An Eagle for Dan</li>
<p>In the Four Gospels we have Christ portrayed in this same manner"</p>
<li>In Matthew the Lion - The King of Israel</li>
<li>In Mark the Ox - The Servant and Sacrifice</li>
<li> In Luke the Man - The Son of Man</li>
<li> In John the Eagle - The Son of God</li>
<p>This is not Christ, but someone like Him - Who do you find in Scripture like Christ?</p>
<p>Christ is the head of the Church. This is His Body. This is His Church</p>
<p>Lion nature - Ox nature - Man's nature - Eagle's nature</p>
<p>This is the Church after it has been perfected in the first 3 -1/2 years of the tribulation.</p>
<h3>They have eyes -</h3>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Before and behind"</blockquote>
<blockquote>v. 8 "Full of eyes within"</blockquote>
<h4>The symbol of intense intelligence</h4>
<p>Looking backward into the past.</p>
<p>Forward into the future.</p>
<p>Inward into the present.</p>
<p>Nothing hid - secrets known.</p>
<h4>Also symbol of unceasing activity.</h4>
<h4>A symbol of continued vigilance.</h4>
<h3>They have wings -v. 8</h3>
<p>Isaiah 6: with twain covered his face</p>
<p>with twain covered his feet</p>
<p>with twain they did fly</p>
<h4>Humility -</h4>
<h4>Redemption - uncovered feet cannot Redeem</h4>
<h4>Freedom -</h4>
<p>Six is the number of man.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:18</p>
<p>Six is 4 -man's worldplus 2 -division or difference, and generally enmity.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1 - Genesis 1:2</p>
<p>First - Perfection</p>
<p>Second - Ruin and desolation</p>
<p>Six is 5 - grace of God</p>
<p>plus 1 - made of none effect by man's addition to it.</p>
<p>Six is 7 - Completeness</p>
<p>minus 1 - man's coming short of perfection.</p>
<p>These are men redeemed - God's perfection.</p>
<p>Man was created on the sixth day. Man has six days to labor. When twelve (the number of governmental perfection) is divided, it indicates imperfection in rule and administration.</p>
<p>I Kings 10:19 Solomon's throne had six steps, and his kingdom was divided.</p>
<p>The twelve loaves were divided into sixes -</p>
<p>Also on the Breastplate of the High Priest -Twelve Tribes were divided tribes.</p>

<h2>The Four And Twenty Elders - vv. 4,10,11</h2>
<h3>Who They Are Not -</h3>
<h4>They are not the Patriarchs</h4>
<p>Revelation 5:9 From every tribe, tongue, people and nation.</p>
<h4>They are not the Apostles. The Apostles were all Jews. They have their part in the foundation. Revelation 21:12-14</h4>
<h4>They are not disembodies spirits. The dead praise not God.</h4>
<p>These are praising God. vv. 10,11</p>
<h3>Who They Are -</h3>
<p>Notice - Where they are located and what they are doing.</p>
<h4>They are located in the throne and sitting on thrones.</h4>
<p>Revelation 4:2,4 Now turn to the 3rd chapter and vv. 20,21</p>
<h4>They are Overcomers</h4>
<blockquote>Sitting on thrones Ch. 3:21; 4:4</blockquote>
<p>They have crowns - v. 10 Crowns promised -</p>
<p>Incorruptible crown - I Corinthians 9:25</p>
<p>Crown of Rejoicing - I Thessalonians 2:19</p>
<p>Crown of Righteousness - II Timothy 4:8</p>
<p>Crown of Life - James 1:12; Rev. 2:10</p>
<p>Crown of Glory - I Peter 5:4</p>
<p>Five in number - Grace and Faith</p>
<p>So then this is a company of people that have heard His voice in the church and have overcome "as He overcame" and He has given them the right to sit with Him in His throne.</p>
<h4>They occupy the closest position to Christ.</h4>
<p>Chpt. 5:6 Reverse the order &mdash;</p>
<h4>They are Twenty-Four in number</h4>
<p>These were the representatives of many others.</p>
<p>The priests and Levites "were set to forward the work of the house of the Lord, was twenty and four thousand." I Chronicles 23:3,4</p>
<p>But they were all arranged in courses of twenty-four.I Chronicles 24:3-5</p>
<p>I Chronicles 25:8-31 There were not more than twenty-four on duty at a time.</p>
<h4>They are Elders -</h4>
<p>The expression is that of time - "Elders". The "Elder" was the ruling man in the original order. They are "Elders" because of their official place.</p>
<p>"Sitting on thrones." They are the first glorified of all the redeemed - the seniors of that celestial city.</p>
