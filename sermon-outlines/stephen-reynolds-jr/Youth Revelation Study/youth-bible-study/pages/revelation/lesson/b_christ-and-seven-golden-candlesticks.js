<h1 id="B">B. Christ and the 7 Golden Candlesticks [1:9-20]</h1>

<blockquote>Revelation 1:9-20 &mdash; I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 14  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. 19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</blockquote>

<h2>THE WITNESS: HOW did John Hear and See</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Their Companion in Tribulation (on isle of Patmos 13sq miles area and 32 miles from the coast of Asia Minor, exiled there under emperor Domitian) It was in this unfriendly place the awesome revelation was written.</li>
	<p>According to Tertullian (in The Prescription of Heretics) John was banished after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome around AD 95.</p>
	<li>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day</li>

	<p>"In the Spirit" Ezekiel 37:1 (valley dry bones);  Re 1:10 (in the spirit on the Lord's day); Re 4:2 (And immediately I was in the spirit); Re 17:3 (carried me away in the spirit);
 Re 21:10 (he carried me away in the spirit )</p>

 <p>Received in the Spirit and to be understood only by the Spirit</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 2:14 &mdash; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</blockquote>

<p>This does not mean the book of Revelation cannot be understood, but that in order to fully understand it we must be in that same condition of communion with the Spirit of God as John.</p>

<blockquote>8 times in Revelation:  Re 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith ....</blockquote>

<blockquote>Isaiah 50:4-- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, <b>he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned</b>.</blockquote>

</ul>

<h2>WHAT did John Hear and See (Revelation 1:9-20)</h2>

<h3> 1. His Voice</h3>

<ul>
	<li>a great voice</li>
	<li>as of a trumpet</li>
	<li>his voice as the sound of many waters</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clearly a VOICE that John heard but it was LIKE a TRUMPET--urgent, clear, strong, awakening, and startling.</p>

<p>God revealed Himself to Moses, on Mt.Sinai "voice of a trumpet exceeding loud." (Exodus 19:16) The Temple opened its doors in the morning at the sound of the trumpet. The Year of Jubilee came with the sound of the trumpet. Lev. 25:9,10 The Silence of the Age will be broken by the sound of a trumpet.
</p>

<blockquote>I Thessalonians 4:16--The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised.</blockquote>

<h3> 2. His Age</h3>

<ul>
	<li>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last</li>
</ul>

<h3> 3. His Vocation</h3>

<ul>
	<li> I saw seven golden candlesticks; And in the midst of the seven candlesticks (v.20)</li>
	<li> he had in his right hand seven stars: (v.20)</li>
	<li> and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword:</li>
</ul>

<p> His place is found <b>in the midst</b> of his church (PROPHET, PRIEST, KING)</p>

<p><b>The candlesticks</b> give light, illumination, and revelation which guide us, warn us and make us aware. The Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a light! (Zechariah 4:2-6; Numbers 8:1-4)</p>

<blockquote>John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
Matthew 5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.

Matthew 4:16-- The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
Luke 1:79-- To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
John 11:9-- Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
2 Corinthians 4:6-- For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</blockquote>

<p><b>"Golden"</b>
<b>GREAT COST</b>. The candlesticks were composed of the costliest metal.

<b>GREAT BEAUTY</b>. The tabernacle use filled with the use of gold. Gold is expressive of Godliness.

Psalm 96:9-- O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>

<p><b>7</b> Churches = Entire Church Age. Completeness</p>

<p>God has His ministers in His hand. He holds, controls, owns and will reward them</p>

<h3> 4. His Divinity - the Christ</h3>

<ul>
<li> one like unto the Son of man</li>
<li> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; </li>
<li> and have the keys of hell and of death.</li>
</ul>

<h3> 5. His Clothing</h3>

<ul>
<li> clothed with a garment down to the foot,</li>
<li> and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. ( a golden belt Ephesisans 6 truth)</li>
</ul>

<p>FULLY CLOTHED</p>

<p>Clothing Signified Status</p>

<h3> 6. His Appearance</h3>

<ul>
<li>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;</li>

<p>His Wisdom and "ELDER"ness. Also a reminder of redemption  (sins red like crimson "white as snow")</p>
<blockquote>Isa 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</blockquote>

<li>his eyes were as a flame of fire;</li>

<blockquote>Re 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. (innermost parts)</blockquote>

<li>his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace;</li>
<li>his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</li>
<li><b>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.</b></li>
</ul>
