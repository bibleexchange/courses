</li>

<li>Adopt some Rules for Consistent Interpretation</li>

<p>In this study, we will seek to faithfully apply the following principles.</p>

- Unless textual statements or clues are given otherwise, we will interpret Revelations prophetic events as being fulfilled in the sequence they are written.

- Being a book of prophecy, we will look to the future first for fulfillment before the past.

- We will interpret the numbers of this book literally first, before applying typical meaning to them.</li>

- We will interpret symbols consistently through the book of Revelation and in the greater context of the Bible as a whole.</li>

- God is good and He keeps His Word. We will shine the light of these truths and the revelations of God's nature throughout the Bible upon all the events of this Book and with them temper our interpretations. ( Psalm 73:1; )
