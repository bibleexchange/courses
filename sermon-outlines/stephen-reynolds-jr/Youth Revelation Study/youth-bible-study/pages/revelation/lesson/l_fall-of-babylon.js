<h1>Fall of Mystery Babylon [17]</h1>

<h1>Judgment on the False Church (17)</h1>

<p>Chapter seventeen tells about the judgment of the False Church who is called the &quot;Mother of Harlots&quot; because of her spiritual adultery. Harlotry is symbolic of false worship or the worship of idols (idolatry). </p>

<p>This woman will be a one-world church and as is all false religion will be attended with lewdness. Religion has never been so rich, so powerful, united and so unclean. Before her judgment, she is in a moral and spiritual wilderness, but advanced in achievements of science, materialism and humanistic philosophy.</p>
<h2>The Time of the Judgment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 17:3&mdash;So he carried me away in the spirit&hellip;
Revelation 1:10&mdash;I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The False Church will suffer this prophesied judgment in the End-Time. She is an End-Time False Church and will face her judgment in the time of the end.</p>
<h2>The Place of the Judgment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 17:3&mdash;&hellip;into the wilderness&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a general sense, the wilderness is a place of testing and more specific to Revelation it is symbolic of the tribulation period that takes place just before the Lord returns (12:14). This false church will be in control for most of the tribulation hour.</p>
<h2>The Receiver of the Judgment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 17:3&mdash;&hellip;and I saw a woman&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to Christ, the Scripture refers to the church as a woman (1 Corinthians 11:3; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:24-32). God illustrated His desired relationship with His people with the relationship of a husband and wife.</p>
<p>In Revelation 12, we read about the True Church (<a href="/courses/revelation/the-sun-clothed-woman_73">&quot;The Sun-Clothed Woman&quot;</a>). Now, in Chapter 17, we read about the judgment on the False Church.</p>
<h2>The Outstanding Details of the Judgment</h2>
<h3>She is a Mother (vs.5)</h3>
<p>As she is a mother, she is producing something. The True Church produced a singular and unified Man Child (12:5), as well as, truth and strength. The False Church produces a divided and plurality of harlots (17:5), as well as, error and weakness.</p>
<h3>She is Sitting (vs. 1,3,9)</h3>
<p>Sitting is a position of control or rule. As a king or judge sits in their authority. She is a dictator over <strong>the people and nations</strong> (vs. 1,15 &quot; many waters&quot;) and <strong>the beast</strong> (vs. 1,3,8,11-13,16 this beast is the anti-christ).</p>
<p>She sits with overwhelming control of the one-world government that is evil and sinful. The False Church rides in control on the scarlet colored beast. She is therefore in control of the nations.</p>
<h3>She is Clothed (vs. 4)</h3>
<p>The Bride of Christ is dressed in fine linen clean and white which is the righteousness of saints (Revelation 19:8). This woman is dressed in the attire of a harlot.</p>
<h4>She is arrayed in purple which is the color of royalty. This woman is not truly royal, but is a hypocrite.</h4>
<h4>Not only is color of the beast scarlet, but she is also clothed in scarlet. Scarlet is the color of sin.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Isaiah 1:18&mdash;&hellip;though your sins be as scarlet&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She revels in all that is an abomination to God. Read Proverbs 6:16-19; Deuteronomy 22:5.</p>
<h4>She is decked with gold and precious stones and pearls.</h4>
<p>There are two Scriptural aspects to Gold. In the positive, gold speaks of divinity and the perfect nature of God. In the negative, gold is the best of the riches of the world. She is not godly or divine, but she is rich with the riches of the world.</p>
<p>All her ornaments are form the world. Her inspiration comes form the pagan and godless cultures of the world.</p>
<h3>She Has a Cup in Her Hand (vs. 4)</h3>
<p>This not the cup of the Lord, but is the cup of devils. This golden cup is filled with the abominations and filthiness of her fornication. She is not sharing the Gospel, but it is &quot;another gospel&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>vs. 2&mdash;With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She is very influential. She has corrupted many others with the teaching of her false religion (1 Timothy 4:1). </p>
<h3>She has a Name (vs. 5)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>She is Drunk (vs. 6)</h3>
<p>She is drunk with precious blood of martyrs who are the saints of the Lord Jesus Christ. This was all a great (megas) mystery (admiration) to John.</p>
<h3>She has an End (vs. 16)</h3>
<p>There is a two-foldness to her judgment. Her fall is mentioned twice (17:16 and 18:21).</p>
<p>She is hated and overthrown. At first the beast carries the woman (vs. 3) and the torn horns hate her and make her desolate and naked and then burn her.</p>
<p>She had her time of rule and it glittered like gold, but &quot;pay day&quot; always comes for the enemies of God. With every blasphemous act or false doctrine she added to the cup of her own judgment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 17:16&mdash;&hellip;burn her with fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Those that are with the Lamb (17:14)</h1>
<p>In the midst of judgment within a spiritual wilderness, we see a glorious promise.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 17:14&mdash;These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</blockquote>
<p>We see the action and the resulting end of the False church, Antichrist and the powers that rule with him. They make war with the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them! For He is Lord of lords and King of kings. There are those who set themselves in opposition to the Great King, but in this verse we also see some are "with Him". Herein is a promise to some, that they can overcome WITH the Lamb. These are the Called, Chosen and Faithful of God. These are the army of the Lamb.</p>

<h1>Fall of Babylon the Great (Ch. 18)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mystery Babylon is a place as well as a system. The System has two parts: Religious (Ch. 17) and Commercial (Ch. 18). The fall of Babylon is mentioned twice (17:16 and 18:21) because there are two stages to her judgment. First, the religious part of the system will be judged and then the commercial part of the system.</p>
<p>In the judgment upon the religious part of the system (Ch. 17), she is put down and taken over by the Antichrist. This will unite religion and commerce, making the State (Antichrist) supreme. Babylon the Great, in final revelation, is a city ruled over by the Antichrist as both the religious and political head. She becomes abundantly rich in carnal wealth for her aid to the devil.</p>
<p>Both the place and the system of &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; will suffer greatly for her role in the Antichrist's efforts. </p>
<p>It is important to note, that presently, there is no city &quot;Babylon&quot;. If the place &quot;Babylon&quot; (50 miles south of modern Iraq) is to be included in this judgment, Babylon as a city must first be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The important detail concerning Babylon is not where on a map can we place her, but what is she guilty of that incurs such severe action from God. Babylon in Chapters 17 and 18, is at the very least symbolic of both a religious system (ch. 17) and a commercial system (ch. 18) that become God's enemies.</p>
<h2>The Announcement of her Judgment (vs. 1-8)</h2>
<h3>The Announcing Angel, vs. 1-3</h3>
<p>A glorious messenger appears from out of heaven.</p>
<h4>He Comes with Great Authority</h4>
<p>All power and authority truly belongs to God! (Daniel 7:14; John 5:26-27; 1 Corinthians 15:24)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 5:25&mdash;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>The Earth is Lighted with His Glory</h4>
<p>This is never said describing created beings, but is often said of God! (Psalm 72:18,19; Isaiah 6:1-3; Ezekiel 43:2; Revelation 1:13-16; 21:23)</p>
<h4>He Cries Mightily with a Strong Voice</h4>
<h3>The Calling Out of God's People, vs. 4-8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 18:4&mdash;And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the mighty word goes into effect, a voice from heaven (probably, the Father) says come out of her, my people. His people are warned to avoid getting caught up in the marketing of the evil system. (An effective advertisement is one that convinces you that you need something.) </p>
<ul>
<li>Come Out of her</li>
<li>Call on Jesus </li>
<li>Repent of Sin</li>
<li>Be Born of the Spirit (Not a soul-ish or intellectual thing, but a spiritual experience.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Satans really merchandise is the souls of men. He takes advantage of and seeks to rob a man of his soul. What do we want? Faith or Feeling. Bible or Psychology. (1 Corinthians 13:45) The devil employs all manner of means in this market: business, religion, drugs, sex, gossip, lustful and rebellious music, </p>
<h2>The Reaction to Her Judgment (vs. 9-20)</h2>
<p>The fall of Babylon is one of the most marvelous events of all time (i.e., the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah). Consider how this would effect the whole world and even how it would effect you. Her fall is a great disappointment to many as just at her height of success she is destroyed. All the schemes of human progress are left disappointed and many will lament. , but there are mixed reactions to her judgment for two worlds are involved. There some who will rejoice while others are crying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 18:9,20&mdash;And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, 20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lamentation</h3>
<h4>Lamenting of Royalty, vs. 9-10</h4>
<h4>Lamenting of Merchants, vs. 11-16</h4>
<h4>Lamenting of Shipmasters, vs. 17-19</h4>
<p>But while these lament, a grand jubilee fills the sky!</p>
<h3>Rejoicing</h3>
<h4>The Heavenly Beings Rejoice</h4>
<h4>The Apostles Rejoice</h4>
<h4>The Prophets Rejoice</h4>
<h2>After her Fall (vs. 21-24)</h2>
<p>Re 18:21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
 22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
 23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</p>
