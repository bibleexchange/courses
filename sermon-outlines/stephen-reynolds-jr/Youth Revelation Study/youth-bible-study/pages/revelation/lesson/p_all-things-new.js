<h1>U. All Things New [21:1-27; 22:1-5]</h1>

# New Heaven and New Earth

TEXT: Revelation 21

>Revelation 21:1&mdash;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

## Introduction

John sees that there will be a new heaven and a new earth and then he describes in awesome detail, "New Jerusalem".

John applies the descriptions of walls, gates, a tabernacle and foundations and even calls what he sees in a lot of places a "city". But, John also compares what he sees with "a bride adorned" and names it in one place "the lamb's wife".

John describes what he sees coming out of heaven from God as a "holy city", "new Jerusalem", "as a bride adorned", "tabernacle of God", "great city", "holy Jerusalem", "the Bride" and "the Lamb's Wife".

Who or what is this "city" like? Is it a place or a person? (vs. 9) In order to understand this "great city", we must carefully consider the details as John laid them out for us.

## The End and The Beginning (vs. 1-8)

The "end" John sees is not an "extinction" but a transition&mdash; made new!

### First Glimpse (vs. 1,2)

Heaven and Earth. John's first impression is that he is seeing something somewhat familiar, and yet it is altogether different. He says he sees a "new earth" and yet it is an earth with no sea. He says he sees a "new heaven" and yet it is a heaven where the veil between it and earth is removed.

Then John sees another "new" thing. It is New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven like as if it were a "young married or betrothed woman" who is ready for her husband as she has put everything in proper order and is beautifully decorated. 

### A Proclamation (vs. 3-8)

The great voice (THE Voice!) proclaims what God is going to do.

#### Dwell with Men (vs. 3)

Notice that New Jerusalem comes "down from God" and from "out of heaven" in verse 2. This is not a description of God's people finally going to heaven to be with God or "men with God". What John sees is more accurately understood as "God with men".

> Revelation 21:3&mdash;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.

#### Bring an End to Former Things (vs. 4-8)

> Revelation 21:6&mdash;And he said unto me, **It is done**. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end&hellip; 

There are many awesome advantages to this new arrangement:

1. No More Tears
2. No More Death
3. No More Sorrow or Crying
4. No More Pain
5. No More Thirst
6. No More Battles
7. No More Unbelief

## A Tour of New Jerusalem (vs. 9-27)

> 9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, 

I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

### The Vantage Point (vs. 10)

#### In the Spirit

> And he carried me away in the spirit

#### A Great and High Mountain

> to a great and high mountain, 

### The Descriptions (vs. 10-

1. A City (vs. 10)

and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, 

2. Comes out of Heaven from God (vs. 10)
descending out of heaven from God,

3. Having the Glory of God (vs. 11)
11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

4. 12 Gates, 12 Angels and 12 Names (vs 12,13,21, 25-27)

and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
 13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.

ALL MAY BE SAVED

25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
 26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
 27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

5. A Wall with 12 Foundations (vs. 12,14-20)
12 And had a wall great and high, 

- 12 Foundations

 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

- Measuring the Wall

 15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
 16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
 17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

 18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.
 19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. 

> In the heavenly city we have harmony, not monotony; variety, not sameness; unity, not uniformity. The stones are not arranged in the order of the high priest&apos;s breastplate, but according to their various shades of colour, beginning from the foundation.&mdash;Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers

6. The Lamb of God

The Lamb is the Temple

> 22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

The Lamb is the Light

> 23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.

# Heaven

Text: Revelation 22:1-5

> Revelation 22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: 4 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. 5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

> John 14:1-3&mdash;Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

## What is Heaven?

Heaven is a Real Place. God created it as a place of His own beauty and perfect design.

> Genesis 1:1&mdash;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

Heaven is not a state or condition of mind, heaven is not a myth or fairy tale, heaven is not imagination heaven is not fiction. Heaven is Real!

Jesus said it is is a "**place**" in John 14:2.

- John 21:2 "coming out of Heaven"

## Hymn: THERE&apos;s NO DISAPPOINTMENT IN HEAVEN

**Words**: Frederick M. Lehman, 1914; he wrote these words in Chicago, Illinois, while suffering financial reverses.

**Music**: Frederick Lehman, harmony by his daughter Claudia L. Mays

&quot;There&apos;s no disappointment in heaven,
 No weariness, sorrow or pain;
No hearts that are bleeding and broken,
 No song with a minor refrain.
The clouds of our earthly horizon
 Will appear in the sky,
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
 With never a tear nor a sigh.
We&apos;ll never pay rent for our mansion,
 The taxes will never come due;
Our garments will never grow threadbare,
 But always be fadeless and new.
We&apos;ll never be hungry nor thirsty,
 Nor languish in poverty there,
For all the rich bounties of heaven
 His sanctified children will share.
There&apos;ll never be crepe on the door-knob,
 No funeral train in the sky;
No graves on the hillside of glory,
 For there we shall never more die.
The old will be young there forever,
 Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we&apos;ll stand in his likeness
 The stars and the sun to outshine.
I&apos;m bound for the beautiful city
 My Lord has prepared for His own;
Where all the redeemed of all ages
 Sing &quot;Glory&quot; around the white throne;
Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven,
 And the glories I there shall behold,
What a joy it will be when My Savior I see,
 In that beautiful city of gold!&quot;
