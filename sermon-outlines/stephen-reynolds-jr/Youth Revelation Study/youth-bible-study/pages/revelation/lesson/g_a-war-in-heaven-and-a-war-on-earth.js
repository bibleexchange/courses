<h1 id="L">L. Sun-clothed Woman [12]</h1>

<h1>Introduction to Chapter 12</h1>

<h2>A Division of Thought</h2>
<p>Chapter 12 is a dividing point in the book of Revelation. Chapters 1-3 prophetically describe the entire church age. Chapters 4-11 start and continue from the Rapture in the middle of the 7 years of tribulation. Chapter 11 concludes with the Seventh Trumpet and the climax of Christ&rsquo;s return to the earth at the end of the 7 years of tribulation. Chapter 12 resets back to the church age (the time before both the Rapture and the Translation) for further detail and prophetic truth.</p>

<img src='/assets/revelation/review-of-chapters-1-11.png' id='review-of-chapters-1-11'/>

<p>Though Chapters 1-11 have progressed linearly, to this point, there are gaps in &lsquo;explanation&rsquo;. For example, Chapter 3 ended with Christ&rsquo;s appraisal of the Church being anything but complementary. Yet, chapter 4 graciously places the Church in the presence of God enjoying a great honor. Something has happened between the end of chapter 3 and the beginning of chapter 4 where the church is Raptured. Further explanation of this is given in the proceeding chapters of our study beginning with Chapter 12. Further details are given in Chapters 12-22 regarding the First 3-1/2 Years of Tribulation, concerning the wrath of God during the Second 3-1/2 Years of Tribulation and the Divine plan following that season of judgment.</p>

<h2>A Continuation of Prophecy</h2>
<p>It is important to remember that this is a book of prophecy and not history. Seven times Revelation refers to itself as words of prophecy.(Revelation 1:3; 11:6; 19:10; 22:7; 22:10; 22:18; 22:19)</p>

<p>A prophetic warning before judgment is an absolutely necessary part of how God does business. As a matter of Divine policy, before God would send judgment as contained in the book of Revelation, God would first give warning through His prophets. (Compare Daniel 12:4 with Revelation 22:10, I Corinthians 2:10, and Revelation 2:17.)</p>

<blockquote>Amos 3:7 &mdash; Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</blockquote>

<h2>The Importance of This Revelation</h2>

<h3>It was a sign.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;appeared a great wonder&rdquo; &ldquo;Semeion&rdquo; Miracle -Sign -Token -Wonder John 2:11; 4:45; 20:30; I Cor. 12:12; Matt.26:48;Luke 2:12; Rom.4:11; II Cor. 12:12; (II Thess.3:17 Token or Sign).</p>
<p>John uses the word &lsquo;semeion&rsquo; (a sign) here for the first time in the Revelation. The intention of a symbol is to communicate meaning beyond the symbol itself. A sign is a picture or symbol of something else. It is that &lsquo;something else&rsquo; which is the true subject of contemplation.</p>
<p>When interpreting Revelation it is necessary to understand that there is both literal and figurative language. Knowing when the writer uses which is key to understanding this book. When the Scripture is absent from a figurative expression or a figurative setting we should not try to make it figurative, but we should take it literal. Here John says,&rdquo; And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven.&rdquo; Something very mysterious is happening in the heavens. By John&rsquo;s statement we know the scenes in Revelation 12 must be taken symbolically or figuratively and not literally.</p>

<h3>It was an important sign.</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Megas&rsquo; (great) means extraordinary and important. Not only is this a sign, but this is &ldquo;A great sign&rdquo;. This is a great, important, extraordinary, and remarkable event that needs to be studiously considered.</p>
<p>How and where this sign appears should alone tell us that it is very important and should therefore arrest our attention:</p>
<h4>It was Seen in the Spirit.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; John was transported through time and space.</p>
<h4>It was Seen in Heaven.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;A great wonder in heaven.&rdquo; That is, it was revealed to him in the heavenly realm. </p>

<p>The meaning of this wonder is apart from the natural world. It is something of a heavenly order. It&rsquo;s not a natural thing; it&rsquo;s not in the natural order. It&rsquo;s not of the earthly, but of the heavenly.</p>

<h1>The Sun-Clothed Woman (12:1,2)</h1>
<blockquote>A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.</blockquote>
<p>Who is this woman?</p>

<h2>Who the woman is not.</h2>
<h3>She is not Mary &mdash;</h3>
<p>Mary was of a very lowly and poverty stricken condition. Can we really interpret properly the lowly state of that little peasant woman that brought Jesus into the world, with this prophecy, fulfilling this position of a woman clothed with the sun and moon under her feet and crowned with twelve stars?</p>
<p>It was a woman that brought a man-child into this world, but was that man-child caught up to God as a child? Was Jesus just a child when He went to Heaven? &ldquo;And her child was caught up unto God and to His throne.&rdquo; This does not speak of a man 33 years old, fully matured, fully grown and fully developed. If John wanted us to understand that this was Jesus, I&rsquo;m sure he would have said that the Lord Jesus was caught up to the throne. Also, Mary had passed away a long time before this vision.</p>
<p>Now, let us look back into the first chapter of Revelation. I think there are some keys for interpretation there. Rev. 1 :3 says &ldquo;Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy.&rdquo; &ldquo;This prophecy&rdquo; has to do with prophetic utterance, foretelling something that is to come to pass. This book was written sixty years or more after the ascension of Christ. Remember, he is speaking of prophecy, something that is yet to take place. Also, in Rev. 1: 1 &ldquo;Things which must shortly come to pass.&rdquo; That is these things have not come to pass. This is not a record of history, but this is something that is to come to pass. Again, in Rev. 4: 1 &rdquo; And I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.&rdquo; When Christ was caught up to God, this Revelation was not yet written and it was said at the time of writing these were future. Also, is Jesus the only one that will rule the nations with a rod of iron? Rev.2:24-27.</p>
<h3>She is not Israel &mdash;</h3>
<p>There is another school of thought, and probably this is the more prominent teaching today. This is the belief that this is literal Israel. Israel was an earthly heritage. An earthly people- An earthly kingdom - Earthly possessions. The only time anything is mentioned to Israel with the heavens is Abraham&rsquo;s seed being as the starts of the sky, and then, only of those that are believers. Rom. 9:6-8.</p>
<p>Israel as a nation is pictured in the Scriptures, especially in the book of Hosea, as an unfaithful wife and as a harlot on the streets. As you look at Israel today you can see that this is her condition rather that in the place of honor. Also, Israel was clothed with the law which speaks of judgment, darkness, and death. This woman is clothed with the &ldquo;sun&ldquo;.</p>
<p>Some say this must be Israel because of what Isaiah said - Isa. 66:6, Look closely at the two texts. They are the opposite of each other.</p>
<h3>She is not the world church &mdash;</h3>
<p>A look at the condition of the church universally will reveal that she is not arrayed in this fashion - but, is worldly, ungodly, and devilish. How can an unholy thing produce a holy thing that is to be caught up to God and to His throne?</p>
<h2>Who the woman is</h2>
<p>The key to help interpret is in Rev. 1:4 &ldquo;John to the Seven Churches.&rdquo; Are we left to interpret whom John is speaking to? &ldquo;The Seven Churches&rdquo; The whole church age. John, when referring to something else, indicates this -when there is an absence of explanation -doesn&rsquo;t it only make sense that he is speaking then to the Churches?</p>
<p>A woman in scripture - Rev. 17 - False here. Rev. 12 - True Church. The woman is the Church. It is a revelation of Christ and the Church. Remember -&rdquo; A great wonder in heaven.&rdquo; This is the Church - the Body of Christ. Eph. 1 :22,23</p>
<p>We see not a fulfillment but a beautiful type and foreshadowing of the birthing of the Man-child in the account of Mary and the birth of Christ in Luke The Church will prepared for her work by the Word of God.</p>
<p>The Angel Brought a Word Luke 1:28; Eph. 1:6</p>
<p>The Word brought was that she was &ldquo;highly favored&rdquo; of the Lord. This means she was &ldquo;endued with grace&ldquo;. God was with her and she was accepted by Him. What made her &ldquo;favored&rdquo; or &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by God? (1) She was dedicated to the Lord [Jewish custom to dedicate their children to God by taking them to the temple when they are young.] (2) She was separated [vs. 27 She was a virgin] (3) She was a Believer though limited in her belief [vs. 29 &ldquo;troubled&rdquo; diatarasso &mdash; beyond her ability to believe.]</p>
<p>Her question in verse 34 &ldquo;How shall this be&rdquo; was answered before she knew it- she was brought a Word and this Word must be germinated by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost Has to Germinate the Word</p>
<p>Luke 1:35 &hellip;The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Power&rdquo; is that &ldquo;dunamis&rdquo; which is the supreme, infinite power of God. This was the same power with which God created the worlds. This work of perfecting the Believer is an IMPOSSIBLE one with us, but not with God!</p>
<p>Luke 1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>
<p>Mary Had to Fully Surrender to the Word</p>
<p>Luke 1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Word&rdquo; in verse 38 is the Greek word &ldquo;rhema&ldquo;. &ldquo;Rhema&rdquo; is the revealed Word of God. Mary fully surrendered to the: (1) Written Word&mdash;Whatever WAS said, (2) Spoken Word&mdash;the preached Word and the (3) Living Word&mdash;Follow the Lamb!</p>
<blockquote>I Peter 1:4-5 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</blockquote>


<h1>The Man Child,12:2-5</h1>
<img src="/images/crown.jpg" id="crown"/>
<p>&ldquo;The Man Child (12:2-5)&rdquo; is a continuation of the &ldquo;great wonder&rdquo; John saw in 12:1. Remember, as it is a &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; (sign, token, symbol) it demands our contemplation and careful consideration. The language used is intended to be interpreted figuratively. Also, in our previous study, we stated that the woman in verse one is the Church. Let us focus now not on the woman so much but the fact that she is with child and she gives birth to a &ldquo;man child&rdquo;.</p>
<img src="/assets/revelation/crows.png" id="manchild_crows"/>
<p>If there is a message that the devil hates, it is the message of the Man Child. This message threatens all the devil has accomplished and would like to do regarding humanity. The devil is persistent in his efforts to snatch away any seed of the message of the Man Child.</p>

<blockquote>Matthew 13:19 &ndash; When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth not, cometh the wicked one, and catch it the way that which was sown in his heart.</blockquote>

<h2>The Identity of the Man Child</h2>
<p>If the woman is the church, who is the Man Child? </p>
<h3>Some believe the Man Child to be Christ. (i.e., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Scofield">Scofield</a>)</h3>
<p>Consider some objections to this theory:</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Prophetic</h4>
<p>This chapter is part of the vision that was given to John the beloved 60 years after the ascension of Christ. The entire vision is a revelation of things that were &ldquo;to come to pass&rdquo; AFTER it was given (Revelation 1:1; 4:1). How then can the translation of this man child refer to the ascension of Christ, which occurred six decades before this vision?</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Nativity</h4>
<p>Christ came down from heaven at birth. The Man Child is caught up to heaven.</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Crucifixion and Ascension of Christ</h4>
<p>If this Scripture refers the ascension of Christ, why should the figure of a child, which the devil cannot kill (the Man Child is not harmed by the devil), &ldquo;caught up unto God, and to his throne&rdquo; be used to symbolize the ascension into Heaven of a full-grown man, whom the devil did kill? (Christ surrendered His life and He died.)</p>
<h3>The Man Child is a product of the Church.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The woman is in travail to bring forth&rdquo;) the woman which is the church is producing sons. </p>
<h3>The Man Child is a fully mature son.</h3>

<blockquote>Ephesians 4:13&mdash;Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hebrews 5:14&mdash;But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</blockquote>
<p>The Man Child is the Overcomer in Revelation 3:21 and the Bride of Christ in Revelation 19:7.</p>

<h2>The Revealing of the Man Child</h2>

<h3>The Seed</h3>

<p>&rdquo;And she brought forth&rdquo; &ndash; tikto &ndash; to produce from seed. This &ldquo;seed&rdquo; is the Word of God presented much through the efforts of God's ministers which are God's gifts given to the saints (Ephesians 4:11-13).</p>
<p>The seed is the revealed Word or the Word of God that has been made alive by the Spirit of God.</p>

<h3>The Birth</h3>

<p>To bring forth the child is to reveal (bring to light or manifest) the child.</p>

<blockquote>Romans 8:17-19&mdash;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1 Peter 1:3-5&mdash;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</blockquote>

<h3>The Pain</h3>
<p>Revealed with great pain. Vs. 2 &ldquo;cried&rdquo; travailing in birth. Pain to be delivered.</p>

<blockquote>Romans 8:23&mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</blockquote>

<h4>The Man Child will be brought forth through intercessory prayer.</h4> 
<p>quot;Cried&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;krazo&rdquo; &ndash; meaning to call aloud, to cry out, or any inarticulate cries. (Romans 8:26-27) This is not a pious recital of prayers, but is a travailing in prayer is a mother travails in giving birth. The prayer must be earnest and must be in faith. &ldquo;Waiting&rdquo; in Romans 8:23 is&rdquo;Apekdechomai&rdquo; meaning to fully or eagerly expect.</p>

<h4>Revealed under great persecution. Vs. 4</h4>

<p>There will be pain &ldquo;basanizo&rdquo; meaning to put to the test. There will be trials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&rdquo; The devil will fight harder against this truth than any other truth that has been revealed because the Man Child takes his place in heaven. Vs.8.</p>

<h3>The Time</h3>
<p>The Man Child is revealed in the last time. The 11th chapter ends with Christ ruling the kingdoms of this world which are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign for ever and ever. Chapter 12 brings us back to the third chapter and at the end of the church age. Luke 21:28; one Peter 1:3&ndash; The time of the revealing is just before the tribulation. The church is still on the earth and will face 3 -1/2 years of tribulation&mdash;vs. 6 &ldquo;in the wilderness&rdquo;. Also, the Man Child is revealed before the Church is perfected. Verse 14</p>
<h2>The Nature of the Man Child.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A Man Child&rdquo;&rdquo;Arrhen&rdquo; or &rdquo; Arsen&rdquo; - means male. It has to do with manhood and not gender.</p>
<h3>Manly characteristics -heroic virtues.</h3>
<p>They are strong -not weak.They are true -not false.Not full of hypocrisy.</p>
<h3>Overcomers, vs. 5</h3>
<p>.&rdquo;Who was to rule&rdquo; Rev. 12:11; 2:26,27; 3:21.The &ldquo;Overcomer&rdquo; is promised to sit with Him on His throne. These are &ldquo;caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Humble, vs.11.</h3>
<p>Did not combat the devil in their own strength. II Cor. 10:4.</p>
<h2>The Characteristics of the Man Child.</h2>
<h3>A student of the Word.</h3>
<p>To confess the Word, you must know the Word, vs. 11.&rdquo;by the Word of their testimony&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A believer in the Word.</h3>
<p>To confess the Word, you must believe the Word They believed in the blood of the Lamb because of the Word.Vs. 11 &ldquo;overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A lover of the Word.Vs 11</h3>
<p>&ldquo;And loved not their lives&rdquo; They loved the Word more than their lives.</p>
<h2>The Development of the Man Child.</h2>
<p>There is a development here. The Scripture indicates a process&mdash;salvation, Holy Ghost Baptism and fully mature son. </p>
<h3>Conceived.&rdquo;Gaster&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 2 &ldquo;With child&rdquo; (Born-Again Believers)</p>
<p>Conceived by the Word. The Word of God (like seed) is being planted in the Church by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<h3>Child.&rdquo;Teknon&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 4 &ldquo;Developing&rdquo;(Holy Ghost Baptized Believers)</p>
<h3>Son.&rdquo;Huios&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 5 &ldquo;Matured&rdquo; (the Bride of Christ, Overcomers)</p>
<p>In type in Gen. 2:21, Adam and Eve. Gen. 5:24 Enoch - Methuselah - Noah.The Word of truth (like seed) is being planted in the heart of the Church by His Spirit. The Body of Christ is not yet fully-grown or mature but God is nourishing it.He will bring it forth. </p>
<p>There are a lot of babes in the church. There are a lot of children in the church. There must be a maturing of sons &ndash; fully grown. 
A perfect man. Matthew 5:48; Ephesians 4:12-13.
&rdquo;Huious&rdquo; is a fully matured son (Hebrews 5:14) that is in a position to receive full inheritance (Galatians 4:1-2; I Peter 1:4) and full power (Ephesians 1:13-14).</p>
<h3>The Position of the Man Child</h3>
<p>As a child, the Believer does not differ from a servant (Galaitans 4:1). </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nepos&rdquo; infant, non-speaking, immature, childish. As the Believer develops and matures in Christ there awaits for him an &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; or &ldquo;positioning as son&rdquo;. This adoption is what we are &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; (Romans 8:23) for: &ldquo;the adoption&rdquo; &ndash;the placing or positioning of sons (&ldquo;huiothesia&rdquo;). </p>
<p>God does not adopt sinners into the family of God. The sinner must be born again into the family of God (John 3:7). The sinner is begotten by the Word and the the Spirit (John 3:5). Adoption is a term involving the positioning of Believers as sons. It is not a putting into the family by spiritual birth, but a putting into position of sons. Notice the Adoption the Apostle is speaking of (Romans 8:23) is yet future at his time. This positioning is a reward for MATURITY and OVERCOMING.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:5 &hellip; who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>Because of the prophecies about Christ in Psalm 2:9 and Revelation 2:26-27 many believe that Revelation 12:5 is talking only about Christ.</p>
<blockquote>Psalm 2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>

<p>But, Christ promised a position on His Throne with those that will overcome even as He overcame. The manchilde goes to the Throne of God.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 12:5 &hellip;caught up unto God, and to his throne.</p>

# The Great Red Dragon - 12:3,4
> Rev. 12: 3, 4 &quot;And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;
![](/assets/revelation/devil-word-cloud.png)
In our text is given &quot;another wonder&quot; (sign) that is to be interpreted after the same manner as the preceding &apos;sign.&apos; It is not a &apos;literal&apos; representation of the devil as he actually looks to the eye, but is &apos;figurative&apos; of the devil&apos;s characteristics. The great red dragon is symbolic of the devil&apos;s destructive and murderous character.
This wonder is a symbol of a fierce, hostile, evil power (satan) with which the Church has, and is, and must yet contend. This evil force is determined to hinder the progress of the Church and destroy her hopes.
## The Dragon
### The Image or &quot;Sign&quot; is that of a &quot;Dragon&quot;
Dragon means &apos;huge serpent&rsquot. Dragons have often been the embodiment of the fear of the unknown. In Greek mythology, these giant serpents often guarded the far and unexplored parts of the earth.
> DRAGON &mdash; &quot;The dragon, figured prominently in ancient and medieval mythologies as an embodiment of evil principle. It has been superstitiously dreaded and even worshipped, as in China, where it is the imperial emblem. It is commonly represented as a large winged serpent, with a crested head and powerful claws. In classical mythology, a dangerous, often a supernatural serpent.&quot; &mdash;Standard Dictionary
The word _dragon_ is derived from the Greek word _drakōn_. This Greek word means &apos;to see&apos;. Ancient Greeks believe the _drakōn_ had incredible sight and could spot hiding prey no matter how well hid.
There is no doubt as to the significance of the dragon symbolizing the devil as the dragon is a symbol of a power that is harmful, wicked, evil, tyrannous and murderous. The devil is a hideous blood-thirsty monster, always &quot;seeking whom he may devour&quot; (1 Peter 5:8).
Understand, this dragon is a terrible creature that delights in attacking, terrifying and devouring. It is especially determined to attack and destroy the truth of God&apos;s Word.
> Matthew 13:19&mdash;&quot;When any one heareth the Word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.&quot;
> Luke 8:12&mdash;&quot;Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.&quot;
> 1 Peter 5:8&mdash;&quot;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:&quot;
### It is &quot;A Great Dragon&quot;
While the picture in general is that of a dragon, it is altogether peculiar and different from the common dragon. It exceeds the ordinary idea in size and bulk, and every dragon feature is greatly magnified. The dragon is &quot;great&quot; in its evil accomplishment and great in its power to kill. It is &quot;a great&hellip; dragon.&quot;
&quot;Megas&quot; &mdash; &quot;Great&quot;means mighty of external form, mighty in degree and intensity, mighty of rank (whether of persons or angels) of all those who have positions of authority and power
Here is a being that has dared to set himself against the Almighty God. This &quot;dragon&quot; is trying to overcome Him and take over the universe by taking from the Creator His own creation.
#### The devil has the power of death.
He has the power to put to death.
> Heb. 2: 14 - Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
The devil&apos;s ability to cause and create terrible afflictions is seen throughout the Bible, but the devil&apos; power to kill was greatly limited by Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The Law of God itself demanded death of EVERY soul that sinned. Now, because Christ paid the debt of death for the Believer, the devil has lost any legal claim to lives of the repentant. There is no such security for the unrepentant sinner.
> Although the devil had the power of death, it was through death that Christ defeated him! &mdash;James Reynolds Sr.
#### The devil has the ability to deceive.
He is great in his ability to deceive and destroy. The devil has the ability to deceive the whole world.
> Revelation 12:9&mdash;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
What a power of deception must lie in him who deceives angels to follow him!
### It is &quot;A Great Red Dragon&quot;
![](/assets/revelation/red-hexagons.png)
It is &quot;red,&quot; seemingly for two reasons. The first is to enhance his terrible appearance. The second is suggestive of his murderous, destructive character. It is a peculiar color.&quot;Purrhos&quot; &mdash; &quot;Red&quot; &mdash; fiery &mdash; bloody &mdash; the color of blood &mdash; murder. This was the color of the horse whose rider was to take peace out of the world, and bring about terrible war and bloodshed.
> Revelation 6:4&mdash;&quot;And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.&quot;
Jesus said the devil was a murderer from the beginning, and could not tell the truth.
> Jn. 8:44 &quot;Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.&quot;
> &quot;There has never been a murder, but he (the devil) caused it.&quot;&mdash;Dr. J. A. Seiss
Fiery red also indicates the destructive and cruel nature of the dragon. The dragon is burning like fire with rage and out of control with malignant hatred against that which is righteous and godly.
### It has &quot;Seven Heads&quot;
Seven is a number of completeness, or fullness. This indicates the fullness of evil and wickedness. Dragons ordinarily were given one head, but this dragon possesses &quot;seven heads.&quot; Two heads would indicate confusion. Here there are seven heads. &quot;Seven heads&quot; also reveal a total and complete state of confusion. The head is the seat of governing power and it implies rule and control. The fact there are seven heads should be understood in the same sense that we read of &quot;the seven Spirits of God&quot; &mdash; a manifold unity. We have here in these heads the symbol of the entire imperial reign and rule of this world from the beginning of time to the end of this present age.
Three times the Lord calls the devil &quot;&hellip;the prince of this world.&quot;
> Jn. 12:31 &quot;&hellip;Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&quot;
> Jn. 14:30 &quot;&hellip;For the prince of this world cometh&hellip;&quot;
> Jn. 16:11 &quot;&hellip;Because the prince of this world is judged.&quot;
The Apostle Paul called him the &quot;god of this world.&quot;
> II Cor. 4:4 &quot;&hellip;The god of this world hath blinded the minds&hellip;&quot;
> 1 John 5:19 &quot;&hellip;The whole world lieth in wickedness.&quot;
> 1 John 5:19&mdash;&quot;The whole world (around us) is under the power of the evil one.&quot; (The Amplified Bible)
The image before us presents the dragon having dominion over the governments of this world. Therefore, through these world powers, he sets himself against the kingdom of God and all that is good and right.
### It has &quot;Seven Crowns upon his Heads&quot;
The &quot;heads&quot; being &quot;crowned&quot; would indicate at least to some degree, that he has been successful in his diabolical attacks.
#### Successful in Deceiving &mdash; A Crown
> Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon&hellip; called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;&quot;
#### Successful in Dividing &mdash; A Crown

He is the destroyer of both body and soul. He seduceth and misleads the whole world, promising everything including peace and prosperity, so that he can more effectively enslave and destroy.
### It has &quot;Ten Horns&quot;
&quot;Ten&quot; signifies the perfection of Divine Order. This is in contrast to that of an evil, wicked being, so this would be in reverse of the Divine Order; complete and total disorder.
&quot;Keras&quot; &mdash; &quot;Horns&quot; are symbolic of strength, power, dominion and kingly rule &mdash; kings and their kingdoms.
> Dan.7: 24 - And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&hellip;;
Dan. 8:20 - The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings&hellip;
These &quot;horns&quot; are not symbols of good rule but of evil power to hurt, wound, afflict and destroy. The forces which destroyedPalestinewere referred to as &quot;four horns&quot; in Zech. 1: 18&mdash;21 They scattered, oppressed, injured and destroyed the people of God. Likewise, the &quot;horns&quot; of the dragon scatter, divide, oppress, torment, injure, afflict, destroy and kill the believers in Christ.
### It has A Tail
> Rev. 4: 12 &quot;&hellip;His tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:&hellip;
His tail is certainly one of the most striking features of the dragon. It swings through heaven drawing a third part of the stars and casts them to the ground. These &quot;stars of heaven&quot; are very particular stars. They are not literal stars, for the whole scene is a &quot;sign.&quot; These were the angelic hosts, fitly called stars by reason of their brightness, shinning beauty and glory.
> Job 38: 4&mdash;7 &quot;Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
When Lucifer fell and became the devil, he was able to deceive and draw away a third part of the angels with him.
> Jude 6 &quot;&hellip;Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation&hellip;
> 2 Peter 2: 4 &mdash; &hellip; God spared not the angels that sinned&hellip;
His tail is symbolic of his ability to deceive not only angels, but also humanity (including Believers). The devil has been successful in deceiving or &apos;drawing away&apos; many saints of God. Many who secured a home in Heaven through Christ's atonement and their faith in His blood will let go of that faith and follow after the devil.
> Matthew 24:24&mdash;For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
> Revelation 19:20&mdash;And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
## The Mystery of the Dragon
The dragon is not altogether that great a mystery because of:
> Rev. 12: 9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
The devil is not literally a dragon, as the Church is not literally a woman, but these are divinely given images or symbols. There is a devil. John recorded here that the dragon was the devil.
> &hellip;The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;
This is a great contrast from his original state.
> Isa. 14: 12 &quot;How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground&hellip;&quot;
> Eze. 28: 14 &quot;Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth&hellip;&quot; He was the highest order of all God&apos;s creation.
> Eze. 28: 15 &quot;Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created&hellip;&quot;
> Eze. 28: 17 &quot;Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness&hellip;&quot;
Perfect in &quot;Beauty&quot; &mdash; Full of &quot;Wisdom&quot; &mdash; Clothed in &quot;Brightness&quot; (Light &mdash; Truth &mdash; Righteousness)
Lucifer fell from the anointed cherub that covereth, to a murderous dragon. What happened? What caused this terrible change? God did not make a dragon (devil); He created Lucifer &mdash; &quot;The light bearer.&quot; God created him with a free will to choose to do good or evil. He was not the devil, but he became the devil through the desire to be like God, or to be God.
The dragon has great power.
* Power over the nations Lk. 4: 6* Power of the air Eph. 2: 2* Power and signs II Thes. 2: 9* Power of death Heb. 2: 14
> Jude 9 - Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord rebuke thee.
Lucifer is of the highest order of angelic beings, but is subordinate to God. Some compare the dragon in Rev. 12 to the Beast coming up out of the sea in Rev. 13\. In Rev. 12, the seven heads wear the crowns. In Rev. 13, it is the horns that are crowned. The dragon is the head of a spiritual empire while the Beast is the head of a physical empire. This portrays a concentration of, and the exercise of, the devil&apos;s diabolical power in and through the world powers.
There is a likeness between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil. There is also the distinction between them because one works in the spiritual realm and the other works in the physical realm.
## The Objects of The Dragon&apos;s Malignity
Rev. 12:4 &quot;&hellip;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;
### The First Objective is to Devour the &apos;Man-Child'
To destroy and devour the &quot;Man-Child,&quot; the devil would have to destroy the message (the Truth of the Word) that produces the &quot;Man-Child.&quot; If there ever was a message that the devil hates, it is this message of the &quot;Man-Child&quot; &mdash; the message ofovercoming&mdash; the message ofperfection. Jesus said:
> Matt.13:19 &quot;Then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown&hellip;
The power of the Word is &quot;&hellip;made of none effect&hellip;&quot; (Rom.4: 14) in the lives of those that &quot;&hellip;understandeth it not.&quot; (Matt. 13:19)
When the Word is received and understood, it will produce the characteristics of Christ in the life of the believer. The Word produces to the extent that it is believed and obeyed. Jesus said by the same &quot;Word&quot; some would produce &quot;&hellip;thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred&hellip;&quot;
> Mk. 4:20 &quot;&hellip;Such as hear the Word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.&quot;
The Scripture speaks of some as babes, some as children and some of mature age.
> Heb. 5:12&mdash;14 &quot;For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the Word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&quot;
The &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be a ruling body of Overcomers that will be given power to rule the nations.
> Rev. 2:26, 27 &quot;And he that overcometh, and keepeth My works unto the end,tohim will I give powerover the nations: Andhe shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:even as I received of My Father.&quot;
Psa. 2:9 &quot;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&apos;s vessel.&quot;
Here we see Christ ruling with the rod of iron. It is said that Rev. 12 has to be Christ because they believe He is the only one that is ruling with the rod of iron. The Overcomer has this promise of being given this power to rule the nations with a rod of iron.
The devil will try to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; as soon as he is born, but the &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be &quot;&hellip;caught up unto God, and to His throne.&quot; This is the promise to the Overcomer.
> Rev. 3:21 &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.&quot;
The dragon&apos;s desire is to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; who is destined to &quot;&hellip;rule all the nations with a rod of iron&hellip;&quot; that the dragon has ruled over. All satanic activities are carried out under the ambitious motive to rule and to be worshipped. Does the devil know he will lose this place?
When this objective failed, he attacked the Woman.
### The Second Objective is to Devour the &quot;Woman&quot;
> Rev. 12:13 &quot;And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.&quot;
In the Gospel according to St. Luke, Jesus spoke of the great and awful signs of the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation Hour.
> Lk. 21:12 &quot;But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;
&quot;Basileus&quot; &mdash; &quot;King&quot; &mdash; a sovereign &mdash; ruler &mdash; dictator (kings are not presidents)
Several years ago the Lord showed me in a dream that the Church was going to go through &quot;Great Persecution.&quot; The Church is persecuted for three-and-a-half years to bring her to a place of separation from the world and complete dedication to the Lord.
> Rev. 12:6 &quot;And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.&quot; (Three-and-a-half years)
Rev. 12:15 &quot;And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood (false doctrine) after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood (false doctrine).&quot;
When this failed, he attacked the &quot;remnant of her seed.&quot;
### The Third Objective is to Destroy the Seed
> Rev. 12:17 &quot;And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed&hellip;&quot;
The &quot;remnant of her seed&quot; is the saints that are left after the Rapture of the Church, which takes place in the middle of the Tribulation Hour. These saints find themselves facing the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. They are represented by the foolish virgins that neglected their experience. They will have to wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and will come out of Great Tribulation.
> Rev. 7:9 &quot;After this (the sealing of the 144,000 Jews) I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;&quot;
Rev. 7:13, 14 &quot;And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of Great Tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;
## The Destiny of the Dragon
### Cast out of Heaven
> Rev. 12:8 &quot;&hellip;Neither was their place found any more in heaven.&quot;
Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&quot;
The devil&apos;s place was not left empty, but was found no more. The &quot;Man-Child&quot; now occupies that place.
### Bound in the Bottomless Pit
> Rev. 20:1&mdash;3 &quot;And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;
### Loosed a Little Season
The dragon will be loosed for a short season. He goes forth and deceives many nations.
> Rev. 20:3 &quot;&hellip;And after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;
Rev. 20:7, 8 &quot;And when the thousand years are expired, satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.&quot;
### Cast Ultimately into the Lake of Fire
The dragon will eventually be cast into the lake of fire, where he shall be tormented forever, and forever.
> Rev. 20:10 &quot;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.&quot;


<h1>The War in Heaven, Rev. 12:7-12</h1>
<blockquote>And there was war in Heaven</blockquote>

<h2>The Fact of a War in Heaven</h2>

<h3>A Fantastic Story?</h3>

<p>Skeptics ridicule the idea of a literal war, and are astonished that reasonable men should believe in such an event. They believe the idea of a &ldquo;War in Heaven&rdquo; belongs only in works of fiction.</p>

<h3>A Broad Symbol?</h3>

<h4>The Moral Conflicts in the Church</h4>
<p>Others believe that this &ldquo;War in Heaven&rdquo; is a poetical and epic account of certain moral conflicts in the history of the Christian Church on earth.</p>

<h4>The Power Struggle in the Roman Empire</h4>
<p>Others believe the Dragon to mean the Pagan Roman Empire; Michael, the Christian Roman Empire; Heaven, the throne of the Roman Emperors; and the war in Heaven, the conflicts between the Pagan and Christian Roman Emperors.</p>

<h4>The War Between &ldquo;Good and Evil&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Also, some teach that we are not to believe that this was an actual event, but a sort of a summary of the prolonged battle between good and evil.</p>

<h3>A Definitive Strike!</h3>
<p>Verse 7 states, &quot;And there was war in Heaven:&quot;, clearly communicating that John saw a &ldquo;war in heaven&rdquo;. There have been many battles&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>The last great conflict when the devil was cast out of heaven, there was a battle in Eden. There the devil deceived man and he lost his position with God.</li>
<li>There was a battle in hell when Christ fought and won redemption for man. He has, &ldquo;the keys of hell and of death.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip;, but this is WAR. John is not witnessing a battle, but a war, where (on the Earthly Front) the redeemed of humanity lay claim to the fullness of redemption, and (on the Heavenly Front) Michael and his angels, cast out the devil.</p>

<p>In multiple places the Scripture describes satan&apos;s current estate allowing him liberty enough to accuse the righteous (compare Revelation 12:10; Job 1:9; 2:5; Zechariah 3:1-7; Luke 22:31; 2 Corinthians 12:7). John sees here a definite and decisive war that removes the &lsquo;plaintiff&rsquo; from Heaven&apos;s courtroom!</p>

<h2>The Cause of The War in Heaven</h2>

<p>If the war John saw is a definitive and specific war (to be contrasted with the ongoing spiritual battles we face), it raises the question: &ldquo;What causes this war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the struggle between the devil and the people of God on this earth is long and old, something new has to happen to spark the epic conflict in Heaven. Consider the relationship of the two following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Man Child is Triumphantly Enthroned</li>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:5&mdash;And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</blockquote>

<li>Lucifer&apos;s Place is Permanently Erased</li>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:8,9a&mdash;And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was cast out&hellip;</blockquote>
</ul>

<p>What caused the War in Heaven? John saw Heaven foreclose on the devil, and the devil placed under the overcomer&apos;s feet! God kept His promise and the devil had to see it coming.</p>
<blockquote>Romans 16:20a&mdash;And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly&hellip;</blockquote>

<h2>The Forces of The War in Heaven (12:7)</h2>
<h3>Michael and his Angels</h3>

<p>Some believe Michael to be Christ. This theory begs the question, &ldquo;Why did Micahel say, &lsquo;The Lord rebuke thee&rsquo;?&rdquo; (Jude 9).</p>
<p>This is a heavenly host charged to defend and minister to the heirs of salvation (Hebrews 1:14).</p>

<h3>The Dragon and his Angels</h3>
<p>A great malignant kingdom, and a vast spiritual empire of evil, stands opposed to God's people (Ephesians 6:11,12). His angels are those that kept not their first estate but followed Satan in his fall (Jude 6).</p>

<h3>The Man Child (The Overcomer)</h3>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:11&mdash;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 3:21&mdash;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</blockquote>

<p>The War in Heaven is with and on behalf of the &quot;child.&quot; The devil will accuse the Believer before God for the LAST time.</p>

<h2>The Nature of The War in Heaven</h2>
<h3>The War is spiritual and not physical in nature.</h3>

<p>There are battles going on in the physical world in many different places. This is a spiritual war that will take place in the heavens.</p>

<p>The forces that are engaged are spiritual. The War is waged in the realm of &quot;Heaven.&quot; We see no loss of life nor bloodshed in this War. (NOTE: Those that loved not their lives unto the death were martyred BEFORE this war.) Instead, there is loss of &quot;place&quot; or &quot;position&quot;.</p>

<h3>It is a war of faith and knowledge.</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 12:11&mdash;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</blockquote>

<p>It is a war of believing and overcoming saints, supported by angels, against a malignant and hellish intellect inflamed with desperate hate and anger. In the conflict of Christ with the devil in the wilderness, the devil attacked His faith and His understanding. Like Christ, the overcomer knows, believes and fights for who he is in God. We can compare the dragon&apos;s contesting the Man Child&apos;s position on the throne with Zechariah 3:1-7.</p>

<h2>The Outcome of The War in Heaven</h2>
<h3>The Dragon is defeated.</h3>
<p>With all his wisdom and power, and all the fury of his hosts, the effort is disastrous, &quot;The dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Dragon loses his &quot;place,&quot; vs. 8.</h3>
<blockquote>&quot;Neither was their place found any more in heaven.&quot;</blockquote>

<h3>The Dragon is cast out, vs. 9.</h3>
<blockquote>&quot; And the great dragon was cast out,&quot; vs. 12.</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! For the devil is come down.&quot;</p>

<h3>The man-child is victorious.</h3>
<p>Sits on the throne. Reigning and ruling with Christ.</p>

<h1>The Woman in the Wilderness, Rev. 12:6; 13-16</h1>

<p>REVIEW: Verses 1 and 5 described the Woman as being "clothed with the sun", "having the moon under her feet", "upon her head a crown of twelve stars" and from out of her is produced the Man Child. We believe these details and the fact the this book is to be interpreted as prophecy identify this Woman as the Church or Body of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>The Flight of the Woman, vs. 6,13-16</h2>

<h3>The Reason For Her Flight, vs.13.</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 12:12&mdash;Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</blockquote>

<p>She makes her flight to the wilderness because she is persecuted ("dioko" to put to flight, drive away, to pursue) by the Dragon. Satan being ejected from heaven, by the Man Child with the aid of Michael and his angels, turns his wrath and venom on the woman. Satan persecutes the woman for two reasons: </p>

<h4>Having been cast out of heaven the Man Child is out of his reach.</h4>
<h4>The woman is to be "blamed" for bringing forth the Man Child.</h4>
<p>Notice that the dragon's attention is on the Man Child and readies to pounce as soon as the Man Child is brought forth. The Dragon is not concerned with the Woman until He is defated and cast down to the earth. His attack on the Against the Woman is an act of defiant rage.</p>

<h1>The Remnant (12:17)</h1>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:17&mdash;And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the <u>remnant of her seed</u>, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</blockquote>

<p>This study concerns the &quot;Seed of the Woman&quot; and the war the dragon wages against them. Though completely defeated in his attempt to destroy the Man Child and the Woman, the rage of the dragon has not lessened. Because the Man Child and the Woman are now out of his reach, the dragon makes war with the Remnant of the Woman's Seed.</p>

<h2>The Remnant of Her Seed</h2>

<h3>The Remnant Identified</h3>

<h4>A Counter View</h4>

<p>Most that believe the Woman is Israel and not the Church, also conclude that the "Remnant" are a part of Israel who were left behind when the Woman fled into the Wilderness. This is a natural and logical conclusion if the Woman is believed to be Israel and that ALL Gentile Believers have already been &quot;caught out&quot; before this time. Clarence Larkin claimed &quot;When the Church is caught out no REMNANT is left behind, all that are "IN CHRIST" are taken away;&hellip;&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Larkin&apos;s claim is possible if no distinctions are made within the saints and all saints (regardless of spiritual maturity and level of obedience) will enjoy an identical reward. This statement appears to ignore the Scriptural truths that there are definite stages of Spiritual Development (For more on this topic see: 
	<a href="">&quot:The Born Again&quot;</a>, 
	<a href="">&quot:The Body of Christ&quot;</a> and 
	<a href="">&quot:The Bride of Christ&quot;</a>) and that God reserves promises relative to Spiritual Development. (See 
	<a href="dbi/courses/the-bride-of-christ/the-difference-between-the-church-and-the-bride_11">The Difference Between the Church and the Bride</a>)
</p>

<h4>Adopted View</h4>

<p>The premise we adopted in the beginning of our study of Revelation 12 is that the Woman is indeed the Church. See notes on <a href="/dbi/courses/revelation/the-sun-clothed-woman_73">The Sun-Clothed Woman</a> for explanation.</p>

<p>The "&hellip;Remnant of her seed&hellip;" are the true Believers in Christ who are left after the Rapture of the Church (they had no oil in their vessel at midnight when the Bridegrooom came and were left behind). These held fast the confession of their faith in Christ Jesus and are a separated people from the prevailing abomination of that time.</p>

<h3>The Remnant Defined</h3>

<p>"The remnant of her seed" means the children of the "Woman." This "remnant" are the born again believers (the family of God) who are converts of the Church (The Woman). The "remnant" is that which remains &ndash; that which is left out of the whole &ndash; that which is left from the Rapture of the Church.</p>


<p>God reserves promises relative to Spiritual Development.</p>

<li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/sinner.png' width='25px' height='25px'/><b> (The Sinner - The World)</b> Of all the good promises of God there is reserved only the promise of the hope of salvation IF the sinner repents and condemnation if he does not.</li>

 <li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/saved.png' width='25px' height='25px'/><b> (The Remnant - The Born Again)</b> In John 3, only those Born Again may enter into the kingdom of God. The Born Again will enjoy all the promises given to those a part of the Family of God.</li>
 
 <li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/body.png' width='25px' height='25px'/><b> (The Woman - The Body of Christ)</b> In Matthew 25, all ten virgins slept (Revelation 3:16) and at midnight only the virgins with oil (a type of the Holy Ghost) went with the Bridegroom into the marriage. The Church which is Christ&apos;s Body will enjoy the promises given to the Born Again and those who have been Baptized into the Body by the Holy Ghost (1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:22,23).</li>
 
 <p>The baptism of the Spirit is required to be in the Church (His Body). The remnant had not been baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ (His Church; the Woman). Either these were never baptized or they had allowed their experience to go dry. Like the five foolish virgins, they were virgins, but they had allowed the oil to go dry. (Matthew 25:7,10)</p>
 
 <li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/bride.png' width='25px' height='25px'/><b> (The Man Child - The Bride of Christ)</b> In Luke 21:28,36, the promise of escaping the tribulation hour is reserved for those who are NOT asleep (&quot;watch&quot; - agrupnew - to be sleepless) and are ready. The Man Child as an Overcomer will enjoy every redemptive right and promise! (Revelation 19:7; 3:21)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are TRUE Believers and not merely those who profess to Believe. Notice, how there is a distinction made between the masses who confess Christ and those who"&hellip;keep the commandments of God."(Revelation 12: 17)</p>
 
<blockquote>Matt. 7:21&ndash;23&mdash;Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.</blockquote>

<h2>The War Against Her Seed</h2>
<blockquote>
Revelation 12:17 "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed&hellip;"</blockquote>

<p>Defeated in his attack on the "Man-Child" (the Overcomers), and then defeated in his attack on the "Woman" (the Church), the dragon changes his focus and enters into a deadly war with the converts of the "Woman," "her seed."</p>

<h3>The Means the Dragon Uses in This War</h3>
<h4>The Anti-christ</h4>
<p>The anti-christ will be the head of the one world government.</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:7 "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them&hellip;"</blockquote>

<h4>The False Religion</h4>
<p>The false religion is the system, which is practiced by the false prophet, bringing all the denominations of the world into one church. This one-world church will be government-controlled and government sponsored and headed up by the false prophet, who causes all to worship the "beast."</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:11&ndash;15 "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."</blockquote>

<h4>The Economy</h4>
<p>A government-controlled one world monetary system will be introduced. No one will be able to buy or sell unless they fit into the government-controlled system and receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead. There will not be a money exchange system, as we know it. There will be a transfer of credits through the computers, and without the mark you will not be able to transact business. This will force many to receive the mark.</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:16, 17 "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 16:2 "And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image."</p>
<p>Revelation 19:20 "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast,andthemthat worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."</p>

<h3>The Effects of the War</h3>
<h4>Great Tribulation</h4>
<p>"Megas Thlipsis" &ndash; "Great Tribulation" &ndash; exceeding great affliction &ndash; to suffer affliction &ndash; primarily means a pressuring</p>
<p>The Great Tribulation indicates a definite period of time, which was spoken of by the Lord, which precedes His Second Advent. The Second Advent is the "Epiphany," the revelation of Christ coming back to take over the kingdoms of this world. This is not the secret coming in the air where He raptures the Church.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:29, 30 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."</blockquote>

<p>The believers will be greatly persecuted.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:21 "For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 2:22 "Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation, except they repent of their deeds."</p>
<p>Revelation 3:10 "Because thou hast kept the Word of My patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."</p>

<h4>Saints Overcome</h4>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:7 "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them&hellip;"</blockquote>

<p>The "Man-Child" (the Overcomers) overcame the dragon.</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 12:11 "&hellip;They overcame him&hellip;"</blockquote>

<p>"The Woman" (the Church) escaped the dragon's attacks by a great miracle. However, these saints that were left behind during the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation are attacked and overcome by the dragon's murderous assaults. Permission was "given" (Revelation 13: 7) to the dragon and to the false-christ to make war with the saints and to overcome them. These saints are not Jews only, for the Scripture says, "over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 7:9 "&hellip;Of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues."</blockquote>

<h4>Many Martyrs</h4>
<p>Many of the saints that are left behind and go into the "Great Tribulation" will give their lives as martyrs, because they refused to give up their faith in Christ Jesus the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:9 "Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for My name's sake."</blockquote>
<blockquote>John 16:2&mdash;They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 6:9&ndash;11&mdash;And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 7:9&ndash;14&mdash;After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the Throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 14:12,13&mdash;Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</blockquote>

<h4>The Martyrs' Reward (Revelation 7:15-17)</h4>

<h5>They are Before the Throne of God</h5>
<h5>They Serve Him&hellip; in HisTemple</h5>
<h5>They Dwell with Him that Sits on the Throne</h5>
<h5>They Shall Hunger No More</h5>
<h5>They Neither Thirst Anymore</h5>
<h5>They Shall No More be Scorched with the Heat</h5>
<h5>They Shall be Fed by the Lamb Himself</h5>
<h5>They Shall be Lead unto Living Fountains of Waters</h5>
<h5>They Shall Have No More Tears</h5>
