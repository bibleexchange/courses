## <div id="1"/>1. Savior and Coming Again (Revelation 1:5-8)

- with clouds (judgment, people)

## <div id="2"/>2. The Glorified Christ (Revelation 1:9-20)

THE WITNESS: HOW did John Hear and See -- Received in the Spirit and to be understood only by the Spirit

> 8 times in Revelation:  Re 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith ....

- 1. His Voice (a great voice, as of a trumpet, his voice as the sound of many waters) It was clearly a VOICE that John heard but it was LIKE a TRUMPET--urgent, clear, strong, awakening, and startling.

<p>God revealed Himself to Moses, on Mt.Sinai "voice of a trumpet exceeding loud." (Exodus 19:16) The Temple opened its doors in the morning at the sound of the trumpet. The Year of Jubilee came with the sound of the trumpet. Lev. 25:9,10 The Silence of the Age will be broken by the sound of a trumpet.
</p>

<blockquote>I Thessalonians 4:16--The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised.</blockquote>

- 2. His Age (I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last)
- 3. His Vocation (His place is found <b>in the midst</b> of his church (PROPHET, PRIEST, KING)

<p><b>"Golden"</b>
<b>GREAT COST</b>. The candlesticks were composed of the costliest metal.

<b>GREAT BEAUTY</b>. The tabernacle use filled with the use of gold. Gold is expressive of Godliness.

Psalm 96:9-- O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>

- 4. His Divinity - the Christ (one like unto the Son of man, > I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; ,  and have the keys of hell and of death.

- 5. His Clothing (clothed with a garment down to the foot,  and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. ( a golden belt Ephesisans 6 truth) - FULLY CLOTHED - Clothing Signified Status

- 6. His Appearance

<ul>
<li>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;</li>

<p>His Wisdom and "ELDER"ness. Also a reminder of redemption  (sins red like crimson "white as snow")</p>
<blockquote>Isa 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</blockquote>

<li>his eyes were as a flame of fire;</li>

<blockquote>Re 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. (innermost parts)</blockquote>

<li>his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace;</li>
<li>his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</li>
<li><b>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.</b></li>

## <div id="3"/>3. The Head of His Church (Revelation 2 & 3)

> Revelation 2:1 &mdash; Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

## <div id="4"/>4. The Lamb in the Midst of the Throne (Revelation 5-8)

> Revelation 5:5,6 &mdash; 5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

<blockquote>Revelation 22:3&mdash;And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</blockquote>

> Revelation 7:17 &mdash;  For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. [innumberable number out of great tribulation]

<h1>The Nature of the Victor, vs. 5-7</h1>
<p>The Book's Opener is presented as a Victor!</p>
<blockquote>Revelaton 5:5 - And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</blockquote>
<h3>A lion</h3>
<blockquote>v. 5 "Lion of the tribe of Judah"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Root of David"</blockquote>
<p>Being of the Root of David, his prowess is of no coincidence. It is by PROMISE and therefore Divine appointment.</p>

> Revelation 22:16 - I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.

<p>He is both ROOT and OFFSPRING of David! By nature, Jesus is the ROOT of David and by divine incarnation he is the offspring of David. David, the greatly revered and legendary king of Israel, received his authority from this same Jesus!</p>

<h3>A lamb</h3>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Stood a lamb"</blockquote>
<p>A lion in power, but a lamb in nature. Notice:</p>
<h4>He is standing</h4>
<p>Because He is not dead, but alive.</p>
<p>Because He is accepted.</p>
<p>Because of us, on our behalf.</p>
<h4>He is a sacrificial lamb</h4>
<blockquote>v. 6 "A lamb as it had been slain"</blockquote>
<h4>His has perfect power and strength</h4>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Having seven horns"</blockquote>
<h4>He has perfect and universal intelligence</h4>
<blockquote>"And seven eyes"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Which are the seven spirits of God"</blockquote>
<h4>He has unlimited rights v. 7</h4>

The Lion Who will Return in Judgment Revelation 19:11-15

## <div id="5"/>5. The Mystery Angel (Revelation 8:3-5)

John sees seven angels &quot;which stood before God&quot; and then he mentions &quot;another&quot; angel. Who is this &quot;mystery angel&quot;

### The Nature of &quot;The Angel&quot;

&quot;Another&quot; (allos) means different. This same phrase is used in Revelation 7:2; 10:14-17; 18:1; 20:1. The word "angel" means messenger of God.

### The Office of &quot;The Angel&quot;

This &quot;angel&quot; is the Angel of the Lord. He offers the prayers of saints. You cannot give something unless you have it. He had to receive them to give them. Angels do not receive worship, but &quot;the Angel of the Lord&quot; does. (Gen. 16:7,13; Ex. 3:2-5; Joshua 5:13-15).

There are many passages in which the expression the &quot;angel of God&quot; or &quot;angel of the Lord&quot; is definitely for a manifestation of God Himself. Compare Genesis 22:11-12; 22:15-19; Exodus 3:2-6.

### The Ministry of The Angel

Scripture itself presents us with details that tell us that this Angel is the Lord:

<h4>The First Proof - He had &quot;a Golden censer&quot;</h4>

<p>This instrument was used by the priests, in the ministry of the worship of God. However, it was used only by the high priest in the holy place. This indicating our great High Priest who is now entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. We remember that that this is a scene in Heaven.</p>

<h4>The Second Proof -He offers the Prayers of Saints before God.</h4>

<p>vs. 3 &quot;All Saints&quot;. There is no record of such an office found in the scripture as being assigned to angels, however, there is record of this office being executed by the Lord Jesus. Eph. 2:18 I Tim. 2:5 Heb. 7:25; Heb. 13:15 I Peter 2:5 I John 2:1;</p>

<h4>The Third Proof - He casts fire on the earth.</h4>

<p>Verse 5 tells us the fire is taken from the altar.</p>
<blockquote>Luke 12:49 -- I [Jesus] came to send fire upon the earth. </blockquote> 
<p>This fire is a symbol of the Divine Presence and Power. (Exodus 3:2 Deuteronomy 4:36 Psalm 50:3 97:3; Isaiah 66:15-16; Acts 2:3) </p>
<p>This fire is an Instrument of Divine Judgment. The action indicated here by the casting into the earth speaks of judgment. (Genesis 19:24; Leviticus 10:2; Numbers 11:1; 16:35; Malachi 4:1; 2 Kings 1:10; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 2 Peter 3:10)</p>

<h4>The Fourth Proof - To offer incense with prayers. vs. 3-4</h4>

<p>&quot;Given unto Him much Incense.&quot;It was given to Him through merit. For without His death and atoning work coupled with His pure and Holy life, there would be no force in prayer. God hears us because of Him. </p>

<p>The Compounding of the incense is given with great precision in the Old Testament. It was to be made of specific ingredients in exact proportion (Exodus 30:34). Any compound that did not meet the exact specifications given by God was to be rejected as strange incense (Exodus 30:9). It was to be tempered with salt as it was holy and was never to be used for ordinary purposes. Any one who tried to duplicate this incense for themselves was to be cut off from his people (Exodus 30:38).</p>

## <div id="6"/>6. The Lamb Stand on Mount Sion (Revelation 14:1-5)

### INTRODUCTION

Revelation 13 concludes with a gloomy tale of a reign of darkness. In Chapter 13 we read of two terrible beasts and their great deception against those who would receive the Beast&apos;s mark. Chapter 14 opens with a glorious scene featuring firstly the Lamb and secondly 144,000 redeemed souls who were marked, but it was God the Father's name on their forehead! We find the details surrounding the Song of this 144,000 in Revelation 14:1-5.</p>

### The Lamb on Mount Sion (vs. 1)

<blockquote>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion,</blockquote>

#### The Lamb
<p>The &quot;Lamb&quot; appears in 27 verses throughout Revelation and His identity cannot be mistaken!</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 5:6&mdash;And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood <strong>a Lamb</strong> as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote> John 1:29&mdash;The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</blockquote>

- the Lamb that was slain
- unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
- the wrath of the Lamb:
- made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
- overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
- the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

#### Standing in the midst of the Throne


<h5>And the four beasts, and the elders (5:6)</h5>
<h5>With the Sealed Book [WAS slain!] (5:8; 6:1)</h5>
<h5>With Wrath (6:16)</h5>


<h5>With an Innumerable Multitude worshipping before Him (7:9)</h5>
<h5>Feeding and Leading the Innumerable Multitude (7:17)</h5>
<h5>Overcoming those that Make War with Him (17:14)</h5>
<h5>Marrying His Bride (19:7; 21:9)</h5>
<h5>As the Temple (21:22)</h5>
<h5>As the Light (21:23)</h5>
<h5>Having a Book of Life (21:27)</h5>
<h5>Having a Pure River of Water Proceeding out of His Throne (22:1)</h5>
<h3>Standing on Mount Sion</h3>
<blockquote>Psalm 87&mdash;His foundation is in the holy mountains. 2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. 6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.</blockquote>
<p>Matthew 21:5 and John 12:15 say to Tell the daughter of Sion that her King is coming to her! Hebrews 12:22 says the Believer has not come to a smoking and burning physical mountain that cannot be touched but unto Mount Sion the City of the Living God.</p>
<blockquote>Hebrews 12:22&mdash;But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;zion&quot; expresses ideas of strength and permanence such as a fortress, monument, or landmark.</p>
<p>Zion is called both the city of David (1 Kings 8:1; 1 Chronicles 11:5; 2 Chronicles 5:2) and the city of God. The fortress was considered so impenetrable they mocked David saying he would not be able to take fortress even with blind and lamb sentries on guard. David captured the Jebusite fortress in 2 Samuel 5:7:</p>
<blockquote>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</blockquote>
<p>Mount Zion is also the highest and southernmost mount of Jerusalem, rising about twenty-five hundred feet above the Mediterranean, but Scripture emphasizes Mount Zion more as a Spiritual concept and less as a physical place. Mount Zion is most importantly understood as the people of God.</p>
<blockquote>Psalm 48:2&mdash;Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.</blockquote>
<h2>The 144,000 (vs. 1-2)</h2>
<p>and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</p>
<p>2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p>

<h2>A New Song (vs. 3-5)</h2>
<blockquote>3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</blockquote>

## <div id="7"/>7. Will Be Wed (Revelation 19)


- The Bridegroom Who Will be Wed (vs. 7-10)

## <div id="8"/>8. Revelation 20:1-10 [**King of Righteousness**](#8)

Satan Sealed in a Bottomless Pit (vs. 1-3)

Re 20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

###Souls Living and Reigning with Christ 1000 Years (vs. 4-6)

(covered in future lesson)

###Following the 1000 Years (vs. 7-10)

After the 1000 year reign, the devil be released, deceive the nations and finally face his doom.

#### Satan will be released for a season (vs. 7)

Satan is loose, will then be bound, but released again and then punished. It seems like a great pity after 1,000 year of peace for the devil to be released, but it will be necessary. Verse 3 says that he "MUST BE LOOSED". There are three perspectives to consider when tackling this mystery.

##### The Perspective of the Devil

It will prove that no matter how much time goes by and opportunity given him, he will always be the devil. He doesn't improve. It will be righteous to judge him eternally.

##### The Perspective of Humanity

The nations during this 1,000 years need the grace and help of God, just as much as anyone. The loosing of the devil will prove that man's hasn't changed. The devil will still be deceiving and humanity that does not lean hard on God will still be deceived.

##### The Perspective of God

God will have exhausted every measure of grace throughout the dispensations of time. An eternal hell would not be justified for a loving God, unless He first extended every possible invitation. (He tried everything and gave His best.) There will be no regrets or "what if God had done something differently" in eternity.

#### Satan will deceive the nations (vs. 8)

He deceives the nations and terrible disaster ensues. It is the devil who has opened "Pandora's Box".

#### Satan will face his doom (vs. 9-10)

Hell was specially prepared for the devil. Mathew 25:41

### Great White Throne Judgment (vs. 11-15)




## <div id="9"/>9. The Lamb and New Jerusalem Reveation 22:22,23

The Lamb is the Temple

> 22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

The Lamb is the Light

> 23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
