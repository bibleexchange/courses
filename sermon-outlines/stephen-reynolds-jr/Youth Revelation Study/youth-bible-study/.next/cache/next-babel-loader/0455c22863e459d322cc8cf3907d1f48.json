God in his infinite wisdom has chosen to use the language of symbolism and imagery to communicate this Revelation. How can we unlock the symbolism of this book? Mainly by comparing scripture with scripture (2 Peter 1:20) do we understand its symbolism. This Revelation is profoundly positioned as the last book of the Bible. It not only contains prophecy of last things, but it is in its nature a climax to all Biblical revelation. We in part find understanding of the symbolism in Revelation by understanding previously given symbolism. Some examples include: 1) The Four Living Creatures Ezekiel 1:5; Revelation 4:6 2) The 7 Churches of Asia were both literal and symbolic. As the New Testament Epistles were relevant to a first century Church so they are still relevant today. 3) Water of Life John 4:14; Revelation 21:6 This Revelation with all its symbolism was given to John by God's \\\"angel\\\". John himself was puzzled as to the role of this \\\"angel\\\" and eventually falls at his feet in 22:8 to worship him. In verse 9, the angel rebuked him saying he was only a \\\"fellow servant\\\" and that John must only \\\"worship God\\\". The Believer must keep in constant remembrance amidst all the majesty of God's Grace that all the glory belongs to God and we are just \\\"His messengers\\\". ## The Scribe of this Book (1:2) > Revelation 1:1 \\u2026unto His servant John 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. ### The Apostle John ### He bare record (1:2; John 1:1-14) ### He gave witness (I John 1:1-3; 20:31)\", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n        children: \" The Value of this Book (1:3)\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 144,\n        columnNumber: 1\n      }, this), \"### It is rewarding \\\"Blessed\\\" - happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied #### \\\"He that readeth\\\" #### \\\"They that hear the words\\\" #### \\\"And keep those things which are written\\\" ### It is enlightening (22:10) > Revelation 22:10--Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.\", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n        children: \"The Premise of this Book(1:4-9)\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 154,\n        columnNumber: 1\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n        children: \"We will search out the source, subject, substance and circumstances of the book of Revelation.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 156,\n        columnNumber: 1\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n        children: \" The Sources of this Revelation (1:4,5)\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 158,\n        columnNumber: 1\n      }, this), \"### John He is the writer - the Scribe ### The Father \\\"Which is, which was, and which is to come.\\\" ### The Spirit \\\"From the seven Spirits which are before His throne;\\\" SEVEN: \\\"Hepta\\\" - signifying to be full - \\\"Pneuma\\\" \\\"Spirit\\\" .

It is not a 'literal' representation of the devil as he actually looks to the eye, but is 'figurative' of the devil's characteristics. The great red dragon is symbolic of the devil's destructive and murderous character. This wonder is a symbol of a fierce, hostile, evil power (satan) with which the Church has, and is, and must yet contend. This evil force is determined to hinder the progress of the Church and destroy her hopes. ## The Dragon ### The Image or \\\"Sign\\\" is that of a \\\"Dragon\\\" Dragon means 'huge serpent&rsquot. Dragons have often been the embodiment of the fear of the unknown. In Greek mythology, these giant serpents often guarded the far and unexplored parts of the earth. > DRAGON \\u2014 \\\"The dragon, figured prominently in ancient and medieval mythologies as an embodiment of evil principle. It has been superstitiously dreaded and even worshipped, as in China, where it is the imperial emblem. It is commonly represented as a large winged serpent, with a crested head and powerful claws. In classical mythology, a dangerous, often a supernatural serpent.\\\" \\u2014Standard Dictionary The word _dragon_ is derived from the Greek word _drak\\u014Dn_. This Greek word means 'to see'. Ancient Greeks believe the _drak\\u014Dn_ had incredible sight and could spot hiding prey no matter how well hid. There is no doubt as to the significance of the dragon symbolizing the devil as the dragon is a symbol of a power that is harmful, wicked, evil, tyrannous and murderous. The devil is a hideous blood-thirsty monster, always \\\"seeking whom he may devour\\\" (1 Peter 5:8). Understand, this dragon is a terrible creature that delights in attacking, terrifying and devouring. It is especially determined to attack and destroy the truth of God's Word. > Matthew 13:19\\u2014\\\"When any one heareth the Word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.\\\" > Luke 8:12\\u2014\\\"Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.\\\" > 1 Peter 5:8\\u2014\\\"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:\\\" ### It is \\\"A Great Dragon\\\" While the picture in general is that of a dragon, it is altogether peculiar and different from the common dragon. It exceeds the ordinary idea in size and bulk, and every dragon feature is greatly magnified. The dragon is \\\"great\\\" in its evil accomplishment and great in its power to kill. It is \\\"a great\\u2026 dragon.\\\" \\\"Megas\\\" \\u2014 \\\"Great\\\"means mighty of external form, mighty in degree and intensity, mighty of rank (whether of persons or angels) of all those who have positions of authority and power Here is a being that has dared to set himself against the Almighty God. This \\\"dragon\\\" is trying to overcome Him and take over the universe by taking from the Creator His own creation. #### The devil has the power of death. He has the power to put to death. > Heb. 2: 14 - Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; The devil's ability to cause and create terrible afflictions is seen throughout the Bible, but the devil' power to kill was greatly limited by Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The Law of God itself demanded death of EVERY soul that sinned. Now, because Christ paid the debt of death for the Believer, the devil has lost any legal claim to lives of the repentant. There is no such security for the unrepentant sinner. > Although the devil had the power of death, it was through death that Christ defeated him! \\u2014James Reynolds Sr. #### The devil has the ability to deceive. He is great in his ability to deceive and destroy. The devil has the ability to deceive the whole world. > Revelation 12:9\\u2014And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. What a power of deception must lie in him who deceives angels to follow him! ### It is \\\"A Great Red Dragon\\\" ![](/assets/revelation/red-hexagons.png) It is \\\"red,\\\" seemingly for two reasons. The first is to enhance his terrible appearance. The second is suggestive of his murderous, destructive character. It is a peculiar color.\\\"Purrhos\\\" \\u2014 \\\"Red\\\" \\u2014 fiery \\u2014 bloody \\u2014 the color of blood \\u2014 murder. This was the color of the horse whose rider was to take peace out of the world, and bring about terrible war and bloodshed. > Revelation 6:4\\u2014\\\"And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.\\\" Jesus said the devil was a murderer from the beginning, and could not tell the truth. > Jn. 8:44 \\\"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\\\" > \\\"There has never been a murder, but he (the devil) caused it.\\\"\\u2014Dr. J. A. Seiss Fiery red also indicates the destructive and cruel nature of the dragon. The dragon is burning like fire with rage and out of control with malignant hatred against that which is righteous and godly. ### It has \\\"Seven Heads\\\" Seven is a number of completeness, or fullness. This indicates the fullness of evil and wickedness. Dragons ordinarily were given one head, but this dragon possesses \\\"seven heads.\\\" Two heads would indicate confusion. Here there are seven heads. \\\"Seven heads\\\" also reveal a total and complete state of confusion. The head is the seat of governing power and it implies rule and control. The fact there are seven heads should be understood in the same sense that we read of \\\"the seven Spirits of God\\\" \\u2014 a manifold unity. We have here in these heads the symbol of the entire imperial reign and rule of this world from the beginning of time to the end of this present age. Three times the Lord calls the devil \\\"\\u2026the prince of this world.\\\" > Jn. 12:31 \\\"\\u2026Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.\\\" > Jn. 14:30 \\\"\\u2026For the prince of this world cometh\\u2026\\\" > Jn. 16:11 \\\"\\u2026Because the prince of this world is judged.\\\" The Apostle Paul called him the \\\"god of this world.\\\" > II Cor. 4:4 \\\"\\u2026The god of this world hath blinded the minds\\u2026\\\" > 1 John 5:19 \\\"\\u2026The whole world lieth in wickedness.\\\" > 1 John 5:19\\u2014\\\"The whole world (around us) is under the power of the evil one.\\\" (The Amplified Bible) The image before us presents the dragon having dominion over the governments of this world. Therefore, through these world powers, he sets himself against the kingdom of God and all that is good and right. ### It has \\\"Seven Crowns upon his Heads\\\" The \\\"heads\\\" being \\\"crowned\\\" would indicate at least to some degree, that he has been successful in his diabolical attacks. #### Successful in Deceiving \\u2014 A Crown > Rev. 12:9 \\\"And the great dragon\\u2026 called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world\\u2026\\\" #### Successful in Dividing \\u2014 A Crown > I Cor. 11: 18 \\\"\\u2026There be divisions among you\\u2026\\\" #### Successful in Defeating \\u2014 A Crown > Matt. 24:12 \\\"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\\\" #### Successful in Denying \\u2014 A Crown > Jude 4 \\\"\\u2026Denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.\\\" #### Successful in Devouring \\u2014 A Crown > I Pet. 5:8 \\\"\\u2026Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:\\\" #### Successful in Delaying \\u2014 A Crown > Dan. 10:13 \\\"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me\\u2026\\\" #### Successful in Deforming \\u2014 A Crown > Lk. 13:11 \\\"\\u2026A woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.\\\" Lk. 13:18 \\\"\\u2026Whom satan hath bound\\u2026\\\" He is the destroyer of both body and soul. He seduceth and misleads the whole world, promising everything including peace and prosperity, so that he can more effectively enslave and destroy. ### It has \\\"Ten Horns\\\" \\\"Ten\\\" signifies the perfection of Divine Order. This is in contrast to that of an evil, wicked being, so this would be in reverse of the Divine Order; complete and total disorder. \\\"Keras\\\" \\u2014 \\\"Horns\\\" are symbolic of strength, power, dominion and kingly rule \\u2014 kings and their kingdoms. > Dan.7: 24 - And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings\\u2026; Dan. 8:20 - The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings\\u2026 These \\\"horns\\\" are not symbols of good rule but of evil power to hurt, wound, afflict and destroy. The forces which destroyedPalestinewere referred to as \\\"four horns\\\" in Zech. 1: 18\\u201421 They scattered, oppressed, injured and destroyed the people of God. Likewise, the \\\"horns\\\" of the dragon scatter, divide, oppress, torment, injure, afflict, destroy and kill the believers in Christ. ### It has A Tail > Rev. 4: 12 \\\"\\u2026His tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:\\u2026 His tail is certainly one of the most striking features of the dragon. It swings through heaven drawing a third part of the stars and casts them to the ground. These \\\"stars of heaven\\\" are very particular stars. They are not literal stars, for the whole scene is a \\\"sign.\\\" These were the angelic hosts, fitly called stars by reason of their brightness, shinning beauty and glory. > Job 38: 4\\u20147 \\\"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? When Lucifer fell and became the devil, he was able to deceive and draw away a third part of the angels with him. > Jude 6 \\\"\\u2026Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation\\u2026 > 2 Peter 2: 4 \\u2014 \\u2026 God spared not the angels that sinned\\u2026 His tail is symbolic of his ability to deceive not only angels, but also humanity (including Believers). The devil has been successful in deceiving or 'drawing away' many saints of God. Many who secured a home in Heaven through Christ's atonement and their faith in His blood will let go of that faith and follow after the devil. > Matthew 24:24\\u2014For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. > Revelation 19:20\\u2014And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. ## The Mystery of the Dragon The dragon is not altogether that great a mystery because of: > Rev. 12: 9 \\\"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. The devil is not literally a dragon, as the Church is not literally a woman, but these are divinely given images or symbols. There is a devil. John recorded here that the dragon was the devil. > \\u2026The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world\\u2026 This is a great contrast from his original state. > Isa. 14: 12 \\\"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground\\u2026\\\" > Eze. 28: 14 \\\"Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth\\u2026\\\" He was the highest order of all God's creation. > Eze. 28: 15 \\\"Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created\\u2026\\\" > Eze. 28: 17 \\\"Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness\\u2026\\\" Perfect in \\\"Beauty\\\" \\u2014 Full of \\\"Wisdom\\\" \\u2014 Clothed in \\\"Brightness\\\" (Light \\u2014 Truth \\u2014 Righteousness) Lucifer fell from the anointed cherub that covereth, to a murderous dragon. What happened? What caused this terrible change? God did not make a dragon (devil); He created Lucifer \\u2014 \\\"The light bearer.\\\" God created him with a free will to choose to do good or evil. He was not the devil, but he became the devil through the desire to be like God, or to be God. The dragon has great power. * Power over the nations Lk. 4: 6* Power of the air Eph. 2: 2* Power and signs II Thes. 2: 9* Power of death Heb. 2: 14 > Jude 9 - Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord rebuke thee. Lucifer is of the highest order of angelic beings, but is subordinate to God. Some compare the dragon in Rev. 12 to the Beast coming up out of the sea in Rev. 13\\\\. In Rev. 12, the seven heads wear the crowns. In Rev. 13, it is the horns that are crowned. The dragon is the head of a spiritual empire while the Beast is the head of a physical empire. This portrays a concentration of, and the exercise of, the devil's diabolical power in and through the world powers. There is a likeness between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil. There is also the distinction between them because one works in the spiritual realm and the other works in the physical realm. ## The Objects of The Dragon's Malignity Rev. 12:4 \\\"\\u2026And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.\\\" ### The First Objective is to Devour the 'Man-Child' To destroy and devour the \\\"Man-Child,\\\" the devil would have to destroy the message (the Truth of the Word) that produces the \\\"Man-Child.\\\" If there ever was a message that the devil hates, it is this message of the \\\"Man-Child\\\" \\u2014 the message ofovercoming\\u2014 the message ofperfection. Jesus said: > Matt.13:19 \\\"Then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown\\u2026 The power of the Word is \\\"\\u2026made of none effect\\u2026\\\" (Rom.4: 14) in the lives of those that \\\"\\u2026understandeth it not.\\\" (Matt. 13:19) When the Word is received and understood, it will produce the characteristics of Christ in the life of the believer. The Word produces to the extent that it is believed and obeyed. Jesus said by the same \\\"Word\\\" some would produce \\\"\\u2026thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred\\u2026\\\" > Mk. 4:20 \\\"\\u2026Such as hear the Word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.\\\" The Scripture speaks of some as babes, some as children and some of mature age. > Heb. 5:12\\u201414 \\\"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the Word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.\\\" The \\\"Man-Child\\\" will be a ruling body of Overcomers that will be given power to rule the nations. > Rev. 2:26, 27 \\\"And he that overcometh, and keepeth My works unto the end,tohim will I give powerover the nations: Andhe shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:even as I received of My Father.\\\" Psa. 2:9 \\\"Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.\\\" Here we see Christ ruling with the rod of iron. It is said that Rev. 12 has to be Christ because they believe He is the only one that is ruling with the rod of iron. The Overcomer has this promise of being given this power to rule the nations with a rod of iron. The devil will try to devour the \\\"Man-Child\\\" as soon as he is born, but the \\\"Man-Child\\\" will be \\\"\\u2026caught up unto God, and to His throne.\\\" This is the promise to the Overcomer. > Rev. 3:21 \\\"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\\\" The dragon's desire is to devour the \\\"Man-Child\\\" who is destined to \\\"\\u2026rule all the nations with a rod of iron\\u2026\\\" that the dragon has ruled over. All satanic activities are carried out under the ambitious motive to rule and to be worshipped. Does the devil know he will lose this place? When this objective failed, he attacked the Woman. ### The Second Objective is to Devour the \\\"Woman\\\" > Rev. 12:13 \\\"And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.\\\" In the Gospel according to St. Luke, Jesus spoke of the great and awful signs of the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation Hour. > Lk. 21:12 \\\"But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake.\\\" \\\"Basileus\\\" \\u2014 \\\"King\\\" \\u2014 a sovereign \\u2014 ruler \\u2014 dictator (kings are not presidents) Several years ago the Lord showed me in a dream that the Church was going to go through \\\"Great Persecution.\\\" The Church is persecuted for three-and-a-half years to bring her to a place of separation from the world and complete dedication to the Lord. > Rev. 12:6 \\\"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.\\\" (Three-and-a-half years) Rev. 12:15 \\\"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood (false doctrine) after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood (false doctrine).\\\" When this failed, he attacked the \\\"remnant of her seed.\\\" ### The Third Objective is to Destroy the Seed > Rev. 12:17 \\\"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed\\u2026\\\" The \\\"remnant of her seed\\\" is the saints that are left after the Rapture of the Church, which takes place in the middle of the Tribulation Hour. These saints find themselves facing the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. They are represented by the foolish virgins that neglected their experience. They will have to wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and will come out of Great Tribulation. > Rev. 7:9 \\\"After this (the sealing of the 144,000 Jews) I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;\\\" Rev. 7:13, 14 \\\"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of Great Tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\\\" ## The Destiny of the Dragon ### Cast out of Heaven > Rev. 12:8 \\\"\\u2026Neither was their place found any more in heaven.\\\" Rev. 12:9 \\\"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\\\" The devil's place was not left empty, but was found no more. The \\\"Man-Child\\\" now occupies that place. ### Bound in the Bottomless Pit > Rev. 20:1\\u20143 \\\"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.\\\" ### Loosed a Little Season The dragon will be loosed for a short season. He goes forth and deceives many nations. > Rev. 20:3 \\\"\\u2026And after that he must be loosed a little season.\\\" Rev. 20:7, 8 \\\"And when the thousand years are expired, satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.\\\" ### Cast Ultimately into the Lake of Fire The dragon will eventually be cast into the lake of fire, where he shall be tormented forever, and forever. > Rev. 20:10 \\\"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.\\\"\", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h1\", {\n          children: \"The War in Heaven, Rev. 12:7-12\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 1882,\n          columnNumber: 1\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"blockquote\", {\n          children: \"And there was war in Heaven\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 1883,\n          columnNumber: 1\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n          children: \"The Fact of a War in Heaven\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 1885,\n          columnNumber: 1\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n          children: \"A Fantastic Story?\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 1887,\n          columnNumber: 1\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n          children: \"Skeptics ridicule the idea of a literal war, and are astonished that reasonable men should believe in such an event.

John applies the descriptions of walls, gates, a tabernacle and foundations and even calls what he sees in a lot of places a \\\"city\\\". But, John also compares what he sees with \\\"a bride adorned\\\" and names it in one place \\\"the lamb's wife\\\". John describes what he sees coming out of heaven from God as a \\\"holy city\\\", \\\"new Jerusalem\\\", \\\"as a bride adorned\\\", \\\"tabernacle of God\\\", \\\"great city\\\", \\\"holy Jerusalem\\\", \\\"the Bride\\\" and \\\"the Lamb's Wife\\\". Who or what is this \\\"city\\\" like? Is it a place or a person? (vs. 9) In order to understand this \\\"great city\\\", we must carefully consider the details as John laid them out for us. ## The End and The Beginning (vs. 1-8) The \\\"end\\\" John sees is not an \\\"extinction\\\" but a transition\\u2014 made new! ### First Glimpse (vs. 1,2) Heaven and Earth. John's first impression is that he is seeing something somewhat familiar, and yet it is altogether different. He says he sees a \\\"new earth\\\" and yet it is an earth with no sea. He says he sees a \\\"new heaven\\\" and yet it is a heaven where the veil between it and earth is removed. Then John sees another \\\"new\\\" thing. It is New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven like as if it were a \\\"young married or betrothed woman\\\" who is ready for her husband as she has put everything in proper order and is beautifully decorated. ### A Proclamation (vs. 3-8) The great voice (THE Voice!) proclaims what God is going to do. #### Dwell with Men (vs. 3) Notice that New Jerusalem comes \\\"down from God\\\" and from \\\"out of heaven\\\" in verse 2. This is not a description of God's people finally going to heaven to be with God or \\\"men with God\\\". What John sees is more accurately understood as \\\"God with men\\\". > Revelation 21:3\\u2014Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. #### Bring an End to Former Things (vs. 4-8) > Revelation 21:6\\u2014And he said unto me, **It is done**. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end\\u2026 There are many awesome advantages to this new arrangement: 1. No More Tears 2. No More Death 3. No More Sorrow or Crying 4. No More Pain 5. No More Thirst 6. No More Battles 7. No More Unbelief ## A Tour of New Jerusalem (vs. 9-27) > 9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. ### The Vantage Point (vs. 10) #### In the Spirit > And he carried me away in the spirit #### A Great and High Mountain > to a great and high mountain, ### The Descriptions (vs. 10- 1. A City (vs. 10) and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, 2. Comes out of Heaven from God (vs. 10) descending out of heaven from God, 3. Having the Glory of God (vs. 11) 11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; 4. 12 Gates, 12 Angels and 12 Names (vs 12,13,21, 25-27) and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: 13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. 21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. ALL MAY BE SAVED 25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there. 26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. 27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life. 5. A Wall with 12 Foundations (vs. 12,14-20) 12 And had a wall great and high, - 12 Foundations 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. - Measuring the Wall 15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. 16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. 17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. 18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. 19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. > In the heavenly city we have harmony, not monotony; variety, not sameness; unity, not uniformity. The stones are not arranged in the order of the high priest's breastplate, but according to their various shades of colour, beginning from the foundation.\\u2014Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers NOTE: The following are merely educated guesses as to the actual gems referred to in Revelation 21. 1.**Jasper**, dark opaque green. 2.**Sapphire**, Lapis-lazuli, opaque blue. 3.**Chalcedony**, an Emerald of a greenish hue. 4.**Emerald/Smaragdus**, bright transparent green. 5.**Sardonyx**, white and red. 6.**Sardius**, bright red. 7.**Chrysolite**, our Topaz, bright yellow. 8.**Beryl**, bluish green. 9.**Topaz**, or Peridot, yellowish green. 10.**Chrysoprasus**, a darker shade of the same colour. 11.**Jacinth/Hyacinthus**, Sapphire, sky blue. 12.**Amethyst**, violet. 6. The Lamb of God The Lamb is the Temple > 22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. The Lamb is the Light > 23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. # Heaven Text: Revelation 22:1-5 > Revelation 22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: 4 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. 5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever. > John 14:1-3\\u2014Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. ## What is Heaven? Heaven is a Real Place. God created it as a place of His own beauty and perfect design. > Genesis 1:1\\u2014In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Heaven is not a state or condition of mind, heaven is not a myth or fairy tale, heaven is not imagination heaven is not fiction. Heaven is Real! Jesus said it is is a \\\"**place**\\\" in John 14:2. - John 21:2 \\\"coming out of Heaven\\\" - Genes 28:17 Jacob - Deuteronomy 10:14 Moses ## Where is Heaven? Genesis 1:1 -- HEBREW: meaning to be lofty; the sky (as aloft; the dual perhaps alluding to the visible arch in which the clouds move, as well as to the higher ether where the celestial bodies revolve > Psalm 103:11\\u2014Ps 103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. Heaven is high above the earth. Job 26:7 Heaven is in the north place. Isaiah 14:13 Heaven is where God is. 1 Kings 8:30, Isiah 66:1 ## What is Heaven Like? Heaven belongs to God. (Genesis 14:19,22) Romans 14:17 > Revelation 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. Isaiah 66:1\\u2014Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest? > Job 3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. no wicked, no sin, weary at rest Rev. 7:16-17; 21:4; 22:3 Heaven is a happy place. Psalm 16:11 Luke 15:7 Joy in heaven 1 Cor. 2:9 Heaven is a place of rewards. Matthew 5:12 Heaven is a beautiful place (notice our text). ## Who Will Go to Heaven? Matthew 5:3 the poor in spirit Romans 8:17 Revelation 22:14 Not Everyone is Going to Heaven Matthew 7:21; John 3:3; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 1Co 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Phil. 3:21 ## Will We Know Anyone in Heaven? 1 Corinthians 13:12 (different but yes) > Heaven wouldn't be home if we didn't know anyone. &mdashJames Reynolds, Sr. Heaven is a mystery now, but not then! ## How do we Get to Heaven? > Matthew 18:3\\u2014And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. > Matthew 19:23 hardly a rich man > John 14:6\\u2014Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. ## Hymn: THERE's NO DISAPPOINTMENT IN HEAVEN **Words**: Frederick M. Lehman, 1914; he wrote these words in Chicago, Illinois, while suffering financial reverses. **Music**: Frederick Lehman, harmony by his daughter Claudia L. Mays \\\"There's no disappointment in heaven, No weariness, sorrow or pain; No hearts that are bleeding and broken, No song with a minor refrain. The clouds of our earthly horizon Will appear in the sky, For all will be sunshine and gladness, With never a tear nor a sigh. We'll never pay rent for our mansion, The taxes will never come due; Our garments will never grow threadbare, But always be fadeless and new. We'll never be hungry nor thirsty, Nor languish in poverty there, For all the rich bounties of heaven His sanctified children will share. There'll never be crepe on the door-knob, No funeral train in the sky; No graves on the hillside of glory, For there we shall never more die. The old will be young there forever, Transformed in a moment of time; Immortal we'll stand in his likeness The stars and the sun to outshine. I'm bound for the beautiful city My Lord has prepared for His own; Where all the redeemed of all ages Sing \\\"Glory\\\" around the white throne; Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven, And the glories I there shall behold, What a joy it will be when My Savior I see, In that beautiful city of gold!\\\"\", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h1\", {\n        children: \"U.

When the book of Revelation is talked about and especially when it is called the \"Apocalypse\" it often gives quiet a chilling impression. Our minds often travel to \"The anti-Christ\" or \"The Mark of the Best\" and especially, \"The End of the World\". These are often made out to be the banner themes of this book, but nothing could be farther from the truth. \"Apocalypse\" does not mean \"judgment day\". \"Apocalypse\". means:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>something revealed, disclosed, manifested, or shown. As a verb it means to uncover and as noun it means an appearing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4> It is a Revelation of Jesus Christ</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Banner Theme of this book is Jesus Christ and His righteous conquest. From the first to the last verse, it is the Lamb, the King, the Bridegroom Who takes center stage. This is not a revelation of John but of JESUS (Savior, Christ, King). This book reveals truth concerning Jesus:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>His Exaltation as the Son (Rev. 3:21; Acts 2:33)</li>\r\n\t<li> Revelation 3:21--To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</li>\r\n\t<li> His ministry in the Church (Rev. 1:13)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:13--And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</li>\r\n\t<li> His position in the throne (Rev 4:2; Eph. 1:20,21)</li>\r\n\t<li> Revelation 4:2--And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</li>\r\n\t<li> His rapture of the Church (Rev. 4:1)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 4:1--After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</li>\r\n\t<li> His coming in power and glory (Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:30)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:7--Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</li>\r\n\t<li> His raising the dead (Rev. 1:18; John 5:27-29)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:18--I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</li>\r\n\t<li> His judgment of the nations (Rev. 14:7)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 14:7--Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</li>\r\n\t<li> His reign and rule on the earth (Rev. 11:15)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 11:15--And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</li>\r\n\t<li> His judgment on Satan (Rev. 20:1-2,10)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:1,2,10--1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4> It is a Gift of God</h4>\r\n<p>Verse 1 says this revelation of Jesus Christ \"which God GAVE unto Him\" was in turn given by Jesus to His angel who gave it to John. The writer is describing a clear stream of inspiration from the throne of heaven which contests any suggestion that the following writing is of human origin and imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4> It is a Prophecy</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\"To show unto His servants things which must come to pass shortly.\" This is a key to this book. v. 3 \"The words of this prophecy\" Ch. 4:1 \"I will show thee things which must (come) be hereafter.\" Revelation is essentially a book of prophecy rather than history.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>It is Symbolic</h4>\r\n\r\n1:1 says \"&hellip;he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John.\" \"Signified\" is the Greek word \"Semaino\" meaning to give a sign or to express or reveal by signs. God in his infinite wisdom has chosen to use the language of symbolism and imagery to communicate this Revelation.\r\nHow can we unlock the symbolism of this book? Mainly by comparing scripture with scripture (2 Peter 1:20) do we understand its symbolism. This Revelation is profoundly positioned as the last book of the Bible. It not only contains prophecy of last things, but it is in its nature a climax to all Biblical revelation. We in part find understanding of the symbolism in Revelation by understanding previously given symbolism.\r\nSome examples include: 1) The Four Living Creatures Ezekiel 1:5; Revelation 4:6 2) The 7 Churches of Asia were both literal and symbolic. As the New Testament Epistles were relevant to a first century Church so they are still relevant today. 3) Water of Life John 4:14; Revelation 21:6\r\nThis Revelation with all its symbolism was given to John by God's \"angel\". John himself was puzzled as to the role of this \"angel\" and eventually falls at his feet in 22:8 to worship him. In verse 9, the angel rebuked him saying he was only a \"fellow servant\" and that John must only \"worship God\". The Believer must keep in constant remembrance amidst all the majesty of God's Grace that all the glory belongs to God and we are just \"His messengers\".\r\n## The Scribe of this Book (1:2)\r\n> Revelation 1:1 &hellip;unto His servant John 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\r\n\r\n### The Apostle John\r\n### He bare record (1:2; John 1:1-14)\r\n### He gave witness (I John 1:1-3; 20:31)\r\n\r\n<h3> The Value of this Book (1:3)</h3>\r\n### It is rewarding\r\n\"Blessed\" - happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied\r\n#### \"He that readeth\"\r\n#### \"They that hear the words\"\r\n#### \"And keep those things which are written\"\r\n### It is enlightening (22:10)\r\n> Revelation 22:10--Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Premise of this Book(1:4-9)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We will search out the source, subject, substance and circumstances of the book of Revelation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> The Sources of this Revelation (1:4,5)</h3>\r\n### John\r\nHe is the writer - the Scribe\r\n### The Father\r\n\"Which is, which was, and which is to come.\"\r\n### The Spirit\r\n\"From the seven Spirits which are before His throne;\" SEVEN: \"Hepta\" - signifying to be full - \"Pneuma\" \"Spirit\" .

Christ and the 7 Golden Candlesticks [1:9-20]</h1>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 1:9-20 &mdash; I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 14  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. 19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>THE WITNESS: HOW did John Hear and See</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Their Companion in Tribulation (on isle of Patmos 13sq miles area and 32 miles from the coast of Asia Minor, exiled there under emperor Domitian) It was in this unfriendly place the awesome revelation was written.</li>\r\n\t<p>According to Tertullian (in The Prescription of Heretics) John was banished after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome around AD 95.</p>\r\n\t<li>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day</li>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\"In the Spirit\" Ezekiel 37:1 (valley dry bones);  Re 1:10 (in the spirit on the Lord's day); Re 4:2 (And immediately I was in the spirit); Re 17:3 (carried me away in the spirit);\r\n Re 21:10 (he carried me away in the spirit )</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Received in the Spirit and to be understood only by the Spirit</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 2:14 &mdash; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This does not mean the book of Revelation cannot be understood, but that in order to fully understand it we must be in that same condition of communion with the Spirit of God as John.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>8 times in Revelation:  Re 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith ....</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 50:4-- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, <b>he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned</b>.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>WHAT did John Hear and See (Revelation 1:9-20)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3> 1.

The Elders are involved with things concerning heavenly subjects (ch. 5 &amp; 7) and The living Creatures are directly involved with things that are Earthly.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:2 -- Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Particulars of the Seven Seals</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Number Seven</h3>\r\n<p>There are Seven Seals in Number. This is indicative of the COMPLETENESS of this administration.</p>\r\n<p>The Seals are arranged in two distinct groups - first there are four and then there are three. A Worldly number that is followed by the heavenly number. These Seven Seals are a Divine judgment on a wicked world</p>\r\n<h3>The First Four Seals are Distinguished by Horses and Horsemen.</h3>\r\n<p>Horses are symbolic pictures of the Power of the Almighty.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Kings 6:17 -- And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. [Job 39:19-25; Zech. 1:8-10; Zech. 6:2-5]</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Four Spirits of the heavens from Zechariah 6:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Zechariach 6:1-8 -- And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Opening of Seals 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Opening of the First Seal 6:1-2</h2>\r\n<h3>The Releasing of Divine Judgment \"A white horse\"</h3>\r\n<p>\"White\" Righteousness</p>\r\n<p>\"Horse\" Divine Power.A righteous judgment of God on the Earth.</p>\r\n<h3>The Commission of The Rider</h3>\r\n<p>\"He that sat on him had a bow. \"The \"bow\" is an instrument of war.Not of a destructive war-but of a moral war.Psa. 64:7-9; Hab. 3:8-9; Isa. 26:9.</p>\r\n<p>\" And a crown was given un to him\" \"And he went forth conquering, and to conquer. \"Psa. 110:3; Isa. 26:9; Dan 12:8-10; Joe12:28-32.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Opening of The Second Seal 6:3-4</h2>\r\n<h3>The Releasing of Divine Vengeance \"A Red Horse\"</h3>\r\n<p>\"Red\" the color of blood.Wars and Blood shed.</p>\r\n<p>\"Horse\" Divine Power.The wrath of God on the Earth.</p>\r\n<h3>The Commission to the Rider.</h3>\r\n<p>\"Power was given to him.. .to take peace from the earth\" II Chron. 15: 3,5 A type.\"They shall kill one another\"</p>\r\n<p>\"There was given unto him a great sword.\" \"Rhomphaia \" \"Megas\" -Sword &mdash;Large</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Opening of The Third Seal. 6:5-6</h2>\r\n<h3>The Commission of The Third Rider. vs. 5-6</h3>\r\n<h4>A Black Horse -</h4>\r\n<p>Black is the symbolic color of dearth and famine.\r\nJer. 14:1-2; Lam.4:8-10 5:10.\r\nNotice verse nine &mdash;\r\nFamines are the scenes of violence and tragedy.\r\nII Kings 6:25-29; Luke 21:23; Matt. 24:19.</p>\r\n<h4>\"A Pair of Balances in His Hand.\"</h4>\r\n<p>Balances are used for exact weighing Indicating that there is a scarcity of food. vs.6Bread by weight always implies scarcity. Lev.26:26; Eze.4:16.When corn is in abundances; it is sold by gross measures and no attention is paid to a few hundred grains.</p>\r\n<h4>The Settling of Prices. vs. 6</h4>\r\n<p>This also adds to the fact of scarcity of food.\r\n\"A Measure of Wheat.\"The word, measure, used here is the Greek word, choenix (which would be about a quart). Davis Dictionary of the Bible. A measure or quart of wheat would be the ordinary allowance of wheat to a man for one day's scanty subsistence.</p>\r\n<p>The Usual Price.The usual price of a \"choenix\" of wheat was one-eighth of a \"penny\" , or denarius. The price named in the text, being eight times this, indicating further the greatness of the famine.</p>\r\n<p>The Value of the Penny.In the A.S.R.V. the word \"penny\" is translated \"shilling.\" A shillingin the Greek denotes a coin worth about eight pence, or nearly seventeen cents. Probably the Roman Denarias a coin worth about 17 cents. This was the amount a soldier received for a days pay. Also in Matt. 20:###The ordinary wage for a full days labor, would be (17 cents) a penny. All that a man can do is earn the bread that he will use himself.

There is no expression from the Living ones. There are no 'horsemen or horses. And the burden of the description is exhibited in the results rather than in the processes. Yet, everything belongs to the same general category of trial and suffering. Under this fifth seal, we have added, bloody persecution of those who hold and testify to the truth. The good as well as the bad suffer the hour of trial. Hence, this fifth seal is the picture of Persecution and Martyrdom.</p>\r\n<p>There are no voices of command from Heaven under this seal, and no messengers despatched from the throne; the reason, bloody persecutions of God's servants come from beneath -not from above. It is the devil who is the murderer. It is Dragon that makes war with the saints. These are martyrs of this particular period of time. Martyrs of the Judgment.</p>\r\n<h3>The Cause of Their Martyrdom. vs. 9</h3>\r\n<p>It is not death, but the cause of death, which constitutes a martyr. Millions upon millions perish under the preceding seals, but they are not called marytrs.

We can consider the definitions of the words used, but any other suggestings to their meaning is speculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Revelation 8:1, \"Silence\" (siqe) means hush, voluntary stillness or refusal to speak. It is a silence of intense interest and awful expectancy with reference to the results of the breaking of the seventh seal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the following section of Revelation makes several strong allusions to the different parts of temple worship.

Confessors or praises of God, looking upon the Son, a company of blessed ones, wrestling or fighting for what is ahead, forgetting these things that are behind, hearing and obeying the word, cleaving unto the reward of a heavenly habitation, an addition to what has already happened, sons of the day of God's hand, or the day of His Power, begotten in the extremity of the age.</p>\r\n<p>One reason the names of Dan and Ephraim is left out. Dan means a judge. These 144,000 are not judges, and never become judges. Ephraim -double fruitfulness, or increase, or growth by multiplication. These are a fixed number 144,000. These are Israelites, living in the period of the judgment, who confess and look to Christ as their Messiah.</p>\r\n<h2>The Time of Their Sealing</h2>\r\n<h3>It takes place on earth.</h3>\r\n<h3>After the opening of the Sixth Seal Chpt. 7:1</h3>\r\n<h3>Before the opening of the Seventh Seal vs. 3</h3>\r\n<h2>The Nature of Their Sealing</h2>\r\n<h3>It is a mark Of some sort.

The question of the Elder is what we want to deal with first. vs. 9 &quot;Who are they? and whence came they?&quot;\r\nSome believe they are the early Christians victorious over the sorrows and persecutions. Some believe they are the Christians under Constantine. To decide who they are look at:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who They Are Not</h2>\r\n<h4>They are not the highest class of the redeemed.</h4>\r\n<p>The Elders &quot;Sit&quot; &ndash;these &quot;Stand&quot; vs. 9 &quot;Stood before the Throne&quot;. The Elders have Crowns and Thrones &ndash; These have neither. The Elders appear in their places &ndash; And have received their reward before judgment. These came to the throne after judgment has started. The Elders were &quot;counted worthy to escape all these things&quot; [Luke 21:36]. These were in the Judgment. &quot;Out of the great tribulation. &quot; vs. 14</p>\r\n<h4>They are not the Church</h4>\r\n<p>The Four Living creatures make up the Church. The Rapture of the Church takes place before the Great Tribulation. These are taken out of the Great Tribulation.</p>\r\n<h4>They are not the sealed ones &ndash;</h4>\r\n<p>The sealed ones were a definite number. These are uncounted and numberless. vs.9 The sealed ones were of Israel. &quot;These are out of every nation, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who They Are</h2>\r\n<h3>They are redeemed people.</h3>\r\n<p>They were once sinners. They are now saved. Vs. 10 &quot;Salvation to Our God, &quot; &quot; And to the Lamb.&quot;</p>\r\n<h3>They are people living on the Earth during the Judgment vs. 14</h3>\r\n<p>&quot;Come out of Great Tribulation. &quot; Some believe because of the number that they are from all ages&ndash; Come out of Great Tribulation.</p>\r\n<h3>They are people who were unprepared, and were &quot;left&quot; when the Rapture took place.</h3>\r\n<p>There were ten virgins in Matthew 25. Five were wise and five were foolish. The five foolish were left outside the marriage door.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 25:11-13 &mdash; Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no crowns or thrones, but only palms. They did not hear the gentle voice of the Spirit, and therefore were not rewarded in the same way those that overcame and escaped the great tribulation. But they did learn their lesson through great trial and are given great promises of blessing.</p> \r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 26:9,10 &mdash;&hellip;for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Some will learn righteousness, but not all will turn to God even in such terrible judgment.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 12:10 &mdash;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Their Eternal State</h2>\r\n<h3>They are in heaven.

They are God&apos;s ministers and are in obedient submission to His will. They stand ready to do as He decrees and bear God&apos;s authority as His servants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>They Are of Particular Rank and Distinction.</h3>\r\n<p>They are of a Divine Order of angels. Angelic beings are not of one and the same grade or office.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Sons of God, in general, came before Him only at appointed times. Job 1:6;</h4> \r\n<h4>Yet, Jesus spake of some angels who \"do always behold the face of their Father which is in heaven.\" Matt. 18:10.</h4>\r\n<h4>In Colossians 1:16, Paul lists &quot;dominions, principalities, and powers&quot; as being among the celestial orders. </h4>\r\n<h4>Daniel 10:13 speaks of some chief princes.</h4>\r\n<h4>1 Thessalonians 4:16 and Jude 9 refer to arch angels.</h4> \r\n\r\n<h3>They Are Seven in Number.</h3>\r\n<p>The Jews were familiar with seven angels of Divine Order by the names: 1) Gabriel, as he said to Zacharias; \"I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God.\" 2) In Luke 1:19 Michael is another, as he is ranked with Gabriel in the book of Daniel. In the book of Enoch, these are the names of the angels who watch: 3) Uriel, 4) Raphael, 5) Raguel, 6) Michael, 7) Sarakiel</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>They Are Servants.</h3>\r\n<p>They are standing. This is the position of service. The twenty-four elders are going to be sitting. The sitting position speaks of the dominion and rule of the heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.</p>\r\n<p>Yet &quot;standing in the presence of God&quot; is to be above all other servants. In Esther 1:4, The 7 Persian princes who &quot;saw the kings face&quot;, were the highest officers of the realm, and next to the monarch in rank and power.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>They Were Given Seven Trumpets.</h3>\r\n<h4>Trumpets are expressive instruments and God gave special directions in the use of the trumpet. The word &quot;trumpet&quot; can be found in 61 verses of the Bible. (Exodus 19:13; Levitucs 25:9; Psalm 47:5)</h4>\r\n<h4>Trumpets are an emblem of war. (Numbers 10:9; Jeremiah 4:19)</h4>\r\n<h4>Trumpets were for the convocation of the people, and the moving of the camps of Israel. (Numbers 8)</h4>\r\n<h4>Trumpets proclaimed the great festivals. (Numbers 10:10; Leviticus 23:24; 25:9; 2 Chronicles 29:27)</h4>\r\n<h4>Trumpets are used to announce royalty. (1 Kings 1:34,39; 2 Kings 9:13)</h4>\r\n<h4>Trumpets are associated with the majesty of God. (Ex. 19:16)</h4>\r\n<h4>Trumpets were used in the overthrow of the ungodly. (Josh. 6:13-16)</h4>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Mystery Angel, vs. 3-5</h2>\r\n<p>John sees seven angels &quot;which stood before God&quot; and then he mentions &quot;another&quot; angel. Who is this &quot;angel&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Nature of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>\r\n<p>&quot;Another&quot; (allos) means different. This same phrase is used in Revelation 7:2; 10:14-17; 18:1; 20:1. The word \"angel\" means messenger of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Office of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>\r\n<p>This &quot;angel&quot; is the Angel of the Lord. He offers the prayers of saints. You cannot give something unless you have it. He had to receive them to give them. Angels do not receive worship, but &quot;the Angel of the Lord&quot; does. (Gen. 16:7,13; Ex. 3:2-5; Joshua 5:13-15).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>There are many passages in which the expression the &quot;angel of God&quot; or &quot;angel of the Lord&quot; is definitely for a manifestation of God Himself. Compare Genesis 22:11-12; 22:15-19; Exodus 3:2-6.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Ministry of The Angel</h3>\r\n<p>Scripture itself presents us with details that tell us that this Angel is the Lord:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The First Proof - He had &quot;a Golden censer&quot;</h4>\r\n<img src='/images/censer.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>\r\n<p>This instrument was used by the priests, in the ministry of the worship of God. However, it was used only by the high priest in the holy place. This indicating our great High Priest who is now entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. We remember that that this is a scene in Heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Second Proof -He offers the Prayers of Saints before God.</h4>\r\n<img src='/images/prayers.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>\r\n<p>vs. 3 &quot;All Saints&quot;. There is no record of such an office found in the scripture as being assigned to angels, however, there is record of this office being executed by the Lord Jesus.\r\nEph. 2:18 I Tim. 2:5 Heb. 7:25; Heb. 13:15 I Peter 2:5 I John 2:1;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Third Proof - He casts fire on the earth.</h4>\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/fire.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>\r\n<p>Verse 5 tells us the fire is taken from the altar.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Luke 12:49 -- I [Jesus] came to send fire upon the earth. </blockquote> \r\n<p>This fire is a symbol of the Divine Presence and Power. (Exodus 3:2 Deuteronomy 4:36 Psalm 50:3 97:3; Isaiah 66:15-16; Acts 2:3) \r\n<p>This fire is an Instrument of Divine Judgment. The action indicated here by the casting into the earth speaks of judgment. (Genesis 19:24; Leviticus 10:2; Numbers 11:1; 16:35; Malachi 4:1; 2 Kings 1:10; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 2 Peter 3:10)</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Fourth Proof - To offer incense with prayers. vs. 3-4</h4>\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/cross.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'/>\r\n<p>&quot;Given unto Him much Incense.&quot;It was given to Him through merit. For without His death and atoning work coupled with His pure and Holy life, there would be no force in prayer. God hears us because of Him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Compounding of the incense is given with great precision in the Old Testament. It was to be made of specific ingredients in exact proportion (Exodus 30:34). Any compound that did not meet the exact specifications given by God was to be rejected as strange incense (Exodus 30:9). It was to be tempered with salt as it was holy and was never to be used for ordinary purposes. Any one who tried to duplicate this incense for themselves was to be cut off from his people (Exodus 30:38).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Events Related To the Angel&apos;s Actions. vs. 5</h3>\r\n<p>Notice carefully the order:</p>\r\n<h4>Flash of Light - The Release</h4>\r\n<h4>The Thundering Voice - The Messenger</h4>\r\n<h4>The Shaking of the Earth - The Results</h4>\r\n\r\n<h1>Introduction to The Seven Trumpets (8:6-11:19)</h1>\r\n<p>We are looking at the final blasts of judgment upon a wicked and rebellious world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Martyrs are Remembered</h2>\r\n<p>The seventh and final seal has been broken from the Sealed Book (8:1). The prayers of all the saints have been accepted before God (8:3,4). Remember now,God has promised to avenge the martyred saints.\r\n</p>\r\n\t<blockquote>Revelation 6:9-11 -- And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</blockquote>\r\n\t\r\n\t<blockquote>Matthew 18:6-7 -- But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</blockquote>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>These martyred Believers are an important part of the judgments of God on the earth. It is not that the world has rejected these saints so much as they have rejected Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I Samuel 8:7 -- And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Luke 10:16 -- He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Every Christian martyr is a testimony to the grace of God and a witness against this sinful world. The Greek word &quot;martus&quot; (martyr) means a witness or record. (see Matthew 18:16; Mark 14:63; Luke 24:48; Acts 1:8,22; 2:32; Hebrews 12:1; I Peter 5:1; Revelation 1:5.)</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Luke 24:46-48 -- And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48 And ye are witnesses of these things.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Trumpets of Judgment Are Sounded</h2>\r\n\r\n <p>Time has now come for the final judgments.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 8:6 -- And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</blockquote> \r\n\r\n<p>Not all seven were to sound at once, but varied events followed each trumpet as it was sounded. God has prearranged the order and time for each to sound. There are none that are alike but there is a progression of greater judgment with each trumpet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Sounding of Trumpets One, Two, Three and Four</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Sounding of The First Trumpet. Vs.7.</h2>\r\n<h3>The nature of the judgment.</h3>\r\n<p>\"Hail and Fire mingled with blood.\" Micah 7:15; Jer. 23:7-8.\r\nThey were like the plagues of Egypt. Ex. 9:23-28; Joel 2:30.\r\n\"Hail\" \"Fire\"\"Blood\"Could it be the Blood that they rejected, will judge them.</p>\r\n<h3>The Action of the Judgment.</h3>\r\n<p>\"They will cast upon the earth\" \"Ballo\" cast; to throw; hurl (a violent or intense action).</p>\r\n<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>\r\n<p>The third part of threes was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.Every field and meadow stripped of its growing crops, and bloody and putrid blackness spread over all the world. This has somewhat of a correspondence to an earlier stage, under the sixth seal. Not to hurt earth, the sea, nor the trees, till the servants of God were sealed. The sealing now has been accomplished, the prohibition is lifted. (Revelation 7:3)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Sounding of the Second Trumpet. Vs. 8-9.</h2>\r\n<h3>The Nature of the Judgment.</h3>\r\n<p>Like a burning mountain \" As it were a great mountain burning with fire.\" It looked like a burning mountain. It is not literally a mountain/volcano, but the image of a meteor.</p>\r\n<h3>The Place of the Judgment.</h3>\r\n<p>The Sea is the place of this plunging mass. \"Was cast into the sea: \" It would seem as if some particular sea was meant. If so, what sea? The Mediterranean Sea, which means the midland sea, or the middle of the earth. Around this sea the greatest recorded events of the world and of the Church have been enacted, and which is the central sea of all history, both sacred and profane.</p>\r\n<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>\r\n<h4>\"The third part of the sea became blood.\"</h4>\r\n<h4>\"The third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life died.\"</h4>\r\n<h4>\"The third part of the ships were destroyed.\" Burned, sunk, or dash ashore.

All are blasts of judgment, and all belong to the \"Great Day of the Lord.\" Thus far, the trumpets have blown only for the objects of physical nature, and wrought their effects through disturbances in the material world. But the trumpet now before us goes beyond the physical world and calls into action quite other agencies. The doors of separation between the earth and the prison of evil spirits are opened.</p>\r\n<h2>What the Star Is - vs. 1.</h2>\r\n<p>This is not a meteor for this star is an intelligent agent, he has ascribed to him distinctive characteristics that could not possibly be ascribed to anything but a living being.</p>\r\n<h3>vs. 1 - \"To him was given the key\"</h3>\r\n<h3>vs. 2 - \"He opened the bottomless pit\"</h3>\r\n<h3>vs. 3 - \"There came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth. \"</h3>\r\n<p>We must conclude that this is not a material but a spiritual star.It is a \"Fallen Star\"</p>\r\n<h2>Who The Star Is - Isa. 14:12.</h2>\r\n<p>Vs. 11 Says the \"star\" is the king over them, whose name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name \"Apollyon\"destroyer; devil; Satan.</p>\r\n<h2>The Time of His Fall -</h2>\r\n<p>At the time of the original creation, he fell into the condemnation of the devil.

Rev. 12:7-9.</p>\r\n<h2>The Key Given -</h2>\r\n<h3>Key speaks of Power - And authority to use that power. Peter was given the keys to the kingdom the power to open the door of the Gospel.

It is not until 11:14 that the sixth\r\n trumpet (the second woe) is accomplished.</p>\r\n <h2 style={{clear:\"both\"}}>The Angel</h2>\r\n <h3>The Title Suggests Deity. - \"another mighty angel\"</h3>\r\n <h4>\"another\" </h4>\r\n <p>This Angel is distinct from the other angels mentioned as we have\r\n seen in Revelation 7:2 and 8:3. We should also note that the\r\n phrase \"another angel\" is also used several times in chapter 14\r\n and once in 18:1, but especially chapter 14 does not seem to give\r\n the same sense of the exceptionalism of the angel as in the other\r\n passages.</p>\r\n <h4>\"mighty\"</h4>\r\n <p>&nbsp;John the Revelator uses the title \"another angel\" in 9\r\n verses, but \"mighty\" (ischuros) angel is used only here in 10:1\r\n and in 18:21 where a mighty angel announces and describes the\r\n judgment of Babylon the Great. \"Ischuros\" (greek word) is used in\r\n 7 verses by John and can be found in 25 verses throughout the New\r\n Testament. It is adjective describing what He is and not what He\r\n has. He is mighty,&nbsp; powerful,&nbsp; strong and boisterious.\r\n \"Ischuros\" can also be used to give a comparative sense: stronger,\r\n mightier, more powerful. </p>\r\n <blockquote>Matthew 3:11 -- I indeed baptize you with water unto\r\n repentance: but he that cometh after me is <b>mightier </b>than\r\n I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with\r\n the Holy Ghost, and with fire: </blockquote>\r\n <blockquote> Mt 12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's\r\n house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the <b>strong </b> man?\r\n and then he will spoil his house. </blockquote>\r\n <blockquote>1 Corinthians 10:22 -- Do we provoke the Lord to\r\n jealousy? are we <b>stronger </b>than he?</blockquote>\r\n <blockquote>Hebrews 6:18 -- That by two immutable things, in which\r\n it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a <b>strong </b>consolation,\r\n who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</blockquote>\r\n <h3>The Particulars Suggest Deity</h3>\r\n <p>Inspection of the particulars of the Angel suggest He is more\r\n than just \"a messenger\", but is \"The Messenger\". More convincing\r\n of the deity of this angel than His actual title (\"another mighty\r\n angel\") is the details of his description.\r\n </p>\r\n <h4>\"clothed with a cloud\"</h4>\r\n <p>Clothing speaks of Condition (Sinful or Righteous). For examples\r\n see: 2 Chronicles 6:41; Job 8:22; 29:14; Psalm 35:26; Psalm 104:1.\r\n In Ezekiel chapter one, the cloud and rainbow was a description of\r\n the glory of God.</p>\r\n <blockquote>Ezekiel 1:28 -- As the appearance of the bow that is in\r\n the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the\r\n brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of\r\n the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and\r\n I heard a voice of one that spake.</blockquote>\r\n <p>Clouds also speak of Mystery (Indicating Deity). For examples\r\n see: Exodus 24:16;40:34; Lev. 16:2; Matt. 17:5.</p>\r\n <p>Clouds also speak of Judgment�. As clouds are indicators of a\r\n storm so the cloud here indicates a storm is coming! The storm is\r\n the judgments of God.\r\n </p>\r\n <h4> \"a rainbow was upon His head\"</h4>\r\n <p>The Rainbow is a Covenant Sign. God said in Genesis 9:13 that \"I\r\n do set my bow in the cloud\". The presence of this rainbow is sign\r\n of mercy which appears over the head of Him that is robed \"with a\r\n cloud\" which is sign of Judgment. In Judgment God Remembers Mercy!\r\n \r\n </p>\r\n <h4>\"His face was as it were the sun\"</h4>\r\n <p>In the first vision - Rev. 1:13-20. Mal. 4: 2 \"Sun of Righteousness\" Acts 26:13 \"Above the brightness of the sun.\" </p>\r\n <h4>\"His feet as pillars of fire\"</h4>\r\n <p> This is an image of pureness and judgment. It is also an image\r\n of steadfastness and glorious majesty.\r\n </p>\r\n <h4>\"And He had in his hand a little book open:\"</h4>\r\n <p>Only ONE had proven worthy to open the book and release its\r\n seals!</p>\r\n <blockquote>Revelation 5:5 -- And one of the elders saith unto me,\r\n Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of\r\n David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven\r\n seals thereof.</blockquote>\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>The Acts of the Angel </h2>\r\n\t\r\n <h3>Taking Possession</h3>\r\n <p>As described in Deuteronomy 11:24, He is taking possession of the earth and its people. \"He set His right foot upon the sea\". The sea or water is often people in Scripture (see Rev. 17:1, 15). \"And His left foot on the earth\". The earth is the place where the people dwell. Who is the world under dominion to now? Under the rule of Satan. (John 12:31; Luke 4:6; II Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2: 2) The Devil is in control\r\n now, but Jesus is soon to take over. He sets His foot upon the sea, and the land, and takes hold as His own.</p>\r\n <h3>Proclaiming Victory</h3>\r\n <p>\"Cried with a loud voice,\" Not the cry of defeat or fear. But of\r\n POWER, VICTORY and TRIUMPH; John 11:43-44 At the grave of Lazarus.\r\n Could it be that He is Awakening the Dead? \"As when a lion\r\n roareth.\" He is known as \"The lion of the tribe of Judah\" Judah-\r\n Praise -Victory -shouting in victory. Song writer said -\"That\r\n breaks every chain.\" Also the Prophet said - \"The Lord shall roar\r\n out of Zion \" Jer. 25:29-31</p>\r\n <h3>Signaling Fulfillment.</h3>\r\n <p>\"lifted up his hand to heaven\" vs. 5. a signal of Readiness or\r\n Victory.</p>\r\n <blockquote>And sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever&hellip;\r\n &hellip;that there should be time no longer.\" vs. 6. </blockquote>\r\n <p>There should be \"No more delay\" (Amplified Version). There is\r\n reason now for delay.

Measure the Temple of God [11:1-2]</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Reinstating of the Jew (11:1-2)</h1>\r\n<p>This chapter is a continuation of chapter 10. In 10:9, John ate the little book and was told he must prophesy again. In 11:1, John is given a reed. The measuring of the temple takes place during the Judgment of the Sixth Trumpet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of the Jewish people is a message to the church first of warning and then of comfort:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Warning</li>\r\n\t<p>The warning is that no one will escape Divine judgment if they take for granted His blessing and count it as their inherent privilege instead of being conditional on a covenant relationship. The Jews so proudly boasted in Jesus' day \"we are Abraham's Children\" while their hearts were FAR from God (Isaiah 29:13). They backslide from being a covenant people to a people of entitlement.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Comfort</li>\r\n\t<p>The comfort is that God is specializes RESTORATIONS! The Jews like an unfruitful branch were cut off and the Gentiles grafted in, but God has always had a mind to restore a repentant Israel. God's prophets have warned both of the dispersion of the Jews and their eventual reinstatement. This reinstatement includes their re-establishment in Palestine, but most importantly includes their restored relationship with God.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Instrument Given</h2>\r\n<h3>A Reed</h3>\r\n<p>The instrument of judgment given to John is \"A Reed\" (Kalamos). This is not a \"frail reed\" as in Matthew 11:7, but is an instrument of measurement as in Isaiah 44:13, Amos 7:7 and Ezekial 40:5.</p>\r\n<p>This reed is a \"canon\", \"Law\" or \"rule\". 3rd century church leader Origen used the word canon to refer to the \"rule of faith\". We can find the greek word \"kanon\" used five times in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 10:13,15,16; Galatians 6:16; Philippians 3:16).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Philippians 3:16 -- Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that this is \"A Reed\" and not \"The Reed\". It is \"A Law/Rule\" and not \"The Law/Rule\". God is not instructing John to measure according to the Old Testament Law and Forms, but the standard of measurement is the New Covenant which God has written on hearts and not tables of stone. (Hebrews 8:8-13; Jeremiah 31:31-34 )</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 3:3 -- Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Like Unto a Rod</h3>\r\n<p>This measuring reed is \"like unto a rod\" (Rhabdos) meaning a stick or wand, scepter (Matthew 27:9) or an instrument of chastisement (Matthew 27:30). Both Christ (Isaiah 11:4; Revelation 19:15) and the Overcomer (Revelation 2:27; 12:5) are described as ruling with a \"rod of iron\". </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although John is witnessing a fuller office of rule for the Overcomer, in one sense the rulership of the saints in the world is already evident. A look at the laws of America alone reveals the great influence of God, His Word and His people in the creation of these laws. \r\n</p><p>The Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, our currency, all 50 state constitutions and the Pledge of Allegiance all affirm the sovereign authority of God. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution both are premised on the need of the authority of law and not the authority of a man which is a Scriptural principle (Isaiah 8:19,20). For further study on Biblical influence on government consider: <a href='http://www.faithfacts.org/christ-and-the-culture/the-bible-and-government'>http://www.faithfacts.org/christ-and-the-culture/the-bible-and-government.</a></p>\r\n<p>For more on &quot;Judgment by believers&quot; see Psalm 149:5-9 and I Corinthians 6:2.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Instrument's Purpose</h2>\r\n<p>In 11:1, The angel commands John to \"rise and measure\". \"Rise\" (eqeiro) means to awaken, rouse or raise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>To Set A Standard.</h3>\r\n<p>Measuring indicates limits and the laying down of borders, dimensions, or boundaries. The \"reed\" is the standard of comparison or measurement. There are no gray areas or guesses here. Absolute determination and inspection is made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary purpose of the measuring is to answer the question how does the temple compare to the standard? Such inspection reveals changes if there are any. The command to measure suggests important changes have been made. The old has been done away and a new is coming into view. Jews had been cast off for their backslidings, but now God will bring them back (Romans 11:11-27). (Note: The Jews trapped in Judaism are confident in their bondage because they measure with an old/expired reed.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>To Declare Ownership.</h3>\r\n<p>Measuring also indicates appropriation. As when a person purchases a property and detailed surveying is made so here what is measured is claimed or owned (Joshua 1:3). God is marking His territory!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 8:10 -- &hellip;I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Articles Measured (vs. 1)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"The Temple of God\"</h3>\r\n<blockquote>I Peter 4:17 -- For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There is both an earthly and spiritual Jerusalem or \"City of God\". (Nehemiah 11:1,18; Isaiah 52:1; Matthew 4:5; 27:52-53)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the earthly temple being measured here. No human judgement is needed for the heavenly temple. In Revelation 21:15 we see a \"Golden Reed\" is used to measure the New Jerusalem. This Golden Reed is a Divine measurement. As it is built by God according to His own blueprint, the measuring in 21:15 reveals its perfection. The measuring in chapter 11 results in judgement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This temple in Revelation 11:1,2 will be judged and given to the Gentiles for a 3-1/2 years. (New Jerusalem will never be given to be trodden under foot.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"The Altar \"</h3>\r\n<h4>The Measuring reminds Israel of The demands and commands of God in regard to the \"Altar.\"</h4>\r\n<h4>Temple worship restored, vs. 1.</h4>\r\n<h4>Sacrifice Restored.

Sun-clothed Woman [12]</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>Introduction to Chapter 12</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Division of Thought</h2>\r\n<p>Chapter 12 is a dividing point in the book of Revelation. Chapters 1-3 prophetically describe the entire church age. Chapters 4-11 start and continue from the Rapture in the middle of the 7 years of tribulation. Chapter 11 concludes with the Seventh Trumpet and the climax of Christ&rsquo;s return to the earth at the end of the 7 years of tribulation. Chapter 12 resets back to the church age (the time before both the Rapture and the Translation) for further detail and prophetic truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/review-of-chapters-1-11.png' id='review-of-chapters-1-11'/>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Chapters 1-11 have progressed linearly, to this point, there are gaps in &lsquo;explanation&rsquo;. For example, Chapter 3 ended with Christ&rsquo;s appraisal of the Church being anything but complementary. Yet, chapter 4 graciously places the Church in the presence of God enjoying a great honor. Something has happened between the end of chapter 3 and the beginning of chapter 4 where the church is Raptured. Further explanation of this is given in the proceeding chapters of our study beginning with Chapter 12. Further details are given in Chapters 12-22 regarding the First 3-1/2 Years of Tribulation, concerning the wrath of God during the Second 3-1/2 Years of Tribulation and the Divine plan following that season of judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Continuation of Prophecy</h2>\r\n<p>It is important to remember that this is a book of prophecy and not history. Seven times Revelation refers to itself as words of prophecy.(Revelation 1:3; 11:6; 19:10; 22:7; 22:10; 22:18; 22:19)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A prophetic warning before judgment is an absolutely necessary part of how God does business. As a matter of Divine policy, before God would send judgment as contained in the book of Revelation, God would first give warning through His prophets. (Compare Daniel 12:4 with Revelation 22:10, I Corinthians 2:10, and Revelation 2:17.)</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Amos 3:7 &mdash; Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Importance of This Revelation</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>It was a sign.</h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;appeared a great wonder&rdquo; &ldquo;Semeion&rdquo; Miracle -Sign -Token -Wonder John 2:11; 4:45; 20:30; I Cor. 12:12; Matt.26:48;Luke 2:12; Rom.4:11; II Cor. 12:12; (II Thess.3:17 Token or Sign).</p>\r\n<p>John uses the word &lsquo;semeion&rsquo; (a sign) here for the first time in the Revelation. The intention of a symbol is to communicate meaning beyond the symbol itself. A sign is a picture or symbol of something else. It is that &lsquo;something else&rsquo; which is the true subject of contemplation.</p>\r\n<p>When interpreting Revelation it is necessary to understand that there is both literal and figurative language. Knowing when the writer uses which is key to understanding this book. When the Scripture is absent from a figurative expression or a figurative setting we should not try to make it figurative, but we should take it literal. Here John says,&rdquo; And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven.&rdquo; Something very mysterious is happening in the heavens. By John&rsquo;s statement we know the scenes in Revelation 12 must be taken symbolically or figuratively and not literally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It was an important sign.</h3>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Megas&rsquo; (great) means extraordinary and important. Not only is this a sign, but this is &ldquo;A great sign&rdquo;. This is a great, important, extraordinary, and remarkable event that needs to be studiously considered.</p>\r\n<p>How and where this sign appears should alone tell us that it is very important and should therefore arrest our attention:</p>\r\n<h4>It was Seen in the Spirit.</h4>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was in the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; John was transported through time and space.</p>\r\n<h4>It was Seen in Heaven.</h4>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A great wonder in heaven.&rdquo; That is, it was revealed to him in the heavenly realm. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meaning of this wonder is apart from the natural world. It is something of a heavenly order. It&rsquo;s not a natural thing; it&rsquo;s not in the natural order. It&rsquo;s not of the earthly, but of the heavenly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Sun-Clothed Woman (12:1,2)</h1>\r\n<blockquote>A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Who is this woman?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who the woman is not.</h2>\r\n<h3>She is not Mary &mdash;</h3>\r\n<p>Mary was of a very lowly and poverty stricken condition. Can we really interpret properly the lowly state of that little peasant woman that brought Jesus into the world, with this prophecy, fulfilling this position of a woman clothed with the sun and moon under her feet and crowned with twelve stars?</p>\r\n<p>It was a woman that brought a man-child into this world, but was that man-child caught up to God as a child? Was Jesus just a child when He went to Heaven? &ldquo;And her child was caught up unto God and to His throne.&rdquo; This does not speak of a man 33 years old, fully matured, fully grown and fully developed. If John wanted us to understand that this was Jesus, I&rsquo;m sure he would have said that the Lord Jesus was caught up to the throne. Also, Mary had passed away a long time before this vision.</p>\r\n<p>Now, let us look back into the first chapter of Revelation. I think there are some keys for interpretation there. Rev. 1 :3 says &ldquo;Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy.&rdquo; &ldquo;This prophecy&rdquo; has to do with prophetic utterance, foretelling something that is to come to pass. This book was written sixty years or more after the ascension of Christ. Remember, he is speaking of prophecy, something that is yet to take place. Also, in Rev. 1: 1 &ldquo;Things which must shortly come to pass.&rdquo; That is these things have not come to pass. This is not a record of history, but this is something that is to come to pass. Again, in Rev. 4: 1 &rdquo; And I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.&rdquo; When Christ was caught up to God, this Revelation was not yet written and it was said at the time of writing these were future. Also, is Jesus the only one that will rule the nations with a rod of iron? Rev.2:24-27.</p>\r\n<h3>She is not Israel &mdash;</h3>\r\n<p>There is another school of thought, and probably this is the more prominent teaching today. This is the belief that this is literal Israel. Israel was an earthly heritage. An earthly people- An earthly kingdom - Earthly possessions. The only time anything is mentioned to Israel with the heavens is Abraham&rsquo;s seed being as the starts of the sky, and then, only of those that are believers. Rom. 9:6-8.</p>\r\n<p>Israel as a nation is pictured in the Scriptures, especially in the book of Hosea, as an unfaithful wife and as a harlot on the streets. As you look at Israel today you can see that this is her condition rather that in the place of honor. Also, Israel was clothed with the law which speaks of judgment, darkness, and death. This woman is clothed with the &ldquo;sun&ldquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Some say this must be Israel because of what Isaiah said - Isa. 66:6, Look closely at the two texts. They are the opposite of each other.</p>\r\n<h3>She is not the world church &mdash;</h3>\r\n<p>A look at the condition of the church universally will reveal that she is not arrayed in this fashion - but, is worldly, ungodly, and devilish. How can an unholy thing produce a holy thing that is to be caught up to God and to His throne?</p>\r\n<h2>Who the woman is</h2>\r\n<p>The key to help interpret is in Rev. 1:4 &ldquo;John to the Seven Churches.&rdquo; Are we left to interpret whom John is speaking to? &ldquo;The Seven Churches&rdquo; The whole church age. John, when referring to something else, indicates this -when there is an absence of explanation -doesn&rsquo;t it only make sense that he is speaking then to the Churches?</p>\r\n<p>A woman in scripture - Rev. 17 - False here. Rev. 12 - True Church. The woman is the Church. It is a revelation of Christ and the Church. Remember -&rdquo; A great wonder in heaven.&rdquo; This is the Church - the Body of Christ. Eph. 1 :22,23</p>\r\n<p>We see not a fulfillment but a beautiful type and foreshadowing of the birthing of the Man-child in the account of Mary and the birth of Christ in Luke The Church will prepared for her work by the Word of God.</p>\r\n<p>The Angel Brought a Word Luke 1:28; Eph. 1:6</p>\r\n<p>The Word brought was that she was &ldquo;highly favored&rdquo; of the Lord. This means she was &ldquo;endued with grace&ldquo;. God was with her and she was accepted by Him. What made her &ldquo;favored&rdquo; or &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by God? (1) She was dedicated to the Lord [Jewish custom to dedicate their children to God by taking them to the temple when they are young.] (2) She was separated [vs. 27 She was a virgin] (3) She was a Believer though limited in her belief [vs. 29 &ldquo;troubled&rdquo; diatarasso &mdash; beyond her ability to believe.]</p>\r\n<p>Her question in verse 34 &ldquo;How shall this be&rdquo; was answered before she knew it- she was brought a Word and this Word must be germinated by the Holy Ghost.</p>\r\n<p>The Holy Ghost Has to Germinate the Word</p>\r\n<p>Luke 1:35 &hellip;The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: &hellip;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Power&rdquo; is that &ldquo;dunamis&rdquo; which is the supreme, infinite power of God. This was the same power with which God created the worlds. This work of perfecting the Believer is an IMPOSSIBLE one with us, but not with God!</p>\r\n<p>Luke 1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Had to Fully Surrender to the Word</p>\r\n<p>Luke 1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Word&rdquo; in verse 38 is the Greek word &ldquo;rhema&ldquo;. &ldquo;Rhema&rdquo; is the revealed Word of God. Mary fully surrendered to the: (1) Written Word&mdash;Whatever WAS said, (2) Spoken Word&mdash;the preached Word and the (3) Living Word&mdash;Follow the Lamb!</p>\r\n<blockquote>I Peter 1:4-5 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>The Man Child,12:2-5</h1>\r\n<img src=\"/images/crown.jpg\" id=\"crown\"/>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Man Child (12:2-5)&rdquo; is a continuation of the &ldquo;great wonder&rdquo; John saw in 12:1. Remember, as it is a &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; (sign, token, symbol) it demands our contemplation and careful consideration. The language used is intended to be interpreted figuratively. Also, in our previous study, we stated that the woman in verse one is the Church. Let us focus now not on the woman so much but the fact that she is with child and she gives birth to a &ldquo;man child&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<img src=\"/assets/revelation/crows.png\" id=\"manchild_crows\"/>\r\n<p>If there is a message that the devil hates, it is the message of the Man Child. This message threatens all the devil has accomplished and would like to do regarding humanity. The devil is persistent in his efforts to snatch away any seed of the message of the Man Child.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 13:19 &ndash; When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth not, cometh the wicked one, and catch it the way that which was sown in his heart.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Identity of the Man Child</h2>\r\n<p>If the woman is the church, who is the Man Child? </p>\r\n<h3>Some believe the Man Child to be Christ. (i.e., <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Scofield\">Scofield</a>)</h3>\r\n<p>Consider some objections to this theory:</p>\r\n<h4>This Wonder is Prophetic</h4>\r\n<p>This chapter is part of the vision that was given to John the beloved 60 years after the ascension of Christ. The entire vision is a revelation of things that were &ldquo;to come to pass&rdquo; AFTER it was given (Revelation 1:1; 4:1). How then can the translation of this man child refer to the ascension of Christ, which occurred six decades before this vision?</p>\r\n<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Nativity</h4>\r\n<p>Christ came down from heaven at birth. The Man Child is caught up to heaven.</p>\r\n<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Crucifixion and Ascension of Christ</h4>\r\n<p>If this Scripture refers the ascension of Christ, why should the figure of a child, which the devil cannot kill (the Man Child is not harmed by the devil), &ldquo;caught up unto God, and to his throne&rdquo; be used to symbolize the ascension into Heaven of a full-grown man, whom the devil did kill? (Christ surrendered His life and He died.)</p>\r\n<h3>The Man Child is a product of the Church.</h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The woman is in travail to bring forth&rdquo;) the woman which is the church is producing sons. </p>\r\n<h3>The Man Child is a fully mature son.</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Ephesians 4:13&mdash;Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 5:14&mdash;But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Man Child is the Overcomer in Revelation 3:21 and the Bride of Christ in Revelation 19:7.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Revealing of the Man Child</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Seed</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&rdquo;And she brought forth&rdquo; &ndash; tikto &ndash; to produce from seed. This &ldquo;seed&rdquo; is the Word of God presented much through the efforts of God's ministers which are God's gifts given to the saints (Ephesians 4:11-13).</p>\r\n<p>The seed is the revealed Word or the Word of God that has been made alive by the Spirit of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Birth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To bring forth the child is to reveal (bring to light or manifest) the child.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Romans 8:17-19&mdash;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Peter 1:3-5&mdash;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Pain</h3>\r\n<p>Revealed with great pain. Vs. 2 &ldquo;cried&rdquo; travailing in birth. Pain to be delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Romans 8:23&mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Man Child will be brought forth through intercessory prayer.</h4> \r\n<p>quot;Cried&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;krazo&rdquo; &ndash; meaning to call aloud, to cry out, or any inarticulate cries. (Romans 8:26-27) This is not a pious recital of prayers, but is a travailing in prayer is a mother travails in giving birth. The prayer must be earnest and must be in faith. &ldquo;Waiting&rdquo; in Romans 8:23 is&rdquo;Apekdechomai&rdquo; meaning to fully or eagerly expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Revealed under great persecution. Vs. 4</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be pain &ldquo;basanizo&rdquo; meaning to put to the test. There will be trials.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&rdquo; The devil will fight harder against this truth than any other truth that has been revealed because the Man Child takes his place in heaven. Vs.8.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Time</h3>\r\n<p>The Man Child is revealed in the last time. The 11th chapter ends with Christ ruling the kingdoms of this world which are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign for ever and ever. Chapter 12 brings us back to the third chapter and at the end of the church age. Luke 21:28; one Peter 1:3&ndash; The time of the revealing is just before the tribulation. The church is still on the earth and will face 3 -1/2 years of tribulation&mdash;vs. 6 &ldquo;in the wilderness&rdquo;. Also, the Man Child is revealed before the Church is perfected. Verse 14</p>\r\n<h2>The Nature of the Man Child.</h2>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A Man Child&rdquo;&rdquo;Arrhen&rdquo; or &rdquo; Arsen&rdquo; - means male. It has to do with manhood and not gender.</p>\r\n<h3>Manly characteristics -heroic virtues.</h3>\r\n<p>They are strong -not weak.They are true -not false.Not full of hypocrisy.</p>\r\n<h3>Overcomers, vs. 5</h3>\r\n<p>.&rdquo;Who was to rule&rdquo; Rev. 12:11; 2:26,27; 3:21.The &ldquo;Overcomer&rdquo; is promised to sit with Him on His throne. These are &ldquo;caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3>Humble, vs.11.</h3>\r\n<p>Did not combat the devil in their own strength. II Cor. 10:4.</p>\r\n<h2>The Characteristics of the Man Child.</h2>\r\n<h3>A student of the Word.</h3>\r\n<p>To confess the Word, you must know the Word, vs. 11.&rdquo;by the Word of their testimony&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3>A believer in the Word.</h3>\r\n<p>To confess the Word, you must believe the Word They believed in the blood of the Lamb because of the Word.Vs. 11 &ldquo;overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3>A lover of the Word.Vs 11</h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And loved not their lives&rdquo; They loved the Word more than their lives.</p>\r\n<h2>The Development of the Man Child.</h2>\r\n<p>There is a development here. The Scripture indicates a process&mdash;salvation, Holy Ghost Baptism and fully mature son. </p>\r\n<h3>Conceived.&rdquo;Gaster&rdquo;</h3>\r\n<p>Vs. 2 &ldquo;With child&rdquo; (Born-Again Believers)</p>\r\n<p>Conceived by the Word. The Word of God (like seed) is being planted in the Church by the Holy Ghost.</p>\r\n<h3>Child.&rdquo;Teknon&rdquo;</h3>\r\n<p>Vs. 4 &ldquo;Developing&rdquo;(Holy Ghost Baptized Believers)</p>\r\n<h3>Son.&rdquo;Huios&rdquo;</h3>\r\n<p>Vs. 5 &ldquo;Matured&rdquo; (the Bride of Christ, Overcomers)</p>\r\n<p>In type in Gen. 2:21, Adam and Eve. Gen. 5:24 Enoch - Methuselah - Noah.The Word of truth (like seed) is being planted in the heart of the Church by His Spirit. The Body of Christ is not yet fully-grown or mature but God is nourishing it.He will bring it forth. </p>\r\n<p>There are a lot of babes in the church. There are a lot of children in the church. There must be a maturing of sons &ndash; fully grown. \r\nA perfect man. Matthew 5:48; Ephesians 4:12-13.\r\n&rdquo;Huious&rdquo; is a fully matured son (Hebrews 5:14) that is in a position to receive full inheritance (Galatians 4:1-2; I Peter 1:4) and full power (Ephesians 1:13-14).</p>\r\n<h3>The Position of the Man Child</h3>\r\n<p>As a child, the Believer does not differ from a servant (Galaitans 4:1). </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nepos&rdquo; infant, non-speaking, immature, childish. As the Believer develops and matures in Christ there awaits for him an &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; or &ldquo;positioning as son&rdquo;. This adoption is what we are &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; (Romans 8:23) for: &ldquo;the adoption&rdquo; &ndash;the placing or positioning of sons (&ldquo;huiothesia&rdquo;). </p>\r\n<p>God does not adopt sinners into the family of God. The sinner must be born again into the family of God (John 3:7). The sinner is begotten by the Word and the the Spirit (John 3:5). Adoption is a term involving the positioning of Believers as sons. It is not a putting into the family by spiritual birth, but a putting into position of sons. Notice the Adoption the Apostle is speaking of (Romans 8:23) is yet future at his time. This positioning is a reward for MATURITY and OVERCOMING.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 12:5 &hellip; who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the prophecies about Christ in Psalm 2:9 and Revelation 2:26-27 many believe that Revelation 12:5 is talking only about Christ.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, Christ promised a position on His Throne with those that will overcome even as He overcame. The manchilde goes to the Throne of God.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 12:5 &hellip;caught up unto God, and to his throne.</p>\r\n\r\n# The Great Red Dragon - 12:3,4\r\n> Rev. 12: 3, 4 &quot;And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;\r\n![](/assets/revelation/devil-word-cloud.png)\r\nIn our text is given &quot;another wonder&quot; (sign) that is to be interpreted after the same manner as the preceding &apos;sign.&apos; It is not a &apos;literal&apos; representation of the devil as he actually looks to the eye, but is &apos;figurative&apos; of the devil&apos;s characteristics. The great red dragon is symbolic of the devil&apos;s destructive and murderous character.\r\nThis wonder is a symbol of a fierce, hostile, evil power (satan) with which the Church has, and is, and must yet contend. This evil force is determined to hinder the progress of the Church and destroy her hopes.\r\n## The Dragon\r\n### The Image or &quot;Sign&quot; is that of a &quot;Dragon&quot;\r\nDragon means &apos;huge serpent&rsquot. Dragons have often been the embodiment of the fear of the unknown. In Greek mythology, these giant serpents often guarded the far and unexplored parts of the earth.\r\n> DRAGON &mdash; &quot;The dragon, figured prominently in ancient and medieval mythologies as an embodiment of evil principle. It has been superstitiously dreaded and even worshipped, as in China, where it is the imperial emblem. It is commonly represented as a large winged serpent, with a crested head and powerful claws. In classical mythology, a dangerous, often a supernatural serpent.&quot; &mdash;Standard Dictionary\r\nThe word _dragon_ is derived from the Greek word _drakōn_. This Greek word means &apos;to see&apos;. Ancient Greeks believe the _drakōn_ had incredible sight and could spot hiding prey no matter how well hid.\r\nThere is no doubt as to the significance of the dragon symbolizing the devil as the dragon is a symbol of a power that is harmful, wicked, evil, tyrannous and murderous. The devil is a hideous blood-thirsty monster, always &quot;seeking whom he may devour&quot; (1 Peter 5:8).\r\nUnderstand, this dragon is a terrible creature that delights in attacking, terrifying and devouring. It is especially determined to attack and destroy the truth of God&apos;s Word.\r\n> Matthew 13:19&mdash;&quot;When any one heareth the Word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.&quot;\r\n> Luke 8:12&mdash;&quot;Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.&quot;\r\n> 1 Peter 5:8&mdash;&quot;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:&quot;\r\n### It is &quot;A Great Dragon&quot;\r\nWhile the picture in general is that of a dragon, it is altogether peculiar and different from the common dragon. It exceeds the ordinary idea in size and bulk, and every dragon feature is greatly magnified. The dragon is &quot;great&quot; in its evil accomplishment and great in its power to kill. It is &quot;a great&hellip; dragon.&quot;\r\n&quot;Megas&quot; &mdash; &quot;Great&quot;means mighty of external form, mighty in degree and intensity, mighty of rank (whether of persons or angels) of all those who have positions of authority and power\r\nHere is a being that has dared to set himself against the Almighty God. This &quot;dragon&quot; is trying to overcome Him and take over the universe by taking from the Creator His own creation.\r\n#### The devil has the power of death.\r\nHe has the power to put to death.\r\n> Heb. 2: 14 - Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;\r\nThe devil&apos;s ability to cause and create terrible afflictions is seen throughout the Bible, but the devil&apos; power to kill was greatly limited by Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The Law of God itself demanded death of EVERY soul that sinned. Now, because Christ paid the debt of death for the Believer, the devil has lost any legal claim to lives of the repentant. There is no such security for the unrepentant sinner.\r\n> Although the devil had the power of death, it was through death that Christ defeated him! &mdash;James Reynolds Sr.\r\n#### The devil has the ability to deceive.\r\nHe is great in his ability to deceive and destroy. The devil has the ability to deceive the whole world.\r\n> Revelation 12:9&mdash;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\r\nWhat a power of deception must lie in him who deceives angels to follow him!\r\n### It is &quot;A Great Red Dragon&quot;\r\n![](/assets/revelation/red-hexagons.png)\r\nIt is &quot;red,&quot; seemingly for two reasons. The first is to enhance his terrible appearance. The second is suggestive of his murderous, destructive character. It is a peculiar color.&quot;Purrhos&quot; &mdash; &quot;Red&quot; &mdash; fiery &mdash; bloody &mdash; the color of blood &mdash; murder. This was the color of the horse whose rider was to take peace out of the world, and bring about terrible war and bloodshed.\r\n> Revelation 6:4&mdash;&quot;And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.&quot;\r\nJesus said the devil was a murderer from the beginning, and could not tell the truth.\r\n> Jn. 8:44 &quot;Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.&quot;\r\n> &quot;There has never been a murder, but he (the devil) caused it.&quot;&mdash;Dr. J. A. Seiss\r\nFiery red also indicates the destructive and cruel nature of the dragon. The dragon is burning like fire with rage and out of control with malignant hatred against that which is righteous and godly.\r\n### It has &quot;Seven Heads&quot;\r\nSeven is a number of completeness, or fullness. This indicates the fullness of evil and wickedness. Dragons ordinarily were given one head, but this dragon possesses &quot;seven heads.&quot; Two heads would indicate confusion. Here there are seven heads. &quot;Seven heads&quot; also reveal a total and complete state of confusion. The head is the seat of governing power and it implies rule and control. The fact there are seven heads should be understood in the same sense that we read of &quot;the seven Spirits of God&quot; &mdash; a manifold unity. We have here in these heads the symbol of the entire imperial reign and rule of this world from the beginning of time to the end of this present age.\r\nThree times the Lord calls the devil &quot;&hellip;the prince of this world.&quot;\r\n> Jn. 12:31 &quot;&hellip;Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&quot;\r\n> Jn. 14:30 &quot;&hellip;For the prince of this world cometh&hellip;&quot;\r\n> Jn. 16:11 &quot;&hellip;Because the prince of this world is judged.&quot;\r\nThe Apostle Paul called him the &quot;god of this world.&quot;\r\n> II Cor. 4:4 &quot;&hellip;The god of this world hath blinded the minds&hellip;&quot;\r\n> 1 John 5:19 &quot;&hellip;The whole world lieth in wickedness.&quot;\r\n> 1 John 5:19&mdash;&quot;The whole world (around us) is under the power of the evil one.&quot; (The Amplified Bible)\r\nThe image before us presents the dragon having dominion over the governments of this world. Therefore, through these world powers, he sets himself against the kingdom of God and all that is good and right.\r\n### It has &quot;Seven Crowns upon his Heads&quot;\r\nThe &quot;heads&quot; being &quot;crowned&quot; would indicate at least to some degree, that he has been successful in his diabolical attacks.\r\n#### Successful in Deceiving &mdash; A Crown\r\n> Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon&hellip; called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;&quot;\r\n#### Successful in Dividing &mdash; A Crown\r\n> I Cor. 11: 18 &quot;&hellip;There be divisions among you&hellip;&quot;\r\n#### Successful in Defeating &mdash; A Crown\r\n> Matt. 24:12 &quot;And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.&quot;\r\n#### Successful in Denying &mdash; A Crown\r\n> Jude 4 &quot;&hellip;Denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;\r\n#### Successful in Devouring &mdash; A Crown\r\n> I Pet. 5:8 &quot;&hellip;Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:&quot;\r\n#### Successful in Delaying &mdash; A Crown\r\n> Dan. 10:13 &quot;But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me&hellip;&quot;\r\n#### Successful in Deforming &mdash; A Crown\r\n> Lk. 13:11 &quot;&hellip;A woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.&quot;\r\nLk. 13:18 &quot;&hellip;Whom satan hath bound&hellip;&quot;\r\nHe is the destroyer of both body and soul. He seduceth and misleads the whole world, promising everything including peace and prosperity, so that he can more effectively enslave and destroy.\r\n### It has &quot;Ten Horns&quot;\r\n&quot;Ten&quot; signifies the perfection of Divine Order. This is in contrast to that of an evil, wicked being, so this would be in reverse of the Divine Order; complete and total disorder.\r\n&quot;Keras&quot; &mdash; &quot;Horns&quot; are symbolic of strength, power, dominion and kingly rule &mdash; kings and their kingdoms.\r\n> Dan.7: 24 - And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&hellip;;\r\nDan. 8:20 - The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings&hellip;\r\nThese &quot;horns&quot; are not symbols of good rule but of evil power to hurt, wound, afflict and destroy. The forces which destroyedPalestinewere referred to as &quot;four horns&quot; in Zech. 1: 18&mdash;21 They scattered, oppressed, injured and destroyed the people of God. Likewise, the &quot;horns&quot; of the dragon scatter, divide, oppress, torment, injure, afflict, destroy and kill the believers in Christ.\r\n### It has A Tail\r\n> Rev. 4: 12 &quot;&hellip;His tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:&hellip;\r\nHis tail is certainly one of the most striking features of the dragon. It swings through heaven drawing a third part of the stars and casts them to the ground. These &quot;stars of heaven&quot; are very particular stars. They are not literal stars, for the whole scene is a &quot;sign.&quot; These were the angelic hosts, fitly called stars by reason of their brightness, shinning beauty and glory.\r\n> Job 38: 4&mdash;7 &quot;Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\r\nWhen Lucifer fell and became the devil, he was able to deceive and draw away a third part of the angels with him.\r\n> Jude 6 &quot;&hellip;Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation&hellip;\r\n> 2 Peter 2: 4 &mdash; &hellip; God spared not the angels that sinned&hellip;\r\nHis tail is symbolic of his ability to deceive not only angels, but also humanity (including Believers). The devil has been successful in deceiving or &apos;drawing away&apos; many saints of God. Many who secured a home in Heaven through Christ's atonement and their faith in His blood will let go of that faith and follow after the devil.\r\n> Matthew 24:24&mdash;For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\r\n> Revelation 19:20&mdash;And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.\r\n## The Mystery of the Dragon\r\nThe dragon is not altogether that great a mystery because of:\r\n> Rev. 12: 9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\r\nThe devil is not literally a dragon, as the Church is not literally a woman, but these are divinely given images or symbols. There is a devil. John recorded here that the dragon was the devil.\r\n> &hellip;The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;\r\nThis is a great contrast from his original state.\r\n> Isa. 14: 12 &quot;How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground&hellip;&quot;\r\n> Eze. 28: 14 &quot;Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth&hellip;&quot; He was the highest order of all God&apos;s creation.\r\n> Eze. 28: 15 &quot;Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created&hellip;&quot;\r\n> Eze. 28: 17 &quot;Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness&hellip;&quot;\r\nPerfect in &quot;Beauty&quot; &mdash; Full of &quot;Wisdom&quot; &mdash; Clothed in &quot;Brightness&quot; (Light &mdash; Truth &mdash; Righteousness)\r\nLucifer fell from the anointed cherub that covereth, to a murderous dragon. What happened? What caused this terrible change? God did not make a dragon (devil); He created Lucifer &mdash; &quot;The light bearer.&quot; God created him with a free will to choose to do good or evil. He was not the devil, but he became the devil through the desire to be like God, or to be God.\r\nThe dragon has great power.\r\n* Power over the nations Lk. 4: 6* Power of the air Eph. 2: 2* Power and signs II Thes. 2: 9* Power of death Heb. 2: 14\r\n> Jude 9 - Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord rebuke thee.\r\nLucifer is of the highest order of angelic beings, but is subordinate to God. Some compare the dragon in Rev. 12 to the Beast coming up out of the sea in Rev. 13\\. In Rev. 12, the seven heads wear the crowns. In Rev. 13, it is the horns that are crowned. The dragon is the head of a spiritual empire while the Beast is the head of a physical empire. This portrays a concentration of, and the exercise of, the devil&apos;s diabolical power in and through the world powers.\r\nThere is a likeness between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil. There is also the distinction between them because one works in the spiritual realm and the other works in the physical realm.\r\n## The Objects of The Dragon&apos;s Malignity\r\nRev. 12:4 &quot;&hellip;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;\r\n### The First Objective is to Devour the &apos;Man-Child'\r\nTo destroy and devour the &quot;Man-Child,&quot; the devil would have to destroy the message (the Truth of the Word) that produces the &quot;Man-Child.&quot; If there ever was a message that the devil hates, it is this message of the &quot;Man-Child&quot; &mdash; the message ofovercoming&mdash; the message ofperfection. Jesus said:\r\n> Matt.13:19 &quot;Then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown&hellip;\r\nThe power of the Word is &quot;&hellip;made of none effect&hellip;&quot; (Rom.4: 14) in the lives of those that &quot;&hellip;understandeth it not.&quot; (Matt. 13:19)\r\nWhen the Word is received and understood, it will produce the characteristics of Christ in the life of the believer. The Word produces to the extent that it is believed and obeyed. Jesus said by the same &quot;Word&quot; some would produce &quot;&hellip;thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred&hellip;&quot;\r\n> Mk. 4:20 &quot;&hellip;Such as hear the Word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.&quot;\r\nThe Scripture speaks of some as babes, some as children and some of mature age.\r\n> Heb. 5:12&mdash;14 &quot;For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the Word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&quot;\r\nThe &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be a ruling body of Overcomers that will be given power to rule the nations.\r\n> Rev. 2:26, 27 &quot;And he that overcometh, and keepeth My works unto the end,tohim will I give powerover the nations: Andhe shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:even as I received of My Father.&quot;\r\nPsa. 2:9 &quot;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&apos;s vessel.&quot;\r\nHere we see Christ ruling with the rod of iron. It is said that Rev. 12 has to be Christ because they believe He is the only one that is ruling with the rod of iron. The Overcomer has this promise of being given this power to rule the nations with a rod of iron.\r\nThe devil will try to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; as soon as he is born, but the &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be &quot;&hellip;caught up unto God, and to His throne.&quot; This is the promise to the Overcomer.\r\n> Rev. 3:21 &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.&quot;\r\nThe dragon&apos;s desire is to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; who is destined to &quot;&hellip;rule all the nations with a rod of iron&hellip;&quot; that the dragon has ruled over. All satanic activities are carried out under the ambitious motive to rule and to be worshipped. Does the devil know he will lose this place?\r\nWhen this objective failed, he attacked the Woman.\r\n### The Second Objective is to Devour the &quot;Woman&quot;\r\n> Rev. 12:13 &quot;And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.&quot;\r\nIn the Gospel according to St. Luke, Jesus spoke of the great and awful signs of the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation Hour.\r\n> Lk. 21:12 &quot;But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;\r\n&quot;Basileus&quot; &mdash; &quot;King&quot; &mdash; a sovereign &mdash; ruler &mdash; dictator (kings are not presidents)\r\nSeveral years ago the Lord showed me in a dream that the Church was going to go through &quot;Great Persecution.&quot; The Church is persecuted for three-and-a-half years to bring her to a place of separation from the world and complete dedication to the Lord.\r\n> Rev. 12:6 &quot;And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.&quot; (Three-and-a-half years)\r\nRev. 12:15 &quot;And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood (false doctrine) after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood (false doctrine).&quot;\r\nWhen this failed, he attacked the &quot;remnant of her seed.&quot;\r\n### The Third Objective is to Destroy the Seed\r\n> Rev. 12:17 &quot;And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed&hellip;&quot;\r\nThe &quot;remnant of her seed&quot; is the saints that are left after the Rapture of the Church, which takes place in the middle of the Tribulation Hour. These saints find themselves facing the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. They are represented by the foolish virgins that neglected their experience. They will have to wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and will come out of Great Tribulation.\r\n> Rev. 7:9 &quot;After this (the sealing of the 144,000 Jews) I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;&quot;\r\nRev. 7:13, 14 &quot;And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of Great Tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;\r\n## The Destiny of the Dragon\r\n### Cast out of Heaven\r\n> Rev. 12:8 &quot;&hellip;Neither was their place found any more in heaven.&quot;\r\nRev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&quot;\r\nThe devil&apos;s place was not left empty, but was found no more. The &quot;Man-Child&quot; now occupies that place.\r\n### Bound in the Bottomless Pit\r\n> Rev. 20:1&mdash;3 &quot;And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;\r\n### Loosed a Little Season\r\nThe dragon will be loosed for a short season. He goes forth and deceives many nations.\r\n> Rev. 20:3 &quot;&hellip;And after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;\r\nRev. 20:7, 8 &quot;And when the thousand years are expired, satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.&quot;\r\n### Cast Ultimately into the Lake of Fire\r\nThe dragon will eventually be cast into the lake of fire, where he shall be tormented forever, and forever.\r\n> Rev. 20:10 &quot;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>The War in Heaven, Rev. 12:7-12</h1>\r\n<blockquote>And there was war in Heaven</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Fact of a War in Heaven</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Fantastic Story?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Skeptics ridicule the idea of a literal war, and are astonished that reasonable men should believe in such an event. They believe the idea of a &ldquo;War in Heaven&rdquo; belongs only in works of fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Broad Symbol?</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Moral Conflicts in the Church</h4>\r\n<p>Others believe that this &ldquo;War in Heaven&rdquo; is a poetical and epic account of certain moral conflicts in the history of the Christian Church on earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Power Struggle in the Roman Empire</h4>\r\n<p>Others believe the Dragon to mean the Pagan Roman Empire; Michael, the Christian Roman Empire; Heaven, the throne of the Roman Emperors; and the war in Heaven, the conflicts between the Pagan and Christian Roman Emperors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The War Between &ldquo;Good and Evil&rdquo;</h4>\r\n<p>Also, some teach that we are not to believe that this was an actual event, but a sort of a summary of the prolonged battle between good and evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Definitive Strike!</h3>\r\n<p>Verse 7 states, &quot;And there was war in Heaven:&quot;, clearly communicating that John saw a &ldquo;war in heaven&rdquo;. There have been many battles&hellip;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The last great conflict when the devil was cast out of heaven, there was a battle in Eden. There the devil deceived man and he lost his position with God.</li>\r\n<li>There was a battle in hell when Christ fought and won redemption for man. He has, &ldquo;the keys of hell and of death.&rdquo; </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;, but this is WAR. John is not witnessing a battle, but a war, where (on the Earthly Front) the redeemed of humanity lay claim to the fullness of redemption, and (on the Heavenly Front) Michael and his angels, cast out the devil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In multiple places the Scripture describes satan&apos;s current estate allowing him liberty enough to accuse the righteous (compare Revelation 12:10; Job 1:9; 2:5; Zechariah 3:1-7; Luke 22:31; 2 Corinthians 12:7). John sees here a definite and decisive war that removes the &lsquo;plaintiff&rsquo; from Heaven&apos;s courtroom!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Cause of The War in Heaven</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If the war John saw is a definitive and specific war (to be contrasted with the ongoing spiritual battles we face), it raises the question: &ldquo;What causes this war?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the struggle between the devil and the people of God on this earth is long and old, something new has to happen to spark the epic conflict in Heaven. Consider the relationship of the two following events:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Man Child is Triumphantly Enthroned</li>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 12:5&mdash;And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<li>Lucifer&apos;s Place is Permanently Erased</li>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 12:8,9a&mdash;And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was cast out&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>What caused the War in Heaven? John saw Heaven foreclose on the devil, and the devil placed under the overcomer&apos;s feet! God kept His promise and the devil had to see it coming.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Romans 16:20a&mdash;And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Forces of The War in Heaven (12:7)</h2>\r\n<h3>Michael and his Angels</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some believe Michael to be Christ. This theory begs the question, &ldquo;Why did Micahel say, &lsquo;The Lord rebuke thee&rsquo;?&rdquo; (Jude 9).</p>\r\n<p>This is a heavenly host charged to defend and minister to the heirs of salvation (Hebrews 1:14).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Dragon and his Angels</h3>\r\n<p>A great malignant kingdom, and a vast spiritual empire of evil, stands opposed to God's people (Ephesians 6:11,12). His angels are those that kept not their first estate but followed Satan in his fall (Jude 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Man Child (The Overcomer)</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 12:11&mdash;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 3:21&mdash;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The War in Heaven is with and on behalf of the &quot;child.&quot; The devil will accuse the Believer before God for the LAST time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Nature of The War in Heaven</h2>\r\n<h3>The War is spiritual and not physical in nature.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are battles going on in the physical world in many different places. This is a spiritual war that will take place in the heavens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The forces that are engaged are spiritual. The War is waged in the realm of &quot;Heaven.&quot; We see no loss of life nor bloodshed in this War. (NOTE: Those that loved not their lives unto the death were martyred BEFORE this war.) Instead, there is loss of &quot;place&quot; or &quot;position&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It is a war of faith and knowledge.</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 12:11&mdash;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a war of believing and overcoming saints, supported by angels, against a malignant and hellish intellect inflamed with desperate hate and anger. In the conflict of Christ with the devil in the wilderness, the devil attacked His faith and His understanding. Like Christ, the overcomer knows, believes and fights for who he is in God. We can compare the dragon&apos;s contesting the Man Child&apos;s position on the throne with Zechariah 3:1-7.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Outcome of The War in Heaven</h2>\r\n<h3>The Dragon is defeated.</h3>\r\n<p>With all his wisdom and power, and all the fury of his hosts, the effort is disastrous, &quot;The dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not.&quot;</p>\r\n<h3>The Dragon loses his &quot;place,&quot; vs. 8.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Neither was their place found any more in heaven.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Dragon is cast out, vs. 9.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>&quot; And the great dragon was cast out,&quot; vs. 12.</blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! For the devil is come down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The man-child is victorious.</h3>\r\n<p>Sits on the throne. Reigning and ruling with Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Woman in the Wilderness, Rev. 12:6; 13-16</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>REVIEW: Verses 1 and 5 described the Woman as being \"clothed with the sun\", \"having the moon under her feet\", \"upon her head a crown of twelve stars\" and from out of her is produced the Man Child. We believe these details and the fact the this book is to be interpreted as prophecy identify this Woman as the Church or Body of Jesus Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Flight of the Woman, vs. 6,13-16</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Reason For Her Flight, vs.13.</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 12:12&mdash;Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>She makes her flight to the wilderness because she is persecuted (\"dioko\" to put to flight, drive away, to pursue) by the Dragon. Satan being ejected from heaven, by the Man Child with the aid of Michael and his angels, turns his wrath and venom on the woman. Satan persecutes the woman for two reasons: </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Having been cast out of heaven the Man Child is out of his reach.</h4>\r\n<h4>The woman is to be \"blamed\" for bringing forth the Man Child.</h4>\r\n<p>Notice that the dragon's attention is on the Man Child and readies to pounce as soon as the Man Child is brought forth. The Dragon is not concerned with the Woman until He is defated and cast down to the earth. His attack on the Against the Woman is an act of defiant rage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Place of Her Flight, vs. 6, 14.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wilderness - vs. 6.\r\n\" And the woman fled into the wilderness. \"\r\n\"Ran away\" -\"Escaped \"\r\n\"Eremos\" it is an adjective -describing something rather than indicating a place.\r\nMeaning -\"Desolate\" -\"Deserted\" -\"Lonely\"</p>\r\n<h4>A Place of Preparation -vs. 6</h4>\r\n<p>\"Where she hath a place prepared of God\" Readiness -All preparedA place of:</p>\r\n<h5>Discipline</h5>\r\n<h5>Training</h5>\r\n<h5>Testing</h5>\r\n<p>Deut. 8:2-3 Israel in the Wilderness\r\nRev. 3: 10 \"Try\" to test -scrutinize -discipline -examine -prove</p>\r\n<h4>A Place of Persecution -vs. 13</h4>\r\n<p>Great Persecution -\"Great Wrath \" vs. 12 \"Thumos\"hot anger -passion, as if breathing hard -fierceness -indignation.\r\nMost evil and wicked times on the earth.Dan. 12:2 Matt. 24:21-22 Luke 21:22</p>\r\n<h5>A Short Time To Do His Work -</h5>\r\n<p>\"Hath but a short time\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>A Place of Provision -vs. 14</h4>\r\n<h5>Special and direct help of God.</h5>\r\n<p>\"Given two wings of a great eagle. \" Ex. 19:4</p>\r\n<h5>Endued with Soaring Power -Isa. 40:31</h5>\r\n<p>\"That she might fly (in) the wilderness. \"\r\nvs. 6 says she's already fled into the wilderness.</p>\r\n<h5>Finds Her Place - \"&hellip;into her place.\"</h5>\r\n<p>( a) She had been out of her place.</p>\r\n<h6>She finds her place in the wilderness.</h6>\r\n<p>Israel wandered in the wilderness.

Though completely defeated in his attempt to destroy the Man Child and the Woman, the rage of the dragon has not lessened. Because the Man Child and the Woman are now out of his reach, the dragon makes war with the Remnant of the Woman's Seed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Remnant of Her Seed</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Remnant Identified</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>A Counter View</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most that believe the Woman is Israel and not the Church, also conclude that the \"Remnant\" are a part of Israel who were left behind when the Woman fled into the Wilderness. This is a natural and logical conclusion if the Woman is believed to be Israel and that ALL Gentile Believers have already been &quot;caught out&quot; before this time. Clarence Larkin claimed &quot;When the Church is caught out no REMNANT is left behind, all that are \"IN CHRIST\" are taken away;&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Larkin&apos;s claim is possible if no distinctions are made within the saints and all saints (regardless of spiritual maturity and level of obedience) will enjoy an identical reward. This statement appears to ignore the Scriptural truths that there are definite stages of Spiritual Development (For more on this topic see: \r\n\t<a href=\"\">&quot:The Born Again&quot;</a>, \r\n\t<a href=\"\">&quot:The Body of Christ&quot;</a> and \r\n\t<a href=\"\">&quot:The Bride of Christ&quot;</a>) and that God reserves promises relative to Spiritual Development. (See \r\n\t<a href=\"dbi/courses/the-bride-of-christ/the-difference-between-the-church-and-the-bride_11\">The Difference Between the Church and the Bride</a>)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Adopted View</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The premise we adopted in the beginning of our study of Revelation 12 is that the Woman is indeed the Church. See notes on <a href=\"/dbi/courses/revelation/the-sun-clothed-woman_73\">The Sun-Clothed Woman</a> for explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"&hellip;Remnant of her seed&hellip;\" are the true Believers in Christ who are left after the Rapture of the Church (they had no oil in their vessel at midnight when the Bridegrooom came and were left behind). These held fast the confession of their faith in Christ Jesus and are a separated people from the prevailing abomination of that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Remnant Defined</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The remnant of her seed\" means the children of the \"Woman.\" This \"remnant\" are the born again believers (the family of God) who are converts of the Church (The Woman). The \"remnant\" is that which remains &ndash; that which is left out of the whole &ndash; that which is left from the Rapture of the Church.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>God reserves promises relative to Spiritual Development.</p>\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/bride-body-born-again-image.png' class=\"inline-with-text-large\"/>\r\n\r\n<ul id=\"bride-body-saved\">\r\n<li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/sinner.png' width='25px' height='25px'/><b> (The Sinner - The World)</b> Of all the good promises of God there is reserved only the promise of the hope of salvation IF the sinner repents and condemnation if he does not.</li>\r\n\r\n <li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/saved.png' width='25px' height='25px'/><b> (The Remnant - The Born Again)</b> In John 3, only those Born Again may enter into the kingdom of God.

The remnant had not been baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ (His Church; the Woman). Either these were never baptized or they had allowed their experience to go dry.

This one-world church will be government-controlled and government sponsored and headed up by the false prophet, who causes all to worship the \"beast.\"</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nRevelation 13:11&ndash;15 \"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Economy</h4>\r\n<p>A government-controlled one world monetary system will be introduced. No one will be able to buy or sell unless they fit into the government-controlled system and receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead. There will not be a money exchange system, as we know it. There will be a transfer of credits through the computers, and without the mark you will not be able to transact business. This will force many to receive the mark.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nRevelation 13:16, 17 \"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 16:2 \"And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.\"</p>\r\n<p>Revelation 19:20 \"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast,andthemthat worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Effects of the War</h3>\r\n<h4>Great Tribulation</h4>\r\n<p>\"Megas Thlipsis\" &ndash; \"Great Tribulation\" &ndash; exceeding great affliction &ndash; to suffer affliction &ndash; primarily means a pressuring</p>\r\n<p>The Great Tribulation indicates a definite period of time, which was spoken of by the Lord, which precedes His Second Advent. The Second Advent is the \"Epiphany,\" the revelation of Christ coming back to take over the kingdoms of this world. This is not the secret coming in the air where He raptures the Church.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMatt. 24:29, 30 \"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The believers will be greatly persecuted.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMatt. 24:21 \"For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 2:22 \"Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.\"</p>\r\n<p>Revelation 3:10 \"Because thou hast kept the Word of My patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Saints Overcome</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nRevelation 13:7 \"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them&hellip;\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"Man-Child\" (the Overcomers) overcame the dragon.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nRevelation 12:11 \"&hellip;They overcame him&hellip;\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The Woman\" (the Church) escaped the dragon's attacks by a great miracle. However, these saints that were left behind during the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation are attacked and overcome by the dragon's murderous assaults. Permission was \"given\" (Revelation 13: 7) to the dragon and to the false-christ to make war with the saints and to overcome them. These saints are not Jews only, for the Scripture says, \"over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.\"</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nRevelation 7:9 \"&hellip;Of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Many Martyrs</h4>\r\n<p>Many of the saints that are left behind and go into the \"Great Tribulation\" will give their lives as martyrs, because they refused to give up their faith in Christ Jesus the Lord.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nMatt. 24:9 \"Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for My name's sake.\"</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>John 16:2&mdash;They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 6:9&ndash;11&mdash;And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 7:9&ndash;14&mdash;After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the Throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:12,13&mdash;Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Martyrs' Reward (Revelation 7:15-17)</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5>They are Before the Throne of God</h5>\r\n<h5>They Serve Him&hellip; in HisTemple</h5>\r\n<h5>They Dwell with Him that Sits on the Throne</h5>\r\n<h5>They Shall Hunger No More</h5>\r\n<h5>They Neither Thirst Anymore</h5>\r\n<h5>They Shall No More be Scorched with the Heat</h5>\r\n<h5>They Shall be Fed by the Lamb Himself</h5>\r\n<h5>They Shall be Lead unto Living Fountains of Waters</h5>\r\n<h5>They Shall Have No More Tears</h5>\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"M\">M. 2 Beasts and the Dragon [13]</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n{/*<!--\r\n\r\nMake reference to: There must be a connection\r\n\r\nRe 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nShow TIMELINE of Review Up to this Point and projection of things to come.\r\n\r\n-->*/}\r\n\r\n<h1>The Beast Out of the Sea (13:1-10)</h1>\r\n<img src=\"/assets/revelation/words-rev-13-first-beast.png\" id=\"words-rev-13-first-beast\"/>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 13:1&mdash;And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>John is seeing in the Spirit a vision of \"The Beast\".</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Origin of the Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The beast will not come from any particular place or people, but will rise up out of the sea of all humanity. The <em>sea</em> has to do with nations and peoples as explained in Revelation 17:15.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 17:15&mdash;And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact the beast rose up is referencing it coming into power. The beast rising to power is enabled by the great sin and rebellion in the hearts of humanity. Blame for the great corruption in the world cannot be laid on any particular nation, but all nations have facilitated this climax of evil. Satan seizes the opportunity of man&apos;s rejection of God&apos;s will and embodies evil in treacherous leaders. God allows leadership to arise that the people deserve!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isaiah 47:10-11; Galatians 6:8; James 4:1; Zechariah 11:7-16</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Zechariah 11:16&mdash;For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did this beast come from? Man&apos;s rejection of God as KING and their TRUE SHEPHERED.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 81:11&mdash;But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Description of the Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Beast as a Whole</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Distinct from the Dragon</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<th>The Dragon</th>\r\n\t<th>The Beast of the Sea</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>Revelation 12</td>\r\n\t<td>Revelation 13</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>7 heads wear crowns</td>\r\n\t<td>10 horns are crowned</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>spiritual empire</td>\r\n\t<td>physical empires</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h4>Controlled by the Dragon</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are likenesses between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil.

As there is one Beast with seven heads, so the system or power at work (the dragon/satan) is still one and the same though different nations or leaders rise and fall. The Beast in this vision represents the entire history of human governments and evil that has been at work in them by the devil. The Beast is a world system of rejection of God and worship of the devil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be a seventh and &apos;new&apos; kingdom of the Anti-christ that will rise as the world power, but the system that drives and the rebellion that fuels will not be anything new.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:7-8&mdash;For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. 8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Having Seven Heads</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 17:9-10&mdash;The seven heads are seven mountains &hellip; And &hellip; there are seven kings.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mountains in the scriptures can be typical of kingdoms. See: Psalms 30:7; Jeremiah 51:25; Daniel 2:25.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/assets/revelation/rev-13-7-kingdoms-2.png\" id=\"rev-13-7-kingdoms\"/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Five Are Fallen</h4>\r\n<p>In the 17th chapter we read: &quot;&hellip;Five Are Fallen&hellip;&quot;: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, and Greece.</p>\r\n<p>At this particular time John is beholding this scene, there has been five fallen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>One Is</h4>\r\n<p>\"&hellip;And One Is&hellip;\": Again, there was \"one\" in power at the time of John&apos;s vision&mdash;there is no question as to what kingdom it was. The Roman Empire was still in rule and power at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Other is not Yet Come</h4>\r\n<p>\"&hellip;And the other is not yet come&hellip;\". That is, the anti-Christ has not yet set up his kingdom. He is the seventh kingdom and he must continue a \"short space\".</p>\r\n<p>He comes on the scene during the first part of the Tribulation and then in the middle of the tribulation he is slain with the Sword and resurrected to life to be the <em>eighth which is of the seven</em>. His resurrection restores one of the seven heads of the beast and is not a new and eighth head (the beast only has seven heads).</p>\r\n<blockquote>Rev 17:11&mdash;And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Who are these Seven Kingdoms? History makes it plain who the first six are: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome. The seventh and final kingdom will be the kingdom of the anti-Christ. The beast&apos;s seven heads are seven kingdoms&mdash;seven world ruling powers. This is a full revelation of &quot;The Times of The Gentiles&quot;(Luke 21:24) from its beginning to its end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"&hellip;And Ten Horns&hellip;\"</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 7:24&mdash;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 17:12&mdash;And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<p>These are not a description of the previous kings, but are the ten ruling powers, which will rise up after the Roman Empire.</p>\r\n<img src='/assets/prophecy-and-daniel/empire-statue.png' id=\"daniel-statue\"/>\r\n<p>This is in agreement with Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream, and Daniel&apos;s vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Nebuchadnezzar</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Nebuchadnezzar saw a Great Image broken up into four sections and finally divided into ten toes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Babylon: the head</h5>\r\n<h5>Persia: the shoulders and breast</h5>\r\n<h5>Greece: the belly and thighs</h5>\r\n<h5>Rome: the thighs and legs and feet, then the ten toes; the ten horns of John&apos;s vision</h5>\r\n\r\n<h4>Daniel</h4>\r\n<p>Daniel&apos;s vision was four wild beasts: lion, a bear, a leopard and an indescribable beast.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 7:7&mdash;After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>\"And it had ten horns\"</h5>\r\n<p>We can compare these to the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream and the ten horns of John&apos;s vision.</p>\r\n<p>However, we see something in Daniels vision that is not seen in either Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream or John&apos;s vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\"There came up among them another little horn.\"</h5>\r\n<h6>John sees:</h6>\r\n<p>The beast itself being the \"Little Horn\" that comes up among the ten.</p>\r\n<h6>However Daniel sees:</h6>\r\n<p>There were three of the \"First Horns plucked up by the roots.\"</p>\r\n<p>This would indicate that Daniel saw a more advanced stage than what John declares. John saw ten horns in the 17th chapter of Revelations. This indicates that he saw them before any of them were plucked up. Furthermore at this stage they have not received their Kingdom (Rev. 17:12).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time that John was seeing that the anti-Christ \"had not yet come\" into power, was possibly just before or at, the beginning of the Tribulation. \"Which received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.\" The first part of the Tribulation hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"And Upon His Horns Ten Crowns\"</h3>\r\n<p>They have now received their crowns and John sees the time of the ten kings reigning with the anti-Christ during the first part of the Tribulation.</p>\r\n<p>For after this John sees the seventh head wounded and resurrected.</p>\r\n<p>However John makes no more mention of the ten kings, but Daniel declares that three of them fall before the anti-Christ when he is resurrected from death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Another Beast (13:11-18)</h1>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Rev. 13:11&mdash;And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>John said &quot;I beheld another beast&quot;. In the exact same sense that John saw the first beast, he sees also a second beast. Whatever reasoning is used to understand the first beast must also be applied to the second beast. Both beasts (though they are different) are <em>seen</em> by John in the same setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The secular empire that will overwhelm the world will not work alone. The extant of the first beast&apos;s success can largely be attributed to the presence and work of another beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Description of the Second Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Another</h3>\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/two-beasts-relationship.png' id='two-beasts-relationship'/>\r\n<p>This beast is addition to the first beast and rises up <strong>after</strong> the first beast. By great deception, he will advertise and promote the beast which came &quot;before him&quot; The relationship of these two beasts has often been compared to the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist. This other beast will be a prominent promoter of the Anti-christ. This second beast will be instrumental in the deception of the Anti-christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Beast</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the first, the second is a dangerous, wild and even venomous beast (empire). Standing on the shore, John saw a tremendously evil influence rise out of the earth. Despite having some characteristics of a lamb, there is no confusion here&mdash;this is an evil thing in rebellion against God and His order. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coming Out of the Earth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Though a beast (empire) it&apos;s realm is of a different nature than the first beast. Key to understanding the second beast is noticing its source. This beast&apos;s origin can be compared with the first beast&apos;s. The first rises out of the sea of humanity and through a succession of rising and falling empires, but the second comes from out of earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a crucial and vulnerable time when all humanity is an unsettled and tempestuous sea crying for answers and clarity comes from out of the &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;land&quot; (stable, settled, authoritative) something whose appearance and whose voice validates the authority of the first beast. The second beast&apos;s message is &quot;Have no fear, this is the <em>right</em> path!&quot;. Coming from a seemingly neutral and stable perspective and wielding supernatural ability, the world will conclude: &quot;It must be ok, the <em>voice of reason</em> said it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two horns like a Lamb</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Horns are representative of a ruler.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 7:24&mdash;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/philomena.jpg' id='philomena'/>\r\n\r\n<p>The lamb-like horns indicate something of a spiritual nature. This second beast completes the depth of the world system of evil. The Dragon empowers the first beast with a secular empire and the second beast validates and completes this empire with its own spiritual or religious empire. Here is something that appears in part <em>lamb-like</em> but has the nature of a wild and venomous beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Mt 23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Actions of the Second Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Spoke as a Dragon</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The lamb-like horns and then the voice of a dragon indicate a real change in character and in policy. For example, laws that were promoted as protections for religious liberty today could be used to accomplish the opposite! The beginning will be applauded for the sake of the &quot;greater good&quot;, but will not manifest in a utopia but in great terror. </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">Slowly our government is becoming a dictatorship instead of a free democracy - a government by the people - of the people - for the people. We are headed to a New World Order. We failed as a people to occupy till He comes. We need to be preparing ourselves to get out.&mdash;Rev. James Reynolds, Sr.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The Second Beast is actually the mouthpiece of the Dragon, so truly, the Dragon is speaking. Even now, the Dragon is already speaking. Herein is an warning to KNOW the voice of God! The only security in this age of deception is a vibrant relationship with Christ and familiarity with His voice. By knowing the TRUE you can spot the FALSE a long ways off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exercised the Power of the First Beast</h3>\r\n<blockquote>vs. 12a&mdash;And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n \r\n <p>The Greek word (poieo) for <em>exerciseth</em> is a very common word in the New Testament. It is used at least 519 times and in the book of Revelation is also translated as: <em>do, bring forth, make, cause, commit, continue, fulfil, wrought, bare</em> and <em>work</em>.</p>\r\n <p>The Greek word (exousia) for <em>power</em> means <em>mastery, strength, right</em> or <em>authority to rule</em>. To the second beast will be delegated the power of authority that belongs to the first beast. The first beast will have the both the ability and right to act as it does in the same sense a king acts sovereignly within his kingdom. The second beast will have the same ability and authority because it will be delegated to him by the first beast.</p>\r\n \r\n <blockquote>vs. 12b&mdash;&hellip;and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</blockquote>\r\n \r\n <h3>Performs Great Miracles (Sets the Hook)</h3>\r\n \r\n<p>Among other unexplainable and miraculous feats, he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. It is by the means of these miracles that he deceives those that dwell on the earth. (Galatians 1:8) This miracle power does come from God, but comes from the beast. A union or pact has been made between these beasts as we see the first beast delegating power and authority and the second beast returns loyalty and validation to the first beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Teaches a Blasphemous Gospel (Reels them in.)</h3>\r\n \r\n <p>The first beast is wounded, and then raised, and incarnated by the devil. The second beast teaches that the world should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. He tells them that the miracle of resurrection now proves beyond all doubt that this is not just a good leader, but this beast is a god to be worshipped!</p>\r\n \r\n <h3>Murders in the Name of God</h3>\r\n \r\n<p>And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>\r\n \r\n <h3>Mark &amp; Number of Apostasy</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 13:16,17&mdash;And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mark Of The Beast will be instituted by the false prophet.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>By Deception (a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing), vs. 11,14</li>\r\n\t<li>By Miracles, vs. 12-13 (&quot;must be God!&quot;)</li>\r\n\t<li>By Coercion, vs. 15 (&quot;Do or Die&quot;)</li>\r\n\t<li>Design of the Mark, vs. 16 (&quot:causeth all&hellip;to receive a mark&quot;)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"N\">N. The Glorious Judge and His Judgment[14, 17, 18]</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>Song of the Hundred and Forty-Four Thousand (Revelation 14:1-5)</h1>\r\n<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>\r\n<p>Revelation 13 concludes with a gloomy tale of a reign of darkness. In Chapter 13 we read of two terrible beasts and their great deception against those who would receive the Beast&apos;s mark. Chapter 14 opens with a glorious scene featuring firstly the Lamb and secondly 144,000 redeemed souls who were marked, but it was God the Father's name on their forehead! We find the details surrounding the Song of this 144,000 in Revelation 14:1-5.</p>\r\n<h2>The Lamb on Mount Sion (vs. 1)</h2>\r\n<blockquote>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion,</blockquote>\r\n<h3>The Lamb</h3>\r\n<p>The &quot;Lamb&quot; appears in 27 verses throughout Revelation and His identity cannot be mistaken!</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 5:6&mdash;And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood <strong>a Lamb</strong> as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote> John 1:29&mdash;The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Was Slain</h4>\r\n<p>the Lamb that was slain\r\nunto the Lamb for ever and ever.\r\nthe wrath of the Lamb:\r\nmade them white in the blood of the Lamb.\r\novercame him by the blood of the Lamb\r\nthe book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p>\r\n<h4>Standing in the midst of the Throne</h4>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 22:3&mdash;And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</blockquote>\r\n<h5>And the four beasts, and the elders (5:6)</h5>\r\n<h5>With the Sealed Book [WAS slain!] (5:8; 6:1)</h5>\r\n<h5>With Wrath (6:16)</h5>\r\n<h5>With an Innumerable Multitude worshipping before Him (7:9)</h5>\r\n<h5>Feeding and Leading the Innumerable Multitude (7:17)</h5>\r\n<h5>Overcoming those that Make War with Him (17:14)</h5>\r\n<h5>Marrying His Bride (19:7; 21:9)</h5>\r\n<h5>As the Temple (21:22)</h5>\r\n<h5>As the Light (21:23)</h5>\r\n<h5>Having a Book of Life (21:27)</h5>\r\n<h5>Having a Pure River of Water Proceeding out of His Throne (22:1)</h5>\r\n<h3>Standing on Mount Sion</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 87&mdash;His foundation is in the holy mountains. 2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. 6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Matthew 21:5 and John 12:15 say to Tell the daughter of Sion that her King is coming to her! Hebrews 12:22 says the Believer has not come to a smoking and burning physical mountain that cannot be touched but unto Mount Sion the City of the Living God.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 12:22&mdash;But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</blockquote>\r\n<p>The word &quot;zion&quot; expresses ideas of strength and permanence such as a fortress, monument, or landmark.</p>\r\n<p>Zion is called both the city of David (1 Kings 8:1; 1 Chronicles 11:5; 2 Chronicles 5:2) and the city of God. The fortress was considered so impenetrable they mocked David saying he would not be able to take fortress even with blind and lamb sentries on guard. David captured the Jebusite fortress in 2 Samuel 5:7:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Mount Zion is also the highest and southernmost mount of Jerusalem, rising about twenty-five hundred feet above the Mediterranean, but Scripture emphasizes Mount Zion more as a Spiritual concept and less as a physical place. Mount Zion is most importantly understood as the people of God.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 48:2&mdash;Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.</blockquote>\r\n<h2>The 144,000 (vs. 1-2)</h2>\r\n<p>and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</p>\r\n<p>2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p>\r\n<h2>A New Song (vs. 3-5)</h2>\r\n<blockquote>3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Judgment Hour Preachers (Revelation 14:6-7)</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<blockquote>vs.7&mdash;&hellip;the hour of his judgment is come&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Christ as judge.</h3>\r\n<p>The pre-eminent content of the Angel&apos;s message is, &quot;The hour of His judement is come.&quot; The church goes (is raptured) and God&apos;s judgment follows. Not only does this message involve the present judgment that will come on the world in the midst of the seven years, but this message also relates to Christ&apos;s coming and judging of the world.</p>\r\n<h3>The Truth Unbound</h3>\r\n<p>Revelation chapter 14 takes place in the middle of the seven years of God&apos;s dealing with the nation of Israel. During the last phase of the judgment of God, the anti-christ will be in rule and will have destroyed or bound all apparent means of the Gospel being proclaimed. However, God has commissioned His angels to speak at this time!</p>\r\n<p>Upon Christ&apos;s entry into Jerusalem, fault was found with the loud proclaimations of praise given Christ as the Messiah and King. Christ answered:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Luke 19:40&mdash;And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</blockquote>\r\n<p>The truth of God and His claims must be spoken. If men are brought to silence, other things must become vocal to testify for Jehovah. In a time when the anti-christ has successfully burried away in caves, mountains and the wilderness all human testimony for God, the heavens speak and the angels whom the anti-christ cannot touch become preachers in the darkest hour of judgment.</p>\r\n<p>This is in keeping with order of things already gone by. The angels testified just before Christ&apos;s first coming and they will again just before His second coming. The angels will testify and preach to all those that dwell on the earth.</p>\r\n<p>Their pulpit will be mid-air and all nations, tribes, tongues and peoples are their audience. Hell may slay, imprison and silence every human witness for God, but it cannot bind the truth! God's Word cannot be bound. It must be heard.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Timothy 2:9&mdash;Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>1 Peter 1:23&mdash;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>First Message &ndash; &quot;The Everlasting Gospel&quot; (vs. 6-7)</h2>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:6,7&mdash;And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</blockquote>\r\n<p>We find in verses 6 and 7 all the elements necessary for the preaching of the Gospel: God inspiring a preacher, a pulpit, a message, an audience and a delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Nature of the Messenger</h3>\r\n<p>This is definitely an angel (a Heavenly messenger) that is proclaiming the message John hears. The fact that an angel is preaching reveals that the present dispensation is now undergoing a change and is ready to pass away while another is beginning to take its place.</p>\r\n<p>Of old, angels were employed for the giving of the law, the heralding of Christ's coming and in the judgment time they are conspicuously everywhere taking part in the Divine administrations with regard to our world. But, in the dispensation under which we now are, the charge of preaching and witnessing for God and the declaring of His Word is the ministry of the Church. The preaching of the Gospel is in the hands of men.</p>\r\n<p>It is now the duty of the Church to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all who will believe. Angels are ministers to the heirs of salvation, but not the preachers of the Gospel of Christ to a world lost in sin. The disciples (Acts 5:19), Philip (Acts 8:26), Cornelius (Acts 10:3), and Paul at sea (Acts 27:3) all benefited from the ministry of angels which enabled them to fulfill their own responsibility in preaching of the Word of God. It is not presently the duty of angels to proclaim the Word of Truth, but is the Believer's present duty and privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Position of his Pulpit</h3>\r\n<p>The Angel's pulpit is positioned in the midst of heaven. In Hebrew are three words to describe three levels of &quot;heaven&quot; 1) Shameh means sky 2) Shachaq means firmament and 3) Galgal means heaven as in the place of God's throne. The Angel's pulpit is in the midst of the sky (See Strong's GREEK#3321 <em>mesouranema</em>). Men will hear the voice, but will not be able to silence it. They will try to block their ears and yet will still hear!</p>\r\n<p>This pulpit is also positioned in a time of judgment. The time and season makes the message all that more vital and its delivery so monumentally grave&mdash;hear ye him (Matthew 17:5).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Content of the Message</h3>\r\n<p>The manner of its delivery will change, but there will be no change in the message. These angels have the everlasting Gospel to preach. It is the same Gospel the Apostles preached and not another beause there is no other Gospel.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Gospel is good news.</li>\r\n<li>The Gospel is power. (Romans 1:16)</li>\r\n<li>The Gospel is a warning or forerunner of judgment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Paul warned the church already about anyone would preach another gospel.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 1:8&mdash;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Notice his message: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fear God: to be in awe and reverence.</li>\r\n<li>Give glory to Him: Worship God in Spirit and in Truth (John 4:24) as well as in the beauty of holiness (Psalm 29:2).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 29:2&mdash;Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. </blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For the hour of His judgment is come</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Bible has much to say about judgment. Enoch (Jude 14-15), David (Psalm 1:5), Isaiah (30:18), Jeremiah (4:2), Ezekiel, Daniel (7:10), John the Baptist (Matthew 3:12), Jesus (Matthew 25:31-32), Paul (2 Thessalonians 1:7-8), Peter (II Peter 2:9) and John the Beloved (1 John 4:17) all preached judgment.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Him that Made it All</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We have neglected Him He matters most and truly Him alone who matters! While we gazed into His Heavens, drank of His waters and profited by His earth we failed to honor Him as God. Repent!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Auditors of the Message</h3>\r\n<p>It would seem a strange thing to believe that every nation, kindred, tongue and people hear the angel in the same language and understand what he says. It would take a long time for this angel to go to every nation and kindred upon the face of the earth and speak in each tongue and dialect. However this sermon is presented in a short period of time. The same God that confounded the language of man at Babel will cause them to understand His messengers!</p>\r\n<p>Many testimonies of this particular miraculous power of God have been shared. To remember one account here, we don't have to look that far into history. Oral Roberts while he was preaching in India experienced God work this same miracle. While he preached in English, the people heard in their native languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Delivery of the Message</h3>\r\n<p>Though it is the same Gospel being proclaimed&hellip;</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:7&mdash;Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</blockquote>\r\n<p>&hellip; yet its manner of delivery has changed. It is no longer the meek and entreating voice beseeching men to be reconciled to God, but a great thundering form the sky demanding of the nations to fear God. The reason given for the change in delivery is the fact:</p>\r\n<blockquote>&hellip;the hour of His judgment is come&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<p>The church-period has given place to the judgment hour. When this is understood, the whole matter clears up. Mercy towards the poor infatuated world still lingers in the very hour of wrath. In the heat and height of His indignation, God still remembers mercy. </p>\r\n<blockquote>Habakkuk 3:2&mdash;O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</blockquote>\r\n<p>And, when there is no human voice left to speak it, an angel from heaven will speak mid-air proclaiming to the guilty world to turn to God. </p>\r\n<p>This is one of the very last calls of grace to an apostate world. The finality of the coming herald and the limited amount of time in which the people of God have to work, ought to spur us to redeem the time and preach the Everlasting Gospel!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Babylon is Fallen (Revelation 14:8)</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:8&mdash;And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</blockquote>\r\n<p>With the hour of judgment comes the work of judgment. The messengers of God are busy declaring the mind of God. The same cry is made both in chapter 14 and chapter 18.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 14:8&mdash;&hellip;Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:2,3&mdash;&hellip;Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, &hellip; 3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This cry is declaring something in the future and yet the sense of the declaration is given as though it is already past. When God says it, future judgment is no less definite than history. Because He is sovereign, God calls things that aren't as though they were. The utter destruction of Babylon is certain.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Babylon is Destroyed</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Emphasis Should be on the Reason for her Destruction</h3>\r\n<p>Believers can and do differ over what Babylon literally is, but it is important to unite in emphasizing what the Scripture does say about it. &quot;Babylon&quot; will be destroyed because of her false teaching and murder of the saints.</p>\r\n<p>The name Babylon is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Babel. Throughout the Bible, Babylon is a symbol of the confusion caused by godlessness. </p>\r\n<p>The unveiling of the real enemy is found in what Babylon DOES and SAYS and not an inherent evil because of where it can be found on a map or because of historical sentiment towards it. The City of Rome or even the area near Baghdad, Iraq are only in danger of God's Wrath for the same reasons any people or nation will suffer judgment&mdash;if they set themselves as the enemies of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Reason</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Babylon is destroyed because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. All who drank of her wine are guilty of spiritual adultery or idolatry.</p>\r\n<p>What is the wine that she made all nations to drink? False doctrines. As harlots would utilize love potions and intoxicating drinks so the City of Babylon has used and will use false doctrine to entrap.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:10-12&mdash;And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>An Illustration from history: In November 1978, 909 people drank cyanide-laced grape-flavored Flavor Aid at the instruction of religious leader and community organizer Jim Jones. Jim Jones attracted a large following to his Peoples Temple through sermons on tolerance, social responsibility and community. As the church grew, however, the sermons on equality and tolerance were replaced by demands for personal loyalty and obedience. (In 1973, Jones had been arrested for soliciting a man for sex&mdash;homosexuality.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proverbs 23:32 is speaking of drunkenness and wine, but is appropriate as well for the devil's tactics of false doctrine:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Proverbs 23:32&mdash;At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Babylon is Destroyed</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Babylon is fallen</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Place and Its Religious System</h3>\r\n<p>There are some that make a great difference between the Mystery Babylon in Chapter 17 and the City of Babylon in Chapters 14 and 18, but both &quot;Babylons&quot; are two parts of the same thing: 1) a place 2) a system. The emphasis is put on the system in the 17th chapter and in 14:8 and the 18th Chapter the emphasis is on the city itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Literally, the City of Babylon</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Not Just Rome</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Babylon, who is the Mother of Harlots (17:5) and the Habitation of Devils (18:2) is fallen. As Rome, Italy (or more specifically Vatican City) has been instrumental in both Christian martyrdom and the spread of false doctrine, this prophecy concerning the fall of the City of Babylon is generally believed to be a prediction concerning the city of Rome, Italy. This interpretation is seemingly influenced by the long standing prejudice of the Protestant church historically at war with the Roman Catholic church. </p>\r\n<p>The passage does not say Rome, but it does say Babylon. To be consistent in our method of interpretation of the this great Book, we will interpret Babylon literally as the city originally built by Nimrod in the land of Shinar and rising and falling throughout history, but being utterly destroyed in the Day of God's Wrath. Truly, Babylon is the birth place of the false doctrine woven throughout Roman Catholicism and not the other way around (i.e., Mother-Infant worship).</p>\r\n<p>The Roman Catholic church is not the only religious system guilty of spiritual adultery. God would not be justified in sparing one and punishing another unrepentant group for the identical criminal act. Babylon is not just Rome. It is bigger than that. It is an apostate religious world.</p>\r\n<h4>Not Utterly Destroyed, Yet</h4>\r\n<p>The City of Babylon was situated in the Land of Shinar on the Euphrates River, about 50 miles south of modern Baghdad, Iraq. Although Babylon was effectively eliminated as an empire when it was taken by the Medes and Persians after the 70 year Jewish exile, all prophecies concerning it have not yet been entirely fulfilled. </p>\r\n<p>The conquering empire of Persia did not destroy Babylon, but instead made it a royal city. Babylon appears importantly in history 500 years after Christ, for it was at Babylon that Jewish Academics compiled the Talmud (the basis of all codes of Jewish Law). Also Modern Day Bahgdad, Iraq stands near the original location of Babylon.</p>\r\n<p>Isaiah 13:6,19-22; Jeremiah 50:40; 51:64 and Revelation 14:8; 17; 18 give an image of an extreme and absolute destruction not yet seen. Much of this has been fulfilled, but not all will be fulfilled until the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 13:6).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Isaiah 13:19,20&mdash;And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</p>\r\n<p>Jeremiah 51:64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Rebuilding Babylon</h4>\r\n<p>Babylon will fall, but first it must be rebuilt. Before her utter destruction that will take place in the Day of the Lord's Wrath, the city of Babylon will first become instrumental in centralizing apostasy. What the Vatican is for just 1.2 Billion Roman Catholics, Babylon will arise for the greatest apostate ecumenical group the world has ever seen. Read Zechariah 5:5-11.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Zechariah 5:10,11&mdash; Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 11 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Babylon is Destroyed</h2>\r\n<h3>Babylon is destroyed by fire</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:18&mdash;And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!</p>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:21&mdash; And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Isaiah 13:19-20; Jeremiah 50:40.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Babylon is Destroyed Quickly</h3>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:10&mdash;&hellip;in one hour is thy judgment come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Rewards of Allegiance (Revelation 14:9-13)</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Introduction &mdash; Loyal to the Cause</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Allegiance speaks of loyalty or commitment to a group or cause. It reminds us of fidelity which is faithfulness to a person, cause, or belief, demonstrated by continuing loyalty and support. Often allegiance is spoken of in the context of citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ILLUSTRATION: The American &lsquo;Pledge of Allegiance&rsquo; was originally written for children for a one time use in 1892. The verse intended to commemorate Columbus Day originally read:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which is stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, it has undergone two changes. The National Flag Conference of the American Legion replaced \"my Flag\" with &lsquo;the Flag of the United States of America.&rsquo; in 1923. Secondly, in 1954 President Eisenhower signed a bill that added the words \"Under God.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, as humanity&apos;s allegiance to God is failing, it is strongly argued by many to remove the words \"Under God\" from the American Pledge. Whether or not these voices are successful, the testimony of \"The Pledge of Allegiance\" has been to date to strengthen, clear up and better our commitment. The line of demarcation between saint and sinner will become more and more pronounced as the end of all things approaches. The intensity of the day of God&apos;s wrath will solidify the allegiances of men. The wicked will do more wickedly, but some will sure up their allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ and even seal their testimony with their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Joshua 24:15&mdash;And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>God's cause is Redemption and Restoration of all things lost through sin. The devil's cause is to destroy through sin.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 John 3:8&mdash;He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as sure as you can back a loser and lose all your investment, so our spiritual allegiance comes with a certain reward or consequence. There is no fence in this contest for the hearts and souls of men. The athlete on the bench can celebrate because he was on the winning side, and even if a benched player on the losing side never saw a second of game-time, he, just like his other team mates, lost. Our allegiance marries us to the destiny of our cause. The devil's is a lost cause and Christ is always the victor! In practice, where does my allegiance lie? Whose cause do I faithfully promote? The end of THAT cause, will be my end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Allegiance to the Beast(vs. 9-11)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Judgment on the followers of the Antichrist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Reason for their Judgment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would anyone worship the devil? In the two reasons given for their judgment, we also see the reasons for their allegiance. There are two groups who hold allegiance to the Beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>They that Worshipped the Beast and his Image</h4>\r\n<p>There are those that give evidence of their fidelity to this system by worship. They honor and give service to the Beast because they are his \"true believers\". These are loyal to the Beast's cause because they believe in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>They that Received his Mark (forehead or hand)</h4>\r\n<p>Not all who make up the masses in allegiance to the Beast are so because they are sold on his ideology. Many join themselves to the enemies of God without any formal or declared intention of hostility toward God. Many will conform out of necessity. Many will surrender to the Beast's influence because without his mark on their hand or forehead they cannot survive in society (Revelation 13:17).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter the individual's reasons for aiding the devil in their life and in the world, they have chosen to side against Christ. If we are not with Christ doing what He wants, we are against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 12:30&mdash;He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Content of their Judgment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Wine of the Wrath of God.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:10&mdash;&hellip;wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His indignation&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This judgment promised is an undiluted (\"without mixture\") concentration of punishment from God Almighty poured into the cup of God's anger. The offenders are then made to drink of that cup to the full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As wine is an intoxicating and overwhelming drink so it is used in Scripture to symbolize these effects (Psalm 60:3). There is the Wine of the Spirit which is an abundant joy in Holy Ghost, but there is also the Wine of Wrath or Violence which parallels the poisoned cup of certain criminals who were obliged to drink and which caused a speedy death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These will drink of the cup of God's indignation because they chose to drink of the cup of iniquity and spiritual fornication (Revelation 14:8). We are all born in sin and condemned to drink of God's wrath, but Christ died and drank that bitter cup so we would not have to (Luke 22:42).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 2:9&mdash;But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Fire and Brimstone</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Tormented (torture, pain) with fire and brimstone (sulphur) as Sodom and Gomorrah and the rich man in hell (Luke 16:23).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Two Phases of their Judgment</h4>\r\n<h5>In the Presence of the Holy Angels and of the Lamb. </h5>\r\n<p>Presence, face, in sight of, before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>In the Lake of Fire</h5>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 20:10&mdash;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Duration of their Judgment</h4>\r\n<h3>The Smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever</h3>\r\n<h3>They have no rest day nor night</h3>\r\n<p>Matthew 25:46; Mark 3:29; 2 Thessalonians 1:9</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Allegiance to the True Christ (vs. 12-13)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the day of God's Wrath not all will be found in confederacy with devil. They will not conform to the Beast's system for any reason at all. These are tribulation saints.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Saint's Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>They Are Patient</h4>\r\n<p>2 Thessalonians 1:4; Hebrews 6:15; James 5:11; Revelation 1:9</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>They Keep His Commandments</h4>\r\n<p>They not all profess allegiance, but their loyalty is evidenced by their obedience (John 14:15).</p>\r\n<h4>They Have the Faith of Jesus</h4>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Saint's Blessedness</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:13b&mdash;&hellip;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours;&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Saint's Rewards</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:13c&mdash;&hellip;and their works do follow them.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Wood, hay and stubble versus gold, silver and precious stone. Their reward is based on their motive and their faithfulness in that allegiance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When missionary George Atley was killed by a band of hostile tribesmen, he was carrying a fully loaded, 10-chamber Winchester rifle. He had to choose whether to defend himself or or with his life defend the fragile mission work in that foreign land. When his body was later found in a stream, Nearby lay his rifle:all 10 chambers still loaded. He had made the supreme sacrifice, motivated by his burden for lost souls and his unswerving devotion to his Savior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing on Philippians 1:20 in The Bible Knowledge Commentary, Robert P. Lightner said,:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">Paul's concern was not what would happen to him but what testimony would be left for his Lord. Release would allow him to continue preaching Christ. But martyrdom would also advance the cause of Christ.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Philippians 1:20&mdash;According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Reaping and Pressing (Revelation 14:14-20)</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Foundation for the Biblical Harvests</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Deuteronomy lists the major crops of the land of promise:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Deuteronomy 8:8&mdash;A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Three Harvest Seasons</h3>\r\n<img id=\"harvest-seasons-israel\" src=\"/assets/revelation/harvest-seasons-in-israel.gif\" />\r\n\r\n<p>In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest. Let us highlight the two of the three major crops because they relate directly to our text in Revelation 14.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Grain Harvest (Spring)</h4>\r\n<p>Barley and wheat were the most important crops of the spring harvest. Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Pentecost was celebrated near the end of the grain harvest with grain and loaf offerings (Leviticus 23:16-17). Newly harvested grain could not eaten until the offering of the firstfruits to God was first made. Pentecost was also called the &quot;The Feast of Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Feast of Weeks&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Exodus 23:16&mdash;And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Grape Harvest (Summer)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>After Pentecost, most of the harvest was fruit: grapes, olives, dates, figs, pomegranates and numerous fruits, seeds and vegetables of lesser importance. Grapes were the first major crop to ripen. In a good year, when the grain yield was great, threshing and grape picking overlapped. The grape harvest was usually completed before the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two Festival Seasons: Spring Feasts and Fall Feasts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The three harvesting seasons were celebrated by two major festival seasons. The Spring Feasts of Passover, Firstfruits, Unleavened Bread, and Pentecost teach of the beginning of Christ's ministry and the Fall Feasts of Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacles represent the completion of His ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider these feasts in sequence:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Spring Feasts (May/June)</h4>\r\n<h5>Passover&mdash;God passed over the Israelites when he killed the Egyptian firstborn.</h5>\r\n<h5>First Fruits&mdash;The first fruits are the first to come and are specially dedicated to God as a reminder that all good things come from God. It also was a pledge of a greater harvest to follow.</h5>\r\n<h5>Unleavened Bread&mdash;A Memorial of Israel&apos;s hasty exodus from Egypt.</h5>\r\n<h5>Pentecost&mdash;Pentecost (Shavuot) was originally a festival for expressing thankfulness to the Lord for the blessing of the harvest. </h5>\r\n\r\n<h4>Fall Feasts (September-October)</h4>\r\n<p>These feasts, which became known as \"The High Holy Days\", celebrated in the 7th month marked the conclusion of the religious year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Trumpets (1st day of 7th month)&mdash;The feast that called people to prepare to stand before the judgment of God. Instead of celebratory it was spent in private and grave introspection&mdash;fasting and prayer.</h5>\r\n<h5>Atonement (10th day of 7th month)&mdash;The importance of the Day of Atonement is revealed by the fact that in the Talmud the name was shortened to simply \"The Day.\" Celebrates God's Creation and God's new creation through atonement. A new beginning celebrated having been cleansed from sin. Day of Atonment represented the conclusion of the judgment that began ten days earlier.</h5>\r\n<h5>Tabernacles (15th day of 7th month)&mdash;The Feast of Tabernacles, also known as the Feast of Booths and Sukkot, is the seventh and last feast that the Lord commanded Israel to observe. God delivered Israel out of the land of Egypt and they were to live in a temporary tabernacle for eight days and look forward to the coming Messiah.</h5>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Luke 12:37&mdash;Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching:&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reaping of the Harvest (vs. 14-16)</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:15&mdash;And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>&hellip;Thrust in Thy Sickle&hellip;</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</blockquote>\r\n<img id=\"christ-crown-cloud-sickle\" src=\"/assets/revelation/christ-crown-cloud-sickle.png\" />\r\n<p>Execute the judgments which God has decreed. It is time for the judgment&mdash;no more delay or waiting. God has waited, but no more! The Lord coming in a white cloud speaks both of righteousness and judgment. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>White/Righteousness (Matthew 17:2; Revelation 3:5,18; 4:14; 7:9; 19:8). </li>\r\n<li>Cloud/Judgment (Matthew 17:5; Luke 21:27; Revelation 1:7).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 1:7&mdash;Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of <u>the earth shall wail because of him</u>. Even so, Amen.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting on the cloud, He is in a position of rulership. Christ is seen here ruling in judgment. It is Christ for John says \"like unto the Son of Man\" (Revelation 1:13).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On His Head is a Golden Crown (His church in glory and already awarded; I Cor. 6:1-3; Rev. 4:4; II Timothy 4:8) and in His hand is a sharp sickle. The sickle is a hooked knife and harvesting instrument used to pluck, gather, or cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&hellip;For the Harvest of the Earth is Ripe&hellip;</h3>\r\n<p>The cup of iniquity is full. Their sins are ripe or ready for judgment. Sin has ripened to the harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&hellip;And the Earth was Reaped&hellip;</h3>\r\n<p>What plagues descend with the sharp sickle! What a cutting down and devastation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pressing of the Vintage (vs. 17-20)</h2>\r\n<img id=\"pressing-wine\" src=\"/assets/revelation/treading-wine.jpg\" />\r\n<p>After the grain harvest comes the grape harvest. The grapes are cut down and then placed in the wine press. This pressing will be performed by God himself in a place called Armageddon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Gathering into the Great Wine Press of the Wrath of God</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 16:14-16&mdash;For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the harvest of the \"earth\" and judgment not on a local but global scale. All the nations will be gathered: the kings, leaders, armies, antichrist, false prophet, and the followers of the beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armageddon is a name occurring only once in the Bible and designating the place where the last great battle of the ages will take place. Armageddon is a Hebrew word, although it does not occur in the Old Testament. Its meaning is not exactly clear, but it is best taken to mean Mount Megiddo, since \"Har\" in Hebrew means mountain and \"Mageddon\" is the place-name of Megiddo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Old Testament history Megiddo was a place of numerous decisive battles because of the broad plain that stood before it. Deborah and Barak defeated Sisera and his Canaanite army there (Judges 4-5), Gideon drove off the Midianites and Amalekites ( Judges 6 ), Saul and the army of Israel were defeated because of their failure to trust in God ( 1 Sam 31 ), and the Egyptian army under Pharaoh Neco killed Josiah, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 23:29 ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some take John's designation literally, expecting the armies of the earth to gather against God in the endtimes below the remains of Old Testament Megiddo; others see in it a more figurative element. They point out that Megiddo was not really a mountain at all and that the battle will take place in the plain. Perhaps John designated it Mount Megiddo as a clue to its symbolic meaning, drawing together the historic place of conflict in Israel's history with the prophecies of Ezekiel that speak of the great end-time conflict taking place in the mountains of Israel ( Ezekiel 39:2,4, 17 ).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Treading in the Great Wine Press of the Wrath of God</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Grapes would be tossed into the winepress, and then a person or persons would stomp on the grapes with their feet until all the grape juice was pressed out. The Wine press is the wrath of God and these grapes are all the enemies of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 63:1-3&mdash;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. 2 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 2:9&mdash;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:20&mdash;And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">And the winepress was trodden without the city, eternally without the city of the heavenly Jerusalem, and far from the presence of God; eternally crushed and trodden down by his justice; eternally tormented in body and soul, without any hope either of living or dying! This is the miserable lot and portion of those who shall have despised the law of God, and died in impenitence. My God, pierce my heart with a salutary dread of thy judgments!&mdash;Adam Clarke </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A lake of blood to the size of 200 sqaure miles and as high as a horse's bridle! Such a slaughter is the end sin brings. Christ is victor over all His enemies. Revelation 19:13 tells us His vesture is \"dipped with blood\" and his name is \"KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS\".</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As there were intertwined the harvesting and the festivals, so in the midst of the end of all things and God's judgment is both the God-ward and man-ward side of all things. God ultimately reaps the harvest and humanity is that harvest. There will be a harvest of the wicked as well as in in-gathering (as the crops are ready) of the Believers. God is allowing the tares and wheat to grow together, but soon there will be an ingathering and distinction made.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 13:30&mdash;Let both grow together until the harvest:&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The first-fruits is an in-gathering dedicated entirely to and for God.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2 Timothy 2:19&mdash;Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>P. Mystery Babylon [17]</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>Judgment on the False Church (17)</h1>\r\n<p>Chapter seventeen tells about the judgment of the False Church who is called the &quot;Mother of Harlots&quot; because of her spiritual adultery. Harlotry is symbolic of false worship or the worship of idols (idolatry). </p>\r\n{/*<!--\r\n##The Political System\r\n\r\n###The Beast\r\n\r\n###The Kings\r\n\r\nwe left out a lot of details concerning the system that WINS (initially)\r\ntalk more of the Beast \"The mystery of the Beast\"\r\nTalk more of the ten horns\r\n-->*/}\r\n\r\n<p>This woman will be a one-world church and as is all false religion will be attended with lewdness. Religion has never been so rich, so powerful, united and so unclean. Before her judgment, she is in a moral and spiritual wilderness, but advanced in achievements of science, materialism and humanistic philosophy.</p>\r\n<h2>The Time of the Judgment</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 17:3&mdash;So he carried me away in the spirit&hellip;\r\nRevelation 1:10&mdash;I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The False Church will suffer this prophesied judgment in the End-Time. She is an End-Time False Church and will face her judgment in the time of the end.</p>\r\n<h2>The Place of the Judgment</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 17:3&mdash;&hellip;into the wilderness&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In a general sense, the wilderness is a place of testing and more specific to Revelation it is symbolic of the tribulation period that takes place just before the Lord returns (12:14). This false church will be in control for most of the tribulation hour.</p>\r\n<h2>The Receiver of the Judgment</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 17:3&mdash;&hellip;and I saw a woman&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In relation to Christ, the Scripture refers to the church as a woman (1 Corinthians 11:3; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:24-32). God illustrated His desired relationship with His people with the relationship of a husband and wife.</p>\r\n<p>In Revelation 12, we read about the True Church (<a href=\"/courses/revelation/the-sun-clothed-woman_73\">&quot;The Sun-Clothed Woman&quot;</a>). Now, in Chapter 17, we read about the judgment on the False Church.</p>\r\n<h2>The Outstanding Details of the Judgment</h2>\r\n<h3>She is a Mother (vs.5)</h3>\r\n<p>As she is a mother, she is producing something. The True Church produced a singular and unified Man Child (12:5), as well as, truth and strength. The False Church produces a divided and plurality of harlots (17:5), as well as, error and weakness.</p>\r\n<h3>She is Sitting (vs. 1,3,9)</h3>\r\n<p>Sitting is a position of control or rule. As a king or judge sits in their authority. She is a dictator over <strong>the people and nations</strong> (vs. 1,15 &quot; many waters&quot;) and <strong>the beast</strong> (vs. 1,3,8,11-13,16 this beast is the anti-christ).</p>\r\n<p>She sits with overwhelming control of the one-world government that is evil and sinful. The False Church rides in control on the scarlet colored beast. She is therefore in control of the nations.</p>\r\n<h3>She is Clothed (vs. 4)</h3>\r\n<p>The Bride of Christ is dressed in fine linen clean and white which is the righteousness of saints (Revelation 19:8). This woman is dressed in the attire of a harlot.</p>\r\n<h4>She is arrayed in purple which is the color of royalty. This woman is not truly royal, but is a hypocrite.</h4>\r\n<h4>Not only is color of the beast scarlet, but she is also clothed in scarlet. Scarlet is the color of sin.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Isaiah 1:18&mdash;&hellip;though your sins be as scarlet&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>She revels in all that is an abomination to God. Read Proverbs 6:16-19; Deuteronomy 22:5.</p>\r\n<h4>She is decked with gold and precious stones and pearls.</h4>\r\n<p>There are two Scriptural aspects to Gold. In the positive, gold speaks of divinity and the perfect nature of God. In the negative, gold is the best of the riches of the world. She is not godly or divine, but she is rich with the riches of the world.</p>\r\n<p>All her ornaments are form the world. Her inspiration comes form the pagan and godless cultures of the world.</p>\r\n<h3>She Has a Cup in Her Hand (vs. 4)</h3>\r\n<p>This not the cup of the Lord, but is the cup of devils. This golden cup is filled with the abominations and filthiness of her fornication. She is not sharing the Gospel, but it is &quot;another gospel&quot;.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>vs. 2&mdash;With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>She is very influential. She has corrupted many others with the teaching of her false religion (1 Timothy 4:1). </p>\r\n<h3>She has a Name (vs. 5)</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>She is Drunk (vs. 6)</h3>\r\n<p>She is drunk with precious blood of martyrs who are the saints of the Lord Jesus Christ. This was all a great (megas) mystery (admiration) to John.</p>\r\n<h3>She has an End (vs. 16)</h3>\r\n<p>There is a two-foldness to her judgment. Her fall is mentioned twice (17:16 and 18:21).</p>\r\n<p>She is hated and overthrown. At first the beast carries the woman (vs. 3) and the torn horns hate her and make her desolate and naked and then burn her.</p>\r\n<p>She had her time of rule and it glittered like gold, but &quot;pay day&quot; always comes for the enemies of God. With every blasphemous act or false doctrine she added to the cup of her own judgment.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 17:16&mdash;&hellip;burn her with fire.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Those that are with the Lamb (17:14)</h1>\r\n<p>In the midst of judgment within a spiritual wilderness, we see a glorious promise.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 17:14&mdash;These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</blockquote>\r\n<p>We see the action and the resulting end of the False church, Antichrist and the powers that rule with him. They make war with the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them! For He is Lord of lords and King of kings. There are those who set themselves in opposition to the Great King, but in this verse we also see some are \"with Him\". Herein is a promise to some, that they can overcome WITH the Lamb. These are the Called, Chosen and Faithful of God. These are the army of the Lamb.</p>\r\n<h2>Called</h2>\r\n<h3>Definition</h3>\r\n<p>GREEK - kletos - adjective - invited, appointed</p>\r\n<blockquote>Romans 1:7&mdash;To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Called to Salvation</h3>\r\n<p>All are invited to salvation (Matthew 11:28; 20:16; 22:14; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).</p>\r\n<h3>Called to be Saints</h3>\r\n<p>We are saints \"by calling\" (Jeremiah 31:3; John 6:44; 12:32; Romans 1:7; 8:28; 1 Corinthians 1:2; Jude 1).</p>\r\n<h3>Called According to His Purpose</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Romans 8:28&mdash;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Chosen</h2>\r\n<p>GREEK - eklektos - adjective - chosen out, select, favorite</p>\r\n<p>Luke 23:35; 1 Peter 2:4,9;</p>\r\n<h3>Not all are Chosen (Matthew 22:14)</h3>\r\n<h3>Chosen Before the World (Ephesians 1:4)</h3>\r\n<h3>To Pick Out</h3>\r\n<p>To hand pick and choose for oneself. This does not imply the rejection of what is not chosen (Mark 13:20; Luke 6:13; John 15:16; Ephesians 1:4; James 2:5).</p>\r\n<h3>To Take that which May be Taken</h3>\r\n<p>Taking that which is eligible or suitable to be taken. The choice is made according to suitability (Matthew 12:18; Psalm 25:12).</p>\r\n<h3>The Chosen are the Elect (1 Peter 2:9)</h3>\r\n<h2>Faithful</h2>\r\n<p>GREEK - pistos - verb - trustworthy, true, reliable, loyal, believe, faith</p>\r\n<h3>Passive</h3>\r\n<p>Meaning Faithful in the sense of to be trusted and reliable. Matthew 24:45; 25:21-23; Acts 16:15; 1 Corinthians 4:2; Ephesian,s 6:2; Colossians 1:7; 1 Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 3:5</p>\r\n<h3>Active</h3>\r\n<p>Faithful in the sense of actively believing and trusting. John 20:27; Acts 16:1; 2 Corinthians 6:15; Galatians 3:9.</p>\r\n<h3>The Faithful will be wise</h3>\r\n<h3>The Faithful will be good</h3>\r\n<h3>Faithful to God</h3>\r\n<h3>Faithful to the Truth</h3>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>These are not separate groups (Called, chosen, faithful), but is a description of those who are WITH and overcome WITH the Lamb.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Timothy 2:12&mdash; If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Fall of Babylon the Great (Ch. 18)</h1>\r\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>Mystery Babylon is a place as well as a system. The System has two parts: Religious (Ch. 17) and Commercial (Ch. 18). The fall of Babylon is mentioned twice (17:16 and 18:21) because there are two stages to her judgment. First, the religious part of the system will be judged and then the commercial part of the system.</p>\r\n<p>In the judgment upon the religious part of the system (Ch. 17), she is put down and taken over by the Antichrist. This will unite religion and commerce, making the State (Antichrist) supreme. Babylon the Great, in final revelation, is a city ruled over by the Antichrist as both the religious and political head. She becomes abundantly rich in carnal wealth for her aid to the devil.</p></p>\r\n<p>Both the place and the system of &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; will suffer greatly for her role in the Antichrist's efforts. </p>\r\n<p>It is important to note, that presently, there is no city &quot;Babylon&quot;. If the place &quot;Babylon&quot; (50 miles south of modern Iraq) is to be included in this judgment, Babylon as a city must first be rebuilt.</p>\r\n<p>The important detail concerning Babylon is not where on a map can we place her, but what is she guilty of that incurs such severe action from God. Babylon in Chapters 17 and 18, is at the very least symbolic of both a religious system (ch. 17) and a commercial system (ch. 18) that become God's enemies.</p>\r\n<h2>The Announcement of her Judgment (vs. 1-8)</h2>\r\n<h3>The Announcing Angel, vs. 1-3</h3>\r\n<p>A glorious messenger appears from out of heaven.</p>\r\n<h4>He Comes with Great Authority</h4>\r\n<p>All power and authority truly belongs to God! (Daniel 7:14; John 5:26-27; 1 Corinthians 15:24)</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>John 5:25&mdash;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h4>The Earth is Lighted with His Glory</h4>\r\n<p>This is never said describing created beings, but is often said of God! (Psalm 72:18,19; Isaiah 6:1-3; Ezekiel 43:2; Revelation 1:13-16; 21:23)</p>\r\n<h4>He Cries Mightily with a Strong Voice</h4>\r\n<h3>The Calling Out of God's People, vs. 4-8</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:4&mdash;And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Before the mighty word goes into effect, a voice from heaven (probably, the Father) says come out of her, my people. His people are warned to avoid getting caught up in the marketing of the evil system. (An effective advertisement is one that convinces you that you need something.) </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Come Out of her</li>\r\n<li>Call on Jesus </li>\r\n<li>Repent of Sin</li>\r\n<li>Be Born of the Spirit (Not a soul-ish or intellectual thing, but a spiritual experience.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Satans really merchandise is the souls of men. He takes advantage of and seeks to rob a man of his soul. What do we want? Faith or Feeling. Bible or Psychology. (1 Corinthians 13:45) The devil employs all manner of means in this market: business, religion, drugs, sex, gossip, lustful and rebellious music, </p>\r\n<h2>The Reaction to Her Judgment (vs. 9-20)</h2>\r\n<p>The fall of Babylon is one of the most marvelous events of all time (i.e., the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah). Consider how this would effect the whole world and even how it would effect you. Her fall is a great disappointment to many as just at her height of success she is destroyed. All the schemes of human progress are left disappointed and many will lament. , but there are mixed reactions to her judgment for two worlds are involved. There some who will rejoice while others are crying.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:9,20&mdash;And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, 20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Lamentation</h3>\r\n<h4>Lamenting of Royalty, vs. 9-10</h4>\r\n<h4>Lamenting of Merchants, vs. 11-16</h4>\r\n<h4>Lamenting of Shipmasters, vs. 17-19</h4>\r\n<p>But while these lament, a grand jubilee fills the sky!</p>\r\n<h3>Rejoicing</h3>\r\n<h4>The Heavenly Beings Rejoice</h4>\r\n<h4>The Apostles Rejoice</h4>\r\n<h4>The Prophets Rejoice</h4>\r\n<h2>After her Fall (vs. 21-24)</h2>\r\n<p>Re 18:21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.\r\n 22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;\r\n 23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.\r\n 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>O. 7 Last Plagues in Vials [15-16]</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Development of Final Judgment (Ch. 15)</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 15:5-8&mdash;And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 6 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Introduction &quot;Another Sign&quot; (15:1)</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 15:1&mdash;And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Time of the Sign</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The harvest of the grain and the vintage in Chapter 14, brings us to the end of this present age. So, the events in chapter 15 occur before or during the harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Message of the Sign</h3>\r\n<p>John sees another sign in Heaven. This is a &quot;sign&quot; just as in Revelation 12 John saw two signs: 1) The Sun-clothed Woman and 2) The Great Red Dragon. It with relevance to these that he calls this &quot;<u>another</u> sign&quot;.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>John uses the Greek word &quot;semeion&quot; in seven verses (12:1,3; 13:13,14; 15:1; 16:14; 19:20). &quot;Semeion&quot; means <i>a symbol or miraculous wonder</i>. The sign John sees here is a &quot;symbolic miracle or wonder&quot; Wonders and miracles are supernatural acts that prove a point or express a message. According to John 10:38, Jesus used miracles to communicate the message that He is God. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>John does in fact see something, but as a sign, what John sees should be interpreted figuratively. John sees a wonder and the wonder with its details communicate a message. The detailed wonder John sees is symbolic, but the death and devastation it speaks of is very literal. Signs of healing accompany the preaching of the Gospel (Mark 16:17; 1 Corinthians 14:22); however, signs of death attend the end of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Characteristics of the Sign</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>John characterizes what he sees not only as a &quot;sign&quot;, but as &quot;great and marvellous&quot;. Respectively, these words are: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>megas&mdash; large, mighty, strong (Matthew 8:24)</li>\r\n\t<li>thaumastos&mdash; wonderful, marvellous (1 Peter 2:9)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is <b>great</b> because it involves so much more in range and intensity than any catastrophe that has ever been. It is <b>marvellous</b> because of the unparalleled character of what it foretells. What it describes is altogether extraordinary and on an astounding scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tribulation Victors (15:2-4) </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before giving the particulars of this great and marvellous sign, John interjects with another vision of a higher and more gracious order, though it is still connected with the outpouring of the plagues. When the wicked are cut off, the righteous will see it. When the plagues fall upon the anti-christ and his hosts, these victors are on high singing, harping and praising God, giving glory to God and to the Lamb!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Their Position &mdash; The Sea of Glass</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 15:2&mdash;&hellip;a sea of glass mingled with fire&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This reminds of the sea of glass in Revelation 4:6 which was spread out before the throne. There is a difference between these two verses. In Chapter 4, the sea of glass was &quot; like unto crystal&quot; in clearness, but in Chapter 15, the sea of glass is mingled with fire. Also, in Chapter 4, the sea appeared to be part of the pavement of heaven, but in Chapter 15, it appears as a mighty reservoir of just judgements about to be poured upon the world. The crystal sea is sort of base on which the whole celestial city is established&mdash;purity, vastness, strength. The sea mingled with fire is a sea of just judgements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Their Victory</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 15:2&mdash;&hellip;them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>These will have complete victory over the beast (The Person), his image (The Doctrines), his mark (The System), and the number of his name (The Society). Their reward for victory is a position on the sea of glass in heaven, having harps and singing praises to God.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Their Song</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Their song is an exultant testimony of God as victor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Song of Moses</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We find Moses&apos; song in Exodus 15:1-11. It is a song celebrating deliverance from Egypt and the destruction of Pharaoh's host by God. The Book of Wisdom says that on this occasion in Exodus 15:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">God opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of infants eloquent</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Hebrews sang rejoicing by the Red Sea, so the Victorious Redeemed will sing by the Sea of Glass mingled with fire. God and therefore his saints will always have the last word!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Song of the Lamb</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Song of the Lamb is redemption&apos;s song! (\"I am Redeemed\", \"Thank God I am Free (saved, saved, saved)\", \"I've been to Calvary\", etc. Here is recorded at least a part of their song.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Seven Angels (vs. 5-6)</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 15:5&mdash;&hellip;the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This tabernacle is in Heaven. The old tabernacle was merely a pattern of things in heaven (Hebrews 8:1-5; 9:23). The &quot;temple of the tabernacle&quot; references the inner tabernacle&mdash;the Most Holy Place or Holiest of All. It was in this tabernacle of testimony the Ark of the Testimony was kept. Therefore, these angels come from out of the Most Holy Place of Heaven&mdash;the throne of God was opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The angels are clothed in pure and white linen which speaks of righteousness. More important than their personal righteousness is the righteousness and holiness of the ministry these angels were to perform. As the priests ministered in the tabernacle in linen, speaking of Christ's righteousness and the ministry that they were performing, so these angels have a ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were girded with golden girdles. Gold speaks of Divinity and girdles speak of the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 1:13&mdash;And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Testament priest were girt with a girdle of a different material because it spoke of redemption, but the girdle here is of gold and the setting of Divine wrath. These priest-like angels have an administration of pouring out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Giving of the Vials (vs. 7,8)</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 15:7&mdash;And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice the mission of the Church in the judgement. One of the four beasts (a part of the church) gives the seven angels the seven golden vials full of the wrath of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:2-3&mdash;Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other times scripture says the temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God was in 1 Kings 8:10,11 and Isaiah 6:1-4. &quot;No man was able to enter into the temple&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Seven Last Plagues (Ch. 16)</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 15:1&mdash;&hellip;in them is filled up the wrath of God.</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Is This Prophecy Already Fulfilled?</h2>\r\n<p>Some interpreters try to parallel these vials with definitive and mostly historical calamities:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>FIRST: French Revolution in General</li>\r\n\t<li>SECOND: Naval Wars of the French Revolution</li>\r\n\t<li>THIRD: Battles of Napoleon in Italy</li>\r\n\t<li>FOURTH: Tyranny of Napoleon</li>\r\n\t<li>FIFTH: calamities which befell the city of Rome and the Pope in consequences of the French Revolution</li>\r\n\t<li>SIXTH: The wane of Turkish power and return of the Jews to Palestine along with the subtle influences of infidelity and popery.</li>\r\n\t<li>SEVENTH: Some further war with Romanism and disaster to the city of Rome.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This line of interpretation leaves many difficult questions. Are France and Italy the whole earth? Has the tribulation hour even come yet? Are half a dozen naval battles the turning of the ocean into blood? Was Napoleon's artillery the sun scorch of blasphemers?</p>\r\n<h2>What are these Vials?</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 16:1&mdash;And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;Vial&quot; is the Greek word &quot;phiale&quot; meaning a broad shallow cup. Phiale is used 12 times in the N.T. and all occurrences can be found in the book of Revelation.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>5:8 Vials full of prayers of the saints</li>\r\n<li>15:7; 16; 17:1; 21:9 Seven Golden Vials full of the wrath of God</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The seven vials are full of the wrath of God. These seven vials are seven definitive and final judgments. (Revelation 15:1; 21:9 &quot; seven last plagues&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>These plagues are not historical, but are the consummation of all plagues. The last will be the worst. The plagues of Egypt and other historical calamities are a mere rehearsal of that to come.</p>\r\n<p>In the following actions, God&apos;s wrath is completely expressed. It climaxes and is ended. Not only does John describe these as the &quot;last&quot; plagues, but they are also seven in number which expresses completeness. By the time these seven plagues are accomplished, God&apos;s wrath upon the earth will be completed or satisfied.</p>\r\n<p>The command to execute the plagues comes not just from the temple in general, but from out of the opened Holy of Holies in the temple of God in heaven (15:5; 16:1). In the Holy of Holies was kept the Ark which contained (Hebrews 9:3,4) a golden pot of manna, Aaron&apos;s rod that budded and two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. It is because of the Ark and its contents that this place is called &quot;the tabernacle of the testimony&quot; They were evidences or witnesses to the fact that the presence God was among his people.</p>\r\n<p>As there are levels in the American Judicial system (District Court, Superior Court and Supreme Court) so, the fact that the Holiest place of the temple is involved speaks of an advanced judgment. this is it! There is no higher court or further level of appeal.</p>\r\n<h2>What Events Lead Up to These Final Judgments?</h2>\r\n<p>The order of these events are highlighted in the sequence we have found them in the scripture. As many of the events in chapters overlap others and some give further detail to events already discussed, this summary is not an attempt to create a chronological &quot;timeline&amp;quot. Following is a review of the truths as we discover them in reading through the Book of Revelation.</p>\r\n<h3>Inspection, Remedy, Reward (Ch. 1-4)</h3>\r\n<p>Christ made inspection and sent messages to His Church. Saints make corrections according to the Lord's warnings. Some hear and repent making themselves ready and others are spewed out of his mouth into 3 1/2 years of tribulation and awakening. Translated and Raptured believers are both seen around the throne of God.</p>\r\n<h3>Seven Seals of a Book of Judgment Have Been Opened (Ch. 5 through 8:1)</h3>\r\n<p>The Lamb of God was the only one worthy to open the Book and release its seals. These seals revealed calamities that are part of God's plan of judgment and not just the normal course of history. White, Red, Black and Pale Horses and their horseman revealed a moral war, Divine vengeance, famine, and a fourth part of the world dead. The Fifth Seal revealed the fact that the Tribulation Hour will involve many Christian martyrs. The Sixth Seal reveals fearful physical events&mdash;sun become black, moon became as blood, and stars fall. Finally, a silence falls over Heaven for one hour. </p>\r\n<h3>Seven Trumpets Have Sounded (Ch. 8 through 11)</h3>\r\n<p>Following the silence in Heaven, a Mystery Angel remembered the death of the martyrs. Seven other Angels then prepared to sound their trumpets. Not all at once, but one after another in increasing judgment their trumpets are sounded as the death of saints are a witness against the world. Since the servants of God now had been sealed (Ch. 7) the prohibition to not hurt the earth (7:3) is lifted. </p>\r\n<h4>One, Two, Three, Four</h4>\r\n<p>In the first four trumpets the blasts effected the material world: hail and fire mingled with blood devastate trees, grass and crops; a third part of the sea is made blood and a third both of its creatures and ships are destroyed; a third of the waters become poisonous (Wormwood); a third of the sun and moon and a third of the stars were darkened. </p>\r\n<h4>Five, Six</h4>\r\n<p>The door between the physical and spiritual worlds is opened: tormenting locusts are released from the bottomless pit; four bound fallen angels are released from the river Euphrates. </p>\r\n<p>A Cloud Robed Angel declared possession of the earth and its people, proclaimed victory and held a scroll that revealed further bitter experiences to follow. The temple was measured for the reinstatement of the Jew. Two witnesses miraculously ministered and then were killed once their work was complete.</p>\r\n<h4>Seven: The Coming of the Lord</h4>\r\n<h3>Pre-Tribulation, Tribulation and Great Tribulation (Ch. 12 &amp; 13)</h3>\r\n<p>John saw (Ch. 12) the signs of the Sun-clothed Woman, the Man Child, the Great Red Dragon, the War in Heaven, And the War with the Remnant of the Seed of the Woman. The eventual Period of Great Tribulation and the Rule of the Antichrist (Ch. 13) set the stage for these Seven Vials.</p>\r\n<h2>The Results of the 7 Vials</h2>\r\n<h3>ONE: The Followers of the Anti-christ, 16:2</h3>\r\n<p>They will face noisome and grievous sores (Luke 16:20). These ulcers and stinging sores will be incurable.</p>\r\n<h3>TWO: The Sea, vs. 3</h3>\r\n<h3>THREE: The Rivers, vs. 4-7</h3>\r\n<h3>FOUR: The Suns Heat Released, vs. 8-9</h3>\r\n<h3>FIVE: The Throne of the Beast, vs. 10-11</h3>\r\n<h3>SIX: The Gathering of the Nations (Armageddon, vs. 12-16)</h3>\r\n<h3>SEVEN: The Judgment of the Nations, vs. 17-21</h3>\r\n\r\n<MarriageAndMarriageFeast />\r\n<MillenialKingdom />\r\n<LastJudgment />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>T. All Things New [21:1-27; 22:1-5]</h1>\r\n\r\n# New Heaven and New Earth\r\n\r\nTEXT: Revelation 21\r\n\r\n>Revelation 21:1&mdash;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nJohn sees that there will be a new heaven and a new earth and then he describes in awesome detail, \"New Jerusalem\".\r\n\r\nJohn applies the descriptions of walls, gates, a tabernacle and foundations and even calls what he sees in a lot of places a \"city\". But, John also compares what he sees with \"a bride adorned\" and names it in one place \"the lamb's wife\".\r\n\r\nJohn describes what he sees coming out of heaven from God as a \"holy city\", \"new Jerusalem\", \"as a bride adorned\", \"tabernacle of God\", \"great city\", \"holy Jerusalem\", \"the Bride\" and \"the Lamb's Wife\".\r\n\r\nWho or what is this \"city\" like? Is it a place or a person? (vs. 9) In order to understand this \"great city\", we must carefully consider the details as John laid them out for us.\r\n\r\n## The End and The Beginning (vs. 1-8)\r\n\r\nThe \"end\" John sees is not an \"extinction\" but a transition&mdash; made new!\r\n\r\n### First Glimpse (vs. 1,2)\r\n\r\nHeaven and Earth. John's first impression is that he is seeing something somewhat familiar, and yet it is altogether different. He says he sees a \"new earth\" and yet it is an earth with no sea. He says he sees a \"new heaven\" and yet it is a heaven where the veil between it and earth is removed.\r\n\r\nThen John sees another \"new\" thing. It is New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven like as if it were a \"young married or betrothed woman\" who is ready for her husband as she has put everything in proper order and is beautifully decorated. \r\n\r\n### A Proclamation (vs. 3-8)\r\n\r\nThe great voice (THE Voice!) proclaims what God is going to do.\r\n\r\n#### Dwell with Men (vs. 3)\r\n\r\nNotice that New Jerusalem comes \"down from God\" and from \"out of heaven\" in verse 2. This is not a description of God's people finally going to heaven to be with God or \"men with God\". What John sees is more accurately understood as \"God with men\".\r\n\r\n> Revelation 21:3&mdash;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.\r\n\r\n#### Bring an End to Former Things (vs. 4-8)\r\n\r\n> Revelation 21:6&mdash;And he said unto me, **It is done**. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end&hellip; \r\n\r\nThere are many awesome advantages to this new arrangement:\r\n\r\n1. No More Tears\r\n2. No More Death\r\n3. No More Sorrow or Crying\r\n4. No More Pain\r\n5. No More Thirst\r\n6. No More Battles\r\n7. No More Unbelief\r\n\r\n## A Tour of New Jerusalem (vs. 9-27)\r\n\r\n> 9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, \r\n\r\nI will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.\r\n\r\n### The Vantage Point (vs. 10)\r\n\r\n#### In the Spirit\r\n\r\n> And he carried me away in the spirit\r\n\r\n#### A Great and High Mountain\r\n\r\n> to a great and high mountain, \r\n\r\n### The Descriptions (vs. 10-\r\n\r\n1. A City (vs. 10)\r\n\r\nand shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, \r\n\r\n2. Comes out of Heaven from God (vs. 10)\r\ndescending out of heaven from God,\r\n\r\n3. Having the Glory of God (vs. 11)\r\n11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;\r\n\r\n4. 12 Gates, 12 Angels and 12 Names (vs 12,13,21, 25-27)\r\n\r\nand had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:\r\n 13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.\r\n\r\n21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.\r\n\r\nALL MAY BE SAVED\r\n\r\n25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.\r\n 26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.\r\n 27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.\r\n\r\n5. A Wall with 12 Foundations (vs. 12,14-20)\r\n12 And had a wall great and high, \r\n\r\n- 12 Foundations\r\n\r\n 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.\r\n\r\n- Measuring the Wall\r\n\r\n 15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.\r\n 16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.\r\n 17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.\r\n\r\n 18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.\r\n 19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. \r\n\r\n> In the heavenly city we have harmony, not monotony; variety, not sameness; unity, not uniformity. The stones are not arranged in the order of the high priest&apos;s breastplate, but according to their various shades of colour, beginning from the foundation.&mdash;Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers \r\n\r\nNOTE: The following are merely educated guesses as to the actual gems referred to in Revelation 21.\r\n\r\n1.**Jasper**, dark opaque green.\r\n\r\n2.**Sapphire**, Lapis-lazuli, opaque blue.\r\n\r\n3.**Chalcedony**, an Emerald of a greenish hue.\r\n\r\n4.**Emerald/Smaragdus**, bright transparent green.\r\n\r\n5.**Sardonyx**, white and red.\r\n\r\n6.**Sardius**, bright red.\r\n\r\n7.**Chrysolite**, our Topaz, bright yellow.\r\n\r\n8.**Beryl**, bluish green.\r\n\r\n9.**Topaz**, or Peridot, yellowish green.\r\n\r\n10.**Chrysoprasus**, a darker shade of the same colour.\r\n\r\n11.**Jacinth/Hyacinthus**, Sapphire, sky blue.\r\n\r\n12.**Amethyst**, violet.\r\n \r\n6. The Lamb of God\r\n\r\nThe Lamb is the Temple\r\n\r\n> 22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.\r\n\r\nThe Lamb is the Light\r\n\r\n> 23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.\r\n\r\n# Heaven\r\n\r\nText: Revelation 22:1-5\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: 4 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. 5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n> John 14:1-3&mdash;Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\r\n\r\n## What is Heaven?\r\n\r\nHeaven is a Real Place. God created it as a place of His own beauty and perfect design.\r\n\r\n> Genesis 1:1&mdash;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\r\n\r\nHeaven is not a state or condition of mind, heaven is not a myth or fairy tale, heaven is not imagination heaven is not fiction. Heaven is Real!\r\n\r\nJesus said it is is a \"**place**\" in John 14:2.\r\n\r\n- John 21:2 \"coming out of Heaven\"\r\n\r\n- Genes 28:17 Jacob\r\n- Deuteronomy 10:14 Moses\r\n\r\n## Where is Heaven?\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:1 -- HEBREW: meaning to be lofty; the sky (as aloft; the dual perhaps alluding to the visible arch in which the clouds move, as well as to the higher ether where the celestial bodies revolve\r\n\r\n> Psalm 103:11&mdash;Ps 103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.\r\n\r\nHeaven is high above the earth.\r\nJob 26:7\r\n\r\nHeaven is in the north place. Isaiah 14:13\r\n\r\nHeaven is where God is. 1 Kings 8:30, Isiah 66:1\r\n\r\n## What is Heaven Like?\r\n\r\nHeaven belongs to God. (Genesis 14:19,22)\r\n\r\nRomans 14:17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Revelation 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaiah 66:1&mdash;Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Job 3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.\r\n\r\nno wicked, no sin, weary at rest Rev. 7:16-17; 21:4; 22:3\r\n\r\n\r\nHeaven is a happy place.\r\nPsalm 16:11\r\nLuke 15:7 Joy in heaven\r\n1 Cor. 2:9\r\n\r\nHeaven is a place of rewards. Matthew 5:12\r\n\r\nHeaven is a beautiful place (notice our text).\r\n\r\n## Who Will Go to Heaven?\r\n\r\nMatthew 5:3 the poor in spirit\r\nRomans 8:17\r\nRevelation 22:14\r\n\r\nNot Everyone is Going to Heaven Matthew 7:21; John 3:3; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10\r\n\r\n1Co 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\r\n\r\nPhil. 3:21\r\n\r\n## Will We Know Anyone in Heaven?\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 13:12 (different but yes)\r\n\r\n> Heaven wouldn't be home if we didn't know anyone. &mdashJames Reynolds, Sr.\r\n\r\nHeaven is a mystery now, but not then!\r\n\r\n## How do we Get to Heaven?\r\n\r\n> Matthew 18:3&mdash;And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Matthew 19:23 hardly a rich man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> John 14:6&mdash;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\r\n\r\n## Hymn: THERE&apos;s NO DISAPPOINTMENT IN HEAVEN\r\n\r\n**Words**: Frederick M. Lehman, 1914; he wrote these words in Chicago, Illinois, while suffering financial reverses.\r\n\r\n**Music**: Frederick Lehman, harmony by his daughter Claudia L. Mays\r\n\r\n&quot;There&apos;s no disappointment in heaven,\r\n No weariness, sorrow or pain;\r\nNo hearts that are bleeding and broken,\r\n No song with a minor refrain.\r\nThe clouds of our earthly horizon\r\n Will appear in the sky,\r\nFor all will be sunshine and gladness,\r\n With never a tear nor a sigh.\r\nWe&apos;ll never pay rent for our mansion,\r\n The taxes will never come due;\r\nOur garments will never grow threadbare,\r\n But always be fadeless and new.\r\nWe&apos;ll never be hungry nor thirsty,\r\n Nor languish in poverty there,\r\nFor all the rich bounties of heaven\r\n His sanctified children will share.\r\nThere&apos;ll never be crepe on the door-knob,\r\n No funeral train in the sky;\r\nNo graves on the hillside of glory,\r\n For there we shall never more die.\r\nThe old will be young there forever,\r\n Transformed in a moment of time;\r\nImmortal we&apos;ll stand in his likeness\r\n The stars and the sun to outshine.\r\nI&apos;m bound for the beautiful city\r\n My Lord has prepared for His own;\r\nWhere all the redeemed of all ages\r\n Sing &quot;Glory&quot; around the white throne;\r\nSometimes I grow homesick for heaven,\r\n And the glories I there shall behold,\r\nWhat a joy it will be when My Savior I see,\r\n In that beautiful city of gold!&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>U. Closing [21-22]</h1>\r\n\r\n# Epilogue (22:6-21)\r\n\r\nRevelation 22:6-21 can be considered the epilogue or the last and concluding statements.\r\n\r\n## The Truthfulness of These Writings (v. 6)\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:6&mdash;And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.\r\n\r\n### Truth is Refreshing\r\n\r\nREAD: Philippians 4:8-9; \r\n\r\n### No One Ever Spoke it Like Jesus!\r\n\r\nSaid of the Lord Himself \"Never a man spake like this man.\"\r\n\r\n### This Sayings are True\r\n\r\nThree times it is repeated that the sayings of the book are true (19:9; 21:5; 22:6). \r\n\r\nThree times it is affirmed that the sayings come directly from God (1:1; 22:6; 22:16). \r\n\r\n> Romains 3:4&mdash;God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar;&hellip;\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">Either this book is nothing but forgery, or it is the most authoritative writing of all time&mdash;James R. Reynolds, Sr.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThese Are Gods Own Words (\"Faithful And True\") and we must take them, build our faith on them, and testify of them. ( 2 Peter 1:19; Matthew 7:24-27; Isaiah 43:10)\r\n\r\n## The Repetition of a Special Blessing (v. 7)\r\n\r\nThe special blessing promised to those who hear and keep the sayings of Revelation that was given in the first chapter is now repeated.\r\n\r\n> Revelation 1:3&mdash;Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:7&mdash;Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.\r\n\r\nIs there another Book that is so intense, emphatic, constant or having so much good in it to be gained and ill to be avoided?\r\n\r\n## The Effect Upon The Apostle (vs. 8-9)\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:8,9&mdash;And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.\r\n\r\n## Direct Orders Concerning This Revelation (v. 10)\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:10&mdash;And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.\r\n\r\n### \"Seal not the sayings of The Prophecy of this book.\"\r\n\r\nDan 8:26 12:4,9 Daniel was told to seal up the book. John is told not to seal the book.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning John was directed to write what he saw and heard, and to make it known to the Churches. Rev 1:11, 19 Prophetical messages to each church. Rev 2:1, 8, 12, 18, 3:1, 7, 14.\r\n\r\n### \"Seal up.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 10 he was about to write. The Seven Thunders He was to seal this up -- But the rest he was not to Seal. He was to record them. He was to make them known. He was to publish them to the Churches. These things where written both by Command and Revelation of God.\r\n\r\nSee the stress, Urgency, Importance. This Book is very important to us.\r\n\r\n## The Effects of This Revelation (v. 11)\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\r\n\r\nThere are two schools of thought here --\r\n\r\n### One -- The idea of eternal fixedness of character. When these Revelations scenes have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n### The other idea -- is the Effect of these Words -- or this Revelation.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the text has immediate reference to the context -- to the now -- sealing- writing and publishing. For a better understanding read it --\r\n\r\n<blockquote> Let the unjust one do injustice more and more and the filthy one defile more and more, and the righteous one do righteousness more and more.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nII Tim 3:13 Heb 6:7-9\r\n\r\nThe same light of the Sun breeds pestilence in the marshland. Breeds life to all. It is an ill to the ill. Good to the Good.\r\n\r\n## The Rewards To All (vs. 12-19)\r\n\r\n### All Will be Rewarded\r\n\r\n> 12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. 13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\r\n\r\nWithout exception, all will receive their just reward.\r\n\r\n### The Reward of Entering God's City\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 15 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.\r\n\r\n### Rewards of Blessing\r\n\r\n> 16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. 17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. 18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\r\n\r\n### To the wicked -\r\n\r\nDegrees of Reward -- More tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah\r\n\r\n### To the Righteous --\r\n\r\nDegrees of Reward - Not Salvation but for works.\r\n\r\nWood -- hay -- stubble Gold- Silver -- Precious Stones.\r\n\r\n## The Benediction (vs. 20-21)\r\n\r\n> Revelation 22:20,21&mdash;He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. 21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.\r\n\r\n<nav className={styles.quickNav}><a href=\"#outline\">outline</a></nav>\r\n\r\n\t</main>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
