src=\"/assets/revelation/words-rev-13-first-beast.png\" id=\"words-rev-13-first-beast\"/>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 13:1&mdash;And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>John is seeing in the Spirit a vision of \"The Beast\".</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Origin of the Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The beast will not come from any particular place or people, but will rise up out of the sea of all humanity. The <em>sea</em> has to do with nations and peoples as explained in Revelation 17:15.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 17:15&mdash;And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact the beast rose up is referencing it coming into power. The beast rising to power is enabled by the great sin and rebellion in the hearts of humanity. Blame for the great corruption in the world cannot be laid on any particular nation, but all nations have facilitated this climax of evil. Satan seizes the opportunity of man&apos;s rejection of God&apos;s will and embodies evil in treacherous leaders. God allows leadership to arise that the people deserve!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isaiah 47:10-11; Galatians 6:8; James 4:1; Zechariah 11:7-16</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Zechariah 11:16&mdash;For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did this beast come from? Man&apos;s rejection of God as KING and their TRUE SHEPHERED.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 81:11&mdash;But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Description of the Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Beast as a Whole</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Distinct from the Dragon</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<th>The Dragon</th>\r\n\t<th>The Beast of the Sea</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>Revelation 12</td>\r\n\t<td>Revelation 13</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>7 heads wear crowns</td>\r\n\t<td>10 horns are crowned</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td>spiritual empire</td>\r\n\t<td>physical empires</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h4>Controlled by the Dragon</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are likenesses between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil. The dragon is the head of a spiritual empire while the Beast is the embodiment of physical world powers. As there is one Beast with seven heads, so the system or power at work (the dragon/satan) is still one and the same though different nations or leaders rise and fall. The Beast in this vision represents the entire history of human governments and evil that has been at work in them by the devil. The Beast is a world system of rejection of God and worship of the devil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be a seventh and &apos;new&apos; kingdom of the Anti-christ that will rise as the world power, but the system that drives and the rebellion that fuels will not be anything new.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:7-8&mdash;For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. 8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Having Seven Heads</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 17:9-10&mdash;The seven heads are seven mountains &hellip; And &hellip; there are seven kings.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mountains in the scriptures can be typical of kingdoms. See: Psalms 30:7; Jeremiah 51:25; Daniel 2:25.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/assets/revelation/rev-13-7-kingdoms-2.png\" id=\"rev-13-7-kingdoms\"/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Five Are Fallen</h4>\r\n<p>In the 17th chapter we read: &quot;&hellip;Five Are Fallen&hellip;&quot;: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, and Greece.</p>\r\n<p>At this particular time John is beholding this scene, there has been five fallen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>One Is</h4>\r\n<p>\"&hellip;And One Is&hellip;\": Again, there was \"one\" in power at the time of John&apos;s vision&mdash;there is no question as to what kingdom it was. The Roman Empire was still in rule and power at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Other is not Yet Come</h4>\r\n<p>\"&hellip;And the other is not yet come&hellip;\". That is, the anti-Christ has not yet set up his kingdom. He is the seventh kingdom and he must continue a \"short space\".</p>\r\n<p>He comes on the scene during the first part of the Tribulation and then in the middle of the tribulation he is slain with the Sword and resurrected to life to be the <em>eighth which is of the seven</em>. His resurrection restores one of the seven heads of the beast and is not a new and eighth head (the beast only has seven heads).</p>\r\n<blockquote>Rev 17:11&mdash;And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Who are these Seven Kingdoms? History makes it plain who the first six are: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome. The seventh and final kingdom will be the kingdom of the anti-Christ. The beast&apos;s seven heads are seven kingdoms&mdash;seven world ruling powers. This is a full revelation of &quot;The Times of The Gentiles&quot;(Luke 21:24) from its beginning to its end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"&hellip;And Ten Horns&hellip;\"</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 7:24&mdash;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 17:12&mdash;And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<p>These are not a description of the previous kings, but are the ten ruling powers, which will rise up after the Roman Empire.</p>\r\n<img src='/assets/prophecy-and-daniel/empire-statue.png' id=\"daniel-statue\"/>\r\n<p>This is in agreement with Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream, and Daniel&apos;s vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Nebuchadnezzar</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Nebuchadnezzar saw a Great Image broken up into four sections and finally divided into ten toes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Babylon: the head</h5>\r\n<h5>Persia: the shoulders and breast</h5>\r\n<h5>Greece: the belly and thighs</h5>\r\n<h5>Rome: the thighs and legs and feet, then the ten toes; the ten horns of John&apos;s vision</h5>\r\n\r\n<h4>Daniel</h4>\r\n<p>Daniel&apos;s vision was four wild beasts: lion, a bear, a leopard and an indescribable beast.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 7:7&mdash;After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>\"And it had ten horns\"</h5>\r\n<p>We can compare these to the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream and the ten horns of John&apos;s vision.</p>\r\n<p>However, we see something in Daniels vision that is not seen in either Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream or John&apos;s vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\"There came up among them another little horn.\"</h5>\r\n<h6>John sees:</h6>\r\n<p>The beast itself being the \"Little Horn\" that comes up among the ten.</p>\r\n<h6>However Daniel sees:</h6>\r\n<p>There were three of the \"First Horns plucked up by the roots.\"</p>\r\n<p>This would indicate that Daniel saw a more advanced stage than what John declares. John saw ten horns in the 17th chapter of Revelations. This indicates that he saw them before any of them were plucked up. Furthermore at this stage they have not received their Kingdom (Rev. 17:12).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time that John was seeing that the anti-Christ \"had not yet come\" into power, was possibly just before or at, the beginning of the Tribulation. \"Which received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.\" The first part of the Tribulation hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"And Upon His Horns Ten Crowns\"</h3>\r\n<p>They have now received their crowns and John sees the time of the ten kings reigning with the anti-Christ during the first part of the Tribulation.</p>\r\n<p>For after this John sees the seventh head wounded and resurrected.</p>\r\n<p>However John makes no more mention of the ten kings, but Daniel declares that three of them fall before the anti-Christ when he is resurrected from death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Another Beast (13:11-18)</h1>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Rev. 13:11&mdash;And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>John said &quot;I beheld another beast&quot;. In the exact same sense that John saw the first beast, he sees also a second beast. Whatever reasoning is used to understand the first beast must also be applied to the second beast. Both beasts (though they are different) are <em>seen</em> by John in the same setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The secular empire that will overwhelm the world will not work alone. The extant of the first beast&apos;s success can largely be attributed to the presence and work of another beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Description of the Second Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Another</h3>\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/two-beasts-relationship.png' id='two-beasts-relationship'/>\r\n<p>This beast is addition to the first beast and rises up <strong>after</strong> the first beast. By great deception, he will advertise and promote the beast which came &quot;before him&quot; The relationship of these two beasts has often been compared to the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist. This other beast will be a prominent promoter of the Anti-christ. This second beast will be instrumental in the deception of the Anti-christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Beast</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the first, the second is a dangerous, wild and even venomous beast (empire). Standing on the shore, John saw a tremendously evil influence rise out of the earth. Despite having some characteristics of a lamb, there is no confusion here&mdash;this is an evil thing in rebellion against God and His order. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coming Out of the Earth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Though a beast (empire) it&apos;s realm is of a different nature than the first beast. Key to understanding the second beast is noticing its source. This beast&apos;s origin can be compared with the first beast&apos;s. The first rises out of the sea of humanity and through a succession of rising and falling empires, but the second comes from out of earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a crucial and vulnerable time when all humanity is an unsettled and tempestuous sea crying for answers and clarity comes from out of the &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;land&quot; (stable, settled, authoritative) something whose appearance and whose voice validates the authority of the first beast. The second beast&apos;s message is &quot;Have no fear, this is the <em>right</em> path!&quot;. Coming from a seemingly neutral and stable perspective and wielding supernatural ability, the world will conclude: &quot;It must be ok, the <em>voice of reason</em> said it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two horns like a Lamb</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Horns are representative of a ruler.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 7:24&mdash;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img src='/assets/revelation/philomena.jpg' id='philomena'/>\r\n\r\n<p>The lamb-like horns indicate something of a spiritual nature. This second beast completes the depth of the world system of evil. The Dragon empowers the first beast with a secular empire and the second beast validates and completes this empire with its own spiritual or religious empire. Here is something that appears in part <em>lamb-like</em> but has the nature of a wild and venomous beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Mt 23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Actions of the Second Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Spoke as a Dragon</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The lamb-like horns and then the voice of a dragon indicate a real change in character and in policy. For example, laws that were promoted as protections for religious liberty today could be used to accomplish the opposite! The beginning will be applauded for the sake of the &quot;greater good&quot;, but will not manifest in a utopia but in great terror. </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">Slowly our government is becoming a dictatorship instead of a free democracy - a government by the people - of the people - for the people. We are headed to a New World Order. We failed as a people to occupy till He comes. We need to be preparing ourselves to get out.&mdash;Rev. James Reynolds, Sr.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The Second Beast is actually the mouthpiece of the Dragon, so truly, the Dragon is speaking. Even now, the Dragon is already speaking. Herein is an warning to KNOW the voice of God! The only security in this age of deception is a vibrant relationship with Christ and familiarity with His voice. By knowing the TRUE you can spot the FALSE a long ways off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exercised the Power of the First Beast</h3>\r\n<blockquote>vs. 12a&mdash;And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n \r\n <p>The Greek word (poieo) for <em>exerciseth</em> is a very common word in the New Testament. It is used at least 519 times and in the book of Revelation is also translated as: <em>do, bring forth, make, cause, commit, continue, fulfil, wrought, bare</em> and <em>work</em>.</p>\r\n <p>The Greek word (exousia) for <em>power</em> means <em>mastery, strength, right</em> or <em>authority to rule</em>. To the second beast will be delegated the power of authority that belongs to the first beast. The first beast will have the both the ability and right to act as it does in the same sense a king acts sovereignly within his kingdom. The second beast will have the same ability and authority because it will be delegated to him by the first beast.</p>\r\n \r\n <blockquote>vs. 12b&mdash;&hellip;and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</blockquote>\r\n \r\n <h3>Performs Great Miracles (Sets the Hook)</h3>\r\n \r\n<p>Among other unexplainable and miraculous feats, he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. It is by the means of these miracles that he deceives those that dwell on the earth. (Galatians 1:8) This miracle power does come from God, but comes from the beast. A union or pact has been made between these beasts as we see the first beast delegating power and authority and the second beast returns loyalty and validation to the first beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Teaches a Blasphemous Gospel (Reels them in.)</h3>\r\n \r\n <p>The first beast is wounded, and then raised, and incarnated by the devil. The second beast teaches that the world should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. He tells them that the miracle of resurrection now proves beyond all doubt that this is not just a good leader, but this beast is a god to be worshipped!</p>\r\n \r\n <h3>Murders in the Name of God</h3>\r\n \r\n<p>And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>\r\n \r\n <h3>Mark &amp; Number of Apostasy</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 13:16,17&mdash;And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mark Of The Beast will be instituted by the false prophet.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>By Deception (a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing), vs. 11,14</li>\r\n\t<li>By Miracles, vs. 12-13 (&quot;must be God!&quot;)</li>\r\n\t<li>By Coercion, vs. 15 (&quot;Do or Die&quot;)</li>\r\n\t<li>Design of the Mark, vs. 16 (&quot:causeth all&hellip;to receive a mark&quot;)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
