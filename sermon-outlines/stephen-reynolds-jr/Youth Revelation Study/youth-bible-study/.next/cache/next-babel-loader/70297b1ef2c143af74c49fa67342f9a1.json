Who is Worthy to Open Book of Seven Seals? [5]</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n{/*<!-- chapter 5 fix numberings-->*/}\r\n\r\n<h1>The Sealed Book, vs. 1-4</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>This chapter continues the description of the vision in chapter four. The scene is still the throne, the Elders, the Living creatures.</p>\r\n\t<p>This prophecy is in connection with the Church, but not of the Church. Also, this prophecy has its description given in Heaven, but its fulfillment on the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Position of the Book</h2>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"In the right hand\"</h3>\r\n<p>The place of power.</p>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"Of Him that sat on the throne.\"</h3>\r\n<p>The place of rule of authority.</p>\r\n<h2>The Characteristics of the Book</h2>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"A book written within\"</h3>\r\n<p>A scroll - about judgment</p>\r\n<p>The book contained a revelation and demonstration of things to come at the consummation of this present age after the Rapture of the Church.</p>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"On the backside, sealed with seven seals\"</h3>\r\n<p>Reserved judgment. This is not a familiar judgment seen. This is an exceptional administration of justice never before witnessed.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Reserved unto the Day of Judgment</blockquote>\r\n<h2>The Dignity of the Book</h2>\r\n<h3>The question by the angel</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 2 \"Who is worthy to open the book\"</blockquote>\r\n<h3>The answer to the question</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 3 \"No man in heaven, or in earth, neither under the earth,was able to open the book, neither to look therein.\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>Notice also that this \"strong\" angel is not able to open the book either. (powerful, forceful, boisterious, mighty)</p>\r\n<h3>John's reaction to this fact</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 4 \"And I wept much\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>Because of three things -</p>\r\n<h4>None found \"worthy\" to \"open the book\"</h4>\r\n<h4>None found worthy to \"read the book\"</h4>\r\n<h4>None found worthy to \"look thereon\"</h4>\r\n<h2>The Time of the Opening of the Book</h2>\r\n<p>After the Rapture, 4:1</p>\r\n<h2>The Purpose of the Opening of the Book</h2>\r\n<p>To release the judgments of God on the earth</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Nature of the Victor, vs. 5-7</h1>\r\n<p>The Book's Opener is presented as a Victor!</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelaton 5:5 - And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</blockquote>\r\n<h3>A lion</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 5 \"Lion of the tribe of Judah\"</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The Root of David\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>Being of the Root of David, his prowess is of no coincidence. It is by PROMISE and therefore Divine appointment.</p>\r\n <blockquote>Revelation 22:16 - I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</blockquote>\r\n<p>He is both ROOT and OFFSPRING of David! By nature, Jesus is the ROOT of David and by divine incarnation he is the offspring of David. David, the greatly revered and legendary king of Israel, received his authority from this same Jesus!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A lamb</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 6 \"Stood a lamb\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>A lion in power, but a lamb in nature. Notice:</p>\r\n<h4>He is standing</h4>\r\n<p>Because He is not dead, but alive.</p>\r\n<p>Because He is accepted.</p>\r\n<p>Because of us, on our behalf.</p>\r\n<h4>He is a sacrificial lamb</h4>\r\n<blockquote>v. 6 \"A lamb as it had been slain\"</blockquote>\r\n<h4>His has perfect power and strength</h4>\r\n<blockquote>v. 6 \"Having seven horns\"</blockquote>\r\n<h4>He has perfect and universal intelligence</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\"And seven eyes\"</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Which are the seven spirits of God\"</blockquote>\r\n<h4>He has unlimited rights v. 7</h4>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Response to The Victor's Worthiness, vs. 8-14</h1>\r\n<h2>Of the Four Beasts and of the Twenty-four Elders v. 8</h2>\r\n<h3>Fell down before the Lamb</h3>\r\n<h3>Having every one of them harps</h3>\r\n<h3>And golden vials - stored up prayers</h3>\r\n<h3>Sing a new song</h3>\r\n<h2>What Their Song Is About</h2>\r\n<h3>Worthy by right of being</h3>\r\n<p>He is Lord - Jehovah God</p>\r\n<h3>Worthy by right of character</h3>\r\n<blockquote>I Peter 1:19 A lamb without spot or blemish</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Worthy by right of obedience</h3>\r\n<p>He earned the right</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred\" etc.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Luke 23:41 - And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Of the Angels vv. 11,12</h2>\r\n<h2>Of All Creation v. 13</h2>\r\n\r\n{/*<!-- chapter 5 end -->*/}\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"F\">F. The 7 Seals [6; 8:1]</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>Introduction to the Seven Seals</h1>\r\n<p>This scene of the breaking of the Seven Seals follows after the translation of the Bride, for the elders already have their crowns, (Rev. 4:10). Also this scene comes after the Rapture of the Church. We read of the rapture in type in Rev. 4:1. The Four Beasts or Four Living Creatures which represent \"the Body of Christ\" or the Church are at the Throne, also.</p>\r\n<h2>The Similarities of the First Four Seals</h2>\r\n<h3>The Opener of the Seals. \"The Lamb\" vs. 1</h3>\r\n<p>In Chapter 5, it was dramatically shown that only the Lamb had the power to take the Book and the power and authority to open the book.</p>\r\n<h3>The Seals Opened</h3>\r\n<h4>John saw something vs. 1.</h4>\r\n<p>John saw something before the thunder. Like a flash of lightening before the storm.</p>\r\n<h4>He heard something.</h4>\r\n<p>He heard - \"As it were the noise of thunder\".</p>\r\n<h3>The Command Given. \"Come\"</h3>\r\n<h4>The Command is Not to John. He is there in the Throne.</h4>\r\n<h4>The Command is A call into Action. A release of Judgment.</h4>\r\n<h4>The Command is Repeated. In regard to the first four seals.</h4>\r\n<h3>The Source of the Command.</h3>\r\n<p>\"One of the Four Beasts\". The Elders are involved with things concerning heavenly subjects (ch. 5 &amp; 7) and The living Creatures are directly involved with things that are Earthly.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:2 -- Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Particulars of the Seven Seals</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Number Seven</h3>\r\n<p>There are Seven Seals in Number. This is indicative of the COMPLETENESS of this administration.</p>\r\n<p>The Seals are arranged in two distinct groups - first there are four and then there are three. A Worldly number that is followed by the heavenly number. These Seven Seals are a Divine judgment on a wicked world</p>\r\n<h3>The First Four Seals are Distinguished by Horses and Horsemen.</h3>\r\n<p>Horses are symbolic pictures of the Power of the Almighty.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Kings 6:17 -- And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. [Job 39:19-25; Zech. 1:8-10; Zech. 6:2-5]</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Four Spirits of the heavens from Zechariah 6:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Zechariach 6:1-8 -- And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Opening of Seals 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Opening of the First Seal 6:1-2</h2>\r\n<h3>The Releasing of Divine Judgment \"A white horse\"</h3>\r\n<p>\"White\" Righteousness</p>\r\n<p>\"Horse\" Divine Power.A righteous judgment of God on the Earth.</p>\r\n<h3>The Commission of The Rider</h3>\r\n<p>\"He that sat on him had a bow. \"The \"bow\" is an instrument of war.Not of a destructive war-but of a moral war.Psa. 64:7-9; Hab. 3:8-9; Isa. 26:9.</p>\r\n<p>\" And a crown was given un to him\" \"And he went forth conquering, and to conquer. \"Psa. 110:3; Isa. 26:9; Dan 12:8-10; Joe12:28-32.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Opening of The Second Seal 6:3-4</h2>\r\n<h3>The Releasing of Divine Vengeance \"A Red Horse\"</h3>\r\n<p>\"Red\" the color of blood.Wars and Blood shed.</p>\r\n<p>\"Horse\" Divine Power.The wrath of God on the Earth.</p>\r\n<h3>The Commission to the Rider.</h3>\r\n<p>\"Power was given to him.. .to take peace from the earth\" II Chron. 15: 3,5 A type.\"They shall kill one another\"</p>\r\n<p>\"There was given unto him a great sword.\" \"Rhomphaia \" \"Megas\" -Sword &mdash;Large</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Opening of The Third Seal. 6:5-6</h2>\r\n<h3>The Commission of The Third Rider. vs. 5-6</h3>\r\n<h4>A Black Horse -</h4>\r\n<p>Black is the symbolic color of dearth and famine.\r\nJer. 14:1-2; Lam.4:8-10 5:10.\r\nNotice verse nine &mdash;\r\nFamines are the scenes of violence and tragedy.\r\nII Kings 6:25-29; Luke 21:23; Matt. 24:19.</p>\r\n<h4>\"A Pair of Balances in His Hand.\"</h4>\r\n<p>Balances are used for exact weighing Indicating that there is a scarcity of food. vs.6Bread by weight always implies scarcity.

Davis Dictionary of the Bible. A measure or quart of wheat would be the ordinary allowance of wheat to a man for one day's scanty subsistence.</p>\r\n<p>The Usual Price.The usual price of a \"choenix\" of wheat was one-eighth of a \"penny\" , or denarius.

Probably the Roman Denarias a coin worth about 17 cents. This was the amount a soldier received for a days pay.

There is no expression from the Living ones. There are no 'horsemen or horses. And the burden of the description is exhibited in the results rather than in the processes. Yet, everything belongs to the same general category of trial and suffering. Under this fifth seal, we have added, bloody persecution of those who hold and testify to the truth. The good as well as the bad suffer the hour of trial. Hence, this fifth seal is the picture of Persecution and Martyrdom.</p>\r\n<p>There are no voices of command from Heaven under this seal, and no messengers despatched from the throne; the reason, bloody persecutions of God's servants come from beneath -not from above. It is the devil who is the murderer. It is Dragon that makes war with the saints. These are martyrs of this particular period of time. Martyrs of the Judgment.</p>\r\n<h3>The Cause of Their Martyrdom. vs. 9</h3>\r\n<p>It is not death, but the cause of death, which constitutes a martyr. Millions upon millions perish under the preceding seals, but they are not called marytrs. The cause for which these were slain makes them martyrs.</p>\r\n<h4>\"Slain for the Word of God\"</h4>\r\n<p>What they may have rejected in the past, now hold to be the very Word of God .</p>\r\n<h4>\"And for the testimony which they held. \"</h4>\r\n<p>(Steadfast adherence to the faith) Probably the testimony of all that was happening. Plagues, disorders, and horrors around them. It will be more than the hardened hearts of scorning unbelievers can bear.</p>\r\n<h3>Their Estate at That Time vs.9</h3>\r\n<h4>They are \"Soul s\" Their slaying is not the end.</h4>\r\n<h4>They can be seen. \"Saw\" Invisible to men in the flesh, seen in the spirit.</h4>\r\n<h4>They can speak. vs. 10 \"They cried with a loud voice.\"</h4>\r\n<p>It is wrong to say the dead is in a state of non-existence, unconsciousness, or oblivion.

Dan means a judge. These 144,000 are not judges, and never become judges. Ephraim -double fruitfulness, or increase, or growth by multiplication. These are a fixed number 144,000. These are Israelites, living in the period of the judgment, who confess and look to Christ as their Messiah.</p>\r\n<h2>The Time of Their Sealing</h2>\r\n<h3>It takes place on earth.</h3>\r\n<h3>After the opening of the Sixth Seal Chpt. 7:1</h3>\r\n<h3>Before the opening of the Seventh Seal vs. 3</h3>\r\n<h2>The Nature of Their Sealing</h2>\r\n<h3>It is a mark Of some sort.

The question of the Elder is what we want to deal with first. vs. 9 &quot;Who are they? and whence came they?&quot;\r\nSome believe they are the early Christians victorious over the sorrows and persecutions. Some believe they are the Christians under Constantine. To decide who they are look at:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who They Are Not</h2>\r\n<h4>They are not the highest class of the redeemed.</h4>\r\n<p>The Elders &quot;Sit&quot; &ndash;these &quot;Stand&quot; vs. 9 &quot;Stood before the Throne&quot;. The Elders have Crowns and Thrones &ndash; These have neither. The Elders appear in their places &ndash; And have received their reward before judgment. These came to the throne after judgment has started. The Elders were &quot;counted worthy to escape all these things&quot; [Luke 21:36]. These were in the Judgment. &quot;Out of the great tribulation. &quot; vs. 14</p>\r\n<h4>They are not the Church</h4>\r\n<p>The Four Living creatures make up the Church. The Rapture of the Church takes place before the Great Tribulation. These are taken out of the Great Tribulation.</p>\r\n<h4>They are not the sealed ones &ndash;</h4>\r\n<p>The sealed ones were a definite number. These are uncounted and numberless. vs.9 The sealed ones were of Israel. &quot;These are out of every nation, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who They Are</h2>\r\n<h3>They are redeemed people.</h3>\r\n<p>They were once sinners.

Five were wise and five were foolish. The five foolish were left outside the marriage door.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 25:11-13 &mdash; Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no crowns or thrones, but only palms. They did not hear the gentle voice of the Spirit, and therefore were not rewarded in the same way those that overcame and escaped the great tribulation. But they did learn their lesson through great trial and are given great promises of blessing.</p> \r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 26:9,10 &mdash;&hellip;for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Some will learn righteousness, but not all will turn to God even in such terrible judgment.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 12:10 &mdash;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Their Eternal State</h2>\r\n<h3>They are in heaven.

In response to the breaking of the seal there is silence. This silence appears to be a &quot;calm before the storm&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This silence takes place &quot;In Heaven&quot; and lasts for half an hour (&quot;Hemioron&quot; &quot;Hemi&quot;: Half plus &quot;Hora&quot;: Hour).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Meaning of the Silence</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This seal and the resulting silence are quite mysterious. We can consider the definitions of the words used, but any other suggestings to their meaning is speculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Revelation 8:1, \"Silence\" (siqe) means hush, voluntary stillness or refusal to speak. It is a silence of intense interest and awful expectancy with reference to the results of the breaking of the seventh seal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the following section of Revelation makes several strong allusions to the different parts of temple worship. For example:</p>\r\n\t<ul class='bullets'>\r\n\t\t<li>Altar and incense in 8:3.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Four horns of the altar in 9:13.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Temple of God in 11:1.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n<p>Adam Clarke makes a comparison of this silence and the prayerful silence of the people who waited while the priest went in to burn incense in the holy place.\r\n </p>\r\n \r\n <blockquote>Luke 1:10 -- And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
