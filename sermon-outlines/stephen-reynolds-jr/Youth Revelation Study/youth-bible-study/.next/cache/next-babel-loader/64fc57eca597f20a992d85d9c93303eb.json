Not only does this message involve the present judgment that will come on the world in the midst of the seven years, but this message also relates to Christ&apos;s coming and judging of the world.</p>\r\n<h3>The Truth Unbound</h3>\r\n<p>Revelation chapter 14 takes place in the middle of the seven years of God&apos;s dealing with the nation of Israel. During the last phase of the judgment of God, the anti-christ will be in rule and will have destroyed or bound all apparent means of the Gospel being proclaimed. However, God has commissioned His angels to speak at this time!</p>\r\n<p>Upon Christ&apos;s entry into Jerusalem, fault was found with the loud proclaimations of praise given Christ as the Messiah and King. Christ answered:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Luke 19:40&mdash;And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</blockquote>\r\n<p>The truth of God and His claims must be spoken. If men are brought to silence, other things must become vocal to testify for Jehovah. In a time when the anti-christ has successfully burried away in caves, mountains and the wilderness all human testimony for God, the heavens speak and the angels whom the anti-christ cannot touch become preachers in the darkest hour of judgment.</p>\r\n<p>This is in keeping with order of things already gone by. The angels testified just before Christ&apos;s first coming and they will again just before His second coming. The angels will testify and preach to all those that dwell on the earth.</p>\r\n<p>Their pulpit will be mid-air and all nations, tribes, tongues and peoples are their audience. Hell may slay, imprison and silence every human witness for God, but it cannot bind the truth! God's Word cannot be bound. It must be heard.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Timothy 2:9&mdash;Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>1 Peter 1:23&mdash;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>First Message &ndash; &quot;The Everlasting Gospel&quot; (vs. 6-7)</h2>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:6,7&mdash;And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</blockquote>\r\n<p>We find in verses 6 and 7 all the elements necessary for the preaching of the Gospel: God inspiring a preacher, a pulpit, a message, an audience and a delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Nature of the Messenger</h3>\r\n<p>This is definitely an angel (a Heavenly messenger) that is proclaiming the message John hears. The fact that an angel is preaching reveals that the present dispensation is now undergoing a change and is ready to pass away while another is beginning to take its place.</p>\r\n<p>Of old, angels were employed for the giving of the law, the heralding of Christ's coming and in the judgment time they are conspicuously everywhere taking part in the Divine administrations with regard to our world. But, in the dispensation under which we now are, the charge of preaching and witnessing for God and the declaring of His Word is the ministry of the Church. The preaching of the Gospel is in the hands of men.</p>\r\n<p>It is now the duty of the Church to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all who will believe. Angels are ministers to the heirs of salvation, but not the preachers of the Gospel of Christ to a world lost in sin. The disciples (Acts 5:19), Philip (Acts 8:26), Cornelius (Acts 10:3), and Paul at sea (Acts 27:3) all benefited from the ministry of angels which enabled them to fulfill their own responsibility in preaching of the Word of God. It is not presently the duty of angels to proclaim the Word of Truth, but is the Believer's present duty and privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Position of his Pulpit</h3>\r\n<p>The Angel's pulpit is positioned in the midst of heaven. In Hebrew are three words to describe three levels of &quot;heaven&quot; 1) Shameh means sky 2) Shachaq means firmament and 3) Galgal means heaven as in the place of God's throne. The Angel's pulpit is in the midst of the sky (See Strong's GREEK#3321 <em>mesouranema</em>). Men will hear the voice, but will not be able to silence it. They will try to block their ears and yet will still hear!</p>\r\n<p>This pulpit is also positioned in a time of judgment. The time and season makes the message all that more vital and its delivery so monumentally grave&mdash;hear ye him (Matthew 17:5).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Content of the Message</h3>\r\n<p>The manner of its delivery will change, but there will be no change in the message. These angels have the everlasting Gospel to preach. It is the same Gospel the Apostles preached and not another beause there is no other Gospel.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Gospel is good news.</li>\r\n<li>The Gospel is power. (Romans 1:16)</li>\r\n<li>The Gospel is a warning or forerunner of judgment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Paul warned the church already about anyone would preach another gospel.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 1:8&mdash;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Notice his message: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fear God: to be in awe and reverence.</li>\r\n<li>Give glory to Him: Worship God in Spirit and in Truth (John 4:24) as well as in the beauty of holiness (Psalm 29:2).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 29:2&mdash;Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. </blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For the hour of His judgment is come</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Bible has much to say about judgment. Enoch (Jude 14-15), David (Psalm 1:5), Isaiah (30:18), Jeremiah (4:2), Ezekiel, Daniel (7:10), John the Baptist (Matthew 3:12), Jesus (Matthew 25:31-32), Paul (2 Thessalonians 1:7-8), Peter (II Peter 2:9) and John the Beloved (1 John 4:17) all preached judgment.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Him that Made it All</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We have neglected Him He matters most and truly Him alone who matters! While we gazed into His Heavens, drank of His waters and profited by His earth we failed to honor Him as God. Repent!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Auditors of the Message</h3>\r\n<p>It would seem a strange thing to believe that every nation, kindred, tongue and people hear the angel in the same language and understand what he says. It would take a long time for this angel to go to every nation and kindred upon the face of the earth and speak in each tongue and dialect. However this sermon is presented in a short period of time. The same God that confounded the language of man at Babel will cause them to understand His messengers!</p>\r\n<p>Many testimonies of this particular miraculous power of God have been shared. To remember one account here, we don't have to look that far into history. Oral Roberts while he was preaching in India experienced God work this same miracle. While he preached in English, the people heard in their native languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Delivery of the Message</h3>\r\n<p>Though it is the same Gospel being proclaimed&hellip;</p>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:7&mdash;Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</blockquote>\r\n<p>&hellip; yet its manner of delivery has changed. It is no longer the meek and entreating voice beseeching men to be reconciled to God, but a great thundering form the sky demanding of the nations to fear God. The reason given for the change in delivery is the fact:</p>\r\n<blockquote>&hellip;the hour of His judgment is come&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<p>The church-period has given place to the judgment hour. When this is understood, the whole matter clears up. Mercy towards the poor infatuated world still lingers in the very hour of wrath. In the heat and height of His indignation, God still remembers mercy. </p>\r\n<blockquote>Habakkuk 3:2&mdash;O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</blockquote>\r\n<p>And, when there is no human voice left to speak it, an angel from heaven will speak mid-air proclaiming to the guilty world to turn to God. </p>\r\n<p>This is one of the very last calls of grace to an apostate world. The finality of the coming herald and the limited amount of time in which the people of God have to work, ought to spur us to redeem the time and preach the Everlasting Gospel!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Babylon is Fallen (Revelation 14:8)</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:8&mdash;And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</blockquote>\r\n<p>With the hour of judgment comes the work of judgment. The messengers of God are busy declaring the mind of God. The same cry is made both in chapter 14 and chapter 18.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 14:8&mdash;&hellip;Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:2,3&mdash;&hellip;Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, &hellip; 3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This cry is declaring something in the future and yet the sense of the declaration is given as though it is already past. When God says it, future judgment is no less definite than history. Because He is sovereign, God calls things that aren't as though they were. The utter destruction of Babylon is certain.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Babylon is Destroyed</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Emphasis Should be on the Reason for her Destruction</h3>\r\n<p>Believers can and do differ over what Babylon literally is, but it is important to unite in emphasizing what the Scripture does say about it. &quot;Babylon&quot; will be destroyed because of her false teaching and murder of the saints.</p>\r\n<p>The name Babylon is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Babel. Throughout the Bible, Babylon is a symbol of the confusion caused by godlessness. </p>\r\n<p>The unveiling of the real enemy is found in what Babylon DOES and SAYS and not an inherent evil because of where it can be found on a map or because of historical sentiment towards it. The City of Rome or even the area near Baghdad, Iraq are only in danger of God's Wrath for the same reasons any people or nation will suffer judgment&mdash;if they set themselves as the enemies of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Reason</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Babylon is destroyed because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. All who drank of her wine are guilty of spiritual adultery or idolatry.</p>\r\n<p>What is the wine that she made all nations to drink? False doctrines. As harlots would utilize love potions and intoxicating drinks so the City of Babylon has used and will use false doctrine to entrap.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:10-12&mdash;And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>An Illustration from history: In November 1978, 909 people drank cyanide-laced grape-flavored Flavor Aid at the instruction of religious leader and community organizer Jim Jones. Jim Jones attracted a large following to his Peoples Temple through sermons on tolerance, social responsibility and community. As the church grew, however, the sermons on equality and tolerance were replaced by demands for personal loyalty and obedience. (In 1973, Jones had been arrested for soliciting a man for sex&mdash;homosexuality.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proverbs 23:32 is speaking of drunkenness and wine, but is appropriate as well for the devil's tactics of false doctrine:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Proverbs 23:32&mdash;At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Babylon is Destroyed</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Babylon is fallen</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Place and Its Religious System</h3>\r\n<p>There are some that make a great difference between the Mystery Babylon in Chapter 17 and the City of Babylon in Chapters 14 and 18, but both &quot;Babylons&quot; are two parts of the same thing: 1) a place 2) a system. The emphasis is put on the system in the 17th chapter and in 14:8 and the 18th Chapter the emphasis is on the city itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Literally, the City of Babylon</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Not Just Rome</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Babylon, who is the Mother of Harlots (17:5) and the Habitation of Devils (18:2) is fallen. As Rome, Italy (or more specifically Vatican City) has been instrumental in both Christian martyrdom and the spread of false doctrine, this prophecy concerning the fall of the City of Babylon is generally believed to be a prediction concerning the city of Rome, Italy. This interpretation is seemingly influenced by the long standing prejudice of the Protestant church historically at war with the Roman Catholic church. </p>\r\n<p>The passage does not say Rome, but it does say Babylon. To be consistent in our method of interpretation of the this great Book, we will interpret Babylon literally as the city originally built by Nimrod in the land of Shinar and rising and falling throughout history, but being utterly destroyed in the Day of God's Wrath. Truly, Babylon is the birth place of the false doctrine woven throughout Roman Catholicism and not the other way around (i.e., Mother-Infant worship).</p>\r\n<p>The Roman Catholic church is not the only religious system guilty of spiritual adultery. God would not be justified in sparing one and punishing another unrepentant group for the identical criminal act. Babylon is not just Rome. It is bigger than that. It is an apostate religious world.</p>\r\n<h4>Not Utterly Destroyed, Yet</h4>\r\n<p>The City of Babylon was situated in the Land of Shinar on the Euphrates River, about 50 miles south of modern Baghdad, Iraq. Although Babylon was effectively eliminated as an empire when it was taken by the Medes and Persians after the 70 year Jewish exile, all prophecies concerning it have not yet been entirely fulfilled. </p>\r\n<p>The conquering empire of Persia did not destroy Babylon, but instead made it a royal city. Babylon appears importantly in history 500 years after Christ, for it was at Babylon that Jewish Academics compiled the Talmud (the basis of all codes of Jewish Law). Also Modern Day Bahgdad, Iraq stands near the original location of Babylon.</p>\r\n<p>Isaiah 13:6,19-22; Jeremiah 50:40; 51:64 and Revelation 14:8; 17; 18 give an image of an extreme and absolute destruction not yet seen. Much of this has been fulfilled, but not all will be fulfilled until the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 13:6).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Isaiah 13:19,20&mdash;And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</p>\r\n<p>Jeremiah 51:64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Rebuilding Babylon</h4>\r\n<p>Babylon will fall, but first it must be rebuilt. Before her utter destruction that will take place in the Day of the Lord's Wrath, the city of Babylon will first become instrumental in centralizing apostasy. What the Vatican is for just 1.2 Billion Roman Catholics, Babylon will arise for the greatest apostate ecumenical group the world has ever seen. Read Zechariah 5:5-11.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Zechariah 5:10,11&mdash; Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 11 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Babylon is Destroyed</h2>\r\n<h3>Babylon is destroyed by fire</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:18&mdash;And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!</p>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:21&mdash; And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Isaiah 13:19-20; Jeremiah 50:40.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Babylon is Destroyed Quickly</h3>\r\n<p>Revelation 18:10&mdash;&hellip;in one hour is thy judgment come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Rewards of Allegiance (Revelation 14:9-13)</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Introduction &mdash; Loyal to the Cause</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Allegiance speaks of loyalty or commitment to a group or cause. It reminds us of fidelity which is faithfulness to a person, cause, or belief, demonstrated by continuing loyalty and support. Often allegiance is spoken of in the context of citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ILLUSTRATION: The American &lsquo;Pledge of Allegiance&rsquo; was originally written for children for a one time use in 1892. The verse intended to commemorate Columbus Day originally read:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which is stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, it has undergone two changes. The National Flag Conference of the American Legion replaced \"my Flag\" with &lsquo;the Flag of the United States of America.&rsquo; in 1923. Secondly, in 1954 President Eisenhower signed a bill that added the words \"Under God.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, as humanity&apos;s allegiance to God is failing, it is strongly argued by many to remove the words \"Under God\" from the American Pledge. Whether or not these voices are successful, the testimony of \"The Pledge of Allegiance\" has been to date to strengthen, clear up and better our commitment. The line of demarcation between saint and sinner will become more and more pronounced as the end of all things approaches. The intensity of the day of God&apos;s wrath will solidify the allegiances of men. The wicked will do more wickedly, but some will sure up their allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ and even seal their testimony with their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Joshua 24:15&mdash;And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>God's cause is Redemption and Restoration of all things lost through sin. The devil's cause is to destroy through sin.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 John 3:8&mdash;He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as sure as you can back a loser and lose all your investment, so our spiritual allegiance comes with a certain reward or consequence. There is no fence in this contest for the hearts and souls of men. The athlete on the bench can celebrate because he was on the winning side, and even if a benched player on the losing side never saw a second of game-time, he, just like his other team mates, lost. Our allegiance marries us to the destiny of our cause. The devil's is a lost cause and Christ is always the victor! In practice, where does my allegiance lie? Whose cause do I faithfully promote? The end of THAT cause, will be my end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Allegiance to the Beast(vs. 9-11)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Judgment on the followers of the Antichrist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Reason for their Judgment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would anyone worship the devil? In the two reasons given for their judgment, we also see the reasons for their allegiance. There are two groups who hold allegiance to the Beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>They that Worshipped the Beast and his Image</h4>\r\n<p>There are those that give evidence of their fidelity to this system by worship. They honor and give service to the Beast because they are his \"true believers\". These are loyal to the Beast's cause because they believe in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>They that Received his Mark (forehead or hand)</h4>\r\n<p>Not all who make up the masses in allegiance to the Beast are so because they are sold on his ideology. Many join themselves to the enemies of God without any formal or declared intention of hostility toward God. Many will conform out of necessity. Many will surrender to the Beast's influence because without his mark on their hand or forehead they cannot survive in society (Revelation 13:17).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter the individual's reasons for aiding the devil in their life and in the world, they have chosen to side against Christ. If we are not with Christ doing what He wants, we are against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 12:30&mdash;He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>The Content of their Judgment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Wine of the Wrath of God.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:10&mdash;&hellip;wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His indignation&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This judgment promised is an undiluted (\"without mixture\") concentration of punishment from God Almighty poured into the cup of God's anger. The offenders are then made to drink of that cup to the full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As wine is an intoxicating and overwhelming drink so it is used in Scripture to symbolize these effects (Psalm 60:3). There is the Wine of the Spirit which is an abundant joy in Holy Ghost, but there is also the Wine of Wrath or Violence which parallels the poisoned cup of certain criminals who were obliged to drink and which caused a speedy death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These will drink of the cup of God's indignation because they chose to drink of the cup of iniquity and spiritual fornication (Revelation 14:8). We are all born in sin and condemned to drink of God's wrath, but Christ died and drank that bitter cup so we would not have to (Luke 22:42).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 2:9&mdash;But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Fire and Brimstone</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Tormented (torture, pain) with fire and brimstone (sulphur) as Sodom and Gomorrah and the rich man in hell (Luke 16:23).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Two Phases of their Judgment</h4>\r\n<h5>In the Presence of the Holy Angels and of the Lamb. </h5>\r\n<p>Presence, face, in sight of, before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>In the Lake of Fire</h5>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 20:10&mdash;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Duration of their Judgment</h4>\r\n<h3>The Smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever</h3>\r\n<h3>They have no rest day nor night</h3>\r\n<p>Matthew 25:46; Mark 3:29; 2 Thessalonians 1:9</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Allegiance to the True Christ (vs. 12-13)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the day of God's Wrath not all will be found in confederacy with devil. They will not conform to the Beast's system for any reason at all. These are tribulation saints.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Saint's Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>They Are Patient</h4>\r\n<p>2 Thessalonians 1:4; Hebrews 6:15; James 5:11; Revelation 1:9</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>They Keep His Commandments</h4>\r\n<p>They not all profess allegiance, but their loyalty is evidenced by their obedience (John 14:15).</p>\r\n<h4>They Have the Faith of Jesus</h4>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Saint's Blessedness</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:13b&mdash;&hellip;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours;&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Saint's Rewards</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:13c&mdash;&hellip;and their works do follow them.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Wood, hay and stubble versus gold, silver and precious stone. Their reward is based on their motive and their faithfulness in that allegiance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When missionary George Atley was killed by a band of hostile tribesmen, he was carrying a fully loaded, 10-chamber Winchester rifle. He had to choose whether to defend himself or or with his life defend the fragile mission work in that foreign land. When his body was later found in a stream, Nearby lay his rifle:all 10 chambers still loaded. He had made the supreme sacrifice, motivated by his burden for lost souls and his unswerving devotion to his Savior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing on Philippians 1:20 in The Bible Knowledge Commentary, Robert P. Lightner said,:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">Paul's concern was not what would happen to him but what testimony would be left for his Lord. Release would allow him to continue preaching Christ. But martyrdom would also advance the cause of Christ.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Philippians 1:20&mdash;According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h1>Reaping and Pressing (Revelation 14:14-20)</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Foundation for the Biblical Harvests</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Deuteronomy lists the major crops of the land of promise:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Deuteronomy 8:8&mdash;A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Three Harvest Seasons</h3>\r\n<img id=\"harvest-seasons-israel\" src=\"/assets/revelation/harvest-seasons-in-israel.gif\" />\r\n\r\n<p>In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest. Let us highlight the two of the three major crops because they relate directly to our text in Revelation 14.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Grain Harvest (Spring)</h4>\r\n<p>Barley and wheat were the most important crops of the spring harvest. Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Pentecost was celebrated near the end of the grain harvest with grain and loaf offerings (Leviticus 23:16-17). Newly harvested grain could not eaten until the offering of the firstfruits to God was first made. Pentecost was also called the &quot;The Feast of Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Feast of Weeks&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Exodus 23:16&mdash;And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Grape Harvest (Summer)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>After Pentecost, most of the harvest was fruit: grapes, olives, dates, figs, pomegranates and numerous fruits, seeds and vegetables of lesser importance. Grapes were the first major crop to ripen. In a good year, when the grain yield was great, threshing and grape picking overlapped. The grape harvest was usually completed before the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two Festival Seasons: Spring Feasts and Fall Feasts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The three harvesting seasons were celebrated by two major festival seasons. The Spring Feasts of Passover, Firstfruits, Unleavened Bread, and Pentecost teach of the beginning of Christ's ministry and the Fall Feasts of Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacles represent the completion of His ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider these feasts in sequence:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Spring Feasts (May/June)</h4>\r\n<h5>Passover&mdash;God passed over the Israelites when he killed the Egyptian firstborn.</h5>\r\n<h5>First Fruits&mdash;The first fruits are the first to come and are specially dedicated to God as a reminder that all good things come from God. It also was a pledge of a greater harvest to follow.</h5>\r\n<h5>Unleavened Bread&mdash;A Memorial of Israel&apos;s hasty exodus from Egypt.</h5>\r\n<h5>Pentecost&mdash;Pentecost (Shavuot) was originally a festival for expressing thankfulness to the Lord for the blessing of the harvest. </h5>\r\n\r\n<h4>Fall Feasts (September-October)</h4>\r\n<p>These feasts, which became known as \"The High Holy Days\", celebrated in the 7th month marked the conclusion of the religious year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Trumpets (1st day of 7th month)&mdash;The feast that called people to prepare to stand before the judgment of God. Instead of celebratory it was spent in private and grave introspection&mdash;fasting and prayer.</h5>\r\n<h5>Atonement (10th day of 7th month)&mdash;The importance of the Day of Atonement is revealed by the fact that in the Talmud the name was shortened to simply \"The Day.\" Celebrates God's Creation and God's new creation through atonement. A new beginning celebrated having been cleansed from sin. Day of Atonment represented the conclusion of the judgment that began ten days earlier.</h5>\r\n<h5>Tabernacles (15th day of 7th month)&mdash;The Feast of Tabernacles, also known as the Feast of Booths and Sukkot, is the seventh and last feast that the Lord commanded Israel to observe. God delivered Israel out of the land of Egypt and they were to live in a temporary tabernacle for eight days and look forward to the coming Messiah.</h5>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Luke 12:37&mdash;Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching:&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reaping of the Harvest (vs. 14-16)</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:15&mdash;And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>&hellip;Thrust in Thy Sickle&hellip;</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</blockquote>\r\n<img id=\"christ-crown-cloud-sickle\" src=\"/assets/revelation/christ-crown-cloud-sickle.png\" />\r\n<p>Execute the judgments which God has decreed. It is time for the judgment&mdash;no more delay or waiting. God has waited, but no more! The Lord coming in a white cloud speaks both of righteousness and judgment. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>White/Righteousness (Matthew 17:2; Revelation 3:5,18; 4:14; 7:9; 19:8). </li>\r\n<li>Cloud/Judgment (Matthew 17:5; Luke 21:27; Revelation 1:7).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 1:7&mdash;Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of <u>the earth shall wail because of him</u>. Even so, Amen.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting on the cloud, He is in a position of rulership. Christ is seen here ruling in judgment. It is Christ for John says \"like unto the Son of Man\" (Revelation 1:13).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On His Head is a Golden Crown (His church in glory and already awarded; I Cor. 6:1-3; Rev. 4:4; II Timothy 4:8) and in His hand is a sharp sickle. The sickle is a hooked knife and harvesting instrument used to pluck, gather, or cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&hellip;For the Harvest of the Earth is Ripe&hellip;</h3>\r\n<p>The cup of iniquity is full. Their sins are ripe or ready for judgment. Sin has ripened to the harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&hellip;And the Earth was Reaped&hellip;</h3>\r\n<p>What plagues descend with the sharp sickle! What a cutting down and devastation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pressing of the Vintage (vs. 17-20)</h2>\r\n<img id=\"pressing-wine\" src=\"/assets/revelation/treading-wine.jpg\" />\r\n<p>After the grain harvest comes the grape harvest. The grapes are cut down and then placed in the wine press. This pressing will be performed by God himself in a place called Armageddon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Gathering into the Great Wine Press of the Wrath of God</h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 16:14-16&mdash;For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the harvest of the \"earth\" and judgment not on a local but global scale. All the nations will be gathered: the kings, leaders, armies, antichrist, false prophet, and the followers of the beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armageddon is a name occurring only once in the Bible and designating the place where the last great battle of the ages will take place. Armageddon is a Hebrew word, although it does not occur in the Old Testament. Its meaning is not exactly clear, but it is best taken to mean Mount Megiddo, since \"Har\" in Hebrew means mountain and \"Mageddon\" is the place-name of Megiddo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Old Testament history Megiddo was a place of numerous decisive battles because of the broad plain that stood before it. Deborah and Barak defeated Sisera and his Canaanite army there (Judges 4-5), Gideon drove off the Midianites and Amalekites ( Judges 6 ), Saul and the army of Israel were defeated because of their failure to trust in God ( 1 Sam 31 ), and the Egyptian army under Pharaoh Neco killed Josiah, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 23:29 ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some take John's designation literally, expecting the armies of the earth to gather against God in the endtimes below the remains of Old Testament Megiddo; others see in it a more figurative element. They point out that Megiddo was not really a mountain at all and that the battle will take place in the plain. Perhaps John designated it Mount Megiddo as a clue to its symbolic meaning, drawing together the historic place of conflict in Israel's history with the prophecies of Ezekiel that speak of the great end-time conflict taking place in the mountains of Israel ( Ezekiel 39:2,4, 17 ).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Treading in the Great Wine Press of the Wrath of God</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Grapes would be tossed into the winepress, and then a person or persons would stomp on the grapes with their feet until all the grape juice was pressed out. The Wine press is the wrath of God and these grapes are all the enemies of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 63:1-3&mdash;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. 2 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 2:9&mdash;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 14:20&mdash;And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">And the winepress was trodden without the city, eternally without the city of the heavenly Jerusalem, and far from the presence of God; eternally crushed and trodden down by his justice; eternally tormented in body and soul, without any hope either of living or dying! This is the miserable lot and portion of those who shall have despised the law of God, and died in impenitence. My God, pierce my heart with a salutary dread of thy judgments!&mdash;Adam Clarke </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A lake of blood to the size of 200 sqaure miles and as high as a horse's bridle! Such a slaughter is the end sin brings. Christ is victor over all His enemies. Revelation 19:13 tells us His vesture is \"dipped with blood\" and his name is \"KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS\".</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As there were intertwined the harvesting and the festivals, so in the midst of the end of all things and God's judgment is both the God-ward and man-ward side of all things. God ultimately reaps the harvest and humanity is that harvest. There will be a harvest of the wicked as well as in in-gathering (as the crops are ready) of the Believers. God is allowing the tares and wheat to grow together, but soon there will be an ingathering and distinction made.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 13:30&mdash;Let both grow together until the harvest:&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The first-fruits is an in-gathering dedicated entirely to and for God.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2 Timothy 2:19&mdash;Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
