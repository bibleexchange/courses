And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. 19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.

Christ and the 7 Golden Candlesticks [1:9-20]</h1>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 1:9-20 &mdash; I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 14  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. 19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>THE WITNESS: HOW did John Hear and See</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Their Companion in Tribulation (on isle of Patmos 13sq miles area and 32 miles from the coast of Asia Minor, exiled there under emperor Domitian) It was in this unfriendly place the awesome revelation was written.</li>\r\n\t<p>According to Tertullian (in The Prescription of Heretics) John was banished after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome around AD 95.</p>\r\n\t<li>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day</li>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\"In the Spirit\" Ezekiel 37:1 (valley dry bones);  Re 1:10 (in the spirit on the Lord's day); Re 4:2 (And immediately I was in the spirit); Re 17:3 (carried me away in the spirit);\r\n Re 21:10 (he carried me away in the spirit )</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Received in the Spirit and to be understood only by the Spirit</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 2:14 &mdash; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This does not mean the book of Revelation cannot be understood, but that in order to fully understand it we must be in that same condition of communion with the Spirit of God as John.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>8 times in Revelation:  Re 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith ....</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 50:4-- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, <b>he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned</b>.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>WHAT did John Hear and See (Revelation 1:9-20)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3> 1.
