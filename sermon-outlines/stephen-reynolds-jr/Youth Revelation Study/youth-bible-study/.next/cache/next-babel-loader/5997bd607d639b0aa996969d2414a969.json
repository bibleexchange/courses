All are blasts of judgment, and all belong to the \"Great Day of the Lord.\" Thus far, the trumpets have blown only for the objects of physical nature, and wrought their effects through disturbances in the material world. But the trumpet now before us goes beyond the physical world and calls into action quite other agencies. The doors of separation between the earth and the prison of evil spirits are opened.</p>\r\n<h2>What the Star Is - vs. 1.</h2>\r\n<p>This is not a meteor for this star is an intelligent agent, he has ascribed to him distinctive characteristics that could not possibly be ascribed to anything but a living being.</p>\r\n<h3>vs. 1 - \"To him was given the key\"</h3>\r\n<h3>vs. 2 - \"He opened the bottomless pit\"</h3>\r\n<h3>vs. 3 - \"There came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth. \"</h3>\r\n<p>We must conclude that this is not a material but a spiritual star.It is a \"Fallen Star\"</p>\r\n<h2>Who The Star Is - Isa. 14:12.</h2>\r\n<p>Vs. 11 Says the \"star\" is the king over them, whose name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name \"Apollyon\"destroyer; devil; Satan.</p>\r\n<h2>The Time of His Fall -</h2>\r\n<p>At the time of the original creation, he fell into the condemnation of the devil. But in Revelations he fell from heaven to Earth. Just prior to the Rapture of the Church, the Devil is cast out. Rev. 12:7-9.</p>\r\n<h2>The Key Given -</h2>\r\n<h3>Key speaks of Power - And authority to use that power. Peter was given the keys to the kingdom the power to open the door of the Gospel. Christ had the keys of death and hell at His side.</h3>\r\n<h3>The key is \"given - Cannot go beyond what he is permitted. Evil would override the world.</h3>\r\n<h2>What The Key Is For -</h2>\r\n<p>\"The Bottomless Pit.\" - The Release of the Locusts.</p>\r\n<h2>What The Locusts Are -</h2>\r\n<h3>Their Nature.</h3>\r\n<p>Locusts have no king, Prov. 30:27.\r\nThey are supernatural, angelic beings.vs. 11.Jude 6; II Peter 2:4.</p>\r\n<h3>Their Forms -</h3>\r\n<p>\"like unto horses\"-\"like unto men\"-\"have hair like a woman,\"-\"have teeth of lions\" - \" have breastplates of iron,\" - \"have wings, \" - \"have tails\"</p>\r\n<h3>Their Intelligence</h3>\r\n<p>They have a certain amount of intelligence. vs. ###Commands are given to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Their Power -</h3>\r\n<p>Is limited -vs. 4; The extent of their power is to horrify and torment, vs. 5.</p>\r\n<h3>The Duration of their torment, vs. 5 and 10.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Sounding of the Sixth Trumpet - Rev. 9:12-21</h1>\r\n<h2>The Voice of this Judgment.</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\"I heard a voice.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The location of the voice-</h3>\r\n<h4>\"From the four horns of the golden altar.\"</h4>\r\n<p>The place of intercession, prayer, petition and mercy. (Rev. 8:3-5; 1 Kings 1:50-53 )</p>\r\n<h4>\"Which is before God.\"</h4>\r\n<p>This is a Divine judgment. As it comes from the presence of God, it has His sanction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who the Voice Adresses</h3>\r\n<p>\"To the sixth angel\" - vs. 14 The Sixth Angel sounds and The Voice responds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What the Voice was Saying.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 9:14 -- &hellip;Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Release of the Angels.</h2>\r\n<h3>The Nature of the Angels.</h3>\r\n<h4>They are fallen and bound angels.

God lets devils destroy them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Time of their Release.</h3>\r\n<p>Prepared for a specific hour, day, month, and year. For example: 9:00 am, 12th day of April 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Vision of Horses and Horsemen - vs. 17.</h2>\r\n<blockquote>\"I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Their Number (vs. 16)</h3>\r\n<p>200,000 x 1,000 = 200,000,000. Two hundred million.</p>\r\n<p>To place the size of this host in perspective consider the size of the worlds armies today. In 2013, The top five countries with the largest armies were China (2,285,000), United States of America (1,458,219), India (1,325,000), North Korea (1,106,000), and Russia (1,027,000).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Their Nature</h3>\r\n<p>These are no ordinary horses, but are executers of these four fallen Angels. These horses fulfill the will of these four fallen Angels and act on their behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Their Description- vs. 17.</h3>\r\n<h4>\"Having Breastplates of Fire.\" In Ephesians Breastplates of Righteousness -Here breastplates of fire&mdash;a symbol of Judgment</h4>\r\n<h4>\"Having breastplates of Jacinth\" According to Elliott, the jacinth color, is the dark purple or blue the color of smoke.</h4>\r\n<h4>\"Having Breastplates of Brimstone.\"</h4>\r\n<p>Brimstone is sulphur.

While fornication is being h3censed by the opinion of Churchmen, God still hates it, and will judge it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Practice of Thievery</h3>\r\n<p>\"Theffs\" - \"Klemma\" - Kepto - (maniac)Wholesale Robbery.</p>\r\n\r\n <h1>The Cloud-Robed Angel (10:1-11)</h1>\r\n <img src=\"/assets/revelation/sun-through-clouds.jpg\" id=\"sun-through-clouds\"/> <br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n <blockquote>Revelation 10:1 -- And I saw another mighty angel come\r\n down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his\r\n head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars\r\n of fire:</blockquote>\r\n <p>The scene of the \"Cloud-Robed Angel\" is still part of the sixth\r\n trumpet that began in 9:13. It is not until 11:14 that the sixth\r\n trumpet (the second woe) is accomplished.</p>\r\n <h2 style={{clear:\"both\"}}>The Angel</h2>\r\n <h3>The Title Suggests Deity. - \"another mighty angel\"</h3>\r\n <h4>\"another\" </h4>\r\n <p>This Angel is distinct from the other angels mentioned as we have\r\n seen in Revelation 7:2 and 8:3. We should also note that the\r\n phrase \"another angel\" is also used several times in chapter 14\r\n and once in 18:1, but especially chapter 14 does not seem to give\r\n the same sense of the exceptionalism of the angel as in the other\r\n passages.</p>\r\n <h4>\"mighty\"</h4>\r\n <p>&nbsp;John the Revelator uses the title \"another angel\" in 9\r\n verses, but \"mighty\" (ischuros) angel is used only here in 10:1\r\n and in 18:21 where a mighty angel announces and describes the\r\n judgment of Babylon the Great. \"Ischuros\" (greek word) is used in\r\n 7 verses by John and can be found in 25 verses throughout the New\r\n Testament. It is adjective describing what He is and not what He\r\n has. He is mighty,&nbsp; powerful,&nbsp; strong and boisterious.\r\n \"Ischuros\" can also be used to give a comparative sense: stronger,\r\n mightier, more powerful. </p>\r\n <blockquote>Matthew 3:11 -- I indeed baptize you with water unto\r\n repentance: but he that cometh after me is <b>mightier </b>than\r\n I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with\r\n the Holy Ghost, and with fire: </blockquote>\r\n <blockquote> Mt 12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's\r\n house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the <b>strong </b> man?\r\n and then he will spoil his house. </blockquote>\r\n <blockquote>1 Corinthians 10:22 -- Do we provoke the Lord to\r\n jealousy? are we <b>stronger </b>than he?</blockquote>\r\n <blockquote>Hebrews 6:18 -- That by two immutable things, in which\r\n it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a <b>strong </b>consolation,\r\n who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</blockquote>\r\n <h3>The Particulars Suggest Deity</h3>\r\n <p>Inspection of the particulars of the Angel suggest He is more\r\n than just \"a messenger\", but is \"The Messenger\". More convincing\r\n of the deity of this angel than His actual title (\"another mighty\r\n angel\") is the details of his description.\r\n </p>\r\n <h4>\"clothed with a cloud\"</h4>\r\n <p>Clothing speaks of Condition (Sinful or Righteous). For examples\r\n see: 2 Chronicles 6:41; Job 8:22; 29:14; Psalm 35:26; Psalm 104:1.\r\n In Ezekiel chapter one, the cloud and rainbow was a description of\r\n the glory of God.</p>\r\n <blockquote>Ezekiel 1:28 -- As the appearance of the bow that is in\r\n the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the\r\n brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of\r\n the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and\r\n I heard a voice of one that spake.</blockquote>\r\n <p>Clouds also speak of Mystery (Indicating Deity). For examples\r\n see: Exodus 24:16;40:34; Lev. 16:2; Matt. 17:5.</p>\r\n <p>Clouds also speak of Judgment�. As clouds are indicators of a\r\n storm so the cloud here indicates a storm is coming! The storm is\r\n the judgments of God.\r\n </p>\r\n <h4> \"a rainbow was upon His head\"</h4>\r\n <p>The Rainbow is a Covenant Sign. God said in Genesis 9:13 that \"I\r\n do set my bow in the cloud\". The presence of this rainbow is sign\r\n of mercy which appears over the head of Him that is robed \"with a\r\n cloud\" which is sign of Judgment. In Judgment God Remembers Mercy!\r\n \r\n </p>\r\n <h4>\"His face was as it were the sun\"</h4>\r\n <p>In the first vision - Rev. 1:13-20. Mal. 4: 2 \"Sun of Righteousness\" Acts 26:13 \"Above the brightness of the sun.\" </p>\r\n <h4>\"His feet as pillars of fire\"</h4>\r\n <p> This is an image of pureness and judgment. It is also an image\r\n of steadfastness and glorious majesty.\r\n </p>\r\n <h4>\"And He had in his hand a little book open:\"</h4>\r\n <p>Only ONE had proven worthy to open the book and release its\r\n seals!</p>\r\n <blockquote>Revelation 5:5 -- And one of the elders saith unto me,\r\n Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of\r\n David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven\r\n seals thereof.</blockquote>\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>The Acts of the Angel </h2>\r\n\t\r\n <h3>Taking Possession</h3>\r\n <p>As described in Deuteronomy 11:24, He is taking possession of the earth and its people. \"He set His right foot upon the sea\". The sea or water is often people in Scripture (see Rev. 17:1, 15). \"And His left foot on the earth\". The earth is the place where the people dwell. Who is the world under dominion to now? Under the rule of Satan. (John 12:31; Luke 4:6; II Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2: 2) The Devil is in control\r\n now, but Jesus is soon to take over. He sets His foot upon the sea, and the land, and takes hold as His own.</p>\r\n <h3>Proclaiming Victory</h3>\r\n <p>\"Cried with a loud voice,\" Not the cry of defeat or fear. But of\r\n POWER, VICTORY and TRIUMPH; John 11:43-44 At the grave of Lazarus.\r\n Could it be that He is Awakening the Dead? \"As when a lion\r\n roareth.\" He is known as \"The lion of the tribe of Judah\" Judah-\r\n Praise -Victory -shouting in victory. Song writer said -\"That\r\n breaks every chain.\" Also the Prophet said - \"The Lord shall roar\r\n out of Zion \" Jer. 25:29-31</p>\r\n <h3>Signaling Fulfillment.</h3>\r\n <p>\"lifted up his hand to heaven\" vs. 5. a signal of Readiness or\r\n Victory.</p>\r\n <blockquote>And sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever&hellip;\r\n &hellip;that there should be time no longer.\" vs. 6. </blockquote>\r\n <p>There should be \"No more delay\" (Amplified Version). There is\r\n reason now for delay. II Peter 3:9-10.</p>\r\n <h2>The Response to the Angel, vs. 3 \"and when He had cried\"</h2>\r\n <h3>Indication of (More) Judgment.</h3>\r\n <p>More severe. \"Seven thunders uttered their voices\" Seven\r\n (Complete) Thunders or Judgment.</p>\r\n <h3>Personality Ascribed.</h3>\r\n <p>They speak -\"Uttered their voices\" John was going to write what\r\n he heard.</p>\r\n <h3>A Command Given, vs. 4.</h3>\r\n <p>Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write\r\n them not.</p>\r\n <h2>The Scroll in the Angel's Hand, vs. 2a; 8-11.</h2>\r\n <h3>It is a Revelation, vs. 7.</h3>\r\n <p>\"The mystery of God should be finished (complete, execute,\r\n conclude) as He hath declared to His servants the prophets.\"</p>\r\n <h3>The Nature of the Revelation.</h3>\r\n <p>It had been a mystery. \"He had in His hand a little book.\" The\r\n Book mentioned in Rev. 5; No man could open it -no one else.</p>\r\n <p>It is a mystery that has been solved . \"A little book open\" The\r\n mystery that had been hid for ages is now revealed.</p>\r\n <h3>The Facts Related To The Revelation.</h3>\r\n <h4>\"Go and take the little book\".

Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Mystery</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 10:7&mdash;But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15:51,52&mdash;Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</blockquote>\r\n<h3>A Trumpet</h3>\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 24:31&mdash;And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 11:15&mdash;And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Attending Manifestations (vs. 15-17)</h2>\r\n<h3>&ldquo;There Were Great Voices in Heaven&rdquo;</h3>\r\n<p>There are many voices in heaven &ndash; Some are shouting (vs. 15).</p>\r\n<li>Others shouting &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.&rdquo; (4:8)</li>\r\n<li>Some are singing a new song (5:9;14:3)</li>\r\n<li>Voices shouting the Worthiness of the Lord.

Measure the Temple of God [11:1-2]</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Reinstating of the Jew (11:1-2)</h1>\r\n<p>This chapter is a continuation of chapter 10. In 10:9, John ate the little book and was told he must prophesy again. In 11:1, John is given a reed. The measuring of the temple takes place during the Judgment of the Sixth Trumpet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of the Jewish people is a message to the church first of warning and then of comfort:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Warning</li>\r\n\t<p>The warning is that no one will escape Divine judgment if they take for granted His blessing and count it as their inherent privilege instead of being conditional on a covenant relationship. The Jews so proudly boasted in Jesus' day \"we are Abraham's Children\" while their hearts were FAR from God (Isaiah 29:13). They backslide from being a covenant people to a people of entitlement.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Comfort</li>\r\n\t<p>The comfort is that God is specializes RESTORATIONS! The Jews like an unfruitful branch were cut off and the Gentiles grafted in, but God has always had a mind to restore a repentant Israel. God's prophets have warned both of the dispersion of the Jews and their eventual reinstatement. This reinstatement includes their re-establishment in Palestine, but most importantly includes their restored relationship with God.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Instrument Given</h2>\r\n<h3>A Reed</h3>\r\n<p>The instrument of judgment given to John is \"A Reed\" (Kalamos). This is not a \"frail reed\" as in Matthew 11:7, but is an instrument of measurement as in Isaiah 44:13, Amos 7:7 and Ezekial 40:5.</p>\r\n<p>This reed is a \"canon\", \"Law\" or \"rule\". 3rd century church leader Origen used the word canon to refer to the \"rule of faith\". We can find the greek word \"kanon\" used five times in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 10:13,15,16; Galatians 6:16; Philippians 3:16).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Philippians 3:16 -- Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that this is \"A Reed\" and not \"The Reed\". It is \"A Law/Rule\" and not \"The Law/Rule\". God is not instructing John to measure according to the Old Testament Law and Forms, but the standard of measurement is the New Covenant which God has written on hearts and not tables of stone. (Hebrews 8:8-13; Jeremiah 31:31-34 )</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 3:3 -- Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Like Unto a Rod</h3>\r\n<p>This measuring reed is \"like unto a rod\" (Rhabdos) meaning a stick or wand, scepter (Matthew 27:9) or an instrument of chastisement (Matthew 27:30). Both Christ (Isaiah 11:4; Revelation 19:15) and the Overcomer (Revelation 2:27; 12:5) are described as ruling with a \"rod of iron\". </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although John is witnessing a fuller office of rule for the Overcomer, in one sense the rulership of the saints in the world is already evident. A look at the laws of America alone reveals the great influence of God, His Word and His people in the creation of these laws. \r\n</p><p>The Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, our currency, all 50 state constitutions and the Pledge of Allegiance all affirm the sovereign authority of God. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution both are premised on the need of the authority of law and not the authority of a man which is a Scriptural principle (Isaiah 8:19,20).

The \"reed\" is the standard of comparison or measurement. There are no gray areas or guesses here. Absolute determination and inspection is made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary purpose of the measuring is to answer the question how does the temple compare to the standard? Such inspection reveals changes if there are any. The command to measure suggests important changes have been made. The old has been done away and a new is coming into view. Jews had been cast off for their backslidings, but now God will bring them back (Romans 11:11-27). (Note: The Jews trapped in Judaism are confident in their bondage because they measure with an old/expired reed.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>To Declare Ownership.</h3>\r\n<p>Measuring also indicates appropriation. As when a person purchases a property and detailed surveying is made so here what is measured is claimed or owned (Joshua 1:3). God is marking His territory!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 8:10 -- &hellip;I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Articles Measured (vs. 1)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"The Temple of God\"</h3>\r\n<blockquote>I Peter 4:17 -- For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There is both an earthly and spiritual Jerusalem or \"City of God\". (Nehemiah 11:1,18; Isaiah 52:1; Matthew 4:5; 27:52-53)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the earthly temple being measured here. No human judgement is needed for the heavenly temple. In Revelation 21:15 we see a \"Golden Reed\" is used to measure the New Jerusalem. This Golden Reed is a Divine measurement. As it is built by God according to His own blueprint, the measuring in 21:15 reveals its perfection. The measuring in chapter 11 results in judgement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This temple in Revelation 11:1,2 will be judged and given to the Gentiles for a 3-1/2 years. (New Jerusalem will never be given to be trodden under foot.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\"The Altar \"</h3>\r\n<h4>The Measuring reminds Israel of The demands and commands of God in regard to the \"Altar.\"</h4>\r\n<h4>Temple worship restored, vs. 1.</h4>\r\n<h4>Sacrifice Restored. Dan.8:11-13; 11:31; 12:11.</h4>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Worshippers</h3>\r\n<h4>The Jew will return to worship. \"That worship there\"</h4>\r\n<h4>The Jew will turn to God.

Two Witnesses [11:3-13]</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>These two witnesses are not presented to John in vision. They are described to him by the glorious Angel, who is the Lord Jesus Himself. The account that is given here is not John's but Christ's, given in His own words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who, then, are these Two Witnesses? The connection in which the account is given may help to give us the answer. These Witnesses come upon us suddenly, in the midst of the scenes of the Judgment, and at a time when Christ is ready to take possession of the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Their Outstanding Circumstances -</h2>\r\n<h3>Ordained of God - vs.3</h3>\r\n<p>\"My two witnesses\" - \"And I will give power\"</p>\r\n<h4>Power to Prophesy -vs 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Power to Punish -vs. 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Power to Shut Heaven -vs. 6a</h4>\r\n<h4>Power to Work Miracles -vs. 6b,c</h4>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two in Number -vs. 3- 4</h3>\r\n<p>Deut. 17:6; Matt. 18:16; Moses and Aaron -Caleb and Joshua\r\nZerubbabel and Jeshua -Peter and John\r\nOld Testament and New Testament\r\nEverything to be established by two or three witnesses.\r\nNotice- vs. 4; Zech. 4:1-3.

Some believe Moses and Elijah. Some believe Enoch and Elijah. Some believe O.T. and N.T. Some believe a body of believers. Malachi 3:1-6; 4:1,5-6; Matt. 17:10-13; 11:14-15; Luke 1:15-17. John the baptist was a partial fulfillment - Mal. 4:6; Luke 1:17. Lev. 26:1,9; Jer. 14:22; Zech. 10:1,2; Hag. 1:9-11.\r\nThe Reason water to blood - Because of the bloody and oppressive tyranny. Moses in Egypt. The bloody persecution.</p>\r\n<h3>They Are Merciful Witnesses.</h3>\r\n<p>Though they appear in judgment, the message is a warning -\r\n\"To flee from the wrath to come\" - But they will hot listen - II Thess. 2:9-11.</p>\r\n<p>What have we identified the two witnesses to be? Now we continue&hellip;\r\nTheir Times -Their Doings -Their End</p>\r\n<h2>The Times of These Two Witnesses.</h2>\r\n<h3>They are not Gospel Times.</h3>\r\n<h4>The Jew and his Temple.</h4>\r\n<h4>Ministers- different from Gospel ministers. vs. 5.</h4>\r\n<p>They kill -vs. 10 torment - deal out fiery judgment.Avenge the very wish to injure them. We are not to avenge ourselves.Not to smite and kill our enemies - but love them. Jesus was crucified Stephen was stoned. James was beheaded. Peter was crucified.Paul beaten -imprisoned - beheaded - Polycarp is burned.The Gospel is a thing of joy. Isa. 57:7.</p>\r\n<h4>Their garments symbols of calamity and judgment. The heavens are shut - no rain -no grain. Waters are turned to blood.</h4>\r\n<h3>They are very Evil Times.</h3>\r\n<h4>Times of great affliction and sorrow for God's true ministers.

How many more?</p>\r\n<h4>They are times of Miracles, vs.3 The Two witnesses</h4>\r\n<p>The Beast and False Prophet - lying signs and wonders. II Thess. 2:3-10.Deceiving the world - Rev. 13:12-13 Moses overcame the magicians.These overcome the witnesses vs. 7.</p>\r\n<h2>The Work of These Two Witnesses.</h2>\r\n<p>They Are Prophets, vs.3; vs. 6; vs. 10.

Matt. 24:21-22.</p>\r\n<h2>The End of These Two Witnesses.</h2>\r\n<p>Their career, though illustrious, and crowded with miracle from beginning to end, is very brief. vs. 3.They shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 3 -1/2 years.</p>\r\n<h3>They Are Killed -vs. 7.</h3>\r\n<p>Put to death. \"When they shall have finished their testimony. \"When their work is complete.</p>\r\n<h3>The Form of Death They Die - vs.8.</h3>\r\n<p>Some believe reference is made of crucifixion.

Rev. 20:4a.</p>\r\n<h3>The Place of Death - vs. 8 \"in the street&hellip;of the great city\"</h3>\r\n<p>They are denied burial. \"Spiritually called Sodom and Egypt\" This is further proof of the literalness of this prophesy. Jerusalem in Apostasy, is a Sodom. Isa. 1:9-10; 3:8-9; Deut. 32:30-33; Jer. 23:14.</p>\r\n<h3>The Length of Their Death - vs. 1 3 -1/2 days.</h3>\r\n<p>They do not remain dead. \"Life came into ,them -and stood upon their feet.\" The world is left in shock -</p>\r\n<h3>They Ascend into Heaven - vs. 12.</h3>\r\n<p>They hear the call.
