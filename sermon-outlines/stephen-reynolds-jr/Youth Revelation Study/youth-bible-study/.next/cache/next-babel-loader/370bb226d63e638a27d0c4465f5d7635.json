God in his infinite wisdom has chosen to use the language of symbolism and imagery to communicate this Revelation. How can we unlock the symbolism of this book? Mainly by comparing scripture with scripture (2 Peter 1:20) do we understand its symbolism. This Revelation is profoundly positioned as the last book of the Bible. It not only contains prophecy of last things, but it is in its nature a climax to all Biblical revelation. We in part find understanding of the symbolism in Revelation by understanding previously given symbolism. Some examples include: 1) The Four Living Creatures Ezekiel 1:5; Revelation 4:6 2) The 7 Churches of Asia were both literal and symbolic. As the New Testament Epistles were relevant to a first century Church so they are still relevant today. 3) Water of Life John 4:14; Revelation 21:6 This Revelation with all its symbolism was given to John by God's \\\"angel\\\". John himself was puzzled as to the role of this \\\"angel\\\" and eventually falls at his feet in 22:8 to worship him. In verse 9, the angel rebuked him saying he was only a \\\"fellow servant\\\" and that John must only \\\"worship God\\\". The Believer must keep in constant remembrance amidst all the majesty of God's Grace that all the glory belongs to God and we are just \\\"His messengers\\\". ## The Scribe of this Book (1:2) > Revelation 1:1 \\u2026unto His servant John 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. ### The Apostle John ### He bare record (1:2; John 1:1-14) ### He gave witness (I John 1:1-3; 20:31)\", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n      children: \" The Value of this Book (1:3)\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 127,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }, this), \"### It is rewarding \\\"Blessed\\\" - happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied #### \\\"He that readeth\\\" #### \\\"They that hear the words\\\" #### \\\"And keep those things which are written\\\" ### It is enlightening (22:10) > Revelation 22:10--Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.\", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n      children: \"The Premise of this Book(1:4-9)\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 137,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n      children: \"We will search out the source, subject, substance and circumstances of the book of Revelation.\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 139,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n      children: \" The Sources of this Revelation (1:4,5)\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 141,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }, this), \"### John He is the writer - the Scribe ### The Father \\\"Which is, which was, and which is to come.\\\" ### The Spirit \\\"From the seven Spirits which are before His throne;\\\" SEVEN: \\\"Hepta\\\" - signifying to be full - \\\"Pneuma\\\" \\\"Spirit\\\" .

When the book of Revelation is talked about and especially when it is called the \"Apocalypse\" it often gives quiet a chilling impression. Our minds often travel to \"The anti-Christ\" or \"The Mark of the Best\" and especially, \"The End of the World\". These are often made out to be the banner themes of this book, but nothing could be farther from the truth. \"Apocalypse\" does not mean \"judgment day\". \"Apocalypse\". means:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>something revealed, disclosed, manifested, or shown. As a verb it means to uncover and as noun it means an appearing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4> It is a Revelation of Jesus Christ</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Banner Theme of this book is Jesus Christ and His righteous conquest. From the first to the last verse, it is the Lamb, the King, the Bridegroom Who takes center stage. This is not a revelation of John but of JESUS (Savior, Christ, King). This book reveals truth concerning Jesus:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>His Exaltation as the Son (Rev. 3:21; Acts 2:33)</li>\r\n\t<li> Revelation 3:21--To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</li>\r\n\t<li> His ministry in the Church (Rev. 1:13)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:13--And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</li>\r\n\t<li> His position in the throne (Rev 4:2; Eph. 1:20,21)</li>\r\n\t<li> Revelation 4:2--And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</li>\r\n\t<li> His rapture of the Church (Rev. 4:1)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 4:1--After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</li>\r\n\t<li> His coming in power and glory (Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:30)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:7--Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</li>\r\n\t<li> His raising the dead (Rev. 1:18; John 5:27-29)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:18--I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</li>\r\n\t<li> His judgment of the nations (Rev. 14:7)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 14:7--Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</li>\r\n\t<li> His reign and rule on the earth (Rev. 11:15)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 11:15--And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</li>\r\n\t<li> His judgment on Satan (Rev. 20:1-2,10)</li>\r\n\t<li>Revelation 1:1,2,10--1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4> It is a Gift of God</h4>\r\n<p>Verse 1 says this revelation of Jesus Christ \"which God GAVE unto Him\" was in turn given by Jesus to His angel who gave it to John. The writer is describing a clear stream of inspiration from the throne of heaven which contests any suggestion that the following writing is of human origin and imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4> It is a Prophecy</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\"To show unto His servants things which must come to pass shortly.\" This is a key to this book. v. 3 \"The words of this prophecy\" Ch. 4:1 \"I will show thee things which must (come) be hereafter.\" Revelation is essentially a book of prophecy rather than history.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>It is Symbolic</h4>\r\n\r\n1:1 says \"&hellip;he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John.\" \"Signified\" is the Greek word \"Semaino\" meaning to give a sign or to express or reveal by signs. God in his infinite wisdom has chosen to use the language of symbolism and imagery to communicate this Revelation.\r\nHow can we unlock the symbolism of this book? Mainly by comparing scripture with scripture (2 Peter 1:20) do we understand its symbolism. This Revelation is profoundly positioned as the last book of the Bible. It not only contains prophecy of last things, but it is in its nature a climax to all Biblical revelation. We in part find understanding of the symbolism in Revelation by understanding previously given symbolism.\r\nSome examples include: 1) The Four Living Creatures Ezekiel 1:5; Revelation 4:6 2) The 7 Churches of Asia were both literal and symbolic. As the New Testament Epistles were relevant to a first century Church so they are still relevant today. 3) Water of Life John 4:14; Revelation 21:6\r\nThis Revelation with all its symbolism was given to John by God's \"angel\". John himself was puzzled as to the role of this \"angel\" and eventually falls at his feet in 22:8 to worship him. In verse 9, the angel rebuked him saying he was only a \"fellow servant\" and that John must only \"worship God\". The Believer must keep in constant remembrance amidst all the majesty of God's Grace that all the glory belongs to God and we are just \"His messengers\".\r\n## The Scribe of this Book (1:2)\r\n> Revelation 1:1 &hellip;unto His servant John 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\r\n\r\n### The Apostle John\r\n### He bare record (1:2; John 1:1-14)\r\n### He gave witness (I John 1:1-3; 20:31)\r\n\r\n<h3> The Value of this Book (1:3)</h3>\r\n### It is rewarding\r\n\"Blessed\" - happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied\r\n#### \"He that readeth\"\r\n#### \"They that hear the words\"\r\n#### \"And keep those things which are written\"\r\n### It is enlightening (22:10)\r\n> Revelation 22:10--Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Premise of this Book(1:4-9)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We will search out the source, subject, substance and circumstances of the book of Revelation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> The Sources of this Revelation (1:4,5)</h3>\r\n### John\r\nHe is the writer - the Scribe\r\n### The Father\r\n\"Which is, which was, and which is to come.\"\r\n### The Spirit\r\n\"From the seven Spirits which are before His throne;\" SEVEN: \"Hepta\" - signifying to be full - \"Pneuma\" \"Spirit\" .
