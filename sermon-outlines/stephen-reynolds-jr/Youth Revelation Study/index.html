<h2>John's Introduction to the Book (1:1-3)</h2>

<p>In John's introduction to this book he introduces the reader to the subject, scribe and value of the book of Revelation.</p>

<blockquote>Revelation 1:19 &mdash; Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</blockquote>

<h3>The Subject of this Book (1:1)</h3>

<h4>It is a Revelation</h4>

<p>The Greek title for this book found in verse 1 is "Apokalupsis" which is transliterated "Apocalypse". When the book of Revelation is talked about and especially when it is called the "Apocalypse" it often gives quiet a chilling impression. Our minds often travel to "The anti-Christ" or "The Mark of the Best" and especially, "The End of the World". These are often made out to be the banner themes of this book, but nothing could be farther from the truth. "Apocalypse" does not mean "judgment day". "Apocalypse". means:</p>

<blockquote>something revealed, disclosed, manifested, or shown. As a verb it means to uncover and as noun it means an appearing.</blockquote>

<h4> It is a Revelation of Jesus Christ</h4>

<p>The Banner Theme of this book is Jesus Christ and His righteous conquest. From the first to the last verse, it is the Lamb, the King, the Bridegroom Who takes center stage. This is not a revelation of John but of JESUS (Savior, Christ, King). This book reveals truth concerning Jesus:</p>

<ol>
	<li>His Exaltation as the Son (Rev. 3:21; Acts 2:33)</li>
> Revelation 3:21--To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
<li> His ministry in the Church (Rev. 1:13)
> Revelation 1:13--And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
<li> His position in the throne (Rev 4:2; Eph. 1:20,21)
> Revelation 4:2--And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
<li> His rapture of the Church (Rev. 4:1)
> Revelation 4:1--After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
<li> His coming in power and glory (Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:30)
> Revelation 1:7--Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
<li> His raising the dead (Rev. 1:18; John 5:27-29)
> Revelation 1:18--I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
<li> His judgment of the nations (Rev. 14:7)
> Revelation 14:7--Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
<li> His reign and rule on the earth (Rev. 11:15)
> Revelation 11:15--And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
<li> His judgment on Satan (Rev. 20:1-2,10)
> Revelation 1:1,2,10--1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

<h4> It is a Gift of God</h4>
<p>Verse 1 says this revelation of Jesus Christ "which God GAVE unto Him" was in turn given by Jesus to His angel who gave it to John. The writer is describing a clear stream of inspiration from the throne of heaven which contests any suggestion that the following writing is of human origin and imagination.</p>

<h4> It is a Prophecy</h4>
<p>"To show unto His servants things which must come to pass shortly." This is a key to this book. v. 3 "The words of this prophecy" Ch. 4:1 "I will show thee things which must (come) be hereafter." Revelation is essentially a book of prophecy rather than history.</p>

<h4>It is Symbolic</h4>

1:1 says "&hellip;he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John." "Signified" is the Greek word "Semaino" meaning to give a sign or to express or reveal by signs. God in his infinite wisdom has chosen to use the language of symbolism and imagery to communicate this Revelation.
How can we unlock the symbolism of this book? Mainly by comparing scripture with scripture (2 Peter 1:20) do we understand its symbolism. This Revelation is profoundly positioned as the last book of the Bible. It not only contains prophecy of last things, but it is in its nature a climax to all Biblical revelation. We in part find understanding of the symbolism in Revelation by understanding previously given symbolism.
Some examples include: 1) The Four Living Creatures Ezekiel 1:5; Revelation 4:6 2) The 7 Churches of Asia were both literal and symbolic. As the New Testament Epistles were relevant to a first century Church so they are still relevant today. 3) Water of Life John 4:14; Revelation 21:6
This Revelation with all its symbolism was given to John by God's "angel". John himself was puzzled as to the role of this "angel" and eventually falls at his feet in 22:8 to worship him. In verse 9, the angel rebuked him saying he was only a "fellow servant" and that John must only "worship God". The Believer must keep in constant remembrance amidst all the majesty of God's Grace that all the glory belongs to God and we are just "His messengers".
## The Scribe of this Book (1:2)
> Revelation 1:1 &hellip;unto His servant John 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

### The Apostle John
### He bare record (1:2; John 1:1-14)
### He gave witness (I John 1:1-3; 20:31)

<h3> The Value of this Book (1:3)</h3>
### It is rewarding
"Blessed" - happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied
#### "He that readeth"
#### "They that hear the words"
#### "And keep those things which are written"
### It is enlightening (22:10)
> Revelation 22:10--Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.


<h2>The Premise of this Book(1:4-9)</h2>

<p>We will search out the source, subject, substance and circumstances of the book of Revelation.</p>

<h3> The Sources of this Revelation (1:4,5)</h3>
### John
He is the writer - the Scribe
### The Father
"Which is, which was, and which is to come."
### The Spirit
"From the seven Spirits which are before His throne;" SEVEN: "Hepta" - signifying to be full - "Pneuma" "Spirit" . Therefore, meaning: a "Seven-fold spirit". God is described here in the fullness of His office and powers.
### The Son
"And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth."
<h3> The Subjects of this Revelation</h3>
### The Churches
"To the Seven Churches in Asia" v. 4 not church but "churches".
### Their location (Asia) - v. 4
### Their need - v. 7
Each church had unique needs and problems so a special message is addressed to each of the seven Churches in Asia (Ephesus - Smyrna - Pergamos - etc.)
<h3> The Substance of this Revelation</h3>
### Grace - v 4 G-R-A-C-E: God's Riches At Christ's Expense
### Peace - v. 4 Peace from God brings peace with God. Peace with God brings peace with man.
### Consolation - v. 7 "Behold He cometh"
### Confirmation - v. 8 He will keep His word with you.
<h3> The Circumstances of this Revelation v.9</h3>
### Common Brotherhood - "your brother"
### Common Suffering - "companion in tribulation"
### Common Royalty - "in the kingdom"
### Common Promise - "patience of Jesus Christ"
### Common Place - "Patmos-a place of exile"
The Isle of Patmos was a place of EXILE with barren rocks that was located in the open sea. It was in this unfriendly place the awesome revelation was written.

<blockquote>Revelation 1:9-20 &mdash; I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 14  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. 19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</blockquote>

<h2>THE WITNESS: HOW did John Hear and See</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Their Companion in Tribulation (on isle of Patmos 13sq miles area and 32 miles from the coast of Asia Minor, exiled there under emperor Domitian) It was in this unfriendly place the awesome revelation was written.</li>
	<p>According to Tertullian (in The Prescription of Heretics) John was banished after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome around AD 95.</p>
	<li>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day</li>

	<p>"In the Spirit" Ezekiel 37:1 (valley dry bones);  Re 1:10 (in the spirit on the Lord's day); Re 4:2 (And immediately I was in the spirit); Re 17:3 (carried me away in the spirit);
 Re 21:10 (he carried me away in the spirit )</p>

 <p>Received in the Spirit and to be understood only by the Spirit</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 2:14 &mdash; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</blockquote>

<p>This does not mean the book of Revelation cannot be understood, but that in order to fully understand it we must be in that same condition of communion with the Spirit of God as John.</p>

<blockquote>8 times in Revelation:  Re 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith ....</blockquote>

<blockquote>Isaiah 50:4-- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, <b>he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned</b>.</blockquote>

</ul>

<h2>WHAT did John Hear and See (Revelation 1:9-20)</h2>

<h3> 1. His Voice</h3>

<ul>
	<li>a great voice</li>
	<li>as of a trumpet</li>
	<li>his voice as the sound of many waters</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clearly a VOICE that John heard but it was LIKE a TRUMPET--urgent, clear, strong, awakening, and startling.</p>

<p>God revealed Himself to Moses, on Mt.Sinai "voice of a trumpet exceeding loud." (Exodus 19:16) The Temple opened its doors in the morning at the sound of the trumpet. The Year of Jubilee came with the sound of the trumpet. Lev. 25:9,10 The Silence of the Age will be broken by the sound of a trumpet.
</p>

<blockquote>I Thessalonians 4:16--The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised.</blockquote>

<h3> 2. His Age</h3>

<ul>
	<li>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last</li>
</ul>

<h3> 3. His Vocation</h3>

<ul>
	<li> I saw seven golden candlesticks; And in the midst of the seven candlesticks (v.20)</li>
	<li> he had in his right hand seven stars: (v.20)</li>
	<li> and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword:</li>
</ul>

<p> His place is found <b>in the midst</b> of his church (PROPHET, PRIEST, KING)</p>


<img src="Youth Revelation Study/lampstand.jpg"/>

<p><b>The candlesticks</b> give light, illumination, and revelation which guide us, warn us and make us aware. The Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a light! (Zechariah 4:2-6; Numbers 8:1-4)</p>

<blockquote>John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
Matthew 5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.

Matthew 4:16-- The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
Luke 1:79-- To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
John 11:9-- Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
2 Corinthians 4:6-- For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</blockquote>

<p><b>"Golden"</b>
<b>GREAT COST</b>. The candlesticks were composed of the costliest metal.

<b>GREAT BEAUTY</b>. The tabernacle use filled with the use of gold. Gold is expressive of Godliness.

Psalm 96:9-- O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>

<p><b>7</b> 7 Churches = Entire Church Age. Completeness</p>

<p>God has His ministers in His hand. He holds, controls, owns and will reward them</p>

<h3> 4. His Divinity - the Christ</h3>

<ul>
<li> one like unto the Son of man</li>
<li> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; </li>
<li> and have the keys of hell and of death.</li>
</ul>

<h3> 5. His Clothing</h3>

<ul>
<li> clothed with a garment down to the foot,</li>
<li> and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. ( a golden belt Ephesisans 6 truth)</li>
</ul>

<p>FULLY CLOTHED</p>

<p>Clothing Signified Status</p>

<h3> 6. His Appearance</h3>

<ul>
<li>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;</li>

<p>His Wisdom and "ELDER"ness. Also a reminder of redemption  (sins red like crimson "white as snow")</p>
<blockquote>Isa 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</blockquote>

<li>his eyes were as a flame of fire;</li>

<blockquote>Re 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. (innermost parts)</blockquote>

<li>his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace;</li>
<li>his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</li>
<li><b>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.</b></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="D">D. Vision of the Throne [4]</h1>

<!-- chapter 4 end -->
<h2>The Rapture</h2>

<blockquote>"Things which must be hereafter"</blockquote>
<p>This chapter begins a new vision, which constitutes the second section of the Revelation. It is related not to things on the earth, but to things in heaven, and to things following the period covered by the seven churches.</p>
<p>The Translation of the Bride has already taken place and this section begins with the rapture.</p>

<h3>He saw a door opened - v. 1 "A door opened in heaven"</h3>
<h3>He heard a voice -</h3>

<p>"Voice which I heard as it were of a trumpet." (I Thessalonians 4:16-18)</p>
<blockquote>Come up hither</blockquote>
<blockquote>I will shew thee things</blockquote>
<blockquote>Which must be hereafter</blockquote>
<p>After the Rapture of the Church.</p>
<h3>He was caught up -</h3>
<p>v. 2 "I was in the Spirit" Caught up in the Spirit.</p>
<p>"A throne was set in heaven" set/Keimai- to be out stretched.</p>

<h2>The Throne of Majesty -</h2>
<h3>The Throne is in heaven -</h3>
<blockquote>v. 2 A throne was set in heaven</blockquote>
<blockquote>Psalm 103:19&mdash;The LORD hath prepared His Throne in the heavens;and His kingdom ruleth over all.</blockquote>
<h3>The Throne is Occupied -</h3>
<blockquote>v. 2 "One sat on the throne"</blockquote>
<p>No name mentioned and No figure described. Only His appearance stated.Not in shape - but in color and flashing brilliancy.</p>
<blockquote>v. 3 "Jasper and a sardine stone"</blockquote>
<p>Crystalline and purple in hue. Royal.cBeautifully bright, red, carnation color.Flashing light or Flames like fire.</p>
<blockquote>I John 1:5 -- God is light&hellip;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hebrews 12:29 -- God is a consuming fire.</blockquote>
<h3>The Throne is Encircled -</h3>
<h4>By a rainbow -</h4>
<blockquote>v. 3 "There was a rainbow round about the throne"</blockquote>
<p>Token of God's covenant. Genesis 9:11,17</p>
<p>An Emerald Rainbow</p>
<blockquote>"Insight like unto an emerald."</blockquote>
<p>"Emerald" - "light green"</p>
<p>The throne is a throne of judgment but not of destruction.</p>
<p>Judgment mingled with grace and mercy.</p>
<p>Life - Promise - Hope - "Emerald"</p>
<p>Over-spanning the appearance of consuming fire.</p>
<h4>By other thrones - v. 4</h4>
<p>"Seats" same word as thrones.</p>
<h3>By Elders -</h3>
<blockquote>"Four and twenty elders sitting"</blockquote>
<p>On the thrones - "round about the throne"</p>
<h4>By Living Creatures - vv. 6-9</h4>

<h3>The Throne is of Judgment</h3>
<blockquote>v. 5 And out of the throne proceeded</blockquote>
<h4>"Lightnings"</h4>
<p>Exodus9:23,28 Exodus19:16</p>
<h4>"Thunderings"</h4>
<p>I Samuel 7:10</p>
<h4>"Voices"</h4>
<p>I Samuel 12:17,18</p>
<h4>"Lamps of Fire"</h4>
<p>It is a flaming indignation.</p>
<p>Isaiah 4:4 Malachi 4:1 I Thessalonians 1:7,8</p>
<p>Lamps of Fire - "Light"</p>
<p>Not of revealing truth,But revealing judgment.</p>
<p>Seven - Completeness - Tribulation"Seven Spirits" - The fullness of the Spirit of God.</p>
<h3>The Throne Has A Pavement - v. 6</h3>
<p>Exodus 24:10 Revelation21:21</p>

<h2>The Four Living Creatures vv. 6-8</h2>
<h3>Who They Are Not</h3>
<h4>They are not angels. (5:8-10; 7:11; Hebrews 2:5)</h4>
<h4>They are not Israel. Israel in History - Revelation 4:1. Also these are from all nations. Revelation 5:9</h4>
<h4>They are not the Apostles, but tribes and people of all the earth.</h4>
<h4>They are not disembodied spirits, but are glorified subjects of grace.</h4>
<p>vv. 8,9 Enthroned - Crowned - Robed</p>
<h3>Who They Are</h3>
<p>Look at their characteristics revealed in the Scriptures</p>
<h4>The first creature was like a lion v. 7</h4>
<h4>The second creature was like a calf</h4>
<h4>The third creature had a face as a man</h4>
<h4>The fourth creature was like a flying eagle</h4>
<p>Four is representative of a larger number.</p>
<p>The Jewish writers tell us that the standard of each tribe of Israel took the color of the stone which represented it in the high priest's breastplate, and that there was wrought upon each a particular figure.</p>
<li>A Lion for Judah</li>
<li>A young ox for Ephraim</li>
<li>A Man for Reuben</li>
<li>An Eagle for Dan</li>
<p>In the Four Gospels we have Christ portrayed in this same manner"</p>
<li>In Matthew the Lion - The King of Israel</li>
<li>In Mark the Ox - The Servant and Sacrifice</li>
<li> In Luke the Man - The Son of Man</li>
<li> In John the Eagle - The Son of God</li>
<p>This is not Christ, but someone like Him - Who do you find in Scripture like Christ?</p>
<p>Christ is the head of the Church. This is His Body. This is His Church</p>
<p>Lion nature - Ox nature - Man's nature - Eagle's nature</p>
<p>This is the Church after it has been perfected in the first 3 -1/2 years of the tribulation.</p>
<h3>They have eyes -</h3>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Before and behind"</blockquote>
<blockquote>v. 8 "Full of eyes within"</blockquote>
<h4>The symbol of intense intelligence</h4>
<p>Looking backward into the past.</p>
<p>Forward into the future.</p>
<p>Inward into the present.</p>
<p>Nothing hid - secrets known.</p>
<h4>Also symbol of unceasing activity.</h4>
<h4>A symbol of continued vigilance.</h4>
<h3>They have wings -v. 8</h3>
<p>Isaiah 6: with twain covered his face</p>
<p>with twain covered his feet</p>
<p>with twain they did fly</p>
<h4>Humility -</h4>
<h4>Redemption - uncovered feet cannot Redeem</h4>
<h4>Freedom -</h4>
<p>Six is the number of man.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:18</p>
<p>Six is 4 -man's worldplus 2 -division or difference, and generally enmity.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1 - Genesis 1:2</p>
<p>First - Perfection</p>
<p>Second - Ruin and desolation</p>
<p>Six is 5 - grace of God</p>
<p>plus 1 - made of none effect by man's addition to it.</p>
<p>Six is 7 - Completeness</p>
<p>minus 1 - man's coming short of perfection.</p>
<p>These are men redeemed - God's perfection.</p>
<p>Man was created on the sixth day. Man has six days to labor. When twelve (the number of governmental perfection) is divided, it indicates imperfection in rule and administration.</p>
<p>I Kings 10:19 Solomon's throne had six steps, and his kingdom was divided.</p>
<p>The twelve loaves were divided into sixes -</p>
<p>Also on the Breastplate of the High Priest -Twelve Tribes were divided tribes.</p>

<h2>The Four And Twenty Elders - vv. 4,10,11</h2>
<h3>Who They Are Not -</h3>
<h4>They are not the Patriarchs</h4>
<p>Revelation 5:9 From every tribe, tongue, people and nation.</p>
<h4>They are not the Apostles. The Apostles were all Jews. They have their part in the foundation. Revelation 21:12-14</h4>
<h4>They are not disembodies spirits. The dead praise not God.</h4>
<p>These are praising God. vv. 10,11</p>
<h3>Who They Are -</h3>
<p>Notice - Where they are located and what they are doing.</p>
<h4>They are located in the throne and sitting on thrones.</h4>
<p>Revelation 4:2,4 Now turn to the 3rd chapter and vv. 20,21</p>
<h4>They are Overcomers</h4>
<blockquote>Sitting on thrones Ch. 3:21; 4:4</blockquote>
<p>They have crowns - v. 10 Crowns promised -</p>
<p>Incorruptible crown - I Corinthians 9:25</p>
<p>Crown of Rejoicing - I Thessalonians 2:19</p>
<p>Crown of Righteousness - II Timothy 4:8</p>
<p>Crown of Life - James 1:12; Rev. 2:10</p>
<p>Crown of Glory - I Peter 5:4</p>
<p>Five in number - Grace and Faith</p>
<p>So then this is a company of people that have heard His voice in the church and have overcome "as He overcame" and He has given them the right to sit with Him in His throne.</p>
<h4>They occupy the closest position to Christ.</h4>
<p>Chpt. 5:6 Reverse the order &mdash;</p>
<h4>They are Twenty-Four in number</h4>
<p>These were the representatives of many others.</p>
<p>The priests and Levites "were set to forward the work of the house of the Lord, was twenty and four thousand." I Chronicles 23:3,4</p>
<p>But they were all arranged in courses of twenty-four.I Chronicles 24:3-5</p>
<p>I Chronicles 25:8-31 There were not more than twenty-four on duty at a time.</p>
<h4>They are Elders -</h4>
<p>The expression is that of time - "Elders". The "Elder" was the ruling man in the original order. They are "Elders" because of their official place.</p>
<p>"Sitting on thrones." They are the first glorified of all the redeemed - the seniors of that celestial city.</p>

<!-- chapter 4 end -->

<h1 id="E">E. Who is Worthy to Open Book of Seven Seals? [5]</h1>


<!-- chapter 5 fix numberings-->

<h1>The Sealed Book, vs. 1-4</h1>

<p>This chapter continues the description of the vision in chapter four. The scene is still the throne, the Elders, the Living creatures.</p>
	<p>This prophecy is in connection with the Church, but not of the Church. Also, this prophecy has its description given in Heaven, but its fulfillment on the earth.</p>

<h2>The Position of the Book</h2>
<h3>v. 1 "In the right hand"</h3>
<p>The place of power.</p>
<h3>v. 1 "Of Him that sat on the throne."</h3>
<p>The place of rule of authority.</p>
<h2>The Characteristics of the Book</h2>
<h3>v. 1 "A book written within"</h3>
<p>A scroll - about judgment</p>
<p>The book contained a revelation and demonstration of things to come at the consummation of this present age after the Rapture of the Church.</p>
<h3>v. 1 "On the backside, sealed with seven seals"</h3>
<p>Reserved judgment. This is not a familiar judgment seen. This is an exceptional administration of justice never before witnessed.</p>
<blockquote>Reserved unto the Day of Judgment</blockquote>
<h2>The Dignity of the Book</h2>
<h3>The question by the angel</h3>
<blockquote>v. 2 "Who is worthy to open the book"</blockquote>
<h3>The answer to the question</h3>
<blockquote>v. 3 "No man in heaven, or in earth, neither under the earth,was able to open the book, neither to look therein."</blockquote>
<p>Notice also that this "strong" angel is not able to open the book either. (powerful, forceful, boisterious, mighty)</p>
<h3>John's reaction to this fact</h3>
<blockquote>v. 4 "And I wept much"</blockquote>
<p>Because of three things -</p>
<h4>None found "worthy" to "open the book"</h4>
<h4>None found worthy to "read the book"</h4>
<h4>None found worthy to "look thereon"</h4>
<h2>The Time of the Opening of the Book</h2>
<p>After the Rapture, 4:1</p>
<h2>The Purpose of the Opening of the Book</h2>
<p>To release the judgments of God on the earth</p>

<h1>The Nature of the Victor, vs. 5-7</h1>
<p>The Book's Opener is presented as a Victor!</p>
<blockquote>Revelaton 5:5 - And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</blockquote>
<h3>A lion</h3>
<blockquote>v. 5 "Lion of the tribe of Judah"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Root of David"</blockquote>
<p>Being of the Root of David, his prowess is of no coincidence. It is by PROMISE and therefore Divine appointment.</p>
 <blockquote>Revelation 22:16 - I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</blockquote>
<p>He is both ROOT and OFFSPRING of David! By nature, Jesus is the ROOT of David and by divine incarnation he is the offspring of David. David, the greatly revered and legendary king of Israel, received his authority from this same Jesus!</p>

<h3>A lamb</h3>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Stood a lamb"</blockquote>
<p>A lion in power, but a lamb in nature. Notice:</p>
<h4>He is standing</h4>
<p>Because He is not dead, but alive.</p>
<p>Because He is accepted.</p>
<p>Because of us, on our behalf.</p>
<h4>He is a sacrificial lamb</h4>
<blockquote>v. 6 "A lamb as it had been slain"</blockquote>
<h4>His has perfect power and strength</h4>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Having seven horns"</blockquote>
<h4>He has perfect and universal intelligence</h4>
<blockquote>"And seven eyes"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Which are the seven spirits of God"</blockquote>
<h4>He has unlimited rights v. 7</h4>

<h1>The Response to The Victor's Worthiness, vs. 8-14</h1>
<h2>Of the Four Beasts and of the Twenty-four Elders v. 8</h2>
<h3>Fell down before the Lamb</h3>
<h3>Having every one of them harps</h3>
<h3>And golden vials - stored up prayers</h3>
<h3>Sing a new song</h3>
<h2>What Their Song Is About</h2>
<h3>Worthy by right of being</h3>
<p>He is Lord - Jehovah God</p>
<h3>Worthy by right of character</h3>
<blockquote>I Peter 1:19 A lamb without spot or blemish</blockquote>
<h3>Worthy by right of obedience</h3>
<p>He earned the right</p>
<blockquote>"For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred" etc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Luke 23:41 - And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</blockquote>
<h2>Of the Angels vv. 11,12</h2>
<h2>Of All Creation v. 13</h2>

<!-- chapter 5 end -->

<h1 id="F">F. The 7 Seals [6; 8:1]</h1>

<h1>Introduction to the Seven Seals</h1>
<p>This scene of the breaking of the Seven Seals follows after the translation of the Bride, for the elders already have their crowns, (Rev. 4:10). Also this scene comes after the Rapture of the Church. We read of the rapture in type in Rev. 4:1. The Four Beasts or Four Living Creatures which represent "the Body of Christ" or the Church are at the Throne, also.</p>
<h2>The Similarities of the First Four Seals</h2>
<h3>The Opener of the Seals. "The Lamb" vs. 1</h3>
<p>In Chapter 5, it was dramatically shown that only the Lamb had the power to take the Book and the power and authority to open the book.</p>
<h3>The Seals Opened</h3>
<h4>John saw something vs. 1.</h4>
<p>John saw something before the thunder. Like a flash of lightening before the storm.</p>
<h4>He heard something.</h4>
<p>He heard - "As it were the noise of thunder".</p>
<h3>The Command Given. "Come"</h3>
<h4>The Command is Not to John. He is there in the Throne.</h4>
<h4>The Command is A call into Action. A release of Judgment.</h4>
<h4>The Command is Repeated. In regard to the first four seals.</h4>
<h3>The Source of the Command.</h3>
<p>"One of the Four Beasts". The Elders are involved with things concerning heavenly subjects (ch. 5 &amp; 7) and The living Creatures are directly involved with things that are Earthly.</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:2 -- Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</blockquote>

<h2>The Particulars of the Seven Seals</h2>

<h3>The Number Seven</h3>
<p>There are Seven Seals in Number. This is indicative of the COMPLETENESS of this administration.</p>
<p>The Seals are arranged in two distinct groups - first there are four and then there are three. A Worldly number that is followed by the heavenly number. These Seven Seals are a Divine judgment on a wicked world</p>
<h3>The First Four Seals are Distinguished by Horses and Horsemen.</h3>
<p>Horses are symbolic pictures of the Power of the Almighty.</p>
<blockquote>2 Kings 6:17 -- And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. [Job 39:19-25; Zech. 1:8-10; Zech. 6:2-5]</blockquote>

<p>Four Spirits of the heavens from Zechariah 6:</p>
<blockquote>Zechariach 6:1-8 -- And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</blockquote>

<p>"There was given unto him a great sword." "Rhomphaia " "Megas" -Sword &mdash;Large</p>

<h2>The Opening of The Third Seal. 6:5-6</h2>
<h3>The Commission of The Third Rider. vs. 5-6</h3>
<h4>A Black Horse -</h4>
<p>Black is the symbolic color of dearth and famine.
Jer. 14:1-2; Lam.4:8-10 5:10.
Notice verse nine &mdash;
Famines are the scenes of violence and tragedy.
II Kings 6:25-29; Luke 21:23; Matt. 24:19.</p>
<h4>"A Pair of Balances in His Hand."</h4>
<p>Balances are used for exact weighing Indicating that there is a scarcity of food. vs.6Bread by weight always implies scarcity. Lev.26:26; Eze.4:16.When corn is in abundances; it is sold by gross measures and no attention is paid to a few hundred grains.</p>
<h4>The Settling of Prices. vs. 6</h4>
<p>This also adds to the fact of scarcity of food.
"A Measure of Wheat."The word, measure, used here is the Greek word, choenix (which would be about a quart). Davis Dictionary of the Bible. A measure or quart of wheat would be the ordinary allowance of wheat to a man for one day's scanty subsistence.</p>
<p>The Usual Price.The usual price of a "choenix" of wheat was one-eighth of a "penny" , or denarius. The price named in the text, being eight times this, indicating further the greatness of the famine.</p>
<p>The Value of the Penny.In the A.S.R.V. the word "penny" is translated "shilling." A shillingin the Greek denotes a coin worth about eight pence, or nearly seventeen cents. Probably the Roman Denarias a coin worth about 17 cents. This was the amount a soldier received for a days pay. Also in Matt. 20:###The ordinary wage for a full days labor, would be (17 cents) a penny. All that a man can do is earn the bread that he will use himself. What if he has a family?</p>
<p>The Barley By Price. Food of horses and cattle - And also the days subsistence of a slave."Hurt not the oil and the wine" A matter of grace. In judgment God remembers mercy.</p>

<p>Death, and Hell followed him.</p>
<h3>Its Power -</h3>
<p>Power over a fourth part of the earth . Of the total population of the earth one forth will die.</p>
<h3>Its Manner of Death.</h3>
<h4>Kill with sword</h4>
<h4>With hunger</h4>
<h4>With Death (Pestilence) Jer. 38:2; Eze.6:11; Matt. 24:7; Luke 21:10-11</h4>
<h4>With Beasts Ezek. 14:21</h4>

<h1>Opening of Seals 5 and 6</h1>
<h2>The Opening of The Fifth Seal 6:9-11</h2>
<p>The manifestations under the breaking of this seal differ, in some respects, from the four preceding. There is no expression from the Living ones. There are no 'horsemen or horses. And the burden of the description is exhibited in the results rather than in the processes. Yet, everything belongs to the same general category of trial and suffering. Under this fifth seal, we have added, bloody persecution of those who hold and testify to the truth. The good as well as the bad suffer the hour of trial. Hence, this fifth seal is the picture of Persecution and Martyrdom.</p>
<p>There are no voices of command from Heaven under this seal, and no messengers despatched from the throne; the reason, bloody persecutions of God's servants come from beneath -not from above. It is the devil who is the murderer. It is Dragon that makes war with the saints. These are martyrs of this particular period of time. Martyrs of the Judgment.</p>
<h3>The Cause of Their Martyrdom. vs. 9</h3>
<p>It is not death, but the cause of death, which constitutes a martyr. Millions upon millions perish under the preceding seals, but they are not called marytrs. The cause for which these were slain makes them martyrs.</p>
<h4>"Slain for the Word of God"</h4>
<p>What they may have rejected in the past, now hold to be the very Word of God .</p>
<h4>"And for the testimony which they held. "</h4>
<p>(Steadfast adherence to the faith) Probably the testimony of all that was happening. Plagues, disorders, and horrors around them. It will be more than the hardened hearts of scorning unbelievers can bear.</p>
<h3>Their Estate at That Time vs.9</h3>
<h4>They are "Soul s" Their slaying is not the end.</h4>
<h4>They can be seen. "Saw" Invisible to men in the flesh, seen in the spirit.</h4>
<h4>They can speak. vs. 10 "They cried with a loud voice."</h4>
<p>It is wrong to say the dead is in a state of non-existence, unconsciousness, or oblivion. Matt. 10:28; kill body - not soul Luke 20:38; Not the God of the dead. Luke 16:19-31 Rich man and Lazarus. Luke 23: 43 "To-day" Consider the experiences of dying believers,and their testimonies.</p>
<h3>The Message They Convey. vs. 10 (last part)</h3>
<h4>It is a cry addressed to the throne. "0 Lord, holy and true"</h4>
<h4>It is a cry for fulfillment. It has started why the delay.</h4>
<h3>The Response To Their Message. vs. 11</h3>
<h4>They were given White Robes.</h4>
<p>They were approved and precious</p>
<h4>They were to rest awhile</h4>
<p>They were to rest in Him</p>
<h4>The reason for their rest.</h4>
<p>There were others God wanted to make it. "Until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. "</p>
<h2>The Opening of The Sixth Seal. 6:12-17</h2>
<h3>Fearful Physical Events</h3>
<h4>"A great earthquake"</h4>
<p>A great shaking -applied to the shaking of a fig tree- everything will be shaken.</p>
<h4>"Sun became black "</h4>
<p>"As sackcloth of hair"</p>
<h4>"The moon became as blood "</h4>
<p>Joe12:31; Matt 24:29; Mark 13:24-26; Luke 21:25; Acts 2:19-21</p>
<h4>"The Stars Fall "</h4>
<h4>The Effect on Earth of These. Starts vs. 14</h4>
<h3>The Effects of these Events on Humanity. vs. 15-17</h3>
<h4>The General Condition of Society</h4>
<p>Kings -great men -rich men - chief captains etc.</p>
<h4>The Security is Gone.</h4>
<p>"hid themselves"</p>
<h4>They realized the source of these events. vs. 16</h4>
<blockquote>Hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</blockquote>

<h1>Opening of The Seventh Seal (8:1)</h1>

<p>Chapter 7 details the the sealing of the 144,000 and the palm-bearing multitude before completing the Seals with the seventh and final seal.</p>

<h2>Details of the Silence</h2>

<p>The Lamb is &quot;He&quot; Who breaks or opens the seal. In response to the breaking of the seal there is silence. This silence appears to be a &quot;calm before the storm&quot;.</p>

<p>This silence takes place &quot;In Heaven&quot; and lasts for half an hour (&quot;Hemioron&quot; &quot;Hemi&quot;: Half plus &quot;Hora&quot;: Hour).</P>

<h2>Meaning of the Silence</h2>

<p>This seal and the resulting silence are quite mysterious. We can consider the definitions of the words used, but any other suggestings to their meaning is speculation.</p>

<p>In Revelation 8:1, "Silence" (siqe) means hush, voluntary stillness or refusal to speak. It is a silence of intense interest and awful expectancy with reference to the results of the breaking of the seventh seal.</p>

<p>As the following section of Revelation makes several strong allusions to the different parts of temple worship. For example:</p>
	<ul class='bullets'>
		<li>Altar and incense in 8:3.</li>
		<li>Four horns of the altar in 9:13.</li>
		<li>Temple of God in 11:1.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Adam Clarke makes a comparison of this silence and the prayerful silence of the people who waited while the priest went in to burn incense in the holy place.
 </p>
 
 <blockquote>Luke 1:10 -- And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</blockquote>

<h1 id="G">G. 144,000 [7:1-12]</h1>

<h1>The Sealing of the 144,000. 7:1-8</h1>
<p>The judgment has begun, and has progressed through a number of its most important stages, but grace has not entirely departed. The sealing must take place before the judgment can continue. vs. 1-3</p>
<h2>Who The 144,000 Are vs. 4</h2>
<p>"Of all the tribes of the children of Israel. " They are Jews- not the Church. The sealed ones are one company, complete in itself; and the Elders and Living ones are another company complete in themselves. John sees them all at the same time, the one in the presence of the other.
12 thousand from each tribe: (Two tribes are not mentioned. Which two are they? Why not possibbly?</p>
<h3>Judah -confession or praise of God</h3>
<h3>Reuben- behold a Son or viewing the Son</h3>
<h3>Gad -a company or a troupe</h3>
<h3>Asher- blessed or happy</h3>
<h3>Naphtali- obtained by wrestling</h3>
<h3>Manasseh -making to forget</h3>
<h3>Simeon -hearing or obeying</h3>
<h3>Levi -adhesion or cleaving to</h3>
<h3>Issachar -a reward</h3>
<h3>Zebulon- habitation or dwelling</h3>
<h3>Joseph -added or addition</h3>
<h3>Benjamin- Son of the right hand</h3>
<p>Look at them all together. Confessors or praises of God, looking upon the Son, a company of blessed ones, wrestling or fighting for what is ahead, forgetting these things that are behind, hearing and obeying the word, cleaving unto the reward of a heavenly habitation, an addition to what has already happened, sons of the day of God's hand, or the day of His Power, begotten in the extremity of the age.</p>
<p>One reason the names of Dan and Ephraim is left out. Dan means a judge. These 144,000 are not judges, and never become judges. Ephraim -double fruitfulness, or increase, or growth by multiplication. These are a fixed number 144,000. These are Israelites, living in the period of the judgment, who confess and look to Christ as their Messiah.</p>
<h2>The Time of Their Sealing</h2>
<h3>It takes place on earth.</h3>
<h3>After the opening of the Sixth Seal Chpt. 7:1</h3>
<h3>Before the opening of the Seventh Seal vs. 3</h3>
<h2>The Nature of Their Sealing</h2>
<h3>It is a mark Of some sort. The impression or mark of a seal or signet. Conspicuous and observable.</h3>
<p>In the Old Testament the Mark of Circumcision
In Egypt the Mark of the Blood
Rahab the Mark of the scarlet thread .
Anti-christ puts a mark on his followers.</p>
<h3>In their foreheads -vs. 3</h3>
<p>Similar to Eze. 9:4</p>
<h3>It is something Supernatural. vs. 2</h3>
<p>"The seal of the living God"
As all believers are sealed by the Lord. Eph. 1:13; Eph. 4:30; II Cor. 1:22</p>
<h2>The Agent of Their Sealing</h2>
<h3>By an angel vs. 2</h3>
<p>"I saw another angel"</p>
<h3>Coming from the East -</h3>
<p>The rising of the Sun. "Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise."</p>
<h2>The Basis of Their Sealing -</h2>
<p>They are "The Servants of God" vs. 4.</p>


<h1 id="H">H. Innumerable Redeemed [7:13-17]</h1>

<p>The Palm&ndash;Bearing Multitude 7:9&ndash;17</p>
<p>It was from heaven that John beheld the shaking and the sealing;. and from the same point of view he sees this company. The question of the Elder is what we want to deal with first. vs. 9 &quot;Who are they? and whence came they?&quot;
Some believe they are the early Christians victorious over the sorrows and persecutions. Some believe they are the Christians under Constantine. To decide who they are look at:</p>

<h2>Who They Are Not</h2>
<h4>They are not the highest class of the redeemed.</h4>
<p>The Elders &quot;Sit&quot; &ndash;these &quot;Stand&quot; vs. 9 &quot;Stood before the Throne&quot;. The Elders have Crowns and Thrones &ndash; These have neither. The Elders appear in their places &ndash; And have received their reward before judgment. These came to the throne after judgment has started. The Elders were &quot;counted worthy to escape all these things&quot; [Luke 21:36]. These were in the Judgment. &quot;Out of the great tribulation. &quot; vs. 14</p>
<h4>They are not the Church</h4>
<p>The Four Living creatures make up the Church. The Rapture of the Church takes place before the Great Tribulation. These are taken out of the Great Tribulation.</p>
<h4>They are not the sealed ones &ndash;</h4>
<p>The sealed ones were a definite number. These are uncounted and numberless. vs.9 The sealed ones were of Israel. &quot;These are out of every nation, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.&quot;</p>

<h2>Who They Are</h2>
<h3>They are redeemed people.</h3>
<p>They were once sinners. They are now saved. Vs. 10 &quot;Salvation to Our God, &quot; &quot; And to the Lamb.&quot;</p>
<h3>They are people living on the Earth during the Judgment vs. 14</h3>
<p>&quot;Come out of Great Tribulation. &quot; Some believe because of the number that they are from all ages&ndash; Come out of Great Tribulation.</p>
<h3>They are people who were unprepared, and were &quot;left&quot; when the Rapture took place.</h3>
<p>There were ten virgins in Matthew 25. Five were wise and five were foolish. The five foolish were left outside the marriage door.</p>
<blockquote>Matthew 25:11-13 &mdash; Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</blockquote>

<p>There are no crowns or thrones, but only palms. They did not hear the gentle voice of the Spirit, and therefore were not rewarded in the same way those that overcame and escaped the great tribulation. But they did learn their lesson through great trial and are given great promises of blessing.</p> 
<blockquote>Isaiah 26:9,10 &mdash;&hellip;for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</blockquote>
<p>Some will learn righteousness, but not all will turn to God even in such terrible judgment.</p>
<blockquote>Daniel 12:10 &mdash;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</blockquote>

<h2>Their Eternal State</h2>
<h3>They are in heaven. Lazarus &ndash;The Richman</h3>
<p>Where God is etc.</p>
<h3>They are &quot;before&quot; the throne. vs. 9</h3>
<p>They&apos;re not in the throne but; They are before it.
&quot;Serve in the temple&quot; vs. 15</p>
<h3>They are &quot;clothed in white robes.&quot;</h3>
<p>The garments of saints.</p>
<h3>They have &quot;palm branches in their hands&quot; the ancient people &ndash;the feast of Tabernacles. Palms are Symbolic of Victory. Also&ndash; vs. 10</h3>
<h3>They shall hunger no more, vs 16 &quot;neither thirst any more.&quot;</h3>
<h3>They shall not be burnt &quot;neither&hellip;sun&hellip; nor&hellip; heat&quot; vs. 16</h3>
<h3>They shall be Fed. vs. 17</h3>


<h1 id="I">I. 7 Angels and 7 Trumpets [8:2-13; 9-10; 11:14-19]</h1>


<!-- Angels fix numbering -->
<h1>A Vision of Angels (8:2-5)</h1>

<h2>The Seven Angels, vs. 2</h2>

<p>They "stood before God" and are in harmony with his will and work. They are God&apos;s ministers and are in obedient submission to His will. They stand ready to do as He decrees and bear God&apos;s authority as His servants.</p>

<h3>They Are of Particular Rank and Distinction.</h3>
<p>They are of a Divine Order of angels. Angelic beings are not of one and the same grade or office.</p>

<h4>The Sons of God, in general, came before Him only at appointed times. Job 1:6;</h4> 
<h4>Yet, Jesus spake of some angels who "do always behold the face of their Father which is in heaven." Matt. 18:10.</h4>
<h4>In Colossians 1:16, Paul lists &quot;dominions, principalities, and powers&quot; as being among the celestial orders. </h4>
<h4>Daniel 10:13 speaks of some chief princes.</h4>
<h4>1 Thessalonians 4:16 and Jude 9 refer to arch angels.</h4> 

<h3>They Are Seven in Number.</h3>
<p>The Jews were familiar with seven angels of Divine Order by the names: 1) Gabriel, as he said to Zacharias; "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God." 2) In Luke 1:19 Michael is another, as he is ranked with Gabriel in the book of Daniel. In the book of Enoch, these are the names of the angels who watch: 3) Uriel, 4) Raphael, 5) Raguel, 6) Michael, 7) Sarakiel</p>

<h3>They Are Servants.</h3>
<p>They are standing. This is the position of service. The twenty-four elders are going to be sitting. The sitting position speaks of the dominion and rule of the heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.</p>
<p>Yet &quot;standing in the presence of God&quot; is to be above all other servants. In Esther 1:4, The 7 Persian princes who &quot;saw the kings face&quot;, were the highest officers of the realm, and next to the monarch in rank and power.</p>

<h3>They Were Given Seven Trumpets.</h3>
<h4>Trumpets are expressive instruments and God gave special directions in the use of the trumpet. The word &quot;trumpet&quot; can be found in 61 verses of the Bible. (Exodus 19:13; Levitucs 25:9; Psalm 47:5)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are an emblem of war. (Numbers 10:9; Jeremiah 4:19)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets were for the convocation of the people, and the moving of the camps of Israel. (Numbers 8)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets proclaimed the great festivals. (Numbers 10:10; Leviticus 23:24; 25:9; 2 Chronicles 29:27)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are used to announce royalty. (1 Kings 1:34,39; 2 Kings 9:13)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are associated with the majesty of God. (Ex. 19:16)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets were used in the overthrow of the ungodly. (Josh. 6:13-16)</h4>

<h2>The Mystery Angel, vs. 3-5</h2>
<p>John sees seven angels &quot;which stood before God&quot; and then he mentions &quot;another&quot; angel. Who is this &quot;angel&quot;?</p>

<h3>The Nature of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;Another&quot; (allos) means different. This same phrase is used in Revelation 7:2; 10:14-17; 18:1; 20:1. The word "angel" means messenger of God.</p>

<h3>The Office of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>
<p>This &quot;angel&quot; is the Angel of the Lord. He offers the prayers of saints. You cannot give something unless you have it. He had to receive them to give them. Angels do not receive worship, but &quot;the Angel of the Lord&quot; does. (Gen. 16:7,13; Ex. 3:2-5; Joshua 5:13-15).
</p>
<p>There are many passages in which the expression the &quot;angel of God&quot; or &quot;angel of the Lord&quot; is definitely for a manifestation of God Himself. Compare Genesis 22:11-12; 22:15-19; Exodus 3:2-6.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of The Angel</h3>
<p>Scripture itself presents us with details that tell us that this Angel is the Lord:</p>

<h4>The First Proof - He had &quot;a Golden censer&quot;</h4>
<img src='/images/censer.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>This instrument was used by the priests, in the ministry of the worship of God. However, it was used only by the high priest in the holy place. This indicating our great High Priest who is now entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. We remember that that this is a scene in Heaven.</p>

<h4>The Second Proof -He offers the Prayers of Saints before God.</h4>
<img src='/images/prayers.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>vs. 3 &quot;All Saints&quot;. There is no record of such an office found in the scripture as being assigned to angels, however, there is record of this office being executed by the Lord Jesus.
Eph. 2:18 I Tim. 2:5 Heb. 7:25; Heb. 13:15 I Peter 2:5 I John 2:1;</p>

<h4>The Third Proof - He casts fire on the earth.</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/fire.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>Verse 5 tells us the fire is taken from the altar.</p>
<blockquote>Luke 12:49 -- I [Jesus] came to send fire upon the earth. </blockquote> 
<p>This fire is a symbol of the Divine Presence and Power. (Exodus 3:2 Deuteronomy 4:36 Psalm 50:3 97:3; Isaiah 66:15-16; Acts 2:3) 
<p>This fire is an Instrument of Divine Judgment. The action indicated here by the casting into the earth speaks of judgment. (Genesis 19:24; Leviticus 10:2; Numbers 11:1; 16:35; Malachi 4:1; 2 Kings 1:10; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 2 Peter 3:10)</p>

<h4>The Fourth Proof - To offer incense with prayers. vs. 3-4</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/cross.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>&quot;Given unto Him much Incense.&quot;It was given to Him through merit. For without His death and atoning work coupled with His pure and Holy life, there would be no force in prayer. God hears us because of Him. </p>

<p>The Compounding of the incense is given with great precision in the Old Testament. It was to be made of specific ingredients in exact proportion (Exodus 30:34). Any compound that did not meet the exact specifications given by God was to be rejected as strange incense (Exodus 30:9). It was to be tempered with salt as it was holy and was never to be used for ordinary purposes. Any one who tried to duplicate this incense for themselves was to be cut off from his people (Exodus 30:38).</p>

<h3>The Events Related To the Angel&apos;s Actions. vs. 5</h3>
<p>Notice carefully the order:</p>
<h4>Flash of Light - The Release</h4>
<h4>The Thundering Voice - The Messenger</h4>
<h4>The Shaking of the Earth - The Results</h4>

<h1>Introduction to The Seven Trumpets (8:6-11:19)</h1>
<p>We are looking at the final blasts of judgment upon a wicked and rebellious world.</p>

<h2>The Martyrs are Remembered</h2>
<p>The seventh and final seal has been broken from the Sealed Book (8:1). The prayers of all the saints have been accepted before God (8:3,4). Remember now,God has promised to avenge the martyred saints.
</p>
	<blockquote>Revelation 6:9-11 -- And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Matthew 18:6-7 -- But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</blockquote>
	
	<p>These martyred Believers are an important part of the judgments of God on the earth. It is not that the world has rejected these saints so much as they have rejected Christ.</p>

<blockquote>I Samuel 8:7 -- And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luke 10:16 -- He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</blockquote>

<p>Every Christian martyr is a testimony to the grace of God and a witness against this sinful world. The Greek word &quot;martus&quot; (martyr) means a witness or record. (see Matthew 18:16; Mark 14:63; Luke 24:48; Acts 1:8,22; 2:32; Hebrews 12:1; I Peter 5:1; Revelation 1:5.)</p>

<blockquote>Luke 24:46-48 -- And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48 And ye are witnesses of these things.</blockquote>

<h2>The Trumpets of Judgment Are Sounded</h2>

 <p>Time has now come for the final judgments.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 8:6 -- And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</blockquote> 

<p>Not all seven were to sound at once, but varied events followed each trumpet as it was sounded. God has prearranged the order and time for each to sound. There are none that are alike but there is a progression of greater judgment with each trumpet.</p>

<h1>The Sounding of Trumpets One, Two, Three and Four</h1>

<h2>The Sounding of The First Trumpet. Vs.7.</h2>
<h3>The nature of the judgment.</h3>
<p>"Hail and Fire mingled with blood." Micah 7:15; Jer. 23:7-8.
They were like the plagues of Egypt. Ex. 9:23-28; Joel 2:30.
"Hail" "Fire""Blood"Could it be the Blood that they rejected, will judge them.</p>
<h3>The Action of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>"They will cast upon the earth" "Ballo" cast; to throw; hurl (a violent or intense action).</p>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>The third part of threes was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.Every field and meadow stripped of its growing crops, and bloody and putrid blackness spread over all the world. This has somewhat of a correspondence to an earlier stage, under the sixth seal. Not to hurt earth, the sea, nor the trees, till the servants of God were sealed. The sealing now has been accomplished, the prohibition is lifted. (Revelation 7:3)</p>

<h2>The Sounding of the Second Trumpet. Vs. 8-9.</h2>
<h3>The Nature of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>Like a burning mountain " As it were a great mountain burning with fire." It looked like a burning mountain. It is not literally a mountain/volcano, but the image of a meteor.</p>
<h3>The Place of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>The Sea is the place of this plunging mass. "Was cast into the sea: " It would seem as if some particular sea was meant. If so, what sea? The Mediterranean Sea, which means the midland sea, or the middle of the earth. Around this sea the greatest recorded events of the world and of the Church have been enacted, and which is the central sea of all history, both sacred and profane.</p>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<h4>"The third part of the sea became blood."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life died."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the ships were destroyed." Burned, sunk, or dash ashore. Ex. 7:20; Psa. 78:44; 105:29; Hosea 4:1-3; Zeph. 1:3; Isa. 2;12-1###Here John sees the fulfillment of these predictions.</h4>

<h2>The Sounding of the Third Trumpet, Vs. 10-11.</h2>
<h3>The nature of the Judgment.</h3>
<p>"There fell a great star from heaven," - This star falls out of heaven. "Burning as it were a lamp." "Torch," - This star has a name. The Name of the star, vs 1 "The star is called wormwood""Wormwood" -"Absinthe " is a bitter; intoxicating, and poisonous herb. It produces convulsions, paralysis, and death.</p>
<h3>The Place of the Judgment. vs. 10</h3>
<p>"It fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. " Jer.9:13-15.</p>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<h4>vs. 11 "The'third part of the waters became wormwood. "</h4>
<h4>"Many men died of the waters."</h4>
<h4>"Because they were made bitter" - "Poisonous "</h4>

<h2>The Sounding of The Fourth Trumpet, vs. 12 -13.</h2>
<p>It doesn't say what it is - it only says what it effects and what those effects were.</p>
<h3>The Place of The Judgment vs. 12.</h3>
<h4>"The third part of the Sun was smitten ."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the Moon."</h4>
<h4>"The third part of the Stars."</h4>
<h3>The Effects of the Judgment.</h3>
<h4>"The third part of them were darkened."</h4>
<h4>"The day shone not for a third part of it."</h4>
<h4>"The night likewise.</h4>
<p>Isa. 13:9-11; Eze. 32:7-8; Joel 2:10,30-31; 3:15; Zeph. 1: 14-16; Matt. 24: 29; Luke 21: 25.</p>
<h3>The Announcement of Greater Judgment, vs. 13.</h3>
<p>Is a .pre-announcement of the general character of what is to come, a fore warning of greater judgment to come.</p>
<h4>A Flying Messenger - "An angel flying through the midst of heaven."</h4>
<h4>Proclaiming with a loud voice: "Saying with a loud voice"</h4>
<h4>Terrible Judgments, "Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth."</h4>


<h1>The Sounding of The Fifth Trumpet - Rev. 9:1-11</h1>
<p>The fifth trumpet is different in character from the preceding four. All are blasts of judgment, and all belong to the "Great Day of the Lord." Thus far, the trumpets have blown only for the objects of physical nature, and wrought their effects through disturbances in the material world. But the trumpet now before us goes beyond the physical world and calls into action quite other agencies. The doors of separation between the earth and the prison of evil spirits are opened.</p>
<h2>What the Star Is - vs. 1.</h2>
<p>This is not a meteor for this star is an intelligent agent, he has ascribed to him distinctive characteristics that could not possibly be ascribed to anything but a living being.</p>
<h3>vs. 1 - "To him was given the key"</h3>
<h3>vs. 2 - "He opened the bottomless pit"</h3>
<h3>vs. 3 - "There came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth. "</h3>
<p>We must conclude that this is not a material but a spiritual star.It is a "Fallen Star"</p>
<h2>Who The Star Is - Isa. 14:12.</h2>
<p>Vs. 11 Says the "star" is the king over them, whose name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name "Apollyon"destroyer; devil; Satan.</p>
<h2>The Time of His Fall -</h2>
<p>At the time of the original creation, he fell into the condemnation of the devil. But in Revelations he fell from heaven to Earth. Just prior to the Rapture of the Church, the Devil is cast out. Rev. 12:7-9.</p>
<h2>The Key Given -</h2>
<h3>Key speaks of Power - And authority to use that power. Peter was given the keys to the kingdom the power to open the door of the Gospel. Christ had the keys of death and hell at His side.</h3>
<h3>The key is "given - Cannot go beyond what he is permitted. Evil would override the world.</h3>
<h2>What The Key Is For -</h2>
<p>"The Bottomless Pit." - The Release of the Locusts.</p>
<h2>What The Locusts Are -</h2>
<h3>Their Nature.</h3>
<p>Locusts have no king, Prov. 30:27.
They are supernatural, angelic beings.vs. 11.Jude 6; II Peter 2:4.</p>
<h3>Their Forms -</h3>
<p>"like unto horses"-"like unto men"-"have hair like a woman,"-"have teeth of lions" - " have breastplates of iron," - "have wings, " - "have tails"</p>
<h3>Their Intelligence</h3>
<p>They have a certain amount of intelligence. vs. ###Commands are given to them.</p>
<h3>Their Power -</h3>
<p>Is limited -vs. 4; The extent of their power is to horrify and torment, vs. 5.</p>
<h3>The Duration of their torment, vs. 5 and 10.</h3>

<h1>The Sounding of the Sixth Trumpet - Rev. 9:12-21</h1>
<h2>The Voice of this Judgment.</h2>
<blockquote>"I heard a voice."</blockquote>

<h3>The location of the voice-</h3>
<h4>"From the four horns of the golden altar."</h4>
<p>The place of intercession, prayer, petition and mercy. (Rev. 8:3-5; 1 Kings 1:50-53 )</p>
<h4>"Which is before God."</h4>
<p>This is a Divine judgment. As it comes from the presence of God, it has His sanction.</p>

<h3>Who the Voice Adresses</h3>
<p>"To the sixth angel" - vs. 14 The Sixth Angel sounds and The Voice responds.</p>

<h3>What the Voice was Saying.</h3>
<blockquote>Revelation 9:14 -- &hellip;Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</blockquote>

<h2>The Release of the Angels.</h2>
<h3>The Nature of the Angels.</h3>
<h4>They are fallen and bound angels. (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6)</h4>
<blockquote>2 Peter 2:4 -- For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</blockquote>

<h4>They are high ranking angels. They were over others.</h4>
<blockquote>Ephesians 6:2 -- For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</blockquote>

<h3>The Purpose of the Release.</h3>
<h4>To carry out judgment.</h4>
<p>"To slay the third part of men." vs. 15</p>
<blockquote>Isaiah 4:1 -- And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man&hellip;</blockquote>

<h4>To give men what they desired.</h4>
<p>They worshipped devils - vs. 20. God lets devils destroy them.</p>

<h3>The Time of their Release.</h3>
<p>Prepared for a specific hour, day, month, and year. For example: 9:00 am, 12th day of April 2014.</p>

<h2>The Vision of Horses and Horsemen - vs. 17.</h2>
<blockquote>"I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them."</blockquote>

<h3>Their Number (vs. 16)</h3>
<p>200,000 x 1,000 = 200,000,000. Two hundred million.</p>
<p>To place the size of this host in perspective consider the size of the worlds armies today. In 2013, The top five countries with the largest armies were China (2,285,000), United States of America (1,458,219), India (1,325,000), North Korea (1,106,000), and Russia (1,027,000).</p>

<h3>Their Nature</h3>
<p>These are no ordinary horses, but are executers of these four fallen Angels. These horses fulfill the will of these four fallen Angels and act on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Their Description- vs. 17.</h3>
<h4>"Having Breastplates of Fire." In Ephesians Breastplates of Righteousness -Here breastplates of fire&mdash;a symbol of Judgment</h4>
<h4>"Having breastplates of Jacinth" According to Elliott, the jacinth color, is the dark purple or blue the color of smoke.</h4>
<h4>"Having Breastplates of Brimstone."</h4>
<p>Brimstone is sulphur. A horrible burning.</p>
<h4>"Their heads were as the heads of Lions" - Heads speak of Authority or Rule - Lions speak of Power.</h4>
<h4>"Out of their mouth issued fire and smoke and brimstone." vs. 17.</h4>
<p>"By these three was the third part of men killed"</p>
<h3>The Place of their Power- vs. 19.</h3>
<p>"Their power is in their mouth and in their tails."</p>
<h2>The Condition of the World -</h2>

<h3>Unrepentant - vs. 20.</h3>

<p>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not.</p>


<h3>Worshipers of Demons.</h3>

<p>That they should not worship devils.</p>

<h3>Idolatrous - Idolatry in various forms: Idols of gold, silver, stone and wood.The world Church at this time is still flourishing, however she shall be destroyed by the ten kings that reign with the Anti-christ.</h3>
<h3>Wholesale Murders - vs. 21. Murderers will run Rampant.</h3>

<blockquote>Neither repented they of their murders. [plural].</blockquote>

<h3>Practice of Fornication</h3>
<p>"Porneia" - Harlotry - adultery - incest
Unlawful lust of either sex.

 <h1>The Cloud-Robed Angel (10:1-11)</h1>
 <img src="/assets/revelation/sun-through-clouds.jpg"
 id="sun-through-clouds"> <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <blockquote>Revelation 10:1 -- And I saw another mighty angel come
 down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his
 head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars
 of fire:</blockquote>
 <p>The scene of the "Cloud-Robed Angel" is still part of the sixth
 trumpet that began in 9:13. It is not until 11:14 that the sixth
 trumpet (the second woe) is accomplished.</p>
 <h2 style='clear:both;'>The Angel</h2>
 <h3>The Title Suggests Deity. - "another mighty angel"</h3>
 <h4>"another" </h4>
 <p>This Angel is distinct from the other angels mentioned as we have
 seen in Revelation 7:2 and 8:3. We should also note that the
 phrase "another angel" is also used several times in chapter 14
 and once in 18:1, but especially chapter 14 does not seem to give
 the same sense of the exceptionalism of the angel as in the other
 passages.</p>
 <h4>"mighty"</h4>
 <p>&nbsp;John the Revelator uses the title "another angel" in 9
 verses, but "mighty" (ischuros) angel is used only here in 10:1
 and in 18:21 where a mighty angel announces and describes the
 judgment of Babylon the Great. "Ischuros" (greek word) is used in
 7 verses by John and can be found in 25 verses throughout the New
 Testament. It is adjective describing what He is and not what He
 has. He is mighty,&nbsp; powerful,&nbsp; strong and boisterious.
 "Ischuros" can also be used to give a comparative sense: stronger,
 mightier, more powerful. </p>
 <blockquote>Matthew 3:11 -- I indeed baptize you with water unto
 repentance: but he that cometh after me is <b>mightier </b>than
 I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with
 the Holy Ghost, and with fire: </blockquote>
 <blockquote> Mt 12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's
 house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the <b>strong </b>man?
 and then he will spoil his house. </blockquote>
 <blockquote>1 Corinthians 10:22 -- Do we provoke the Lord to
 jealousy? are we <b>stronger </b>than he?</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Hebrews 6:18 -- That by two immutable things, in which
 it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a <b>strong </b>consolation,
 who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</blockquote>
 <h3>The Particulars Suggest Deity</h3>
 <p>Inspection of the particulars of the Angel suggest He is more
 than just "a messenger", but is "The Messenger". More convincing
 of the deity of this angel than His actual title ("another mighty
 angel") is the details of his description.
 </p>
 <h4>"clothed with a cloud"</h4>
 <p>Clothing speaks of Condition (Sinful or Righteous). For examples
 see: 2 Chronicles 6:41; Job 8:22; 29:14; Psalm 35:26; Psalm 104:1.
 In Ezekiel chapter one, the cloud and rainbow was a description of
 the glory of God.</p>
 <blockquote>Ezekiel 1:28 -- As the appearance of the bow that is in
 the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
 brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of
 the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and
 I heard a voice of one that spake.</blockquote>
 <p>Clouds also speak of Mystery (Indicating Deity). For examples
 see: Exodus 24:16;40:34; Lev. 16:2; Matt. 17:5.</p>
 <p>Clouds also speak of Judgment�. As clouds are indicators of a
 storm so the cloud here indicates a storm is coming! The storm is
 the judgments of God.
 </p>
 <h4> "a rainbow was upon His head"</h4>
 <p>The Rainbow is a Covenant Sign. God said in Genesis 9:13 that "I
 do set my bow in the cloud". The presence of this rainbow is sign
 of mercy which appears over the head of Him that is robed "with a
 cloud" which is sign of Judgment. In Judgment God Remembers Mercy!
 
 </p>
 <h4>"His face was as it were the sun"</h4>
 <p>In the first vision - Rev. 1:13-20. Mal. 4: 2 "Sun of Righteousness" Acts 26:13 "Above the brightness of the sun." </p>
 <h4>"His feet as pillars of fire"</h4>
 <p> This is an image of pureness and judgment. It is also an image
 of steadfastness and glorious majesty.
 </p>
 <h4>"And He had in his hand a little book open:"</h4>
 <p>Only ONE had proven worthy to open the book and release its
 seals!</p>
 <blockquote>Revelation 5:5 -- And one of the elders saith unto me,
 Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of
 David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven
 seals thereof.</blockquote>
 
	
	<h2>The Acts of the Angel </h2>
	
 <h3>Taking Possession</h3>
 <p>As described in Deuteronomy 11:24, He is taking possession of the earth and its people. "He set His right foot upon the sea". The sea or water is often people in Scripture (see Rev. 17:1, 15). "And His left foot on the earth". The earth is the place where the people dwell. Who is the world under dominion to now? Under the rule of Satan. (John 12:31; Luke 4:6; II Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2: 2) The Devil is in control
 now, but Jesus is soon to take over. He sets His foot upon the sea, and the land, and takes hold as His own.</p>
 <h3>Proclaiming Victory</h3>
 <p>"Cried with a loud voice," Not the cry of defeat or fear. But of
 POWER, VICTORY and TRIUMPH; John 11:43-44 At the grave of Lazarus.
 Could it be that He is Awakening the Dead? "As when a lion
 roareth." He is known as "The lion of the tribe of Judah" Judah-
 Praise -Victory -shouting in victory. Song writer said -"That
 breaks every chain." Also the Prophet said - "The Lord shall roar
 out of Zion " Jer. 25:29-31</p>
 <h3>Signaling Fulfillment.</h3>
 <p>"lifted up his hand to heaven" vs. 5. a signal of Readiness or
 Victory.</p>
 <blockquote>And sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever&hellip;
 &hellip;that there should be time no longer." vs. 6. </blockquote>
 <p>There should be "No more delay" (Amplified Version). There is
 reason now for delay. II Peter 3:9-10.</p>
 <h2>The Response to the Angel, vs. 3 "and when He had cried"</h2>
 <h3>Indication of (More) Judgment.</h3>
 <p>More severe. "Seven thunders uttered their voices" Seven
 (Complete) Thunders or Judgment.</p>
 <h3>Personality Ascribed.</h3>
 <p>They speak -"Uttered their voices" John was going to write what
 he heard.</p>
 <h3>A Command Given, vs. 4.</h3>
 <p>Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write
 them not.</p>
 <h2>The Scroll in the Angel's Hand, vs. 2a; 8-11.</h2>
 <h3>It is a Revelation, vs. 7.</h3>
 <p>"The mystery of God should be finished (complete, execute,
 conclude) as He hath declared to His servants the prophets."</p>
 <h3>The Nature of the Revelation.</h3>
 <p>It had been a mystery. "He had in His hand a little book." The
 Book mentioned in Rev. 5; No man could open it -no one else.</p>
 <p>It is a mystery that has been solved . "A little book open" The
 mystery that had been hid for ages is now revealed.</p>
 <h3>The Facts Related To The Revelation.</h3>
 <h4>"Go and take the little book". Faith is the factor that receives
 from God. Faith takes hold of truth.</h4>
 <h4>"Which is open" Was closed now opened .</h4>
 <h4>"In the hand of the Angel" In His hand -earned -merited.</h4>
 <p>Based on the merits of Calvary. "a Lamb as it had been slain"
 Chp. 5:6 We can only take the open Book - The Revelation of God -
 from the hand of Christ.</p>
 <h3>The Effects of The Revelation.</h3>
 <h4>"In my mouth sweet as Honey" </h4>
 <blockquote>Psa. 119:103 -- How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
 yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</blockquote>
 <h4>"My belly was bitter." Bitter in Experience, vs. 11 gives us a
 hint as to why it is bitter: persecution.</h4>

<h1 id="J">J. Measure the Temple of God [11:1-2]</h1>

<h1>The Reinstating of the Jew (11:1-2)</h1>
<p>This chapter is a continuation of chapter 10. In 10:9, John ate the little book and was told he must prophesy again. In 11:1, John is given a reed. The measuring of the temple takes place during the Judgment of the Sixth Trumpet.</p>

<p>The history of the Jewish people is a message to the church first of warning and then of comfort:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Warning</li>
	<p>The warning is that no one will escape Divine judgment if they take for granted His blessing and count it as their inherent privilege instead of being conditional on a covenant relationship. The Jews so proudly boasted in Jesus' day "we are Abraham's Children" while their hearts were FAR from God (Isaiah 29:13). They backslide from being a covenant people to a people of entitlement.</p>
	
	<li>Comfort</li>
	<p>The comfort is that God is specializes RESTORATIONS! The Jews like an unfruitful branch were cut off and the Gentiles grafted in, but God has always had a mind to restore a repentant Israel. God's prophets have warned both of the dispersion of the Jews and their eventual reinstatement. This reinstatement includes their re-establishment in Palestine, but most importantly includes their restored relationship with God.</p>
</ul>

<h2>The Instrument Given</h2>
<h3>A Reed</h3>
<p>The instrument of judgment given to John is "A Reed" (Kalamos). This is not a "frail reed" as in Matthew 11:7, but is an instrument of measurement as in Isaiah 44:13, Amos 7:7 and Ezekial 40:5.</p>
<p>This reed is a "canon", "Law" or "rule". 3rd century church leader Origen used the word canon to refer to the "rule of faith". We can find the greek word "kanon" used five times in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 10:13,15,16; Galatians 6:16; Philippians 3:16).</p>

<blockquote>Philippians 3:16 -- Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</blockquote>

<p>Note that this is "A Reed" and not "The Reed". It is "A Law/Rule" and not "The Law/Rule". God is not instructing John to measure according to the Old Testament Law and Forms, but the standard of measurement is the New Covenant which God has written on hearts and not tables of stone. (Hebrews 8:8-13; Jeremiah 31:31-34 )</p>

<blockquote>2 Corinthians 3:3 -- Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</blockquote>

<h3>Like Unto a Rod</h3>
<p>This measuring reed is "like unto a rod" (Rhabdos) meaning a stick or wand, scepter (Matthew 27:9) or an instrument of chastisement (Matthew 27:30). Both Christ (Isaiah 11:4; Revelation 19:15) and the Overcomer (Revelation 2:27; 12:5) are described as ruling with a "rod of iron". </p>

<p>Although John is witnessing a fuller office of rule for the Overcomer, in one sense the rulership of the saints in the world is already evident. A look at the laws of America alone reveals the great influence of God, His Word and His people in the creation of these laws. 
</p><p>The Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, our currency, all 50 state constitutions and the Pledge of Allegiance all affirm the sovereign authority of God. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution both are premised on the need of the authority of law and not the authority of a man which is a Scriptural principle (Isaiah 8:19,20).

<h2>The Instrument's Purpose</h2>
<p>In 11:1, The angel commands John to "rise and measure". "Rise" (eqeiro) means to awaken, rouse or raise.</p>

<h3>To Set A Standard.</h3>
<p>Measuring indicates limits and the laying down of borders, dimensions, or boundaries. The "reed" is the standard of comparison or measurement. There are no gray areas or guesses here. Absolute determination and inspection is made.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the measuring is to answer the question how does the temple compare to the standard? Such inspection reveals changes if there are any. The command to measure suggests important changes have been made. The old has been done away and a new is coming into view. Jews had been cast off for their backslidings, but now God will bring them back (Romans 11:11-27). (Note: The Jews trapped in Judaism are confident in their bondage because they measure with an old/expired reed.)</p>

<h3>To Declare Ownership.</h3>
<p>Measuring also indicates appropriation. As when a person purchases a property and detailed surveying is made so here what is measured is claimed or owned (Joshua 1:3). God is marking His territory!
</p>

<blockquote>Hebrews 8:10 -- &hellip;I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</blockquote>

<h2>The Articles Measured (vs. 1)</h2>

<h3>"The Temple of God"</h3>
<blockquote>I Peter 4:17 -- For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</blockquote>

<p>There is both an earthly and spiritual Jerusalem or "City of God". (Nehemiah 11:1,18; Isaiah 52:1; Matthew 4:5; 27:52-53)</p>

<p>It is the earthly temple being measured here. No human judgement is needed for the heavenly temple. In Revelation 21:15 we see a "Golden Reed" is used to measure the New Jerusalem. This Golden Reed is a Divine measurement. As it is built by God according to His own blueprint, the measuring in 21:15 reveals its perfection. The measuring in chapter 11 results in judgement.</p>

<p>This temple in Revelation 11:1,2 will be judged and given to the Gentiles for a 3-1/2 years. (New Jerusalem will never be given to be trodden under foot.)</p>

<h3>"The Altar "</h3>
<h4>The Measuring reminds Israel of The demands and commands of God in regard to the "Altar."</h4>
<h4>Temple worship restored, vs. 1.</h4>
<h4>Sacrifice Restored. Dan.8:11-13; 11:31; 12:11.</h4>

<h3>The Worshippers</h3>
<h4>The Jew will return to worship. "That worship there"</h4>
<h4>The Jew will turn to God. Rom. 11:21-25.</h4>
<h2>That Which Is Not Measured.</h2>
<blockquote>vs. 2 "The court which is without the temple leave out" "Measure it not "</blockquote>
<h3>It is given unto the Gentiles for a time."42 months" Isa. 1:27; Zech. 13:9; 14:1-4.</h3>
<h3>God does not accept what will not meet the measurement.</h3>
<h3>The Judgment of the Gentiles is reserved for the future.</h3>


<h1 id="K">K. Two Witnesses [11:3-13]</h1>

<p>These two witnesses are not presented to John in vision. They are described to him by the glorious Angel, who is the Lord Jesus Himself. The account that is given here is not John's but Christ's, given in His own words.</p>

<p>Who, then, are these Two Witnesses? The connection in which the account is given may help to give us the answer. These Witnesses come upon us suddenly, in the midst of the scenes of the Judgment, and at a time when Christ is ready to take possession of the earth.</p>

<h1>Introduction to Chapter 12</h1>

<h2>A Division of Thought</h2>
<p>Chapter 12 is a dividing point in the book of Revelation. Chapters 1-3 prophetically describe the entire church age. Chapters 4-11 start and continue from the Rapture in the middle of the 7 years of tribulation. Chapter 11 concludes with the Seventh Trumpet and the climax of Christ&rsquo;s return to the earth at the end of the 7 years of tribulation. Chapter 12 resets back to the church age (the time before both the Rapture and the Translation) for further detail and prophetic truth.</p>

<img src='/assets/revelation/review-of-chapters-1-11.png' id='review-of-chapters-1-11'/>

<p>Though Chapters 1-11 have progressed linearly, to this point, there are gaps in &lsquo;explanation&rsquo;. For example, Chapter 3 ended with Christ&rsquo;s appraisal of the Church being anything but complementary. Yet, chapter 4 graciously places the Church in the presence of God enjoying a great honor. Something has happened between the end of chapter 3 and the beginning of chapter 4 where the church is Raptured. Further explanation of this is given in the proceeding chapters of our study beginning with Chapter 12. Further details are given in Chapters 12-22 regarding the First 3-1/2 Years of Tribulation, concerning the wrath of God during the Second 3-1/2 Years of Tribulation and the Divine plan following that season of judgment.</p>

<h2>A Continuation of Prophecy</h2>
<p>It is important to remember that this is a book of prophecy and not history. Seven times Revelation refers to itself as words of prophecy.(Revelation 1:3; 11:6; 19:10; 22:7; 22:10; 22:18; 22:19)</p>

<p>A prophetic warning before judgment is an absolutely necessary part of how God does business. As a matter of Divine policy, before God would send judgment as contained in the book of Revelation, God would first give warning through His prophets. (Compare Daniel 12:4 with Revelation 22:10, I Corinthians 2:10, and Revelation 2:17.)</p>

<blockquote>Amos 3:7 &mdash; Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</blockquote>

<h2>The Importance of This Revelation</h2>

<h3>It was a sign.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;appeared a great wonder&rdquo; &ldquo;Semeion&rdquo; Miracle -Sign -Token -Wonder John 2:11; 4:45; 20:30; I Cor. 12:12; Matt.26:48;Luke 2:12; Rom.4:11; II Cor. 12:12; (II Thess.3:17 Token or Sign).</p>
<p>John uses the word &lsquo;semeion&rsquo; (a sign) here for the first time in the Revelation. The intention of a symbol is to communicate meaning beyond the symbol itself. A sign is a picture or symbol of something else. It is that &lsquo;something else&rsquo; which is the true subject of contemplation.</p>
<p>When interpreting Revelation it is necessary to understand that there is both literal and figurative language. Knowing when the writer uses which is key to understanding this book. When the Scripture is absent from a figurative expression or a figurative setting we should not try to make it figurative, but we should take it literal. Here John says,&rdquo; And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven.&rdquo; Something very mysterious is happening in the heavens. By John&rsquo;s statement we know the scenes in Revelation 12 must be taken symbolically or figuratively and not literally.</p>

<h3>It was an important sign.</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Megas&rsquo; (great) means extraordinary and important. Not only is this a sign, but this is &ldquo;A great sign&rdquo;. This is a great, important, extraordinary, and remarkable event that needs to be studiously considered.</p>
<p>How and where this sign appears should alone tell us that it is very important and should therefore arrest our attention:</p>
<h4>It was Seen in the Spirit.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; John was transported through time and space.</p>
<h4>It was Seen in Heaven.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;A great wonder in heaven.&rdquo; That is, it was revealed to him in the heavenly realm. </p>

<p>The meaning of this wonder is apart from the natural world. It is something of a heavenly order. It&rsquo;s not a natural thing; it&rsquo;s not in the natural order. It&rsquo;s not of the earthly, but of the heavenly.</p>

<h1>The Sun-Clothed Woman (12:1,2)</h1>
<blockquote>A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.</blockquote>
<p>Who is this woman?</p>

<h2>Who the woman is not.</h2>
<h3>She is not Mary &mdash;</h3>
<p>Mary was of a very lowly and poverty stricken condition. Can we really interpret properly the lowly state of that little peasant woman that brought Jesus into the world, with this prophecy, fulfilling this position of a woman clothed with the sun and moon under her feet and crowned with twelve stars?</p>
<p>It was a woman that brought a man-child into this world, but was that man-child caught up to God as a child? Was Jesus just a child when He went to Heaven? &ldquo;And her child was caught up unto God and to His throne.&rdquo; This does not speak of a man 33 years old, fully matured, fully grown and fully developed. If John wanted us to understand that this was Jesus, I&rsquo;m sure he would have said that the Lord Jesus was caught up to the throne. Also, Mary had passed away a long time before this vision.</p>
<p>Now, let us look back into the first chapter of Revelation. I think there are some keys for interpretation there. Rev. 1 :3 says &ldquo;Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy.&rdquo; &ldquo;This prophecy&rdquo; has to do with prophetic utterance, foretelling something that is to come to pass. This book was written sixty years or more after the ascension of Christ. Remember, he is speaking of prophecy, something that is yet to take place. Also, in Rev. 1: 1 &ldquo;Things which must shortly come to pass.&rdquo; That is these things have not come to pass. This is not a record of history, but this is something that is to come to pass. Again, in Rev. 4: 1 &rdquo; And I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.&rdquo; When Christ was caught up to God, this Revelation was not yet written and it was said at the time of writing these were future. Also, is Jesus the only one that will rule the nations with a rod of iron? Rev.2:24-27.</p>
<h3>She is not Israel &mdash;</h3>
<p>There is another school of thought, and probably this is the more prominent teaching today. This is the belief that this is literal Israel. Israel was an earthly heritage. An earthly people- An earthly kingdom - Earthly possessions. The only time anything is mentioned to Israel with the heavens is Abraham&rsquo;s seed being as the starts of the sky, and then, only of those that are believers. Rom. 9:6-8.</p>
<p>Israel as a nation is pictured in the Scriptures, especially in the book of Hosea, as an unfaithful wife and as a harlot on the streets. As you look at Israel today you can see that this is her condition rather that in the place of honor. Also, Israel was clothed with the law which speaks of judgment, darkness, and death. This woman is clothed with the &ldquo;sun&ldquo;.</p>
<p>Some say this must be Israel because of what Isaiah said - Isa. 66:6, Look closely at the two texts. They are the opposite of each other.</p>
<h3>She is not the world church &mdash;</h3>
<p>A look at the condition of the church universally will reveal that she is not arrayed in this fashion - but, is worldly, ungodly, and devilish. How can an unholy thing produce a holy thing that is to be caught up to God and to His throne?</p>
<h2>Who the woman is</h2>
<p>The key to help interpret is in Rev. 1:4 &ldquo;John to the Seven Churches.&rdquo; Are we left to interpret whom John is speaking to? &ldquo;The Seven Churches&rdquo; The whole church age. John, when referring to something else, indicates this -when there is an absence of explanation -doesn&rsquo;t it only make sense that he is speaking then to the Churches?</p>
<p>A woman in scripture - Rev. 17 - False here. Rev. 12 - True Church. The woman is the Church. It is a revelation of Christ and the Church. Remember -&rdquo; A great wonder in heaven.&rdquo; This is the Church - the Body of Christ. Eph. 1 :22,23</p>
<p>We see not a fulfillment but a beautiful type and foreshadowing of the birthing of the Man-child in the account of Mary and the birth of Christ in Luke The Church will prepared for her work by the Word of God.</p>
<p>The Angel Brought a Word Luke 1:28; Eph. 1:6</p>
<p>The Word brought was that she was &ldquo;highly favored&rdquo; of the Lord. This means she was &ldquo;endued with grace&ldquo;. God was with her and she was accepted by Him. What made her &ldquo;favored&rdquo; or &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by God? (1) She was dedicated to the Lord [Jewish custom to dedicate their children to God by taking them to the temple when they are young.] (2) She was separated [vs. 27 She was a virgin] (3) She was a Believer though limited in her belief [vs. 29 &ldquo;troubled&rdquo; diatarasso &mdash; beyond her ability to believe.]</p>
<p>Her question in verse 34 &ldquo;How shall this be&rdquo; was answered before she knew it- she was brought a Word and this Word must be germinated by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost Has to Germinate the Word</p>
<p>Luke 1:35 &hellip;The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Power&rdquo; is that &ldquo;dunamis&rdquo; which is the supreme, infinite power of God. This was the same power with which God created the worlds. This work of perfecting the Believer is an IMPOSSIBLE one with us, but not with God!</p>
<p>Luke 1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>
<p>Mary Had to Fully Surrender to the Word</p>
<p>Luke 1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Word&rdquo; in verse 38 is the Greek word &ldquo;rhema&ldquo;. &ldquo;Rhema&rdquo; is the revealed Word of God. Mary fully surrendered to the: (1) Written Word&mdash;Whatever WAS said, (2) Spoken Word&mdash;the preached Word and the (3) Living Word&mdash;Follow the Lamb!</p>
<blockquote>I Peter 1:4-5 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</blockquote>


<h1>The Man Child,12:2-5</h1>
<img src="/assets/crown.png" id="crown">
<p>&ldquo;The Man Child (12:2-5)&rdquo; is a continuation of the &ldquo;great wonder&rdquo; John saw in 12:1. Remember, as it is a &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; (sign, token, symbol) it demands our contemplation and careful consideration. The language used is intended to be interpreted figuratively. Also, in our previous study, we stated that the woman in verse one is the Church. Let us focus now not on the woman so much but the fact that she is with child and she gives birth to a &ldquo;man child&rdquo;.</p>
<img src="/assets/revelation/crows.png" id="manchild_crows">
<p>If there is a message that the devil hates, it is the message of the Man Child. This message threatens all the devil has accomplished and would like to do regarding humanity. The devil is persistent in his efforts to snatch away any seed of the message of the Man Child.</p>

<blockquote>Matthew 13:19 &ndash; When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth not, cometh the wicked one, and catch it the way that which was sown in his heart.</blockquote>

<h2>The Identity of the Man Child</h2>
<p>If the woman is the church, who is the Man Child? </p>
<h3>Some believe the Man Child to be Christ. (i.e., <a href=&rdquo;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Scofield&rdquo;>Scofield</a>)</h3>
<p>Consider some objections to this theory:</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Prophetic</h4>
<p>This chapter is part of the vision that was given to John the beloved 60 years after the ascension of Christ. The entire vision is a revelation of things that were &ldquo;to come to pass&rdquo; AFTER it was given (Revelation 1:1; 4:1). How then can the translation of this man child refer to the ascension of Christ, which occurred six decades before this vision?</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Nativity</h4>
<p>Christ came down from heaven at birth. The Man Child is caught up to heaven.</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Crucifixion and Ascension of Christ</h4>
<p>If this Scripture refers the ascension of Christ, why should the figure of a child, which the devil cannot kill (the Man Child is not harmed by the devil), &ldquo;caught up unto God, and to his throne&rdquo; be used to symbolize the ascension into Heaven of a full-grown man, whom the devil did kill? (Christ surrendered His life and He died.)</p>
<h3>The Man Child is a product of the Church.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The woman is in travail to bring forth&rdquo;) the woman which is the church is producing sons. </p>
<h3>The Man Child is a fully mature son.</h3>

<blockquote>Ephesians 4:13&mdash;Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hebrews 5:14&mdash;But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</blockquote>
<p>The Man Child is the Overcomer in Revelation 3:21 and the Bride of Christ in Revelation 19:7.</p>

<h2>The Revealing of the Man Child</h2>

<h3>The Seed</h3>

<p>&rdquo;And she brought forth&rdquo; &ndash; tikto &ndash; to produce from seed. This &ldquo;seed&rdquo; is the Word of God presented much through the efforts of God's ministers which are God's gifts given to the saints (Ephesians 4:11-13).</p>
<p>The seed is the revealed Word or the Word of God that has been made alive by the Spirit of God.</p>

<h3>The Birth</h3>

<p>To bring forth the child is to reveal (bring to light or manifest) the child.</p>

<blockquote>Romans 8:17-19&mdash;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1 Peter 1:3-5&mdash;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</blockquote>

<h3>The Pain</h3>
<p>Revealed with great pain. Vs. 2 &ldquo;cried&rdquo; travailing in birth. Pain to be delivered.</p>

<blockquote>Romans 8:23&mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</blockquote>

<h4>The Man Child will be brought forth through intercessory prayer.</h4> 
<p>quot;Cried&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;krazo&rdquo; &ndash; meaning to call aloud, to cry out, or any inarticulate cries. (Romans 8:26-27) This is not a pious recital of prayers, but is a travailing in prayer is a mother travails in giving birth. The prayer must be earnest and must be in faith. &ldquo;Waiting&rdquo; in Romans 8:23 is&rdquo;Apekdechomai&rdquo; meaning to fully or eagerly expect.</p>

<h4>Revealed under great persecution. Vs. 4</h4>

<p>There will be pain &ldquo;basanizo&rdquo; meaning to put to the test. There will be trials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&rdquo; The devil will fight harder against this truth than any other truth that has been revealed because the Man Child takes his place in heaven. Vs.8.</p>

<h3>The Time</h3>
<p>The Man Child is revealed in the last time. The 11th chapter ends with Christ ruling the kingdoms of this world which are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign for ever and ever. Chapter 12 brings us back to the third chapter and at the end of the church age. Luke 21:28; one Peter 1:3&ndash; The time of the revealing is just before the tribulation. The church is still on the earth and will face 3 -1/2 years of tribulation&mdash;vs. 6 &ldquo;in the wilderness&rdquo;. Also, the Man Child is revealed before the Church is perfected. Verse 14</p>
<h2>The Nature of the Man Child.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A Man Child&rdquo;&rdquo;Arrhen&rdquo; or &rdquo; Arsen&rdquo; - means male. It has to do with manhood and not gender.</p>
<h3>Manly characteristics -heroic virtues.</h3>
<p>They are strong -not weak.They are true -not false.Not full of hypocrisy.</p>
<h3>Overcomers, vs. 5</h3>
<p>.&rdquo;Who was to rule&rdquo; Rev. 12:11; 2:26,27; 3:21.The &ldquo;Overcomer&rdquo; is promised to sit with Him on His throne. These are &ldquo;caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Humble, vs.11.</h3>
<p>Did not combat the devil in their own strength. II Cor. 10:4.</p>
<h2>The Characteristics of the Man Child.</h2>
<h3>A student of the Word.</h3>
<p>To confess the Word, you must know the Word, vs. 11.&rdquo;by the Word of their testimony&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A believer in the Word.</h3>
<p>To confess the Word, you must believe the Word They believed in the blood of the Lamb because of the Word.Vs. 11 &ldquo;overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A lover of the Word.Vs 11</h3>
<p>&ldquo;And loved not their lives&rdquo; They loved the Word more than their lives.</p>
<h2>The Development of the Man Child.</h2>
<p>There is a development here. The Scripture indicates a process&mdash;salvation, Holy Ghost Baptism and fully mature son. </p>
<h3>Conceived.&rdquo;Gaster&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 2 &ldquo;With child&rdquo; (Born-Again Believers)</p>
<p>Conceived by the Word. The Word of God (like seed) is being planted in the Church by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<h3>Child.&rdquo;Teknon&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 4 &ldquo;Developing&rdquo;(Holy Ghost Baptized Believers)</p>
<h3>Son.&rdquo;Huios&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 5 &ldquo;Matured&rdquo; (the Bride of Christ, Overcomers)</p>
<p>In type in Gen. 2:21, Adam and Eve. Gen. 5:24 Enoch - Methuselah - Noah.The Word of truth (like seed) is being planted in the heart of the Church by His Spirit. The Body of Christ is not yet fully-grown or mature but God is nourishing it.He will bring it forth. </p>
<p>There are a lot of babes in the church. There are a lot of children in the church. There must be a maturing of sons &ndash; fully grown. 
A perfect man. Matthew 5:48; Ephesians 4:12-13.
&rdquo;Huious&rdquo; is a fully matured son (Hebrews 5:14) that is in a position to receive full inheritance (Galatians 4:1-2; I Peter 1:4) and full power (Ephesians 1:13-14).</p>
<h3>The Position of the Man Child</h3>
<p>As a child, the Believer does not differ from a servant (Galaitans 4:1). </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nepos&rdquo; infant, non-speaking, immature, childish. As the Believer develops and matures in Christ there awaits for him an &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; or &ldquo;positioning as son&rdquo;. This adoption is what we are &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; (Romans 8:23) for: &ldquo;the adoption&rdquo; &ndash;the placing or positioning of sons (&ldquo;huiothesia&rdquo;). </p>
<p>God does not adopt sinners into the family of God. The sinner must be born again into the family of God (John 3:7). The sinner is begotten by the Word and the the Spirit (John 3:5). Adoption is a term involving the positioning of Believers as sons. It is not a putting into the family by spiritual birth, but a putting into position of sons. Notice the Adoption the Apostle is speaking of (Romans 8:23) is yet future at his time. This positioning is a reward for MATURITY and OVERCOMING.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:5 &hellip; who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>Because of the prophecies about Christ in Psalm 2:9 and Revelation 2:26-27 many believe that Revelation 12:5 is talking only about Christ.</p>
<blockquote>Psalm 2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>

<p>But, Christ promised a position on His Throne with those that will overcome even as He overcame. The manchilde goes to the Throne of God.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 12:5 &hellip;caught up unto God, and to his throne.</p>

# The Great Red Dragon - 12:3,4
> Rev. 12: 3, 4 &quot;And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;
![](/assets/revelation/devil-word-cloud.png)
In our text is given &quot;another wonder&quot; (sign) that is to be interpreted after the same manner as the preceding &apos;sign.&apos; It is not a &apos;literal&apos; representation of the devil as he actually looks to the eye, but is &apos;figurative&apos; of the devil&apos;s characteristics. The great red dragon is symbolic of the devil&apos;s destructive and murderous character.
This wonder is a symbol of a fierce, hostile, evil power (satan) with which the Church has, and is, and must yet contend. This evil force is determined to hinder the progress of the Church and destroy her hopes.
## The Dragon
### The Image or &quot;Sign&quot; is that of a &quot;Dragon&quot;
Dragon means &apos;huge serpent&rsquot. Dragons have often been the embodiment of the fear of the unknown. In Greek mythology, these giant serpents often guarded the far and unexplored parts of the earth.
> DRAGON &mdash; &quot;The dragon, figured prominently in ancient and medieval mythologies as an embodiment of evil principle. It has been superstitiously dreaded and even worshipped, as in China, where it is the imperial emblem. It is commonly represented as a large winged serpent, with a crested head and powerful claws. In classical mythology, a dangerous, often a supernatural serpent.&quot; &mdash;Standard Dictionary
The word _dragon_ is derived from the Greek word _drakōn_. This Greek word means &apos;to see&apos;. Ancient Greeks believe the _drakōn_ had incredible sight and could spot hiding prey no matter how well hid.
There is no doubt as to the significance of the dragon symbolizing the devil as the dragon is a symbol of a power that is harmful, wicked, evil, tyrannous and murderous. The devil is a hideous blood-thirsty monster, always &quot;seeking whom he may devour&quot; (1 Peter 5:8).
Understand, this dragon is a terrible creature that delights in attacking, terrifying and devouring. It is especially determined to attack and destroy the truth of God&apos;s Word.
> Matthew 13:19&mdash;&quot;When any one heareth the Word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.&quot;
> Luke 8:12&mdash;&quot;Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.&quot;
> 1 Peter 5:8&mdash;&quot;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:&quot;
### It is &quot;A Great Dragon&quot;
While the picture in general is that of a dragon, it is altogether peculiar and different from the common dragon. It exceeds the ordinary idea in size and bulk, and every dragon feature is greatly magnified. The dragon is &quot;great&quot; in its evil accomplishment and great in its power to kill. It is &quot;a great&hellip; dragon.&quot;
&quot;Megas&quot; &mdash; &quot;Great&quot;means mighty of external form, mighty in degree and intensity, mighty of rank (whether of persons or angels) of all those who have positions of authority and power
Here is a being that has dared to set himself against the Almighty God. This &quot;dragon&quot; is trying to overcome Him and take over the universe by taking from the Creator His own creation.
#### The devil has the power of death.
He has the power to put to death.
> Heb. 2: 14 - Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
The devil&apos;s ability to cause and create terrible afflictions is seen throughout the Bible, but the devil&apos; power to kill was greatly limited by Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The Law of God itself demanded death of EVERY soul that sinned. Now, because Christ paid the debt of death for the Believer, the devil has lost any legal claim to lives of the repentant. There is no such security for the unrepentant sinner.
> Although the devil had the power of death, it was through death that Christ defeated him! &mdash;James Reynolds Sr.
#### The devil has the ability to deceive.
He is great in his ability to deceive and destroy. The devil has the ability to deceive the whole world.
> Revelation 12:9&mdash;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
What a power of deception must lie in him who deceives angels to follow him!
### It is &quot;A Great Red Dragon&quot;
![](/assets/revelation/red-hexagons.png)
It is &quot;red,&quot; seemingly for two reasons. The first is to enhance his terrible appearance. The second is suggestive of his murderous, destructive character. It is a peculiar color.&quot;Purrhos&quot; &mdash; &quot;Red&quot; &mdash; fiery &mdash; bloody &mdash; the color of blood &mdash; murder. This was the color of the horse whose rider was to take peace out of the world, and bring about terrible war and bloodshed.
> Revelation 6:4&mdash;&quot;And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.&quot;
Jesus said the devil was a murderer from the beginning, and could not tell the truth.
> Jn. 8:44 &quot;Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.&quot;
> &quot;There has never been a murder, but he (the devil) caused it.&quot;&mdash;Dr. J. A. Seiss
Fiery red also indicates the destructive and cruel nature of the dragon. The dragon is burning like fire with rage and out of control with malignant hatred against that which is righteous and godly.
### It has &quot;Seven Heads&quot;
Seven is a number of completeness, or fullness. This indicates the fullness of evil and wickedness. Dragons ordinarily were given one head, but this dragon possesses &quot;seven heads.&quot; Two heads would indicate confusion. Here there are seven heads. &quot;Seven heads&quot; also reveal a total and complete state of confusion. The head is the seat of governing power and it implies rule and control. The fact there are seven heads should be understood in the same sense that we read of &quot;the seven Spirits of God&quot; &mdash; a manifold unity. We have here in these heads the symbol of the entire imperial reign and rule of this world from the beginning of time to the end of this present age.
Three times the Lord calls the devil &quot;&hellip;the prince of this world.&quot;
> Jn. 12:31 &quot;&hellip;Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&quot;
> Jn. 14:30 &quot;&hellip;For the prince of this world cometh&hellip;&quot;
> Jn. 16:11 &quot;&hellip;Because the prince of this world is judged.&quot;
The Apostle Paul called him the &quot;god of this world.&quot;
> II Cor. 4:4 &quot;&hellip;The god of this world hath blinded the minds&hellip;&quot;
> 1 John 5:19 &quot;&hellip;The whole world lieth in wickedness.&quot;
> 1 John 5:19&mdash;&quot;The whole world (around us) is under the power of the evil one.&quot; (The Amplified Bible)
The image before us presents the dragon having dominion over the governments of this world. Therefore, through these world powers, he sets himself against the kingdom of God and all that is good and right.
### It has &quot;Seven Crowns upon his Heads&quot;
The &quot;heads&quot; being &quot;crowned&quot; would indicate at least to some degree, that he has been successful in his diabolical attacks.
#### Successful in Deceiving &mdash; A Crown
> Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon&hellip; called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;&quot;
#### Successful in Dividing &mdash; A Crown
> I Cor. 11: 18 &quot;&hellip;There be divisions among you&hellip;&quot;
#### Successful in Defeating &mdash; A Crown
> Matt. 24:12 &quot;And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.&quot;
#### Successful in Denying &mdash; A Crown
> Jude 4 &quot;&hellip;Denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;
#### Successful in Devouring &mdash; A Crown
> I Pet. 5:8 &quot;&hellip;Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:&quot;
#### Successful in Delaying &mdash; A Crown
> Dan. 10:13 &quot;But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me&hellip;&quot;
#### Successful in Deforming &mdash; A Crown
> Lk. 13:11 &quot;&hellip;A woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.&quot;
Lk. 13:18 &quot;&hellip;Whom satan hath bound&hellip;&quot;
He is the destroyer of both body and soul. He seduceth and misleads the whole world, promising everything including peace and prosperity, so that he can more effectively enslave and destroy.
### It has &quot;Ten Horns&quot;
&quot;Ten&quot; signifies the perfection of Divine Order. This is in contrast to that of an evil, wicked being, so this would be in reverse of the Divine Order; complete and total disorder.
&quot;Keras&quot; &mdash; &quot;Horns&quot; are symbolic of strength, power, dominion and kingly rule &mdash; kings and their kingdoms.
> Dan.7: 24 - And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&hellip;;
Dan. 8:20 - The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings&hellip;
These &quot;horns&quot; are not symbols of good rule but of evil power to hurt, wound, afflict and destroy. The forces which destroyedPalestinewere referred to as &quot;four horns&quot; in Zech. 1: 18&mdash;21 They scattered, oppressed, injured and destroyed the people of God. Likewise, the &quot;horns&quot; of the dragon scatter, divide, oppress, torment, injure, afflict, destroy and kill the believers in Christ.
### It has A Tail
> Rev. 4: 12 &quot;&hellip;His tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:&hellip;
His tail is certainly one of the most striking features of the dragon. It swings through heaven drawing a third part of the stars and casts them to the ground. These &quot;stars of heaven&quot; are very particular stars. They are not literal stars, for the whole scene is a &quot;sign.&quot; These were the angelic hosts, fitly called stars by reason of their brightness, shinning beauty and glory.
> Job 38: 4&mdash;7 &quot;Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
When Lucifer fell and became the devil, he was able to deceive and draw away a third part of the angels with him.
> Jude 6 &quot;&hellip;Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation&hellip;
> 2 Peter 2: 4 &mdash; &hellip; God spared not the angels that sinned&hellip;
His tail is symbolic of his ability to deceive not only angels, but also humanity (including Believers). The devil has been successful in deceiving or &apos;drawing away&apos; many saints of God. Many who secured a home in Heaven through Christ's atonement and their faith in His blood will let go of that faith and follow after the devil.
> Matthew 24:24&mdash;For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
> Revelation 19:20&mdash;And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
## The Mystery of the Dragon
The dragon is not altogether that great a mystery because of:
> Rev. 12: 9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
The devil is not literally a dragon, as the Church is not literally a woman, but these are divinely given images or symbols. There is a devil. John recorded here that the dragon was the devil.
> &hellip;The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;
This is a great contrast from his original state.
> Isa. 14: 12 &quot;How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground&hellip;&quot;
> Eze. 28: 14 &quot;Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth&hellip;&quot; He was the highest order of all God&apos;s creation.
> Eze. 28: 15 &quot;Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created&hellip;&quot;
> Eze. 28: 17 &quot;Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness&hellip;&quot;
Perfect in &quot;Beauty&quot; &mdash; Full of &quot;Wisdom&quot; &mdash; Clothed in &quot;Brightness&quot; (Light &mdash; Truth &mdash; Righteousness)
Lucifer fell from the anointed cherub that covereth, to a murderous dragon. What happened? What caused this terrible change? God did not make a dragon (devil); He created Lucifer &mdash; &quot;The light bearer.&quot; God created him with a free will to choose to do good or evil. He was not the devil, but he became the devil through the desire to be like God, or to be God.
The dragon has great power.
* Power over the nations Lk. 4: 6* Power of the air Eph. 2: 2* Power and signs II Thes. 2: 9* Power of death Heb. 2: 14
> Jude 9 - Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the Lord rebuke thee.
Lucifer is of the highest order of angelic beings, but is subordinate to God. Some compare the dragon in Rev. 12 to the Beast coming up out of the sea in Rev. 13\. In Rev. 12, the seven heads wear the crowns. In Rev. 13, it is the horns that are crowned. The dragon is the head of a spiritual empire while the Beast is the head of a physical empire. This portrays a concentration of, and the exercise of, the devil&apos;s diabolical power in and through the world powers.
There is a likeness between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil. There is also the distinction between them because one works in the spiritual realm and the other works in the physical realm.
## The Objects of The Dragon&apos;s Malignity
Rev. 12:4 &quot;&hellip;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;
### The First Objective is to Devour the &apos;Man-Child'
To destroy and devour the &quot;Man-Child,&quot; the devil would have to destroy the message (the Truth of the Word) that produces the &quot;Man-Child.&quot; If there ever was a message that the devil hates, it is this message of the &quot;Man-Child&quot; &mdash; the message ofovercoming&mdash; the message ofperfection. Jesus said:
> Matt.13:19 &quot;Then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown&hellip;
The power of the Word is &quot;&hellip;made of none effect&hellip;&quot; (Rom.4: 14) in the lives of those that &quot;&hellip;understandeth it not.&quot; (Matt. 13:19)
When the Word is received and understood, it will produce the characteristics of Christ in the life of the believer. The Word produces to the extent that it is believed and obeyed. Jesus said by the same &quot;Word&quot; some would produce &quot;&hellip;thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred&hellip;&quot;
> Mk. 4:20 &quot;&hellip;Such as hear the Word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.&quot;
The Scripture speaks of some as babes, some as children and some of mature age.
> Heb. 5:12&mdash;14 &quot;For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the Word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&quot;
The &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be a ruling body of Overcomers that will be given power to rule the nations.
> Rev. 2:26, 27 &quot;And he that overcometh, and keepeth My works unto the end,tohim will I give powerover the nations: Andhe shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:even as I received of My Father.&quot;
Psa. 2:9 &quot;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&apos;s vessel.&quot;
Here we see Christ ruling with the rod of iron. It is said that Rev. 12 has to be Christ because they believe He is the only one that is ruling with the rod of iron. The Overcomer has this promise of being given this power to rule the nations with a rod of iron.
The devil will try to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; as soon as he is born, but the &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be &quot;&hellip;caught up unto God, and to His throne.&quot; This is the promise to the Overcomer.
> Rev. 3:21 &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.&quot;
The dragon&apos;s desire is to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; who is destined to &quot;&hellip;rule all the nations with a rod of iron&hellip;&quot; that the dragon has ruled over. All satanic activities are carried out under the ambitious motive to rule and to be worshipped. Does the devil know he will lose this place?
When this objective failed, he attacked the Woman.
### The Second Objective is to Devour the &quot;Woman&quot;
> Rev. 12:13 &quot;And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.&quot;
In the Gospel according to St. Luke, Jesus spoke of the great and awful signs of the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation Hour.
> Lk. 21:12 &quot;But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;
&quot;Basileus&quot; &mdash; &quot;King&quot; &mdash; a sovereign &mdash; ruler &mdash; dictator (kings are not presidents)
Several years ago the Lord showed me in a dream that the Church was going to go through &quot;Great Persecution.&quot; The Church is persecuted for three-and-a-half years to bring her to a place of separation from the world and complete dedication to the Lord.
> Rev. 12:6 &quot;And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.&quot; (Three-and-a-half years)
Rev. 12:15 &quot;And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood (false doctrine) after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood (false doctrine).&quot;
When this failed, he attacked the &quot;remnant of her seed.&quot;
### The Third Objective is to Destroy the Seed
> Rev. 12:17 &quot;And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed&hellip;&quot;
The &quot;remnant of her seed&quot; is the saints that are left after the Rapture of the Church, which takes place in the middle of the Tribulation Hour. These saints find themselves facing the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. They are represented by the foolish virgins that neglected their experience. They will have to wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and will come out of Great Tribulation.
> Rev. 7:9 &quot;After this (the sealing of the 144,000 Jews) I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;&quot;
Rev. 7:13, 14 &quot;And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of Great Tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;
## The Destiny of the Dragon
### Cast out of Heaven
> Rev. 12:8 &quot;&hellip;Neither was their place found any more in heaven.&quot;
Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&quot;
The devil&apos;s place was not left empty, but was found no more. The &quot;Man-Child&quot; now occupies that place.
### Bound in the Bottomless Pit
> Rev. 20:1&mdash;3 &quot;And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;
### Loosed a Little Season
The dragon will be loosed for a short season. He goes forth and deceives many nations.
> Rev. 20:3 &quot;&hellip;And after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;
Rev. 20:7, 8 &quot;And when the thousand years are expired, satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.&quot;
### Cast Ultimately into the Lake of Fire
The dragon will eventually be cast into the lake of fire, where he shall be tormented forever, and forever.
> Rev. 20:10 &quot;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.&quot;


<h1>The War in Heaven, Rev. 12:7-12</h1>
<blockquote>And there was war in Heaven</blockquote>

<h2>The Fact of a War in Heaven</h2>

<h3>A Fantastic Story?</h3>

<p>Skeptics ridicule the idea of a literal war, and are astonished that reasonable men should believe in such an event. They believe the idea of a &ldquo;War in Heaven&rdquo; belongs only in works of fiction.</p>

<h3>A Broad Symbol?</h3>

<h4>The Moral Conflicts in the Church</h4>
<p>Others believe that this &ldquo;War in Heaven&rdquo; is a poetical and epic account of certain moral conflicts in the history of the Christian Church on earth.</p>

<h4>The Power Struggle in the Roman Empire</h4>
<p>Others believe the Dragon to mean the Pagan Roman Empire; Michael, the Christian Roman Empire; Heaven, the throne of the Roman Emperors; and the war in Heaven, the conflicts between the Pagan and Christian Roman Emperors.</p>

<h4>The War Between &ldquo;Good and Evil&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Also, some teach that we are not to believe that this was an actual event, but a sort of a summary of the prolonged battle between good and evil.</p>

<h3>A Definitive Strike!</h3>
<p>Verse 7 states, &quot;And there was war in Heaven:&quot;, clearly communicating that John saw a &ldquo;war in heaven&rdquo;. There have been many battles&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>The last great conflict when the devil was cast out of heaven, there was a battle in Eden. There the devil deceived man and he lost his position with God.</li>
<li>There was a battle in hell when Christ fought and won redemption for man. He has, &ldquo;the keys of hell and of death.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip;, but this is WAR. John is not witnessing a battle, but a war, where (on the Earthly Front) the redeemed of humanity lay claim to the fullness of redemption, and (on the Heavenly Front) Michael and his angels, cast out the devil.</p>

<p>In multiple places the Scripture describes satan&apos;s current estate allowing him liberty enough to accuse the righteous (compare Revelation 12:10; Job 1:9; 2:5; Zechariah 3:1-7; Luke 22:31; 2 Corinthians 12:7). John sees here a definite and decisive war that removes the &lsquo;plaintiff&rsquo; from Heaven&apos;s courtroom!</p>

<h2>The Cause of The War in Heaven</h2>

<p>If the war John saw is a definitive and specific war (to be contrasted with the ongoing spiritual battles we face), it raises the question: &ldquo;What causes this war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the struggle between the devil and the people of God on this earth is long and old, something new has to happen to spark the epic conflict in Heaven. Consider the relationship of the two following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Man Child is Triumphantly Enthroned</li>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:5&mdash;And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</blockquote>

<li>Lucifer&apos;s Place is Permanently Erased</li>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:8,9a&mdash;And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was cast out&hellip;</blockquote>
</ul>

<p>What caused the War in Heaven? John saw Heaven foreclose on the devil, and the devil placed under the overcomer&apos;s feet! God kept His promise and the devil had to see it coming.</p>
<blockquote>Romans 16:20a&mdash;And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly&hellip;</blockquote>

<h2>The Forces of The War in Heaven (12:7)</h2>
<h3>Michael and his Angels</h3>

<p>Some believe Michael to be Christ. This theory begs the question, &ldquo;Why did Micahel say, &lsquo;The Lord rebuke thee&rsquo;?&rdquo; (Jude 9).</p>
<p>This is a heavenly host charged to defend and minister to the heirs of salvation (Hebrews 1:14).</p>

<h3>The Dragon and his Angels</h3>
<p>A great malignant kingdom, and a vast spiritual empire of evil, stands opposed to God's people (Ephesians 6:11,12). His angels are those that kept not their first estate but followed Satan in his fall (Jude 6).</p>

<h3>The Man Child (The Overcomer)</h3>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:11&mdash;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 3:21&mdash;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</blockquote>

<p>The War in Heaven is with and on behalf of the &quot;child.&quot; The devil will accuse the Believer before God for the LAST time.</p>

<h2>The Nature of The War in Heaven</h2>
<h3>The War is spiritual and not physical in nature.</h3>

<p>There are battles going on in the physical world in many different places. This is a spiritual war that will take place in the heavens.</p>

<p>The forces that are engaged are spiritual. The War is waged in the realm of &quot;Heaven.&quot; We see no loss of life nor bloodshed in this War. (NOTE: Those that loved not their lives unto the death were martyred BEFORE this war.) Instead, there is loss of &quot;place&quot; or &quot;position&quot;.</p>

<h3>It is a war of faith and knowledge.</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 12:11&mdash;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</blockquote>

<p>It is a war of believing and overcoming saints, supported by angels, against a malignant and hellish intellect inflamed with desperate hate and anger. In the conflict of Christ with the devil in the wilderness, the devil attacked His faith and His understanding. Like Christ, the overcomer knows, believes and fights for who he is in God. We can compare the dragon&apos;s contesting the Man Child&apos;s position on the throne with Zechariah 3:1-7.</p>

<h2>The Outcome of The War in Heaven</h2>
<h3>The Dragon is defeated.</h3>
<p>With all his wisdom and power, and all the fury of his hosts, the effort is disastrous, &quot;The dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Dragon loses his &quot;place,&quot; vs. 8.</h3>
<blockquote>&quot;Neither was their place found any more in heaven.&quot;</blockquote>

<h3>The Dragon is cast out, vs. 9.</h3>
<blockquote>&quot; And the great dragon was cast out,&quot; vs. 12.</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! For the devil is come down.&quot;</p>

<h3>The man-child is victorious.</h3>
<p>Sits on the throne. Reigning and ruling with Christ.</p>

<h1>The Woman in the Wilderness, Rev. 12:6; 13-16</h1>

<p>REVIEW: Verses 1 and 5 described the Woman as being "clothed with the sun", "having the moon under her feet", "upon her head a crown of twelve stars" and from out of her is produced the Man Child. We believe these details and the fact the this book is to be interpreted as prophecy identify this Woman as the Church or Body of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>The Flight of the Woman, vs. 6,13-16</h2>

<h3>The Reason For Her Flight, vs.13.</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 12:12&mdash;Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</blockquote>

<p>She makes her flight to the wilderness because she is persecuted ("dioko" to put to flight, drive away, to pursue) by the Dragon. Satan being ejected from heaven, by the Man Child with the aid of Michael and his angels, turns his wrath and venom on the woman. Satan persecutes the woman for two reasons: </p>

<h4>Having been cast out of heaven the Man Child is out of his reach.</h4>
<h4>The woman is to be "blamed" for bringing forth the Man Child.</h4>
<p>Notice that the dragon's attention is on the Man Child and readies to pounce as soon as the Man Child is brought forth. The Dragon is not concerned with the Woman until He is defated and cast down to the earth. His attack on the Against the Woman is an act of defiant rage.</p>

<h1>The Remnant (12:17)</h1>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:17&mdash;And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the <u>remnant of her seed</u>, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</blockquote>

<p>This study concerns the &quot;Seed of the Woman&quot; and the war the dragon wages against them. Though completely defeated in his attempt to destroy the Man Child and the Woman, the rage of the dragon has not lessened. Because the Man Child and the Woman are now out of his reach, the dragon makes war with the Remnant of the Woman's Seed.</p>

<h2>The Remnant of Her Seed</h2>

<h3>The Remnant Identified</h3>

<h4>A Counter View</h4>

<p>Most that believe the Woman is Israel and not the Church, also conclude that the "Remnant" are a part of Israel who were left behind when the Woman fled into the Wilderness. This is a natural and logical conclusion if the Woman is believed to be Israel and that ALL Gentile Believers have already been &quot;caught out&quot; before this time. Clarence Larkin claimed &quot;When the Church is caught out no REMNANT is left behind, all that are "IN CHRIST" are taken away;&hellip;&quot;</p>

<p> Mr. Larkin&apos;s claim is possible if no distinctions are made within the saints and all saints (regardless of spiritual maturity and level of obedience) will enjoy an identical reward. This statement appears to ignore the Scriptural truths that there are definite stages of Spiritual Development (For more on this topic see: <a href="">&quot:The Born Again&quot;</a>, <a href="">&quot:The Body of Christ&quot;</a></a> and <a href="">&quot:The Bride of Christ&quot;</a>) and that God reserves promises relative to Spiritual Development. (See <a href="dbi/courses/the-bride-of-christ/the-difference-between-the-church-and-the-bride_11">The Difference Between the Church and the Bride</a>)</p>

<h4>Adopted View</h4>

<p>The premise we adopted in the beginning of our study of Revelation 12 is that the Woman is indeed the Church. See notes on <a href="/dbi/courses/revelation/the-sun-clothed-woman_73">The Sun-Clothed Woman</a> for explanation.</p>

<p>The "&hellip;Remnant of her seed&hellip;" are the true Believers in Christ who are left after the Rapture of the Church (they had no oil in their vessel at midnight when the Bridegrooom came and were left behind). These held fast the confession of their faith in Christ Jesus and are a separated people from the prevailing abomination of that time.</p>

<h3>The Remnant Defined</h3>

<p>"The remnant of her seed" means the children of the "Woman." This "remnant" are the born again believers (the family of God) who are converts of the Church (The Woman). The "remnant" is that which remains &ndash; that which is left out of the whole &ndash; that which is left from the Rapture of the Church.</p>


<p>God reserves promises relative to Spiritual Development.</p>
<img src='/assets/revelation/bride-body-born-again-image.png' class="inline-with-text-large">

<ul id="bride-body-saved">
<li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/sinner.png' width='25px' height='25px'><b> (The Sinner - The World)</b> Of all the good promises of God there is reserved only the promise of the hope of salvation IF the sinner repents and condemnation if he does not.</li>

 <li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/saved.png' width='25px' height='25px'><b> (The Remnant - The Born Again)</b> In John 3, only those Born Again may enter into the kingdom of God. The Born Again will enjoy all the promises given to those a part of the Family of God.</li>
 
 <li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/body.png' width='25px' height='25px'><b> (The Woman - The Body of Christ)</b> In Matthew 25, all ten virgins slept (Revelation 3:16) and at midnight only the virgins with oil (a type of the Holy Ghost) went with the Bridegroom into the marriage. The Church which is Christ&apos;s Body will enjoy the promises given to the Born Again and those who have been Baptized into the Body by the Holy Ghost (1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:22,23).</li>
 
 <p>The baptism of the Spirit is required to be in the Church (His Body). The remnant had not been baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ (His Church; the Woman). Either these were never baptized or they had allowed their experience to go dry. Like the five foolish virgins, they were virgins, but they had allowed the oil to go dry. (Matthew 25:7,10)</p>
 
 <li><img src='/assets/revelation/color-squares/bride.png' width='25px' height='25px'><b> (The Man Child - The Bride of Christ)</b> In Luke 21:28,36, the promise of escaping the tribulation hour is reserved for those who are NOT asleep (&quot;watch&quot; - agrupnew - to be sleepless) and are ready. The Man Child as an Overcomer will enjoy every redemptive right and promise! (Revelation 19:7; 3:21)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are TRUE Believers and not merely those who profess to Believe. Notice, how there is a distinction made between the masses who confess Christ and those who"&hellip;keep the commandments of God."(Revelation 12: 17)</p>
 
<blockquote>Matt. 7:21&ndash;23&mdash;Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.</blockquote>

<h2>The War Against Her Seed</h2>
<blockquote>
Revelation 12:17 "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed&hellip;"</blockquote>

<p>Defeated in his attack on the "Man-Child" (the Overcomers), and then defeated in his attack on the "Woman" (the Church), the dragon changes his focus and enters into a deadly war with the converts of the "Woman," "her seed."</p>

<h3>The Means the Dragon Uses in This War</h3>
<h4>The Anti-christ</h4>
<p>The anti-christ will be the head of the one world government.</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:7 "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them&hellip;"</blockquote>

<h4>The False Religion</h4>
<p>The false religion is the system, which is practiced by the false prophet, bringing all the denominations of the world into one church. This one-world church will be government-controlled and government sponsored and headed up by the false prophet, who causes all to worship the "beast."</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:11&ndash;15 "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."</blockquote>

<h4>The Economy</h4>
<p>A government-controlled one world monetary system will be introduced. No one will be able to buy or sell unless they fit into the government-controlled system and receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead. There will not be a money exchange system, as we know it. There will be a transfer of credits through the computers, and without the mark you will not be able to transact business. This will force many to receive the mark.</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:16, 17 "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 16:2 "And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image."</p>
<p>Revelation 19:20 "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast,andthemthat worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."</p>

<h3>The Effects of the War</h3>
<h4>Great Tribulation</h4>
<p>"Megas Thlipsis" &ndash; "Great Tribulation" &ndash; exceeding great affliction &ndash; to suffer affliction &ndash; primarily means a pressuring</p>
<p>The Great Tribulation indicates a definite period of time, which was spoken of by the Lord, which precedes His Second Advent. The Second Advent is the "Epiphany," the revelation of Christ coming back to take over the kingdoms of this world. This is not the secret coming in the air where He raptures the Church.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:29, 30 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."</blockquote>

<p>The believers will be greatly persecuted.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:21 "For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 2:22 "Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation, except they repent of their deeds."</p>
<p>Revelation 3:10 "Because thou hast kept the Word of My patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."</p>

<h4>Saints Overcome</h4>
<blockquote>
Revelation 13:7 "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them&hellip;"</blockquote>

<p>The "Man-Child" (the Overcomers) overcame the dragon.</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 12:11 "&hellip;They overcame him&hellip;"</blockquote>

<p>"The Woman" (the Church) escaped the dragon's attacks by a great miracle. However, these saints that were left behind during the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation are attacked and overcome by the dragon's murderous assaults. Permission was "given" (Revelation 13: 7) to the dragon and to the false-christ to make war with the saints and to overcome them. These saints are not Jews only, for the Scripture says, "over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."</p>
<blockquote>
Revelation 7:9 "&hellip;Of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues."</blockquote>

<h4>Many Martyrs</h4>
<p>Many of the saints that are left behind and go into the "Great Tribulation" will give their lives as martyrs, because they refused to give up their faith in Christ Jesus the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:9 "Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for My name's sake."</blockquote>
<blockquote>John 16:2&mdash;They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 6:9&ndash;11&mdash;And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 7:9&ndash;14&mdash;After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the Throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 14:12,13&mdash;Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</blockquote>

<h4>The Martyrs' Reward (Revelation 7:15-17)</h4>

<h5>They are Before the Throne of God</h5>
<h5>They Serve Him&hellip; in HisTemple</h5>
<h5>They Dwell with Him that Sits on the Throne</h5>
<h5>They Shall Hunger No More</h5>
<h5>They Neither Thirst Anymore</h5>
<h5>They Shall No More be Scorched with the Heat</h5>
<h5>They Shall be Fed by the Lamb Himself</h5>
<h5>They Shall be Lead unto Living Fountains of Waters</h5>
<h5>They Shall Have No More Tears</h5>

<h1>The Beast Out of the Sea (13:1-10)</h1>
<img src="/assets/revelation/words-rev-13-first-beast.png" id="words-rev-13-first-beast">

<blockquote>Revelation 13:1&mdash;And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</blockquote>

<p>John is seeing in the Spirit a vision of "The Beast".</p>

<h2>The Origin of the Beast</h2>

<p>The beast will not come from any particular place or people, but will rise up out of the sea of all humanity. The <em>sea</em> has to do with nations and peoples as explained in Revelation 17:15.</p>

<blockquote>Revelation 17:15&mdash;And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</blockquote>

<p>The fact the beast rose up is referencing it coming into power. The beast rising to power is enabled by the great sin and rebellion in the hearts of humanity. Blame for the great corruption in the world cannot be laid on any particular nation, but all nations have facilitated this climax of evil. Satan seizes the opportunity of man&apos;s rejection of God&apos;s will and embodies evil in treacherous leaders. God allows leadership to arise that the people deserve!</p>

<p>Isaiah 47:10-11; Galatians 6:8; James 4:1; Zechariah 11:7-16</p>

<blockquote>Zechariah 11:16&mdash;For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</blockquote>

<p>Where did this beast come from? Man&apos;s rejection of God as KING and their TRUE SHEPHERED.</p>

<blockquote>Psalm 81:11&mdash;But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</blockquote>




<h2>The Description of the Beast</h2>

<h3>The Beast as a Whole</h3>


<h4>Distinct from the Dragon</h4>

	<th>The Beast of the Sea</th>

	<td>physical empires</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Controlled by the Dragon</h4>

<p>There are likenesses between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil. The dragon is the head of a spiritual empire while the Beast is the embodiment of physical world powers. As there is one Beast with seven heads, so the system or power at work (the dragon/satan) is still one and the same though different nations or leaders rise and fall. The Beast in this vision represents the entire history of human governments and evil that has been at work in them by the devil. The Beast is a world system of rejection of God and worship of the devil.</p>

<p>There will be a seventh and &apos;new&apos; kingdom of the Anti-christ that will rise as the world power, but the system that drives and the rebellion that fuels will not be anything new.</p>

<blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:7-8&mdash;For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. 8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</blockquote>

<h3>Having Seven Heads</h3>
<blockquote>Revelation 17:9-10&mdash;The seven heads are seven mountains &hellip; And &hellip; there are seven kings.</blockquote>



<p>Mountains in the scriptures can be typical of kingdoms. See: Psalms 30:7; Jeremiah 51:25; Daniel 2:25.</p>

<img src="/assets/revelation/rev-13-7-kingdoms-2.png" id="rev-13-7-kingdoms">

<h4>Five Are Fallen</h4>
<p>In the 17th chapter we read: &quot;&hellip;Five Are Fallen&hellip;&quot;: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, and Greece.</p>
<p>At this particular time John is beholding this scene, there has been five fallen.</p>

<h4>One Is</h4>
<p>"&hellip;And One Is&hellip;": Again, there was "one" in power at the time of John&apos;s vision&mdash;there is no question as to what kingdom it was. The Roman Empire was still in rule and power at that time.</p>

<h4>The Other is not Yet Come</h4>
<p>"&hellip;And the other is not yet come&hellip;". That is, the anti-Christ has not yet set up his kingdom. He is the seventh kingdom and he must continue a "short space".</p>
<p>He comes on the scene during the first part of the Tribulation and then in the middle of the tribulation he is slain with the Sword and resurrected to life to be the <em>eighth which is of the seven</em>. His resurrection restores one of the seven heads of the beast and is not a new and eighth head (the beast only has seven heads).</p>
<blockquote>Rev 17:11&mdash;And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</blockquote>

<p>Who are these Seven Kingdoms? History makes it plain who the first six are: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome. The seventh and final kingdom will be the kingdom of the anti-Christ. The beast&apos;s seven heads are seven kingdoms&mdash;seven world ruling powers. This is a full revelation of &quot;The Times of The Gentiles&quot;(Luke 21:24) from its beginning to its end.</p>

<h3>"&hellip;And Ten Horns&hellip;"</h3>
<blockquote>Daniel 7:24&mdash;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&hellip;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Revelation 17:12&mdash;And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings&hellip;</blockquote>
<p>These are not a description of the previous kings, but are the ten ruling powers, which will rise up after the Roman Empire.</p>
<img src='/assets/prophecy-and-daniel/empire-statue.png' id="daniel-statue">
<p>This is in agreement with Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream, and Daniel&apos;s vision.</p>

<h4>Nebuchadnezzar</h4>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar saw a Great Image broken up into four sections and finally divided into ten toes.</p>

<h5>Babylon: the head</h5>
<h5>Persia: the shoulders and breast</h5>
<h5>Greece: the belly and thighs</h5>
<h5>Rome: the thighs and legs and feet, then the ten toes; the ten horns of John&apos;s vision</h5>

<h4>Daniel</h4>
<p>Daniel&apos;s vision was four wild beasts: lion, a bear, a leopard and an indescribable beast.</p>
<blockquote>Daniel 7:7&mdash;After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</blockquote>

<h5>"And it had ten horns"</h5>
<p>We can compare these to the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream and the ten horns of John&apos;s vision.</p>
<p>However, we see something in Daniels vision that is not seen in either Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream or John&apos;s vision.</p>

<h5>"There came up among them another little horn."</h5>
<h6>John sees:</h6>
<p>The beast itself being the "Little Horn" that comes up among the ten.</p>
<h6>However Daniel sees:</h6>
<p>There were three of the "First Horns plucked up by the roots."</p>
<p>This would indicate that Daniel saw a more advanced stage than what John declares. John saw ten horns in the 17th chapter of Revelations. This indicates that he saw them before any of them were plucked up. Furthermore at this stage they have not received their Kingdom (Rev. 17:12).</p>

<p>At the time that John was seeing that the anti-Christ "had not yet come" into power, was possibly just before or at, the beginning of the Tribulation. "Which received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast." The first part of the Tribulation hour.</p>

<h3>"And Upon His Horns Ten Crowns"</h3>
<p>They have now received their crowns and John sees the time of the ten kings reigning with the anti-Christ during the first part of the Tribulation.</p>
<p>For after this John sees the seventh head wounded and resurrected.</p>
<p>However John makes no more mention of the ten kings, but Daniel declares that three of them fall before the anti-Christ when he is resurrected from death.</p>

<h1>Another Beast (13:11-18)</h1>

<blockquote>Rev. 13:11&mdash;And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</blockquote>

<p>John said &quot;I beheld another beast&quot;. In the exact same sense that John saw the first beast, he sees also a second beast. Whatever reasoning is used to understand the first beast must also be applied to the second beast. Both beasts (though they are different) are <em>seen</em> by John in the same setting.</p>

<p>The secular empire that will overwhelm the world will not work alone. The extant of the first beast&apos;s success can largely be attributed to the presence and work of another beast.</p>

<h2>Description of the Second Beast</h2>

<h3>Another</h3>
<img src='/assets/revelation/two-beasts-relationship.png' id='two-beasts-relationship'>
<p>This beast is addition to the first beast and rises up <strong>after</strong> the first beast. By great deception, he will advertise and promote the beast which came &quot;before him&quot; The relationship of these two beasts has often been compared to the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist. This other beast will be a prominent promoter of the Anti-christ. This second beast will be instrumental in the deception of the Anti-christ.</p>

<h3>Beast</h3>

<p>Like the first, the second is a dangerous, wild and even venomous beast (empire). Standing on the shore, John saw a tremendously evil influence rise out of the earth. Despite having some characteristics of a lamb, there is no confusion here&mdash;this is an evil thing in rebellion against God and His order. </p>

<h3>Coming Out of the Earth</h3>

<p>Though a beast (empire) it&apos;s realm is of a different nature than the first beast. Key to understanding the second beast is noticing its source. This beast&apos;s origin can be compared with the first beast&apos;s. The first rises out of the sea of humanity and through a succession of rising and falling empires, but the second comes from out of earth.</p>

<p>At a crucial and vulnerable time when all humanity is an unsettled and tempestuous sea crying for answers and clarity comes from out of the &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;land&quot; (stable, settled, authoritative) something whose appearance and whose voice validates the authority of the first beast. The second beast&apos;s message is &quot;Have no fear, this is the <em>right</em> path!&quot;. Coming from a seemingly neutral and stable perspective and wielding supernatural ability, the world will conclude: &quot;It must be ok, the <em>voice of reason</em> said it was.</p>

<h3>Two horns like a Lamb</h3>

<p>Horns are representative of a ruler.</p>
<blockquote>Daniel 7:24&mdash;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings</blockquote>

<img src='/assets/revelation/philomena.jpg' id='philomena'>

<p>The lamb-like horns indicate something of a spiritual nature. This second beast completes the depth of the world system of evil. The Dragon empowers the first beast with a secular empire and the second beast validates and completes this empire with its own spiritual or religious empire. Here is something that appears in part <em>lamb-like</em> but has the nature of a wild and venomous beast.</p>

<blockquote>Mt 23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</blockquote>

<h2>Actions of the Second Beast</h2>

<h3>Spoke as a Dragon</h3>

<p>The lamb-like horns and then the voice of a dragon indicate a real change in character and in policy. For example, laws that were promoted as protections for religious liberty today could be used to accomplish the opposite! The beginning will be applauded for the sake of the &quot;greater good&quot;, but will not manifest in a utopia but in great terror. </p>

<blockquote class="quote">Slowly our government is becoming a dictatorship instead of a free democracy - a government by the people - of the people - for the people. We are headed to a New World Order. We failed as a people to occupy till He comes. We need to be preparing ourselves to get out.&mdash;Rev. James Reynolds, Sr.</blockquote>

<p>The Second Beast is actually the mouthpiece of the Dragon, so truly, the Dragon is speaking. Even now, the Dragon is already speaking. Herein is an warning to KNOW the voice of God! The only security in this age of deception is a vibrant relationship with Christ and familiarity with His voice. By knowing the TRUE you can spot the FALSE a long ways off.</p>

<h3>Exercised the Power of the First Beast</h3>
<blockquote>vs. 12a&mdash;And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,&hellip;</blockquote>
 
 <p>The Greek word (poieo) for <em>exerciseth</em> is a very common word in the New Testament. It is used at least 519 times and in the book of Revelation is also translated as: <em>do, bring forth, make, cause, commit, continue, fulfil, wrought, bare</em> and <em>work</em>.</p>
 <p>The Greek word (exousia) for <em>power</em> means <em>mastery, strength, right</em> or <em>authority to rule</em>. To the second beast will be delegated the power of authority that belongs to the first beast. The first beast will have the both the ability and right to act as it does in the same sense a king acts sovereignly within his kingdom. The second beast will have the same ability and authority because it will be delegated to him by the first beast.</p>
 
 <blockquote>vs. 12b&mdash;&hellip;and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</blockquote>
 
 <h3>Performs Great Miracles (Sets the Hook)</h3>
 
<p>Among other unexplainable and miraculous feats, he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. It is by the means of these miracles that he deceives those that dwell on the earth. (Galatians 1:8) This miracle power does come from God, but comes from the beast. A union or pact has been made between these beasts as we see the first beast delegating power and authority and the second beast returns loyalty and validation to the first beast.</p>

<h3>Teaches a Blasphemous Gospel (Reels them in.)</h3>
 
 <p>The first beast is wounded, and then raised, and incarnated by the devil. The second beast teaches that the world should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. He tells them that the miracle of resurrection now proves beyond all doubt that this is not just a good leader, but this beast is a god to be worshipped!</p>
 
 <h3>Murders in the Name of God</h3>
 
<p>And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>
 
 <h3>Mark &amp; Number of Apostasy</h3>
<blockquote>Revelation 13:16,17&mdash;And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</blockquote>

<p>The Mark Of The Beast will be instituted by the false prophet.</p>

<ul>
	<li>By Deception (a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing), vs. 11,14</li>
	<li>By Miracles, vs. 12-13 (&quot;must be God!&quot;)</li>
	<li>By Coercion, vs. 15 (&quot;Do or Die&quot;)</li>
	<li>Design of the Mark, vs. 16 (&quot:causeth all&hellip;to receive a mark&quot;)</li>

<h1 id="N">N. The Glorious Judge and His Judgment[14, 17, 18]</h1>

<h1>Song of the Hundred and Forty-Four Thousand (Revelation 14:1-5)</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Revelation 13 concludes with a gloomy tale of a reign of darkness. In Chapter 13 we read of two terrible beasts and their great deception against those who would receive the Beast&apos;s mark. Chapter 14 opens with a glorious scene featuring firstly the Lamb and secondly 144,000 redeemed souls who were marked, but it was God the Father's name on their forehead! We find the details surrounding the Song of this 144,000 in Revelation 14:1-5.</p>
<h2>The Lamb on Mount Sion (vs. 1)</h2>
<blockquote>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion,</blockquote>
<h3>The Lamb</h3>
<p>The &quot;Lamb&quot; appears in 27 verses throughout Revelation and His identity cannot be mistaken!</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 5:6&mdash;And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood <strong>a Lamb</strong> as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote> John 1:29&mdash;The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</blockquote>
<h4>Was Slain</h4>
<p>the Lamb that was slain
unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
the wrath of the Lamb:
made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p>
<h4>Standing in the midst of the Throne</h4>
<blockquote>Revelation 22:3&mdash;And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</blockquote>
<h5>And the four beasts, and the elders (5:6)</h5>
<h5>With the Sealed Book [WAS slain!] (5:8; 6:1)</h5>
<h5>With Wrath (6:16)</h5>
<h5>With an Innumerable Multitude worshipping before Him (7:9)</h5>
<h5>Feeding and Leading the Innumerable Multitude (7:17)</h5>
<h5>Overcoming those that Make War with Him (17:14)</h5>
<h5>Marrying His Bride (19:7; 21:9)</h5>
<h5>As the Temple (21:22)</h5>
<h5>As the Light (21:23)</h5>
<h5>Having a Book of Life (21:27)</h5>
<h5>Having a Pure River of Water Proceeding out of His Throne (22:1)</h5>
<h3>Standing on Mount Sion</h3>
<blockquote>Psalm 87&mdash;His foundation is in the holy mountains. 2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. 6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.</blockquote>
<p>Matthew 21:5 and John 12:15 say to Tell the daughter of Sion that her King is coming to her! Hebrews 12:22 says the Believer has not come to a smoking and burning physical mountain that cannot be touched but unto Mount Sion the City of the Living God.</p>
<blockquote>Hebrews 12:22&mdash;But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;zion&quot; expresses ideas of strength and permanence such as a fortress, monument, or landmark.</p>
<p>Zion is called both the city of David (1 Kings 8:1; 1 Chronicles 11:5; 2 Chronicles 5:2) and the city of God. The fortress was considered so impenetrable they mocked David saying he would not be able to take fortress even with blind and lamb sentries on guard. David captured the Jebusite fortress in 2 Samuel 5:7:</p>
<blockquote>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</blockquote>
<p>Mount Zion is also the highest and southernmost mount of Jerusalem, rising about twenty-five hundred feet above the Mediterranean, but Scripture emphasizes Mount Zion more as a Spiritual concept and less as a physical place. Mount Zion is most importantly understood as the people of God.</p>
<blockquote>Psalm 48:2&mdash;Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.</blockquote>
<h2>The 144,000 (vs. 1-2)</h2>
<p>and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</p>
<p>2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p>
<h2>A New Song (vs. 3-5)</h2>
<blockquote>3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</blockquote>

<h1>Judgment Hour Preachers (Revelation 14:6-7)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>vs.7&mdash;&hellip;the hour of his judgment is come&hellip;</blockquote>
<h3>Christ as judge.</h3>
<p>The pre-eminent content of the Angel&apos;s message is, &quot;The hour of His judement is come.&quot; The church goes (is raptured) and God&apos;s judgment follows. Not only does this message involve the present judgment that will come on the world in the midst of the seven years, but this message also relates to Christ&apos;s coming and judging of the world.</p>
<h3>The Truth Unbound</h3>
<p>Revelation chapter 14 takes place in the middle of the seven years of God&apos;s dealing with the nation of Israel. During the last phase of the judgment of God, the anti-christ will be in rule and will have destroyed or bound all apparent means of the Gospel being proclaimed. However, God has commissioned His angels to speak at this time!</p>
<p>Upon Christ&apos;s entry into Jerusalem, fault was found with the loud proclaimations of praise given Christ as the Messiah and King. Christ answered:</p>
<blockquote>Luke 19:40&mdash;And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</blockquote>
<p>The truth of God and His claims must be spoken. If men are brought to silence, other things must become vocal to testify for Jehovah. In a time when the anti-christ has successfully burried away in caves, mountains and the wilderness all human testimony for God, the heavens speak and the angels whom the anti-christ cannot touch become preachers in the darkest hour of judgment.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with order of things already gone by. The angels testified just before Christ&apos;s first coming and they will again just before His second coming. The angels will testify and preach to all those that dwell on the earth.</p>
<p>Their pulpit will be mid-air and all nations, tribes, tongues and peoples are their audience. Hell may slay, imprison and silence every human witness for God, but it cannot bind the truth! God's Word cannot be bound. It must be heard.</p>
<blockquote>2 Timothy 2:9&mdash;Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p>1 Peter 1:23&mdash;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</blockquote>


<h2>First Message &ndash; &quot;The Everlasting Gospel&quot; (vs. 6-7)</h2>
<blockquote>Revelation 14:6,7&mdash;And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</blockquote>
<p>We find in verses 6 and 7 all the elements necessary for the preaching of the Gospel: God inspiring a preacher, a pulpit, a message, an audience and a delivery.</p>

<h3>The Nature of the Messenger</h3>
<p>This is definitely an angel (a Heavenly messenger) that is proclaiming the message John hears. The fact that an angel is preaching reveals that the present dispensation is now undergoing a change and is ready to pass away while another is beginning to take its place.</p>
<p>Of old, angels were employed for the giving of the law, the heralding of Christ's coming and in the judgment time they are conspicuously everywhere taking part in the Divine administrations with regard to our world. But, in the dispensation under which we now are, the charge of preaching and witnessing for God and the declaring of His Word is the ministry of the Church. The preaching of the Gospel is in the hands of men.</p>
<p>It is now the duty of the Church to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all who will believe. Angels are ministers to the heirs of salvation, but not the preachers of the Gospel of Christ to a world lost in sin. The disciples (Acts 5:19), Philip (Acts 8:26), Cornelius (Acts 10:3), and Paul at sea (Acts 27:3) all benefited from the ministry of angels which enabled them to fulfill their own responsibility in preaching of the Word of God. It is not presently the duty of angels to proclaim the Word of Truth, but is the Believer's present duty and privilege.</p>

<h3>The Position of his Pulpit</h3>
<p>The Angel's pulpit is positioned in the midst of heaven. In Hebrew are three words to describe three levels of &quot;heaven&quot; 1) Shameh means sky 2) Shachaq means firmament and 3) Galgal means heaven as in the place of God's throne. The Angel's pulpit is in the midst of the sky (See Strong's GREEK#3321 <em>mesouranema</em>). Men will hear the voice, but will not be able to silence it. They will try to block their ears and yet will still hear!</p>
<p>This pulpit is also positioned in a time of judgment. The time and season makes the message all that more vital and its delivery so monumentally grave&mdash;hear ye him (Matthew 17:5).</p>

<h3>The Content of the Message</h3>
<p>The manner of its delivery will change, but there will be no change in the message. These angels have the everlasting Gospel to preach. It is the same Gospel the Apostles preached and not another beause there is no other Gospel.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gospel is good news.</li>
<li>The Gospel is power. (Romans 1:16)</li>
<li>The Gospel is a warning or forerunner of judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul warned the church already about anyone would preach another gospel.</p>
<blockquote>Galatians 1:8&mdash;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</blockquote>
<p>Notice his message: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fear God: to be in awe and reverence.</li>
<li>Give glory to Him: Worship God in Spirit and in Truth (John 4:24) as well as in the beauty of holiness (Psalm 29:2).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Psalm 29:2&mdash;Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. </blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For the hour of His judgment is come</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bible has much to say about judgment. Enoch (Jude 14-15), David (Psalm 1:5), Isaiah (30:18), Jeremiah (4:2), Ezekiel, Daniel (7:10), John the Baptist (Matthew 3:12), Jesus (Matthew 25:31-32), Paul (2 Thessalonians 1:7-8), Peter (II Peter 2:9) and John the Beloved (1 John 4:17) all preached judgment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Him that Made it All</li>
</ul>
<p>We have neglected Him He matters most and truly Him alone who matters! While we gazed into His Heavens, drank of His waters and profited by His earth we failed to honor Him as God. Repent!</p>

<h3>The Auditors of the Message</h3>
<p>It would seem a strange thing to believe that every nation, kindred, tongue and people hear the angel in the same language and understand what he says. It would take a long time for this angel to go to every nation and kindred upon the face of the earth and speak in each tongue and dialect. However this sermon is presented in a short period of time. The same God that confounded the language of man at Babel will cause them to understand His messengers!</p>
<p>Many testimonies of this particular miraculous power of God have been shared. To remember one account here, we don't have to look that far into history. Oral Roberts while he was preaching in India experienced God work this same miracle. While he preached in English, the people heard in their native languages.</p>

<h3>The Delivery of the Message</h3>
<p>Though it is the same Gospel being proclaimed&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 14:7&mdash;Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; yet its manner of delivery has changed. It is no longer the meek and entreating voice beseeching men to be reconciled to God, but a great thundering form the sky demanding of the nations to fear God. The reason given for the change in delivery is the fact:</p>
<blockquote>&hellip;the hour of His judgment is come&hellip;</blockquote>
<p>The church-period has given place to the judgment hour. When this is understood, the whole matter clears up. Mercy towards the poor infatuated world still lingers in the very hour of wrath. In the heat and height of His indignation, God still remembers mercy. </p>
<blockquote>Habakkuk 3:2&mdash;O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</blockquote>
<p>And, when there is no human voice left to speak it, an angel from heaven will speak mid-air proclaiming to the guilty world to turn to God. </p>
<p>This is one of the very last calls of grace to an apostate world. The finality of the coming herald and the limited amount of time in which the people of God have to work, ought to spur us to redeem the time and preach the Everlasting Gospel!</p>

<h1>Babylon is Fallen (Revelation 14:8)</h1>
<blockquote>Revelation 14:8&mdash;And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</blockquote>
<p>With the hour of judgment comes the work of judgment. The messengers of God are busy declaring the mind of God. The same cry is made both in chapter 14 and chapter 18.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 14:8&mdash;&hellip;Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
<p>Revelation 18:2,3&mdash;&hellip;Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, &hellip; 3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This cry is declaring something in the future and yet the sense of the declaration is given as though it is already past. When God says it, future judgment is no less definite than history. Because He is sovereign, God calls things that aren't as though they were. The utter destruction of Babylon is certain.</p>


<h2>Why Babylon is Destroyed</h2>

<h3>Emphasis Should be on the Reason for her Destruction</h3>
<p>Believers can and do differ over what Babylon literally is, but it is important to unite in emphasizing what the Scripture does say about it. &quot;Babylon&quot; will be destroyed because of her false teaching and murder of the saints.</p>
<p>The name Babylon is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Babel. Throughout the Bible, Babylon is a symbol of the confusion caused by godlessness. </p>
<p>The unveiling of the real enemy is found in what Babylon DOES and SAYS and not an inherent evil because of where it can be found on a map or because of historical sentiment towards it. The City of Rome or even the area near Baghdad, Iraq are only in danger of God's Wrath for the same reasons any people or nation will suffer judgment&mdash;if they set themselves as the enemies of God.</p>

<h3>The Reason</h3>

<p>Babylon is destroyed because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. All who drank of her wine are guilty of spiritual adultery or idolatry.</p>
<p>What is the wine that she made all nations to drink? False doctrines. As harlots would utilize love potions and intoxicating drinks so the City of Babylon has used and will use false doctrine to entrap.</p>
<blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:10-12&mdash;And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</blockquote>

<p>An Illustration from history: In November 1978, 909 people drank cyanide-laced grape-flavored Flavor Aid at the instruction of religious leader and community organizer Jim Jones. Jim Jones attracted a large following to his Peoples Temple through sermons on tolerance, social responsibility and community. As the church grew, however, the sermons on equality and tolerance were replaced by demands for personal loyalty and obedience. (In 1973, Jones had been arrested for soliciting a man for sex&mdash;homosexuality.)</p>

<p>Proverbs 23:32 is speaking of drunkenness and wine, but is appropriate as well for the devil's tactics of false doctrine:</p>

<blockquote>Proverbs 23:32&mdash;At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</blockquote>

<h2>What Babylon is Destroyed</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Babylon is fallen</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>A Place and Its Religious System</h3>
<p>There are some that make a great difference between the Mystery Babylon in Chapter 17 and the City of Babylon in Chapters 14 and 18, but both &quot;Babylons&quot; are two parts of the same thing: 1) a place 2) a system. The emphasis is put on the system in the 17th chapter and in 14:8 and the 18th Chapter the emphasis is on the city itself.</p>

<h3>Literally, the City of Babylon</h3>

<h4>Not Just Rome</h4>

<p>Babylon, who is the Mother of Harlots (17:5) and the Habitation of Devils (18:2) is fallen. As Rome, Italy (or more specifically Vatican City) has been instrumental in both Christian martyrdom and the spread of false doctrine, this prophecy concerning the fall of the City of Babylon is generally believed to be a prediction concerning the city of Rome, Italy. This interpretation is seemingly influenced by the long standing prejudice of the Protestant church historically at war with the Roman Catholic church. </p>
<p>The passage does not say Rome, but it does say Babylon. To be consistent in our method of interpretation of the this great Book, we will interpret Babylon literally as the city originally built by Nimrod in the land of Shinar and rising and falling throughout history, but being utterly destroyed in the Day of God's Wrath. Truly, Babylon is the birth place of the false doctrine woven throughout Roman Catholicism and not the other way around (i.e., Mother-Infant worship).</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic church is not the only religious system guilty of spiritual adultery. God would not be justified in sparing one and punishing another unrepentant group for the identical criminal act. Babylon is not just Rome. It is bigger than that. It is an apostate religious world.</p>
<h4>Not Utterly Destroyed, Yet</h4>
<p>The City of Babylon was situated in the Land of Shinar on the Euphrates River, about 50 miles south of modern Baghdad, Iraq. Although Babylon was effectively eliminated as an empire when it was taken by the Medes and Persians after the 70 year Jewish exile, all prophecies concerning it have not yet been entirely fulfilled. </p>
<p>The conquering empire of Persia did not destroy Babylon, but instead made it a royal city. Babylon appears importantly in history 500 years after Christ, for it was at Babylon that Jewish Academics compiled the Talmud (the basis of all codes of Jewish Law). Also Modern Day Bahgdad, Iraq stands near the original location of Babylon.</p>
<p>Isaiah 13:6,19-22; Jeremiah 50:40; 51:64 and Revelation 14:8; 17; 18 give an image of an extreme and absolute destruction not yet seen. Much of this has been fulfilled, but not all will be fulfilled until the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 13:6).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isaiah 13:19,20&mdash;And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 51:64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rebuilding Babylon</h4>
<p>Babylon will fall, but first it must be rebuilt. Before her utter destruction that will take place in the Day of the Lord's Wrath, the city of Babylon will first become instrumental in centralizing apostasy. What the Vatican is for just 1.2 Billion Roman Catholics, Babylon will arise for the greatest apostate ecumenical group the world has ever seen. Read Zechariah 5:5-11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zechariah 5:10,11&mdash; Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 11 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Rewards of Allegiance (Revelation 14:9-13)</h1>

<h2>Introduction &mdash; Loyal to the Cause</h2>

<p>Allegiance speaks of loyalty or commitment to a group or cause. It reminds us of fidelity which is faithfulness to a person, cause, or belief, demonstrated by continuing loyalty and support. Often allegiance is spoken of in the context of citizenship.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION: The American &lsquo;Pledge of Allegiance&rsquo; was originally written for children for a one time use in 1892. The verse intended to commemorate Columbus Day originally read:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which is stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</blockquote>

<p>To date, it has undergone two changes. The National Flag Conference of the American Legion replaced "my Flag" with &lsquo;the Flag of the United States of America.&rsquo; in 1923. Secondly, in 1954 President Eisenhower signed a bill that added the words "Under God."</p>

<p>Today, as humanity&apos;s allegiance to God is failing, it is strongly argued by many to remove the words "Under God" from the American Pledge. Whether or not these voices are successful, the testimony of "The Pledge of Allegiance" has been to date to strengthen, clear up and better our commitment. The line of demarcation between saint and sinner will become more and more pronounced as the end of all things approaches. The intensity of the day of God&apos;s wrath will solidify the allegiances of men. The wicked will do more wickedly, but some will sure up their allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ and even seal their testimony with their lives.</p>

<blockquote>Joshua 24:15&mdash;And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</blockquote>

<p>God's cause is Redemption and Restoration of all things lost through sin. The devil's cause is to destroy through sin.</p>

<blockquote>1 John 3:8&mdash;He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</blockquote>

<p>Just as sure as you can back a loser and lose all your investment, so our spiritual allegiance comes with a certain reward or consequence. There is no fence in this contest for the hearts and souls of men. The athlete on the bench can celebrate because he was on the winning side, and even if a benched player on the losing side never saw a second of game-time, he, just like his other team mates, lost. Our allegiance marries us to the destiny of our cause. The devil's is a lost cause and Christ is always the victor! In practice, where does my allegiance lie? Whose cause do I faithfully promote? The end of THAT cause, will be my end.</p>

<h2>Allegiance to the Beast(vs. 9-11)</h2>

<p>Judgment on the followers of the Antichrist.</p>

<h3>The Reason for their Judgment</h3>

<p>Why would anyone worship the devil? In the two reasons given for their judgment, we also see the reasons for their allegiance. There are two groups who hold allegiance to the Beast.</p>

<h4>They that Worshipped the Beast and his Image</h4>
<p>There are those that give evidence of their fidelity to this system by worship. They honor and give service to the Beast because they are his "true believers". These are loyal to the Beast's cause because they believe in it.</p>

<h4>They that Received his Mark (forehead or hand)</h4>
<p>Not all who make up the masses in allegiance to the Beast are so because they are sold on his ideology. Many join themselves to the enemies of God without any formal or declared intention of hostility toward God. Many will conform out of necessity. Many will surrender to the Beast's influence because without his mark on their hand or forehead they cannot survive in society (Revelation 13:17).</p>

<p>No matter the individual's reasons for aiding the devil in their life and in the world, they have chosen to side against Christ. If we are not with Christ doing what He wants, we are against him.</p>

<blockquote>Matthew 12:30&mdash;He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</blockquote>


<h3>The Content of their Judgment</h3>

<h4>The Wine of the Wrath of God.</h4>
<blockquote>Revelation 14:10&mdash;&hellip;wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His indignation&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>This judgment promised is an undiluted ("without mixture") concentration of punishment from God Almighty poured into the cup of God's anger. The offenders are then made to drink of that cup to the full.</p>

<p>As wine is an intoxicating and overwhelming drink so it is used in Scripture to symbolize these effects (Psalm 60:3). There is the Wine of the Spirit which is an abundant joy in Holy Ghost, but there is also the Wine of Wrath or Violence which parallels the poisoned cup of certain criminals who were obliged to drink and which caused a speedy death.</p>

<p>These will drink of the cup of God's indignation because they chose to drink of the cup of iniquity and spiritual fornication (Revelation 14:8). We are all born in sin and condemned to drink of God's wrath, but Christ died and drank that bitter cup so we would not have to (Luke 22:42).</p>

<blockquote>Hebrews 2:9&mdash;But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</blockquote>

<h4>Fire and Brimstone</h4>

<p>Tormented (torture, pain) with fire and brimstone (sulphur) as Sodom and Gomorrah and the rich man in hell (Luke 16:23).</p>


<h4>The Two Phases of their Judgment</h4>
<h5>In the Presence of the Holy Angels and of the Lamb. </h5>
<p>Presence, face, in sight of, before.</p>

<h5>In the Lake of Fire</h5>

<blockquote>Revelation 20:10&mdash;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</blockquote>

<h4>The Duration of their Judgment</h4>
<h3>The Smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever</h3>
<h3>They have no rest day nor night</h3>
<p>Matthew 25:46; Mark 3:29; 2 Thessalonians 1:9</p>

<h2>Allegiance to the True Christ (vs. 12-13)</h2>

<p>During the day of God's Wrath not all will be found in confederacy with devil. They will not conform to the Beast's system for any reason at all. These are tribulation saints.</p>

<h3>The Saint's Description</h3>

<h4>They Are Patient</h4>
<p>2 Thessalonians 1:4; Hebrews 6:15; James 5:11; Revelation 1:9</p>

<h4>They Keep His Commandments</h4>
<p>They not all profess allegiance, but their loyalty is evidenced by their obedience (John 14:15).</p>
<h4>They Have the Faith of Jesus</h4>

<h3>The Saint's Blessedness</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 14:13b&mdash;&hellip;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours;&hellip;</blockquote>

<h3>The Saint's Rewards</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 14:13c&mdash;&hellip;and their works do follow them.</blockquote>

<p>Wood, hay and stubble versus gold, silver and precious stone. Their reward is based on their motive and their faithfulness in that allegiance.</p>

<p>When missionary George Atley was killed by a band of hostile tribesmen, he was carrying a fully loaded, 10-chamber Winchester rifle. He had to choose whether to defend himself or or with his life defend the fragile mission work in that foreign land. When his body was later found in a stream, Nearby lay his rifle:all 10 chambers still loaded. He had made the supreme sacrifice, motivated by his burden for lost souls and his unswerving devotion to his Savior.</p>

<p>Writing on Philippians 1:20 in The Bible Knowledge Commentary, Robert P. Lightner said,:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">Paul's concern was not what would happen to him but what testimony would be left for his Lord. Release would allow him to continue preaching Christ. But martyrdom would also advance the cause of Christ.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Philippians 1:20&mdash;According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</blockquote>

<h1>Reaping and Pressing (Revelation 14:14-20)</h1>



<h2>Foundation for the Biblical Harvests</h2>

<p>Deuteronomy lists the major crops of the land of promise:</p>
<blockquote>Deuteronomy 8:8&mdash;A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;</blockquote>

<h3>Three Harvest Seasons</h3>
<img id="harvest-seasons-israel" src="/assets/revelation/harvest-seasons-in-israel.gif" />

<p>In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest. Let us highlight the two of the three major crops because they relate directly to our text in Revelation 14.</p>



<h4>Grain Harvest (Spring)</h4>
<p>Barley and wheat were the most important crops of the spring harvest. Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Pentecost was celebrated near the end of the grain harvest with grain and loaf offerings (Leviticus 23:16-17). Newly harvested grain could not eaten until the offering of the firstfruits to God was first made. Pentecost was also called the &quot;The Feast of Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Feast of Weeks&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>Exodus 23:16&mdash;And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</blockquote>

<h4>Grape Harvest (Summer)</h4>

<p>After Pentecost, most of the harvest was fruit: grapes, olives, dates, figs, pomegranates and numerous fruits, seeds and vegetables of lesser importance. Grapes were the first major crop to ripen. In a good year, when the grain yield was great, threshing and grape picking overlapped. The grape harvest was usually completed before the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>

<h3>Two Festival Seasons: Spring Feasts and Fall Feasts</h3>

<p>The three harvesting seasons were celebrated by two major festival seasons. The Spring Feasts of Passover, Firstfruits, Unleavened Bread, and Pentecost teach of the beginning of Christ's ministry and the Fall Feasts of Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacles represent the completion of His ministry.</p>

<p>Consider these feasts in sequence:</p>

<h4>Spring Feasts (May/June)</h4>
<h5>Passover&mdash;God passed over the Israelites when he killed the Egyptian firstborn.</h5>
<h5>First Fruits&mdash;The first fruits are the first to come and are specially dedicated to God as a reminder that all good things come from God. It also was a pledge of a greater harvest to follow.</h5>
<h5>Unleavened Bread&mdash;A Memorial of Israel&apos;s hasty exodus from Egypt.</h5>
<h5>Pentecost&mdash;Pentecost (Shavuot) was originally a festival for expressing thankfulness to the Lord for the blessing of the harvest. </h5>

<h4>Fall Feasts (September-October)</h4>
<p>These feasts, which became known as "The High Holy Days", celebrated in the 7th month marked the conclusion of the religious year.</p>

<h5>Trumpets (1st day of 7th month)&mdash;The feast that called people to prepare to stand before the judgment of God. Instead of celebratory it was spent in private and grave introspection&mdash;fasting and prayer.</h5>
<h5>Atonement (10th day of 7th month)&mdash;The importance of the Day of Atonement is revealed by the fact that in the Talmud the name was shortened to simply "The Day." Celebrates God's Creation and God's new creation through atonement. A new beginning celebrated having been cleansed from sin. Day of Atonment represented the conclusion of the judgment that began ten days earlier.</h5>
<h5>Tabernacles (15th day of 7th month)&mdash;The Feast of Tabernacles, also known as the Feast of Booths and Sukkot, is the seventh and last feast that the Lord commanded Israel to observe. God delivered Israel out of the land of Egypt and they were to live in a temporary tabernacle for eight days and look forward to the coming Messiah.</h5>

<blockquote>Luke 12:37&mdash;Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching:&hellip;</blockquote>

<h2>Reaping of the Harvest (vs. 14-16)</h2>

<blockquote>Revelation 14:15&mdash;And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</blockquote>

<h3>&hellip;Thrust in Thy Sickle&hellip;</h3>

<blockquote>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</blockquote>
<img id="christ-crown-cloud-sickle" src="/assets/revelation/christ-crown-cloud-sickle.png" />
<p>Execute the judgments which God has decreed. It is time for the judgment&mdash;no more delay or waiting. God has waited, but no more! The Lord coming in a white cloud speaks both of righteousness and judgment. </p>
<ul>
<li>White/Righteousness (Matthew 17:2; Revelation 3:5,18; 4:14; 7:9; 19:8). </li>
<li>Cloud/Judgment (Matthew 17:5; Luke 21:27; Revelation 1:7).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Revelation 1:7&mdash;Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of <u>the earth shall wail because of him</u>. Even so, Amen.</blockquote>

<p>Sitting on the cloud, He is in a position of rulership. Christ is seen here ruling in judgment. It is Christ for John says "like unto the Son of Man" (Revelation 1:13).</p>

<p>On His Head is a Golden Crown (His church in glory and already awarded; I Cor. 6:1-3; Rev. 4:4; II Timothy 4:8) and in His hand is a sharp sickle. The sickle is a hooked knife and harvesting instrument used to pluck, gather, or cut.</p>

<h3>&hellip;For the Harvest of the Earth is Ripe&hellip;</h3>
<p>The cup of iniquity is full. Their sins are ripe or ready for judgment. Sin has ripened to the harvest.</p>

<h3>&hellip;And the Earth was Reaped&hellip;</h3>
<p>What plagues descend with the sharp sickle! What a cutting down and devastation.</p>

<h2>Pressing of the Vintage (vs. 17-20)</h2>
<img id="pressing-wine" src="/assets/revelation/treading-wine.jpg" />
<p>After the grain harvest comes the grape harvest. The grapes are cut down and then placed in the wine press. This pressing will be performed by God himself in a place called Armageddon.</p>

<h3>The Gathering into the Great Wine Press of the Wrath of God</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 16:14-16&mdash;For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</blockquote>

<p>This is the harvest of the "earth" and judgment not on a local but global scale. All the nations will be gathered: the kings, leaders, armies, antichrist, false prophet, and the followers of the beast.</p>

<p>Armageddon is a name occurring only once in the Bible and designating the place where the last great battle of the ages will take place. Armageddon is a Hebrew word, although it does not occur in the Old Testament. Its meaning is not exactly clear, but it is best taken to mean Mount Megiddo, since "Har" in Hebrew means mountain and "Mageddon" is the place-name of Megiddo.</p>

<p>In Old Testament history Megiddo was a place of numerous decisive battles because of the broad plain that stood before it. Deborah and Barak defeated Sisera and his Canaanite army there (Judges 4-5), Gideon drove off the Midianites and Amalekites ( Judges 6 ), Saul and the army of Israel were defeated because of their failure to trust in God ( 1 Sam 31 ), and the Egyptian army under Pharaoh Neco killed Josiah, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 23:29 ).</p>

<p>Some take John's designation literally, expecting the armies of the earth to gather against God in the endtimes below the remains of Old Testament Megiddo; others see in it a more figurative element. They point out that Megiddo was not really a mountain at all and that the battle will take place in the plain. Perhaps John designated it Mount Megiddo as a clue to its symbolic meaning, drawing together the historic place of conflict in Israel's history with the prophecies of Ezekiel that speak of the great end-time conflict taking place in the mountains of Israel ( Ezekiel 39:2,4, 17 ).</p>

<h3>The Treading in the Great Wine Press of the Wrath of God</h3>

<p>Grapes would be tossed into the winepress, and then a person or persons would stomp on the grapes with their feet until all the grape juice was pressed out. The Wine press is the wrath of God and these grapes are all the enemies of God.</p>

<blockquote>Isaiah 63:1-3&mdash;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. 2 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Psalm 2:9&mdash;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Revelation 14:20&mdash;And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">And the winepress was trodden without the city, eternally without the city of the heavenly Jerusalem, and far from the presence of God; eternally crushed and trodden down by his justice; eternally tormented in body and soul, without any hope either of living or dying! This is the miserable lot and portion of those who shall have despised the law of God, and died in impenitence. My God, pierce my heart with a salutary dread of thy judgments!&mdash;Adam Clarke </blockquote>

<p>A lake of blood to the size of 200 sqaure miles and as high as a horse's bridle! Such a slaughter is the end sin brings. Christ is victor over all His enemies. Revelation 19:13 tells us His vesture is "dipped with blood" and his name is "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS".</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As there were intertwined the harvesting and the festivals, so in the midst of the end of all things and God's judgment is both the God-ward and man-ward side of all things. God ultimately reaps the harvest and humanity is that harvest. There will be a harvest of the wicked as well as in in-gathering (as the crops are ready) of the Believers. God is allowing the tares and wheat to grow together, but soon there will be an ingathering and distinction made.</p>

<blockquote>Matthew 13:30&mdash;Let both grow together until the harvest:&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>The first-fruits is an in-gathering dedicated entirely to and for God.</p>

<blockquote>2 Timothy 2:19&mdash;Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</blockquote>

#Judgment on the False Church (17)

Chapter seventeen tells about the judgment of the False Church who is called the &quot;Mother of Harlots&quot; because of her spiritual adultery. Harlotry is symbolic of false worship or the worship of idols (idolatry). 

This woman will be a one-world church and as is all false religion will be attended with lewdness. Region has never been so rich, so powerful, united and so unclean.

##The Time of the Judgment

> Revelation 17:3&mdash;So he carried me away in the spirit&hellip;

The False Church will suffer this prophesied judgment in the End-Time. She is an End-Time False Church and will face her judgment in the time of the end.

##The Place of the Judgment

> Revelation 17:3&mdash;&hellip;into the wilderness&hellip;

In a general sense, the wilderness is a place of testing and more specific to Revelation it is symbolic of the tribulation period that takes place just before the Lord returns (12:14). This false church will be in control for most of the tribulation hour.

##The Receiver of the Judgment

<p>In the midst of judgment within a spiritual wilderness, we see a glorious promise.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 17:14&mdash;These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</blockquote>
<p>We see the action and the resulting end of the False church, Antichrist and the powers that rule with him. They make war with the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them! For He is Lord of lords and King of kings. There are those who set themselves in opposition to the Great King, but in this verse we also see some are "with Him". Herein is a promise to some, that they can overcome WITH the Lamb. These are the Called, Chosen and Faithful of God. These are the army of the Lamb.</p>

<h1>Fall of Babylon the Great (Ch. 18)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mystery Babylon is a place as well as a system. The System has two parts: Religious (Ch. 17) and Commercial (Ch. 18). The fall of Babylon is mentioned twice (17:16 and 18:21) because there are two stages to her judgment. First, the religious part of the system will be judged and then the commercial part of the system.</p>
<p>In the judgment upon the religious part of the system (Ch. 17), she is put down and taken over by the Antichrist. This will unite religion and commerce, making the State (Antichrist) supreme. Babylon the Great, in final revelation, is a city ruled over by the Antichrist as both the religious and political head. She becomes abundantly rich in carnal wealth for her aid to the devil.</p></p>
<p>Both the place and the system of &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; will suffer greatly for her role in the Antichrist's efforts. </p>
<p>It is important to note, that presently, there is no city &quot;Babylon&quot;. If the place &quot;Babylon&quot; (50 miles south of modern Iraq) is to be included in this judgment, Babylon as a city must first be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The important detail concerning Babylon is not where on a map can we place her, but what is she guilty of that incurs such severe action from God. Babylon in Chapters 17 and 18, is at the very least symbolic of both a religious system (ch. 17) and a commercial system (ch. 18) that become God's enemies.</p>
<h2>The Announcement of her Judgment (vs. 1-8)</h2>
<h3>The Announcing Angel, vs. 1-3</h3>
<p>A glorious messenger appears from out of heaven.</p>
<h4>He Comes with Great Authority</h4>
<p>All power and authority truly belongs to God! (Daniel 7:14; John 5:26-27; 1 Corinthians 15:24)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 5:25&mdash;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>The Earth is Lighted with His Glory</h4>
<p>This is never said describing created beings, but is often said of God! (Psalm 72:18,19; Isaiah 6:1-3; Ezekiel 43:2; Revelation 1:13-16; 21:23)</p>
<h4>He Cries Mightily with a Strong Voice</h4>
<h3>The Calling Out of God's People, vs. 4-8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 18:4&mdash;And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the mighty word goes into effect, a voice from heaven (probably, the Father) says come out of her, my people. His people are warned to avoid getting caught up in the marketing of the evil system. (An effective advertisement is one that convinces you that you need something.) </p>
<ul>
<li>Come Out of her</li>
<li>Call on Jesus </li>
<li>Repent of Sin</li>
<li>Be Born of the Spirit (Not a soul-ish or intellectual thing, but a spiritual experience.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Satans really merchandise is the souls of men. He takes advantage of and seeks to rob a man of his soul. What do we want? Faith or Feeling. Bible or Psychology. (1 Corinthians 13:45) The devil employs all manner of means in this market: business, religion, drugs, sex, gossip, lustful and rebellious music, </p>
<h2>The Reaction to Her Judgment (vs. 9-20)</h2>
<p>The fall of Babylon is one of the most marvelous events of all time (i.e., the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah). Consider how this would effect the whole world and even how it would effect you. Her fall is a great disappointment to many as just at her height of success she is destroyed. All the schemes of human progress are left disappointed and many will lament. , but there are mixed reactions to her judgment for two worlds are involved. There some who will rejoice while others are crying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 18:9,20&mdash;And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, 20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lamentation</h3>
<h4>Lamenting of Royalty, vs. 9-10</h4>
<h4>Lamenting of Merchants, vs. 11-16</h4>
<h4>Lamenting of Shipmasters, vs. 17-19</h4>
<p>But while these lament, a grand jubilee fills the sky!</p>
<h3>Rejoicing</h3>
<h4>The Heavenly Beings Rejoice</h4>
<h4>The Apostles Rejoice</h4>
<h4>The Prophets Rejoice</h4>
<h2>After her Fall (vs. 21-24)</h2>
<p>Re 18:21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
 22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
 23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</p>

<h1>O. 7 Last Plagues in Vials [15-16]</h1>

<p>Development of Final Judgment (Ch. 15)</p>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:5-8&mdash;And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 6 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction &quot;Another Sign&quot; (15:1)</h2>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:1&mdash;And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</blockquote>

<h3>The Time of the Sign</h3>

<p>The harvest of the grain and the vintage in Chapter 14, brings us to the end of this present age. So, the events in chapter 15 occur before or during the harvest.</p>

<h3>The Message of the Sign</h3>
<p>John sees another sign in Heaven. This is a &quot;sign&quot; just as in Revelation 12 John saw two signs: 1) The Sun-clothed Woman and 2) The Great Red Dragon. It with relevance to these that he calls this &quot;<u>another</u> sign&quot;.</p> 

<p>John uses the Greek word &quot;semeion&quot; in seven verses (12:1,3; 13:13,14; 15:1; 16:14; 19:20). &quot;Semeion&quot; means <i>a symbol or miraculous wonder</i>. The sign John sees here is a &quot;symbolic miracle or wonder&quot; Wonders and miracles are supernatural acts that prove a point or express a message. According to John 10:38, Jesus used miracles to communicate the message that He is God. </p>

<p>John does in fact see something, but as a sign, what John sees should be interpreted figuratively. John sees a wonder and the wonder with its details communicate a message. The detailed wonder John sees is symbolic, but the death and devastation it speaks of is very literal. Signs of healing accompany the preaching of the Gospel (Mark 16:17; 1 Corinthians 14:22); however, signs of death attend the end of the world.</p>

<h3>The Characteristics of the Sign</h3>

<p>John characterizes what he sees not only as a &quot;sign&quot;, but as &quot;great and marvellous&quot;. Respectively, these words are: </p>

<ul>
	<li>megas&mdash; large, mighty, strong (Matthew 8:24)</li>
	<li>thaumastos&mdash; wonderful, marvellous (1 Peter 2:9)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is <b>great</b> because it involves so much more in range and intensity than any catastrophe that has ever been. It is <b>marvellous</b> because of the unparalleled character of what it foretells. What it describes is altogether extraordinary and on an astounding scale.</p>

<h2>Tribulation Victors (15:2-4) </h2>

<p>Before giving the particulars of this great and marvellous sign, John interjects with another vision of a higher and more gracious order, though it is still connected with the outpouring of the plagues. When the wicked are cut off, the righteous will see it. When the plagues fall upon the anti-christ and his hosts, these victors are on high singing, harping and praising God, giving glory to God and to the Lamb!</p>

<h3>Their Position &mdash; The Sea of Glass</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:2&mdash;&hellip;a sea of glass mingled with fire&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>This reminds of the sea of glass in Revelation 4:6 which was spread out before the throne. There is a difference between these two verses. In Chapter 4, the sea of glass was &quot; like unto crystal&quot; in clearness, but in Chapter 15, the sea of glass is mingled with fire. Also, in Chapter 4, the sea appeared to be part of the pavement of heaven, but in Chapter 15, it appears as a mighty reservoir of just judgements about to be poured upon the world. The crystal sea is sort of base on which the whole celestial city is established&mdash;purity, vastness, strength. The sea mingled with fire is a sea of just judgements.</p>

<h3>Their Victory</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:2&mdash;&hellip;them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</blockquote>

<p>These will have complete victory over the beast (The Person), his image (The Doctrines), his mark (The System), and the number of his name (The Society). Their reward for victory is a position on the sea of glass in heaven, having harps and singing praises to God.</p>

<h3>Their Song</h3>

<p>Their song is an exultant testimony of God as victor.</p>

<h4>The Song of Moses</h4>

<p>We find Moses&apos; song in Exodus 15:1-11. It is a song celebrating deliverance from Egypt and the destruction of Pharaoh's host by God. The Book of Wisdom says that on this occasion in Exodus 15:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">God opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of infants eloquent</blockquote>

<p>As the Hebrews sang rejoicing by the Red Sea, so the Victorious Redeemed will sing by the Sea of Glass mingled with fire. God and therefore his saints will always have the last word!</p>

<h4>The Song of the Lamb</h4>

<p>The Song of the Lamb is redemption&apos;s song! ("I am Redeemed", "Thank God I am Free (saved, saved, saved)", "I've been to Calvary", etc. Here is recorded at least a part of their song.</p>

<blockquote>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</blockquote>

<h2>Seven Angels (vs. 5-6)</h2>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:5&mdash;&hellip;the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</blockquote>

<p>This tabernacle is in Heaven. The old tabernacle was merely a pattern of things in heaven (Hebrews 8:1-5; 9:23). The &quot;temple of the tabernacle&quot; references the inner tabernacle&mdash;the Most Holy Place or Holiest of All. It was in this tabernacle of testimony the Ark of the Testimony was kept. Therefore, these angels come from out of the Most Holy Place of Heaven&mdash;the throne of God was opened.</p>

<p>The angels are clothed in pure and white linen which speaks of righteousness. More important than their personal righteousness is the righteousness and holiness of the ministry these angels were to perform. As the priests ministered in the tabernacle in linen, speaking of Christ's righteousness and the ministry that they were performing, so these angels have a ministry.</p>

<p>They were girded with golden girdles. Gold speaks of Divinity and girdles speak of the truth.</p>

<blockquote>Revelation 1:13&mdash;And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</blockquote>

<p>Old Testament priest were girt with a girdle of a different material because it spoke of redemption, but the girdle here is of gold and the setting of Divine wrath. These priest-like angels have an administration of pouring out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>

<h2>The Giving of the Vials (vs. 7,8)</h2>

<blockquote>Revelation 15:7&mdash;And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</blockquote>

<p>Notice the mission of the Church in the judgement. One of the four beasts (a part of the church) gives the seven angels the seven golden vials full of the wrath of God.</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:2-3&mdash;Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</blockquote>

<p>Two other times scripture says the temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God was in 1 Kings 8:10,11 and Isaiah 6:1-4. &quot;No man was able to enter into the temple&quot;.</p>

<h1>Seven Last Plagues (Ch. 16)</h1>
<blockquote>Revelation 15:1&mdash;&hellip;in them is filled up the wrath of God.</blockquote>
<h2>Is This Prophecy Already Fulfilled?</h2>
<p>Some interpreters try to parallel these vials with definitive and mostly historical calamities:</p>
<ol>
	<li>FIRST: French Revolution in General</li>
	<li>SECOND: Naval Wars of the French Revolution</li>
	<li>THIRD: Battles of Napoleon in Italy</li>
	<li>FOURTH: Tyranny of Napoleon</li>
	<li>FIFTH: calamities which befell the city of Rome and the Pope in consequences of the French Revolution</li>
	<li>SIXTH: The wane of Turkish power and return of the Jews to Palestine along with the subtle influences of infidelity and popery.</li>
	<li>SEVENTH: Some further war with Romanism and disaster to the city of Rome.</li>
</ol>
<p>This line of interpretation leaves many difficult questions. Are France and Italy the whole earth? Has the tribulation hour even come yet? Are half a dozen naval battles the turning of the ocean into blood? Was Napoleon's artillery the sun scorch of blasphemers?</p>
<h2>What are these Vials?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 16:1&mdash;And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Vial&quot; is the Greek word &quot;phiale&quot; meaning a broad shallow cup. Phiale is used 12 times in the N.T. and all occurrences can be found in the book of Revelation.</p>
<ul>
<li>5:8 Vials full of prayers of the saints</li>
<li>15:7; 16; 17:1; 21:9 Seven Golden Vials full of the wrath of God</li>
</ul>
<p>The seven vials are full of the wrath of God. These seven vials are seven definitive and final judgments. (Revelation 15:1; 21:9 &quot; seven last plagues&quot;)</p>
<p>These plagues are not historical, but are the consummation of all plagues. The last will be the worst. The plagues of Egypt and other historical calamities are a mere rehearsal of that to come.</p>
<p>In the following actions, God&apos;s wrath is completely expressed. It climaxes and is ended. Not only does John describe these as the &quot;last&quot; plagues, but they are also seven in number which expresses completeness. By the time these seven plagues are accomplished, God&apos;s wrath upon the earth will be completed or satisfied.</p>
<p>The command to execute the plagues comes not just from the temple in general, but from out of the opened Holy of Holies in the temple of God in heaven (15:5; 16:1). In the Holy of Holies was kept the Ark which contained (Hebrews 9:3,4) a golden pot of manna, Aaron&apos;s rod that budded and two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. It is because of the Ark and its contents that this place is called &quot;the tabernacle of the testimony&quot; They were evidences or witnesses to the fact that the presence God was among his people.</p>
<p>As there are levels in the American Judicial system (District Court, Superior Court and Supreme Court) so, the fact that the Holiest place of the temple is involved speaks of an advanced judgment. this is it! There is no higher court or further level of appeal.</p>
<h2>What Events Lead Up to These Final Judgments?</h2>
<p>The order of these events are highlighted in the sequence we have found them in the scripture. As many of the events in chapters overlap others and some give further detail to events already discussed, this summary is not an attempt to create a chronological &quot;timeline&amp;quot. Following is a review of the truths as we discover them in reading through the Book of Revelation.</p>
<h3>Inspection, Remedy, Reward (Ch. 1-4)</h3>
<p>Christ made inspection and sent messages to His Church. Saints make corrections according to the Lord's warnings. Some hear and repent making themselves ready and others are spewed out of his mouth into 3 1/2 years of tribulation and awakening. Translated and Raptured believers are both seen around the throne of God.</p>
<h3>Seven Seals of a Book of Judgment Have Been Opened (Ch. 5 through 8:1)</h3>
<p>The Lamb of God was the only one worthy to open the Book and release its seals. These seals revealed calamities that are part of God's plan of judgment and not just the normal course of history. White, Red, Black and Pale Horses and their horseman revealed a moral war, Divine vengeance, famine, and a fourth part of the world dead. The Fifth Seal revealed the fact that the Tribulation Hour will involve many Christian martyrs. The Sixth Seal reveals fearful physical events&mdash;sun become black, moon became as blood, and stars fall. Finally, a silence falls over Heaven for one hour. </p>
<h3>Seven Trumpets Have Sounded (Ch. 8 through 11)</h3>
<p>Following the silence in Heaven, a Mystery Angel remembered the death of the martyrs. Seven other Angels then prepared to sound their trumpets. Not all at once, but one after another in increasing judgment their trumpets are sounded as the death of saints are a witness against the world. Since the servants of God now had been sealed (Ch. 7) the prohibition to not hurt the earth (7:3) is lifted. </p>
<h4>One, Two, Three, Four</h4>
<p>In the first four trumpets the blasts effected the material world: hail and fire mingled with blood devastate trees, grass and crops; a third part of the sea is made blood and a third both of its creatures and ships are destroyed; a third of the waters become poisonous (Wormwood); a third of the sun and moon and a third of the stars were darkened. </p>
<h4>Five, Six</h4>
<p>The door between the physical and spiritual worlds is opened: tormenting locusts are released from the bottomless pit; four bound fallen angels are released from the river Euphrates. </p>
<p>A Cloud Robed Angel declared possession of the earth and its people, proclaimed victory and held a scroll that revealed further bitter experiences to follow. The temple was measured for the reinstatement of the Jew. Two witnesses miraculously ministered and then were killed once their work was complete.</p>
<h4>Seven: The Coming of the Lord</h4>
<h3>Pre-Tribulation, Tribulation and Great Tribulation (Ch. 12 &amp; 13)</h3>
<p>John saw (Ch. 12) the signs of the Sun-clothed Woman, the Man Child, the Great Red Dragon, the War in Heaven, And the War with the Remnant of the Seed of the Woman. The eventual Period of Great Tribulation and the Rule of the Antichrist (Ch. 13) set the stage for these Seven Vials.</p>
<h2>The Results of the 7 Vials</h2>
<h3>ONE: The Followers of the Anti-christ, 16:2</h3>
<p>They will face noisome and grievous sores (Luke 16:20). These ulcers and stinging sores will be incurable.</p>
<h3>TWO: The Sea, vs. 3</h3>
<h3>THREE: The Rivers, vs. 4-7</h3>
<h3>FOUR: The Suns Heat Released, vs. 8-9</h3>
<h3>FIVE: The Throne of the Beast, vs. 10-11</h3>
<h3>SIX: The Gathering of the Nations (Armageddon, vs. 12-16)</h3>
<h3>SEVEN: The Judgment of the Nations, vs. 17-21</h3>


<h1>Q. The Marriage and Marriage Feast of the Lamb [19]</h1>

# Three Revelations of Who God Is

TEXT: Revelation 19

## Introduction

### That I May Know Him

> Philippians 3:10&mdash;**That I may know him**, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;

From behind the veil of the human condition, it is difficult to get a clear picture of God. We describe with limited vocabulary and understand him through limited experiences. 

Man often weighs in one hand, what the Bible says about God and then in the other hand weighs what we have experienced in this life. This method of "getting to know God" is faulty at best and has resulted in multitudes of skewed impressions of Who God is and what He is like.

- Is He Angry?
- Is he Love?
- Is FULL of mercy?
- Does he hate me?
- Will he receive me?

It is not God's fault humanity does not truly KNOW Him. It is the fault of our limited perspective. It will not be until "by-and-by" that even the most faithful of God's people will see and understand Him in His fullness. But, until then, it is a journey of faith that brings us closer and closer to God. 

Will I believe God is Who He says He is? Will I take Him at His Word? Will I pattern my life on the foundation of a faith that says, "God is True and Faithful?"

Today that faith is developed and tested, but one day it will be rewarded!

Blinded very young, hymn-writer Francis Jane Crosby (1820-1915) began writing poetry as young girl. At the age of eight she wrote these words: 

<blockquote class="quote">Oh, what a happy soul am I! Although I cannot see,<br> I am resolved that in this world, contented I will be.<br> How many blessings I enjoy that other people don&apos;t;<br> To weep and sigh because I am blind, I cannot, and I won&apos;t.</blockquote>

Once a well-intentioned Scottish minister remarked to her: &quot;I think it is a great pity that the master, when He showed so many gifts upon you, did not give you sight.&quot; She responded, &quot;Do you know that if at birth I had been able to make one petition to my Creator, it would have been that I should be born blind?&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot; asked the surprised minister.
&quot;Because, when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior.&quot;

In her hymn "My Savior First of All", she wrote&hellip;

<blockquote class="quote">When my lifework is ended and I cross the swelling tide, 
When the bright and glorious morning I shall see; I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side, And His smile will be the first to welcome me. <br> I shall know Him, I shall know Him, And redeemed by His side I shall stand; I shall know Him, I shall know Him By the print of the nails in His hand.</blockquote>

>2 Timothy 4:7-8&mdash;I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that **love his appearing**. [manifestation, (especially) the second coming of Christ]

### The Preface of Revelation 19

> Revelation 19:1mdash;And after these things&hellip;

We are at the end of the third and final division of the book of Revelation. In 19:1, "after these things" is the same phrase in 1:19 "things which shall be hereafter". In review, Revelation has three main divisions:

<div class="emb-outline">
	<h1>3 Main Divisions</h1>
	<h2>The Things Seen (Ch.1)</h2>
	<h2>The Things Which Are (Ch. 2-3)</h2>
	<h2>The Things Which Shall be Hereafter (Ch. 4-22)</h2>
</div>

>Revelation 1:19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

God is infinite and our understanding of him is constantly developing all the while He never changes. In Revelation chapter 19 we are given three different scenes that illuminate different aspects of God's nature. Herein are three revelations of Who God is:

<div class="emb-outline">
	<h1>Three Revelations of Who God Is</h1>
	<h2><a href="#first">The Lord Our God Omnipotent who Reigns (vs. 1-6)</a></h2>
	<h2><a href="#second">The Bridegroom Who Will be Wed (vs. 7-10)</a></h2>
	<h2><a href="#third">The Lion Who will Return in Judgment (vs. 11-21)</a></h2>
</div>

<bookmark id="first"/>
## The Lord Our God Omnipotent who Reigns (vs. 1-6)

### He Gave Us a Voice for Singing

I heard a great voice of much people in heaven

And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne

Revelation 19:4 is the last reference in the Bible to the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures (by those titles). 

v.6 the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, 

### He is the Words of the Song

&hellip;saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:

#### Alleluia/Hallelujah

The Hebrew word "halal" [STRONG's 01984] in relation to God means to be clear of sound or color or to shine. Therefore, it means to make a show, to boast or to celebrate. 'Halal' can be found in 140 verses in the O.T.

"Halal" [Hallelujah] is common in the Psalms where it is mostly translated "Praise Ye the LORD" (Psalm 105:45; 106:1; 106:48; 111:1; 112:1; 113:1; 146:1; 148:1; 149:1; 150:1).

> Psalm 150:1&mdash;Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.

Interestingly, in the N.T., Alleluia/Hallelujah can only be found here in Revelation 19. The Greek word "allelouia" is imperative just as the Hebrew word "halal". Alleluia is a command to Praise the Lord (Jah)! It is an adoring exclamation&mdash;HALLELUJAH!

##The Bridegroom Who Will be Wed (vs. 7-10)

The Lamb will be Wed

> 7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. 8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. 9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. 10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

## The Lion Who will Return in Judgment (vs. 11-21)
> 11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

### The Mystery of His Name
 12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
 
 (to his enemies: you don't even know me! (contrast on the cross, the sign written over His head! Mt 27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
 Mt 27:37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.)

 13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
 14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
 15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
 16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

An Invitation to another 'supper' is given:
 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
 18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.

 19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
 20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
 21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

##Conclusion

## The Bridegroom Who Will be Wed (vs. 7-10)
Revelation 19:7-10

### A Joyous Marriage and Marriage Supper

#### The Marriage Supper

> Revelation 19:7&mdash;Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come,&hellip; 

Now that the harlot has fallen, the faithful woman comes to her rightful honors. The bethrothed, now becomes a bride. The time of her marriage has come, and grand banquet that follows, will begin.

> Revelation 19:9&mdash;And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.

#### The Wedding

There is no question who the Bridegroom is, but who is the Bride?

Some say, that ALL who are born again make up the Bride. Let's consider Psalm 45 in light of this. Here is a brief outline of Psalm 45:8,9,14.

vs. 8 First, the King Comes Forth Out of the Ivory Palaces (Alone)
vs. 9 Second, the King with the Queen
vs. 14 Third, we see the virgins who are the companions, associates or bosom friends of the Queen

These virgins do not go with the Queen when she is taken, but they follow after her. 

> Psalm 45:14&mdash;She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee

We also see this truth in the parable of the ten virgins of Matthew 25. Implied in this parable is that not all those who finally get to heaven are of that class which makes up the Bride.

To understand who the Bride is, we need to observe the different classes of persons given in the text. 

1. The Voice of the one who says "Let us be glad", vs. 10
2. Those who are to rejoice with him ("us") vs. 9

These are considered blessed to a) witness the marriage and to b) participate in the banquet.

The Bride is not merely going to witness a marriage or eat a celebratory feast, but she is one of the two reasons for the grand day! She is the Bridegroom's heart's desire and the one He has chosen to unite with as one. (Amos 3:3; 2 Corinthians 6:14)

### The Preparation of the Lamb's Wife

> Revelation 19:7,8&mdash;&hellip;and his wife hath made herself ready. 8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

#### The Making of the Bride

How does this bride so capture the eye and heart of the groom? What has led her to this grand wedding day? Three things catch our notice in her preparation:

##### Her Self Activity - "made herself read"

The Bridegroom does not prepare her directly, but she will ready herself by applying what He has provided.

##### The Action of Bestowing of the Gifts of Grace- "to her was granted"
##### The Action of Faith and Obedience - "arrayed in fine linen"

The garments reveal the nature of preparation. The outstanding characteristics of her garments are: clean (free from impurity) and white (shining and brilliant). The fine lines she wears is the <dikaioma> "righteous acts" or "equitable deeds" of the saints. 

There is righteousness that is imputed by faith which is the free gift of God in Christ. There is also righteousness that is imparted which is the fruit or works of faith. Consider Philippians 3:8-14. In Psalm 45:13-14, her clothing is of wrought gold (divine righteousness) and her raiment is also of needlework (righteous acts or works of faith).

#### The Marks of the Bride

##### She Will have a Lamb's Nature
##### She Will be Meek and Lowly
##### Humble
##### Obedient
##### Overcomer

### The Marriage of the Lamb

What is the marriage of the Lamb? John did not see it, but he did hear the heavens rejoicing!

We can assume a few things about this "wedding" based on the terms used. Any marriage being a union, the Bride will be united with the Bridegroom. Being with Him, she will reign with him and share with Him in all His glorious inheritance.

We are not told what the ceremony will hold. It is still a grand and glorious mystery!

### John's Response

> Revelation 19:10&mdash;And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

# The Lion Who Will Return in Judgment

## Review:

<div class="emb-outline">
# Three Revelations of Who God Is</h1>
TEXT: Revelation 19

## Introduction - You can Know Who God Is and What He is Like (Phil. 3:10)
## The Lord Our God Omnipotent who Reigns (Rev. 19:1-6)
## The Bridegroom Who Will be Wed (Rev. 19:7-10)
## The Lion Who will Return in Judgment (vs. 11-21)
</div>

## Theme: Revelation 19:11-21

Revelation 19:11-21 is about the battle of the Great Day of the Lord. (Zephaniah 1:14; Revelation 16:14) This battle will be of great and yet righteous violence and vengeance.

### Violence

**Words of Battle**: &hellip; white horse &hellip; judge and make war &hellip; vesture dipped in blood&hellip; armies &hellip; sharp sword, &hellip;smite &hellip; rule &hellip; rod of iron &hellip; treadeth &hellip; fierceness and wrath .. eat the flesh &hellip; make war&hellip;beast was taken, and with him the false prophet&hellip;These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone&hellip;slain with the sword

### Vengeance

A search for "vengeance" in the Bible will result in at least 40 verses. And the context is almost always in reference to God taking vengeance on His enemies.

Read: Deut. 32:35; Psalm 94:1; Romans 12:19; Romans 3:5

> Deuteronomy 32:35 To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

<!-- -->

> Psalms 94:1 O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

<!-- -->

> Romans 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. (Leviticus 19:18)

<blockquote class="quote">The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury. &mdash;Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</blockquote>

God alone is God. We are never to usurp the AUTHORITY of God -- vengeance for spiritual wrong belongs exclusively to God.

<blockquote class="quote">On 17 June, Michel Servetus was convicted of heresy, "thanks to the 17 letters sent by John Calvin (Calvin agreed that those whom the ruling religious authorities determined to be heretics should be punished:), and sentenced to be burned with his books. Historians record his last words as: "**Jesus, Son of the Eternal God, have mercy on me**."</blockquote>

<!-- -->

Is God unrighteous in His vengeance? {"Do as I say and not as I do"?}

> Romans 3:5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)

<blockquote class="quote">Dictionary definition of Avenge: inflict hurt or harm on someone for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands. (to carry out a grudge)</blockquote>

Even deeper than the sense of carrying out a "grudge" is the sense that Scripture gives to revenge. In the scripture, in reference to God, revenge/avenge/vengeance has at its root meaning **PUNISHMENT**. God is not petty, he is righteous. We see God in our text not passionately out of control because of a vandetta, but we see **Christ in His Divine glory***.

## The Lion is a Mighty Conqueror (vs 11-16)

### Verse 11 He is Righteous and Glorious

> Revelation 19:11&mdash;And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

- Heaven Opened
- All the Judgments of God are righteous

### Verse 12 His Eyes, Crowns and Name

>12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

#### His Eyes were a Flame of Fire

Two things to consider: His omniscent perception and his omnipotent wrath.

#### On His Head Many Crowns

He is not just Judge and General, but He is also King. In 2 Samuel 12:30 when David defeated the Ammonites he put the crown of the vanquished king on his head. The Dragon has seven diadems as "possesor of the seven great world powers". (Rev. 12:3) The beast has ten crowns combining 10 soveriegn powers. (Rev. 13:1) The accumulation of crowns relates to the accumulation of victories and dominion.

#### He has an Unknowable Name

John saw that the name was written, but did not and could not record it as he was awed with its splendor making it too much for him to understand or know. (Matthew 11:27 the depth of God)

### Verse 13 Reputation, Purpose and Position of Christ

#### His Reputation
> &hellip;And he was clothed with a vesture.

His moral character or reputation is seen. He is not naked. He and all those in Heavenly places are clothed. Those who serve the devil are naked. (Mark 5:15 "legion"; Acts 19:16 "Sons of Sceva") 

He is clothed with a long inner garment (Rev. 1:13) and an outer garment ("vesture").

#### His Purpose
> &hellip; dipped in blood:&hellip;

The blood in this context is not His own, but are the bloodstains of His enemies. We see here the marks of a veteran mighty in battle. This is He who fought for Israel as He fought from Heaven against Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines and many others. Remember what happened to Dagon? (1 Samuel 5:1-7)

> Isaiah 63:1-4&mdash;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. 2 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. 4 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.

He is in our text wearing the "same garments" as then! He is coming in the same capacity for the same purpose and with the same invincible power.

#### His Position
> &hellip;and his name is called The Word of God. (John 1:1)

In our text, He is not coming at this time as a lamb to save, but as "the Word of God" / Judge. He will judge the world by His Word. Three names are given here indicating his position:

1. An Unknowable Name vs. 12
2. The Word of God vs. 13, 15

> Revelation 19:15&mdash;And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

3. King of Kings and Lord of Lords vs. 16

> Revelation 19:16&mdash;And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

### vs. 14 The Armies of Heaven

#### The Lion of Judah is Not Alone

When the Lord Jesus is revealed from Heaven in flaming fire taking vengeance upon them that know not God and that obey not the Gospel, He does not come alone.

> Revelation 19:14&mdash;And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

- His Army Will Include His Mighty Angels

> 2 Thessalonians 1:7,8&mdash;And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

Compare with 2 Kings 6:17 and Psalm 68:17;

- His Army will Include 10,000's of His Saints

Jude 1:14,15&mdash;And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

Saints from all ages of time, make up the armies of the sky. Notice that the Bride goes to Heaven in a Battle (Revelation 12:7) and then comes again in a battle (Revelation 19:14).

#### They Followed Him

He is the commander who gives the orders. They do His bidding. In Matthew 26:53 He could have called 12 legions of angels, but He died alone. (A Roman legion consisted of about six thousand soldiers, or upwards.)

#### Upon White Horses

#### Clothed in Fine Linen, white and clean

#### They Wear no Armor

## The Lion's Last Battle (vs. 17-21)

### Some Background on this Battle

#### The Demise of Satan throughout Scripture

Christ is always the victor. Lucifer rebelled and fell to the condemnation of the devil. Satan deceived Eve, but out of a woman came the seed of the Redeemer! Jesus Christ was betrayed or forsaken by those closest to Him through the wiles of the devil, but three days later Up from the Grave Christ Arose! In the last days, the devil will deceive many, but God will still have his faithful and holy remnant.

We are in a time, when evil appears to advance his cause without much opposition. No matter the appearances, satan is a defeated foe. We are commanded to resist, defend against and oppose the devil in daily battles. But Christ will have the final say-so and a final "battle" will END the Wicked One and his servants.

> 2 Thessalonians 2:8&mdash;And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:

#### The Gathering and Wine Press in Revelation 14:14-20

Revelation 14 describes Christ coming as one like unto the Son of man sitting on a white cloud. Having in His hand a sharp sickle, the following judgment is described as both a "gathering of harvest" and a "wine press of wrath".

> Revelation 14:19-20&mdash; And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. 20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

<!-- -->

>Revelation 19:15&mdash;&hellip;he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

#### The 6th vial in Revelation 16:12-16

Revelation 16 told us that the location of this great battle would be in Armageddon. On the human side, the kings of the earth are inspired to gather together against God by evil spirits.

> Revelation 16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

<!-- -->

> Revelation 16:16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

#### Making War with the Lamb in Revelation 17:14

Revelation 17:14 describes the kings of the earth as making war with the lamb, but the Lamb and those that are with Him overcome them.

> Revelation 17:14 These [the ten kings of the earth] shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

### An Invitation to this Battle

An Invitation to another 'supper' is given:
 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
 18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.

 19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
 20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
 21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

## Conclusion

<h1>R. Millenial Kingdom [20:1-10]</h1>

#Binding for 1000 Years and Loosing of Satan

text: Revelation 20:1-3, 7-10

##Satan Sealed in a Bottomless Pit (vs. 1-3)

Re 20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

##Souls Living and Reigning with Christ 1000 Years (vs. 4-6)

(covered in future lesson)

##Following the 1000 Years (vs. 7-10)

After the 1000 year reign, the devil be released, deceive the nations and finally face his doom.

### Satan will be released for a season (vs. 7)

Satan is loose, will then be bound, but released again and then punished. It seems like a great pity after 1,000 year of peace for the devil to be released, but it will be necessary. Verse 3 says that he "MUST BE LOOSED". There are three perspectives to consider when tackling this mystery.

####The Perspective of the Devil

It will prove that no matter how much time goes by and opportunity given him, he will always be the devil. He doesn't improve. It will be righteous to judge him eternally.

####The Perspective of Humanity

The nations during this 1,000 years need the grace and help of God, just as much as anyone. The loosing of the devil will prove that man's hasn't changed. The devil will still be deceiving and humanity that does not lean hard on God will still be deceived.

####The Perspective of God

God will have exhausted every measure of grace throughout the dispensations of time. An eternal hell would not be justified for a loving God, unless He first extended every possible invitation. (He tried everything and gave His best.) There will be no regrets or "what if God had done something differently" in eternity.

### Satan will deceive the nations (vs. 8)

He deceives the nations and terrible disaster ensues. It is the devil who has opened "Pandora's Box".

### Satan will face his doom (vs. 9-10)

Hell was specially prepared for the devil. Mathew 25:41

##Great White Throne Judgment (vs. 11-15)

(covered in future lesson)

# 1000 Year Reign

text: Revelation 20:4-6

>Revelation 20:4-6&mdash;And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

## What is so confusing about a Millennial Reign?

Our text tells us some will live and reign with Christ 1,000 years. Millennnial simply means relating to a a period of 1,000 years. It is a fairly universal Christian doctrine that this "Millenial Reign" will take place, but there is also much debate concerning the details of this doctrine.

Let us categorize and consider some of the points made in this debate. For brevity we will refer to the period of time of the Millenial Reign as "the Reign".

### Premillennialism

The Reign begins with the Second Coming of Christ and will last exactly 1,000 literal years. The Reign will be a physical one located on the earth. The Reign will be preceded by a literal 7 years of tribulation that concludes with the literal return of Christ on earth. There is great diversity of thought among Premillenialists concerning the timing of the Rapture. Premillenialism can present the timing of the Rapture in at least four ways:

1. It takes place before the tribulation.
2. It takes place mid-way through the tribulation.
3. It takes place after the tribulation.
4. It takes place before the Wrath of God is poured out on the earth.

Simply said, Premillennialists can be either Pre-tribulation, Mid-tribulation, Post Tribulation, Pre-Wrath or even "we don't know when" Rapturists. One thing is agreed upon, the Rapture will take place.

Many premillennialists believe that God will fulfill many unfilled promises to Israel during the Reign.

[Chuck Swindoll, John Walvoord, the Left Behind Series, Dallas Theological Seminary ]

### Amillennialism

Amillennism (Greek a- "no" + "millennialism) is the rejection of the belief that Christ will have a 1000 year long physical reign on the earth. The Reign began in Heaven with Christ's resurrection and will last an undetermined number of years, but does end at the Second Coming of Christ. The Reign is characterized as strictly spiritual and accomplished through conversion of the lost. The Tribulation will be a brief period of suffering at the end of the Reign and before Christ's Second Coming. The Tribulation does not last any definite number of years, but it is definitely brief in relation to the time-line of all history. The rapture takes place as part of Christ's Second Coming at the conclusion of the Tribulation period.

[Covenant theologians, Lutherans, a minority of Baptists, Catholics, most Presbyterian and Reformed churches, Hank Hanegraff, and R.C. Sproul. Even as early as Justin Martyr&apos;s time (138-165 A.D.) he said genuine Christians disagreed on the literal millennium. Even in the early church both groups accepted each other in Christ. ]

### Postmillennialism

Postmillenialism views Second Coming of Christ as happening after a golden age of Christian prosperity. The Reign begins when a majority of the of the population is converted (reference: Matthew 24:14). The Reign lasts for an indefinite time until Christ's Second Coming and not a literal 1000 years (1000 years is interpreted simply as "a long period of time"). Like in Amillennialism the Reign is a spiritual and not physical one. The Tribulation will be a brief period that takes place before Jesus' Second Coming. The Rapture takes place as part of the Second Coming of Christ.

As similar as Amillennialism and Postmillenialism are, its difficult to tell them apart. Both emphasize a non-literal interpretation and deny the Reign taking place literally on earth. One major difference is that Postmillenialism holds that the Reign is happening right now and that the world will increasingly get better as we approach Christ's return. Christ will return after Christians and not Christ have well established God's Kingdom on the earth.

## Who will take Part in this Administration? (vs. 4,5)

At least three groups of people are mentioned in our text or elsewhere in Scripture in connection with judging the world.

### The Overcomers

#### "And I Saw Thrones"

These are seats of authority.

>Revelation 3:21&mdash;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

<!-- -->

>Revelation 12:5&mdash;And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

#### "And They Sat Upon Them"

The seats are occupied.

#### "And Judgment was Given Unto Them"

These have been trusted with discretionary power to act.

>Matthew 24:46-47&mdash;Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. 47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.

We can compare this scene with that in Acts 26:6. In Acts 26, Paul is the one being judged, but in our text, it is the saints who are administrating the judgment.

>1 Corinthians 6:2&mdash;2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? &hellip;

### The Martyrs

#### "And I Saw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus"

##### Why Were They Beheaded?

These martyrs had been beheaded for their witness of Jesus and the Word of God. They had resisted worship of the beast and the receiving of his mark.

1. Witness of Jesus
2. Stood for Truth
3. Refused False Worship
4. Refused the mark of the Beast.

Their resistance meant an end to natural life, but they had eternal life.

##### How Do They Live Again?

Those Christian martyrs are to be resurrected and will LIVE and REIGN with Christ 1,000 years.

>vs. 4&hellip;they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years

John clarifies that this resurrection is partial and that not all the dead are resurrected at this time. The remaining dead will not be resurrected until AFTER the 1,000 Year Reign.

### What is the Meaning of this Special Blessing? (v. 6)

There are some who will enjoy the special blessing of taking part in the first resurrection, overcoming the second death, being priests of God and Christ and reigning with Jesus 1,000 years on the earth.

What do some of these terms mean?

1. First Resurrection
2. Second Death
3. Priests of God and of Christ
4. 1000 Year Reign

<h1>S. Last Judgment [20:11-15]</h1>

# Great White Throne Judgment

text: Revelation 20:11-15

## The Judge of this Court (vs. 11)

A Great White Throne and Him that Sat on It

> 11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

Compare this Throne with details given in Revelation 4 (vs. 11). 
1. chapter Four described the throne of God just as the judgments of God on the earth were to begin. That throne was set in Heaven, but in Revelation 20 we are not told where this is set.

2. The first has a rainbow around it signifying God's covenant and promises. This was the revelation of grace and mercy. This throne is naked for it has no hopes, no covenant of good in Hell.

3. The firsth had lightnings, thunders and voices which are indicators of warning. To this throne is nothing like that ascribed but greatness and whiteness. Immeasurable power and pure justice. No more warning, probation. This is the "third strike".

4. The first had 7 burning torches and seven spirits of God. The fulness of Redemption. This is accompanied with nothing gracious.

5.the first had beforre it a glassy sea. Here nothing celestial is visible.

6. The first had singing and joyful exultation, the giving of praises to God and the lamb and rewards for righteousness. Here is no song or voice of gladness. 
 
## The Standard of Proof of this Court (vs. 12)

The amount of evidence which a plaintiff or prosecuting attorney must present in a trial in order to win is called the standard of proof. Different cases require different standards of proof depending on what is at stake. 

### There at least 3 common standards of proof in courts of law: 

1. "beyond a reasonable doubt"
2. "clear and convincing evidence"

This standard is often applied to civil cases. According to this standard a person has to prove that it is "more likely than not" that the defendant committed the crime. This standard is not as strict as "beyond a reasonable doubt".

3. "preponderance of evidence"

### This Court's Standard of Proof

1. "beyond all doubt"

The Judge will require no third-hand testimony. He is the "Faithful and True Witness". Jesus Christ is the incriminating witness against all who reject God's plan of salvation.

> Revelation 3:14&mdash;And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; 

<!-- -->

> Proverbs 15:3&mdash;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.

In this court, the standard of proof will be "beyond all doubt". God does not make mistakes.

2. Judged Out of the Books 

> 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

Judged out of the book according to God's law and not the law of man. Each biography will be opened.

1. Demas - The backslider, I preached and sang and lost it
2. Agrippa - Almost I became a Christian
2. Ananias and Sapphira - I love God, I just want to have the world at the same time. (Professed it, but didn't live it)
2. Judas Iscariot - Lived, walked, called by Jesus and even obtained part of the ministry, yet he traded his soul for 30 pieces of silver. (Matthew 26:15)
3. Herod - Why didn't you give up your unlawful wife? I loved her too much.
4. King Ahab - My wife is to blame. 
5. King Saul - I wanted to please the people.
6. Cain - I thought my offering was just as good as my brothers.

When placed in the context of eternal judgment our excuses for sin are so trivial!

## The Jurisdiction of this Court (vs. 13)
13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.


## The Severity of this Court (vs. 14)
14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

God is not soft on sin!

## The Failure to Appear Rate of this Court (vs. 15)

In our legal systems, when you miss a court date you cannot always "make it up". Failure to appear in court means you could be facing additional criminal charges. Civil judges expect you to show up, but someone could attempt to jump bail. For the courtroom scene in Revelation 20, there is no possibility of "failing to appear".

The State of Maine's Maine Pretrial Services claims a "failure to appear rate" of less than 1% of its clients. That is pretty good, but not as good a rate as the Great White Throne Judgment. There will be a judgment and all will be there (Rev. 6:15). There will be no place to escape this appointment. There will be no jumping bail&mdash;failure to appear rate: 0%.

This will require a resurrection

Roll Call for a Hell Bound Train 

> Revelation 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

> Psalm 9:17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.

James Reynolds -- They say Hell is a place without the presence of God, but that is not altogether true. Hell is a place filled with God's wrath&mdash; no love, no mercy, no grace. Hell will never experience joy or peace.

- Hell is a place of torment
- Hell is a place of crying (everyone)
- Hell is a place of memories (prayers of loved ones, godly counsel ignored, pleas of loved ones, times of conviction, times of nearness to God, 
- Hell is a place of no rest (not physically, mentally or spiritually. eternal exhaustion) Isaiah 57:20,21 (no peace to the wicked)
- Hell is a place of profanity (Rev. 16:11)
- Hell will be void of singing (only moaning and screaming)
- Hell will be filled with demons (tormenting and biting Acts 7:54)
- Hell is a place of darkness
- Hell is a place of unbridled passion

Hell is a terrible place and it was not made for man (Matthew 25:41). God does not want anyone to go to hell (2 Peter 3:9). God does not send anyone to hell so much as each one there chose it for themselves (Hebrews 10:29): 1) They refused the remedy , 2) insulted the Grace of God, 3) pushed aside the prayers of the righteous and 4) rejected the Love of God.


<h1>T. All Things New [21:1-27; 22:1-5]</h1>

# New Heaven and New Earth

TEXT: Revelation 21

>Revelation 21:1&mdash;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

## Introduction

John sees that there will be a new heaven and a new earth and then he describes in awesome detail, "New Jerusalem".

John applies the descriptions of walls, gates, a tabernacle and foundations and even calls what he sees in a lot of places a "city". But, John also compares what he sees with "a bride adorned" and names it in one place "the lamb's wife".

John describes what he sees coming out of heaven from God as a "holy city", "new Jerusalem", "as a bride adorned", "tabernacle of God", "great city", "holy Jerusalem", "the Bride" and "the Lamb's Wife".

Who or what is this "city" like? Is it a place or a person? (vs. 9) In order to understand this "great city", we must carefully consider the details as John laid them out for us.

## The End and The Beginning (vs. 1-8)

The "end" John sees is not an "extinction" but a transition&mdash; made new!

### First Glimpse (vs. 1,2)

Heaven and Earth. John's first impression is that he is seeing something somewhat familiar, and yet it is altogether different. He says he sees a "new earth" and yet it is an earth with no sea. He says he sees a "new heaven" and yet it is a heaven where the veil between it and earth is removed.

Then John sees another "new" thing. It is New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven like as if it were a "young married or betrothed woman" who is ready for her husband as she has put everything in proper order and is beautifully decorated. 

### A Proclamation (vs. 3-8)

The great voice (THE Voice!) proclaims what God is going to do.

#### Dwell with Men (vs. 3)

Notice that New Jerusalem comes "down from God" and from "out of heaven" in verse 2. This is not a description of God's people finally going to heaven to be with God or "men with God". What John sees is more accurately understood as "God with men".

> Revelation 21:3&mdash;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.

#### Bring an End to Former Things (vs. 4-8)

> Revelation 21:6&mdash;And he said unto me, **It is done**. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end&hellip; 

There are many awesome advantages to this new arrangement:

1. No More Tears
2. No More Death
3. No More Sorrow or Crying
4. No More Pain
5. No More Thirst
6. No More Battles
7. No More Unbelief

## A Tour of New Jerusalem (vs. 9-27)

> 9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, 

I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

### The Vantage Point (vs. 10)

#### In the Spirit

> And he carried me away in the spirit

#### A Great and High Mountain

> to a great and high mountain, 

### The Descriptions (vs. 10-

1. A City (vs. 10)

and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, 

2. Comes out of Heaven from God (vs. 10)
descending out of heaven from God,

3. Having the Glory of God (vs. 11)
11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

4. 12 Gates, 12 Angels and 12 Names (vs 12,13,21, 25-27)

and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
 13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.

ALL MAY BE SAVED

25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
 26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
 27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

5. A Wall with 12 Foundations (vs. 12,14-20)
12 And had a wall great and high, 

- 12 Foundations

 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

- Measuring the Wall

 15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
 16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
 17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

 18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.
 19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. 

> In the heavenly city we have harmony, not monotony; variety, not sameness; unity, not uniformity. The stones are not arranged in the order of the high priest&apos;s breastplate, but according to their various shades of colour, beginning from the foundation.&mdash;Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers 

NOTE: The following are merely educated guesses as to the actual gems referred to in Revelation 21.

1.**Jasper**, dark opaque green.

2.**Sapphire**, Lapis-lazuli, opaque blue.

3.**Chalcedony**, an Emerald of a greenish hue.

4.**Emerald/Smaragdus**, bright transparent green.

5.**Sardonyx**, white and red.

6.**Sardius**, bright red.

7.**Chrysolite**, our Topaz, bright yellow.

8.**Beryl**, bluish green.

9.**Topaz**, or Peridot, yellowish green.

10.**Chrysoprasus**, a darker shade of the same colour.

11.**Jacinth/Hyacinthus**, Sapphire, sky blue.

12.**Amethyst**, violet.
 
6. The Lamb of God

The Lamb is the Temple

> 22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

The Lamb is the Light

> 23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.

# Heaven

Text: Revelation 22:1-5

> Revelation 22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: 4 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. 5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

> John 14:1-3&mdash;Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

## What is Heaven?

Heaven is a Real Place. God created it as a place of His own beauty and perfect design.

> Genesis 1:1&mdash;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

Heaven is not a state or condition of mind, heaven is not a myth or fairy tale, heaven is not imagination heaven is not fiction. Heaven is Real!

Jesus said it is is a "**place**" in John 14:2.

- John 21:2 "coming out of Heaven"

- Genes 28:17 Jacob
- Deuteronomy 10:14 Moses

## Where is Heaven?

Genesis 1:1 -- HEBREW: meaning to be lofty; the sky (as aloft; the dual perhaps alluding to the visible arch in which the clouds move, as well as to the higher ether where the celestial bodies revolve

> Psalm 103:11&mdash;Ps 103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.

Heaven is high above the earth.

## Hymn: THERE&apos;s NO DISAPPOINTMENT IN HEAVEN

**Words**: Frederick M. Lehman, 1914; he wrote these words in Chicago, Illinois, while suffering financial reverses.

**Music**: Frederick Lehman, harmony by his daughter Claudia L. Mays

&quot;There&apos;s no disappointment in heaven,
 No weariness, sorrow or pain;
No hearts that are bleeding and broken,
 No song with a minor refrain.
The clouds of our earthly horizon
 Will appear in the sky,
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
 With never a tear nor a sigh.
We&apos;ll never pay rent for our mansion,
 The taxes will never come due;
Our garments will never grow threadbare,
 But always be fadeless and new.
We&apos;ll never be hungry nor thirsty,
 Nor languish in poverty there,
For all the rich bounties of heaven
 His sanctified children will share.
There&apos;ll never be crepe on the door-knob,
 No funeral train in the sky;
No graves on the hillside of glory,
 For there we shall never more die.
The old will be young there forever,
 Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we&apos;ll stand in his likeness
 The stars and the sun to outshine.
I&apos;m bound for the beautiful city
 My Lord has prepared for His own;
Where all the redeemed of all ages
 Sing &quot;Glory&quot; around the white throne;
Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven,
 And the glories I there shall behold,
What a joy it will be when My Savior I see,
 In that beautiful city of gold!&quot;


<h1>U. Closing [21-22]</h1>

# Epilogue (22:6-21)

Revelation 22:6-21 can be considered the epilogue or the last and concluding statements.

## The Truthfulness of These Writings (v. 6)

> Revelation 22:6&mdash;And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.

### Truth is Refreshing

READ: Philippians 4:8-9; 

### No One Ever Spoke it Like Jesus!

Said of the Lord Himself "Never a man spake like this man."

### This Sayings are True

Three times it is repeated that the sayings of the book are true (19:9; 21:5; 22:6). 

Three times it is affirmed that the sayings come directly from God (1:1; 22:6; 22:16). 

> Romains 3:4&mdash;God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar;&hellip;

<blockquote class="quote">Either this book is nothing but forgery, or it is the most authoritative writing of all time&mdash;James R. Reynolds, Sr.</blockquote>

These Are Gods Own Words ("Faithful And True") and we must take them, build our faith on them, and testify of them. ( 2 Peter 1:19; Matthew 7:24-27; Isaiah 43:10)

## The Repetition of a Special Blessing (v. 7)

The special blessing promised to those who hear and keep the sayings of Revelation that was given in the first chapter is now repeated.

> Revelation 1:3&mdash;Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.

> Revelation 22:7&mdash;Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.

Is there another Book that is so intense, emphatic, constant or having so much good in it to be gained and ill to be avoided?

## The Effect Upon The Apostle (vs. 8-9)

> Revelation 22:8,9&mdash;And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

## Direct Orders Concerning This Revelation (v. 10)

> Revelation 22:10&mdash;And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.

### "Seal not the sayings of The Prophecy of this book."

Dan 8:26 12:4,9 Daniel was told to seal up the book. John is told not to seal the book.

From the beginning John was directed to write what he saw and heard, and to make it known to the Churches. Rev 1:11, 19 Prophetical messages to each church. Rev 2:1, 8, 12, 18, 3:1, 7, 14.

### "Seal up."

In Chapter 10 he was about to write. The Seven Thunders He was to seal this up -- But the rest he was not to Seal. He was to record them. He was to make them known. He was to publish them to the Churches. These things where written both by Command and Revelation of God.

See the stress, Urgency, Importance. This Book is very important to us.

## The Effects of This Revelation (v. 11)

> Revelation 22:11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.

There are two schools of thought here --

### One -- The idea of eternal fixedness of character. When these Revelations scenes have been fulfilled.

### The other idea -- is the Effect of these Words -- or this Revelation.

The meaning of the text has immediate reference to the context -- to the now -- sealing- writing and publishing. For a better understanding read it --

> Let the unjust one do injustice more and more and the filthy one defile more and more, and the righteous one do righteousness more and more."</blockquote>

II Tim 3:13 Heb 6:7-9

The same light of the Sun breeds pestilence in the marshland. Breeds life to all. It is an ill to the ill. Good to the Good.

## The Rewards To All (vs. 12-19)

### All Will be Rewarded

> 12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. 13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

Without exception, all will receive their just reward.

### The Reward of Entering God's City

> Revelation 22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 15 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

### Rewards of Blessing

> 16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. 17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. 18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

### To the wicked -

Degrees of Reward -- More tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah

### To the Righteous --

Degrees of Reward - Not Salvation but for works.

Wood -- hay -- stubble Gold- Silver -- Precious Stones.

## The Benediction (vs. 20-21)

> Revelation 22:20,21&mdash;He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. 21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
