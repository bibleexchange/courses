The Bible and slavery

- Paul, Onesimus and Philemon

> Philemon 16 no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.  16 If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.

> Genesis 9:24-27 Ge 9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. 25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 26 And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant. 27 God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
