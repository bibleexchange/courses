# Servants of God

TEXT:  Mt 25:14-30

>  Matthew 25:23 &mdash; His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

## Introduction

- What Does God need?
- What does God desire?
- What does it mean to be "a servant of God"

[NEGATIVE] In the first occurrence of "servant" in the Bible, being a "servant of servants" is part of Canaan's curse:

>  Ge 9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

[POSITIVE] The next account we find "servant" is Abraham identifying himself as in submission and belonging to God.

> Genesis 18:3 &mdash; And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

- It matters who your master is!

> Ro 6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

## Angels

> Psalm 103:20 &mdash; Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

> Psalm 104:4 &mdash; Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: [Hebrews 1:7]

- **DO GOD's WORD**: God's Word is His will 
- **GOD's MESSENGERS**: Luke 1:19 "I am Gabriel... stand in the p.of.God ... bring good news" 
- **STRONG and MIGHTY**: God makes his ministering angels strong and mighty, like winds and lightning,
- **HELPERS OF GOD's CHILDREN**: Daniel 10:13, Michael the Arch. helped Daniel
- **WARING WITH THE DEVIL**: Rev. 12:7 Michael and his angels waging war with dragon 

## Nature
- Stormy Winds

> Psalm 148:8 &mdash; Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:

> ILLUSTRATION: 3 Times American Revolutionary Soldiers were spared by a flash flood from advancing british soldiers.

-  Balaam's Donkey

> Numbers 22:21-35 &mdash; 22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. ...

- Sacrificial Animals in the Old Testament

God has used animals to tell the story of salvation.

- Jonah's "Big Fish"

> Matthew 12:40 &mdash; For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

- Bear when Elisha the Prophet was mocked

> 2 Kings 2:23, 24 &mdash; And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. 24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

	- Children: NOt just young children, but even mature offspring
	- This punishment too great for the offence, if it be considered, that their mocking proceeded from a great malignity of mind against God; that they mocked not only a man, and an ancient man, whose very age commanded reverence; and a prophet; but even God himself, and that glorious work of God, the ascension of Elijah into heaven; that they might be guilty of many other heinous crimes, which God and the prophet knew; and were guilty of idolatry, which by God's law deserved death
	
## Men and Woman

### Agents of Forgiveness and Mercy (READ Matthew 18:28)

>  Mt 18:28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. 

### Watchman

> Daniel 1:8 – “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.”

Taking a Stand ... "There is No Other Hand"

> **ILLUSTRATION**: Tevye, the Jewish dairy farmer in the musical __Fiddler on the Roof__, lives with his wife and five daughters in czarist Russia. Change is taking place all around him and the new patterns are nowhere more obvious to Tevye than in the relationship between the sexes. First, one of his daughters announces that she and a young tailor have pledged themselves to each other, even though Tevye had already promised her to the village butcher, a widower. Initially Tevye will not hear of his daughter’s plans, but he finally has an argument with himself and decides to give in to the young lovers’ wishes. A second daughter also chooses the man she wants to marry: an idealist revolutionary. Tevye is rather fond of him, and, after another argument with himself, he again concedes to the changing times. A while later, Tevye’s third daughter wishes to marry. She has fallen in love with a young Gentile. This violates Tevye’s deepest religious convictions: it is unthinkable that one of his daughters would marry outside the faith. Once again, he has an argument with himself. He knows that his daughter is deeply in love, and he does not want her to be unhappy. Still, he cannot deny his deepest convictions. “How can I turn my back on my faith, my people?” he asks himself. “If I try and bend that far, I’ll break!” Tevye pauses and begins a response: “On the other hand….” He pauses again, and then he shouts: “No! There is no other hand! There is no other hand!”

By definition, “conviction” means “a strong belief.” As a servant of God, I need to have strong beliefs.
