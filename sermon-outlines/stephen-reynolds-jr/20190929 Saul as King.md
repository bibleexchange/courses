# King Saul

Text: 

## Introduction

Saul's story is an example of someone once having the favor of God and then losing it. The Call of God, God's will, his anointing and chosing.

## A Desire for Change in Government

Israel was led directly by God who would raise up judges from time to time, but The people eventually request for a king like other nations (1 Samuel 8:1-22). This was brought about by two things.

> 1 Samuel 8:5 &mdash; And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 

1) **Corruption in Leadership** 

When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel: Joel and Abiah. They turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment.

2) **And a Desire to be like Other Nations with Kings**

The prophet Samuel sorrows but is comforted by God.

> 1 Samuel 8:7 &mdash; And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

Abimelech had set himself as a king in the time of the judges. (Judges 9)

Jotham, his brother, cried against him in a parable. The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them
-  **olive tree**, Reign over us.But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
-  **fig tree**, reign over us. But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
-  **the vine** reign over us.13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
-  **the bramble**, reign over us. And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.

> Judges 9:23,56,57 &mdash;Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 56 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:57 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

Not even at the height of Saul's reign was Israel entirely united.

## Saul's Call 1 Samuel 9

### Saul's Background

> 1 Samuel 9:1 ¶ Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. 2 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.

- A Benjamite, smallest of the tribes of Israel
- Kish, was His father, and is GREAT GREAT GREAT grandfather was a "mighty man of power" (army, wealth, virtue, valor, strength) (supposed contr: 1 Chr. 8:33 Ner begat Kish, versus Abiel begat Kish, Abiel=Ner two names, one man)
- Saul means "asked for; prayed for" He was the "KING" the people demanded, but also the "MAN" that God chose.
- Saul was "a good man"
- Saul was head and shoulders taller than everyone else. An impressive presence.

### Saul's Problem

Saul was sent by his father to recover their lost donkeys.They looked through Ephraim and Shalisha and Shalim and Benjamin, but did not find them. So coming to the land of Zuph, Saul decides to return home before his father begins to worry about their own safety. [**The value of human life.**]

A servant suggests they go so the nearby 'seer' or 'man of God' for was a prophet. Saul's first question is, what offering can we bring? Bread gone, no present to bring. The servant volunteers his 1/4 shekel of silver.

At the direction of some ladies drawing water, Saul and his troup head toward Samuel the prophet. 

> **2 Samuel 9: 15-17** Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. 17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.

Samuel tells Saul you will stay with me today and tomorrow you will go after I tell you "all that is in your heart". And by the way, those donkeys you were looking for these 3 days are found.

- All That is in Your Heart
- The Impossible Mission of Recovering Donkeys was merely a vehicle to bring Saul to the man of God.

### Saul's Questions

> 21 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?

Saul is brought to the parlour seeted with 30 guest of whom he was instruct to sit at the head and food had already been set aside and prepared!

- What questions Saul must have had!?!

> 1 Samuel 9:27 &mdash; And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

## <u>Phase 1:</u> Saul is Anointed to be King at Gibeah Privately 1 Sam. 10:1-16

> 1 Samuel 10:1 &mdash; Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

Saul being anointed was a symbol of being set apart and empowered by God's Spirit. This not only made Saul Israel's first king, but this is the first time a person was anointed other than an Aaronic priest and sacred objects (Leviticus 8:10-11, 30; Numbers 7:1).

**Saul was then given four signs to confirm that he was God's choice to be king (1 Samuel 10:2-8).  All four signs were to come to pass immediately, that very day. **:

1. You will find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The donkeys which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
2. From there go to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
3. After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
4. 6 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and **shalt be turned into another man**.

> 1 Samuel 10:9 ¶ And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, **God gave him another heart**: and all those signs came to pass that day.

- 10:11  Is Saul also among the prophets?

> 1 Samuel 10:12 &mdash; And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? **Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?**

## <u>Phase 2</u>: Saul's Presentation as King at Mizpeh 1 Samuel 10:17-27

> 1Sa 10:17 ¶ And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
 18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you: 19 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
- lots cast
- Saul hiding
- v. 24 God save the king
- Saul goes home to Gibeah with a band of men "whose hearts God had touched" ( not a "castle", but back to the fields and oxen)
-  27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.

## <u>Phase 3</u>: Saul is Accepted by People as King after Jabeshgilead 1 Samuel 11

- Nahash enacmped against  Jabesh-Gilead.

- The men of  Jabesh-Gilead offered to serve

- Nahah required also that ALL THEIR RIGHT EYES be thrust out "and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel" With an intent to bring shame on all Israel.

- "Give us seven days, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee."

- Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. 5 ¶ And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. 6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
   7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth **after Saul and after Samuel**, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.

- 300,000 of Israel 30,000 of Judah . And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, **To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help.** 

- Saul and his hosts destroys the Ammonites.

- 12 ¶ And the people said unto Samuel, **Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.** 13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day **the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel**.

  > 1 Samuel 11:14-15 &mdash; 14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. 15 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

##  <u>Phase 4</u>: Samuel's Exhortation 1 Samuel 12

- I have listened to you and have a made a king over you (Desipite Samuel has lead faithfully and God has lead faithfully)

- Be My Witness before the Lord: 1.  whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.

-  And they said, **Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand**.

- It is the Lord that:

  -  advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.

  - When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

  - And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 10 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.

  - 11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.

  - And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, **Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king**.

    > 13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

    - 14 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:
    - 15 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.
  
- Samuel prays for God to  send thunder and rain on the wheat harvest so they would see their wickedness. (v.17)
  
- Pray for us SAmuel that we die not for we have added to our sins in asking a king
- Follow God wiht all your heart
- God wil not forsake his people
- God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:  24 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
- But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king. (v.25)

## Saul's Rejection Ch. 13,14,15

1. #### The War with the Philistines, 13-14

- After 2 Years as King, Saul chose 3,000 men of Israel [2,000 with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and 1,000 with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.] An army of **330, 000** had been gathered in defense of Jabesh-Gilead.
- Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba and Saul sounded the trumpet for all Israel. to gather with Saul at Gilgal.
- Now instigated, the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, **30,000** chariots, and **6,000** horsemen, and people **as the sand which is on the sea shore** in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.
- When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did **hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.**
   And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the **people followed him trembling.**
-  **13:8** And he **tarried 7 days**, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. Saul left waiting for Samuel and offered the burnt offering himself. As soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 11 And Samuel said, **What hast thou done?** And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
  ...  **I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering**.
-  13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done **foolishly**: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 14 But now **thy kingdom shall not continue**: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.
-  15 ¶ And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about **600 men**.
- 16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
- Philistine spoilers in 3 bands made sure no  smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears: 20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. 21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. 22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. 23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

- (14:1) While Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree with about 600 men, Jonathan begins a secret mission (not even Saul knew about)
-  4 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
   5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
   6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: **for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few**.
   7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
   8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
   9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
   10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
   11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
   12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
   13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
   14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
   15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
   16 ¶ And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
   17 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
   18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
   19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
   20 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
   21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
   22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
   23 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.
   24 ¶ And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
   25 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
   26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
   27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
   28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.
   29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
   30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
   31 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
   32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.
   33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
   34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
   35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
   36 ¶ And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
   37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
   38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
   39 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
   40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
   41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
   42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
   43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
   44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
   45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
   46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
   47 ¶ So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
   48 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
   49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
   50 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
   51 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
   52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
