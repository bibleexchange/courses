# 5 W's of Worship

(The WHERE, WHEN, WHY, WHAT, and WHO of Worship)

## Introduction

### What are the 5 W's?

> Hebrews 13:10-16 &mdash; We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 11  For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 12  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. 13  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 14  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. 15  By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. 16  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.


## WHERE= Have You Got an Altar?, v. 10 (Where to Worship)

> 10  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.

========= ANYWHERE WE MEET THE CONDITIONS OF MEETING WITH GOD ================

In the Tabernacle, the priests had to go to a particular physical location to do service unto God.

## WHEN= (When to Worship)

- Paul and Silas found themselves in a prison.

## WHY= Have You Got a Sacrifice?, v. 11,12 (Why to Worship)

> 11  For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 12  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.


========= THE PRICE OF HAVING A RELATIONSIHP WITH A HOLY GOD ================

- HIS Sacrifice is that He might SANCTIFY the people -- separate from the world and set apart to God.

- Our Worship is how we develop our relationship with Him. --> IS THERE SIN IN MY LIFE?

Mary and Joseph had kept baby Jesus and 8 days later at the Temple (to present him unto the Lord) they had a hallelujah time! Simeon and Anna.


## What= Let Us Go Unto Him!, 13-16 (How to Worship or what worship looks like)

> 13  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 14  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. 15  By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. 16  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

Come Bless the Lord!

- It Needs to be Guarded (Genesis 15:11) Drive Off the Fowl)
- Bearing His Reproach (cannot care what is going on around you) -- tendancy to watch instead of worship--
> Fire On the Altar (The Holy Ghost) -- Elijah, Gideon
