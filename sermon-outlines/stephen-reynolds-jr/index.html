			<p>Song: "Set my spirit free that I might worship thee"</p>

			<h1>I Refuse to be a Slave</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<blockquote>1 Corinthians 10:23 &mdash; All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</blockquote>

				<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:12 &mdash; All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but <b>I will not be brought under the power of any</b>.</blockquote>

			<h2>1. All Things Are Lawful?</h2>

			<p>If everything were lawful, that doesn't mean all things EDIFY, PROFIT, FREE. Many things could be LAWFUL but corrupt our character, rob us of our freedoms or do harm to others. Am I BUILT UP, PROFITED and more FREE by this? Or is it a threat to my liberty?</p>

			<p>John Starks from N.H. could not attend an important government meeting due to a deathly illness but he sent in to the gathering a letter stating: "Live Free or Die. There are worse things than death."</p>

			<p>At the 1775 Continental Congress in Richmond, Virginia the virginians were deciding on whether to join the revolutionary fight by sending soldiers. Patrick Henry stood to inspire the motion with the words, "Give me Liberty or Give me death."</p>

			<h2>Threats to Liberty</h2>

			<p>Is the drunkard free? is the drug addict free? Is the selfish man with no respect of others free? Where is their choice?</p>

			<p>Christians are FREE MEN. BORN FREE. Free to choose.</p>

			<p>This is a great contrast to the attitudes of many in our time or so easily surrender their LIBERTIES. There are still some who <b>REFUSE TO BE A SLAVE</b>.</p>

			<h2>I Refuse to be a Slave to ...</h2>

			<h3>Technology/Entertainment</h3>

			<p>Getting Caught up in the madness of consumerism ... newest and latest ... but can't afford to change the oil in their car.</p>

			<p>Limit Time</p>

			<h3>Lust (forbidden, evil desire)</h3>
			
			<p>Great care needs to be taken on what we set before our eyes and ears. Advertisers know the great power in successfully planting a thought in someone. ("Be socialable, drink pepsi") <b>!!DON'T LOOK!!</b></p>

			<blockquote>Proverbs 23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. 32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</blockquote>

			<p>It is a difficult thing to stop a HABIT once it has developed. H-A-B-I-T.</p>

			<p>They argue the body wants it so whats wrong with that? Its just a NATURAL thing, the body wants it so give in. BUT paul argues 1) the body was made for MEAT/FOOD 2) Fornication is a harm/sin AGAINST your body. Even though the police man isn't going to arrest you.</p>

			<h3>Impulse</h3>
			
			<p>Stephen tackling the air conditioner ... Stop and think</p>

			<p>Act with intention and purpose. I'm just gonna go and be with this crowd and see what happens... set your mind before.</p>

			<p>Be a thermometer not a thermostat</p>

			<h3>Worldly Success</h3>

			<p>Balance Natural and Spiritual needs. LET YOUR MODERATION BE KNOWN.</p>

			<p>People will always be more important than things</p>

			<p>SPEAK UP when your hear or see something wrong. "SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

			<p>(A Pauline Rule) I Refuse to Become a Slave to anything that May Corrupt Me or Draw me Away from God</p>

			<p>An independant and strong mind is needed to resolve not to become a slave to habit that causes injury and to act critically toward any threats to spiritual success.</p>

			<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:19 &mdash; What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</blockquote>

<!--
			<p>Other Pauline rules: 1) remain unmarried 2)</p>

			<blockquote> 2Ti 2:22 &mdash; Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</blockquote>

			<ul>
				<li>What can I do and still be a Christian?</li>
				<li>Paul's 3 Part Test: Does it Edify? Does it Profit? Does it Enslave?</li>
				<li>It is a threat, risk, danger to our Christian liberty to only consider "all things lawful" without applying the following rule given</li>
				<li>ALL THINGS LAWFUL for me -- 'indifferent' or 'unlawful' eating of meats vs. fornication (not the same but are different things, not just "both hunger and fornication are natural desires of the flesh")</li>
				<li>That fornication was positively wrong, and against the very nature and essence of Christianity,</li>
				<li>"but i will not be brought under the power of any"</li>
				<li>"all things are not expedient"</li>
				<li>"but all things edify not"</li>
				<li>exesti 1832 (30 verses) "no lawful to do on sabbath" "david ate shewbead no lawful" "is it lawful to heal on sabbath" "not lawful for thee to have her" "not lawful for a man to utter"</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What kinds of activities does paul list?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Going to the law before the unjust against brethren</li>
				<li>The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God</li>
				<li>fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, thieves, covetous,  drunkards, revilers, extortioners</li>
				<li>NEW PARAGRAPH and 3rd of chapters begins at verse 12</li>
				<li> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</li>
				<li>The body is the temple of the Holy Ghost</li>
				<li>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</li>
				<li> Many things may be lawful, yet there are many things which are not expedient; that is, which do not profit, ... being lawful does not mean they are without harm ... They might injure the body; produce scandal; lead others to offend or to sin. (meats and wine)</li>
				<li> There are many customs which, perhaps, cannot be strictly proved to be unlawful or sinful, which yet do injury in some way if indulged in; and which, as their indulgence can do no good, should be abandoned. Anything that does evil--however small--and no good, should be abandoned at once. </li>
				<li>I Will not become a slave of it, I will not be subdued by it</li>
				<li> his grand purpose was not to be the slave of habit, not to be subdued by any practice that might corrupt his mind, fetter his energies, or destroy his freedom as a man and as a Christian.</li>

			<h1>When the Lord Asks 'Why?'</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>1. Men Ask Why</h3>

<ul>
 	<li>Of the Lord<li> 

	<blockquote> Psalms 10:1 &mdash; Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? </blockquote>

	<blockquote> Mark 15:34 &mdash; And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</blockquote>

	 	<li>Of Each Other</li>

	 <blockquote> Exodus 14:5 &mdash; And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</blockquote>

	 <blockquote> Joshua 7:25 &mdash; And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. [ASKING ACHAN]</blockquote>

		<p>Our Children asking  Why - its an annoyance sometimes</p>
		
		<li>Of Ourself</li>
		
		<p>Why do we do what we do? Stop and Think</p>

	<blockquote> 2 Corinthians 13:5 &mdash; Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</blockquote>

	<h3>2. The Lord Already Knows</h3>

	> John 2:23-25 &mdash; Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. 24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, 25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.

		Is it a hard question when God asks why?
		When God asks a question, it isn't for him but for me!

	<h3>3. Can I answer with the Word? (defended by the Word)</h3>
		- If I can't then its just an excuse
		- A people of principle, truth
		- The Very pillar and ground of the truth is the church

	<blockquote>1 Timothy 3:15 &mdash; But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</blockquote>

	<h2> I. Why Did You Lie to the Holy Ghost</h2>

	<blockquote>Acts 5:3,4 &mdash; But Peter said, Ananias, **why** hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? 4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? **why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?** thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</blockquote>

	- Have I lied to the Holy Ghost?
	- 

	<h2> II. Why are you angry?</h2>

	<blockquote>And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? Genesis 4:6 KJV</blockquote>

	Leads to: what have you done?

	<blockquote> Genesis 4:10 &mdash; And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</blockquote>

	<h2> III. Why are You Sliding Back?</h2>

	<blockquote> Jeremiah 8:5 &mdash; Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</blockquote>

	<h2> IV. Why are you troubled (Jesus)?</h2>

	Jesus appeared to the 11 after his Resurrection?

	<blockquote> Luke 24:38 &mdash; And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? </blockquote>

	<blockquote>John 14:1 &mdash; Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</blockquote>

	#The Silver Cup

TEXT: I Peter 2:2; Genesis 44:1-12 

1 Peter 2:2 -- As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: [pure]

##I. The Foundation

###A. Joseph Teaches us About Jesus Christ
(longed for son, firstborn, sold by his brethren for pieces of silver, His birth inspired faith, tested, falsely accused, his own brethren sought to kill Him, After He suffered He rose to a throne, HE OVERCAME HIS DIFFICULTIES)

###B. The Steward Teaches us About the Holy Ghost

(The Holy Ghost takes the things of Christ and makes them the Believer's.)

> John 16:13-14 -- Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

> Genesis 43:23a And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks:&hellip;

###C. The Sacks Teach Us About the Spiritual Experience of the Christian.

> Genesis 44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. (I Cor. 6:19 Know ye not your body is the temple&hellip;)

###D. The Silver Cup Teaches Us About the Influence of the Spirit on the Christian -- GIFTS and FRUIT.
(It is one object - a silver cup - that is placed by the steward in Benjamin's sack, but it represents the MANY spiritual Gifts.)

###E. Benjamin Teaches Us About the Christian Who Inherits All that Christ Has Provided. He is an OVERCOMER that OVERCOMES as Christ did.

##II. Spiritual Gifts are the Inheritance of the Believer

###A. These ARE GIFTS. (Their MONEY is returned to them. Rightfully Theirs By BIRTHRIGHT--His brethren!)

###B. Each is Given AS MUCH AS THEY CAN CARRY.

###C. These Spiritual Gifts Create UNITY in the Family of God and BUILDS up the individual. (Contrasting the works of the flesh which cause division.)

These Gifts God has given to the church are NECESSARY and not OPTIONAL.

> 1 Corinthians 12:1 -- Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

> Ephesians 4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

> Ephesian 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

> 1 Corinthians 12:28 -- And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

###D. It is the work of the Holy Ghost deliver these gifts to the Believer.

1Co 12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.

###E. It is the Responsibility of the Christian to Seek Earnestly the Best Gift.

> 1 Corinthians 12:31a But covet earnestly the best gifts:&hellip;

> Hebrews 6:1,2 -- Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 2 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

####What is the best gift? Salvation, Faith, Victory, Wisdom, Healing, Prophecy = The BEST GIFT is the one you need right now!

> Hebrews 6:19-20 -- Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; 20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

The Forerunner entered beyond the HOLY PLACE into the HOLIEST OF HOLIES.

##CONCLUSION:
Search Will Be Made and God Will Reward the Overcomer. He will be looking for that SILVER CUP. What's in your sack?

> Luke 21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

> Revelation 19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
