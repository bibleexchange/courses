<h1>Who is Influencing Us?</h1>

<blockquote>Psalm 1 &mdash; Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 4 Â¶ The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</blockquote>

<blockquote> Isaiah 61:3 &mdash; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li>"You can tell who she has been spending time with by her hair style."</li>
<li>Oldest and largest Living Things on earth are trees.</li>
<li> Many accounts in Bible include trees. 1) The Garden 2) the Ark 3) Waters of Marah 4) Aarons Rod Budded 5) Israel Waited for the wind in the Mulberry Trees 6) The Cross</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wild Trees</h2>

v.1 HOW DOES ONE GET HERE? ... falls into contempt of God, which is called the **seat of the scorners**.

<h3> a. Counsel of the Ungodly -- UNGODLY  -- WALKS -- COUNSEL</h3>

    "THERE IS NO NEED FOR RELIGION IF WE JUST LIVE AN HONEST LIFE."

<h3> b. Way of sinners         -- SINNERS  -- STANDS -- WAY</h3>

    "Actively Transgress God's laws without shame -- Many WAYS of sin and lewdness. Each man has own vices."

<h3> c. Seat of the scornful   -- SCORNFUL -- SITS -- SEATs</h3>

    "NO CONVICTION. The arrogance of resting in sin. ACC 'A Believer in all unbelief'".

    FAR TOO EASY TO CRITICIZE. MORE WORK TO EDIFY.

<h3> --> WALK > STAND > SIT </h3>

<h2> Trees of Righteousness</h2>

- contrast with a tree of righteousness
1 in a million

<h3> a. Verse 1 BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO ... (plural BLESSEDNESSES... or as exclamation!) ... THAT (emphatic) man (1 among a thousand)</h3>

<h3> b. Influence of Jesus</h3>

<blockquote> Psalm 104:16,17 &mdash; The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li> Those we once sough refuge in the cross, are made a refuge to the weary</li>
	<li> "The Most Useful Tree" Boabab</li>
	<li> "The Traveller's Tree"</li>
</ul>

<h3> c. The Work of Jesus </h3>

- HIS PLANTING (not wild, purpose, plan, placed)
- NOT ALL ARE HIS PLANTING
- ditches of water redirected by the foot

<h3> d. Fragrance of Jesus</h3>

> Psalm 45:8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

- Hard to hold bitterness long toward someone you are interceding for in prayer.
- **Myrrh** 1 piece would fill a room, bruised with a rock and resin poured out all around (The church finds herself in NEED of suffering. Can we truly know Christ as we ought without fellowshipping in His suffering?)
- **Cassia** Healing
- **Aloes** Bitter Smell but Healing Properties

<h3> e. Strength and Beauty of Jesus</h3>
