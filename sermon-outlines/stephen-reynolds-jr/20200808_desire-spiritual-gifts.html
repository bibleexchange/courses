		<h1>Desire Spiritual Gifts</h1>

		<blockquote>1 Corinthians 14:1,12 &mdash; Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. 12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</blockquote>

		<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><b>The Reason for the confusion</b>, tug of war, see sawing, roller coaster, etc.</li>
			<li>ILLUSTRATION: puzzle, What is missing?</li>
			<li>Ephesians 4; 1 Corinthians 12-14</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>1. Desire Spiritual Gifts (Why should I want them?)</h2>


		<ul>
			<li>DESIRE</li>
			<li>DESIRE A GIFT (carnal)</li>
			<li> it is an ODD condition where you do not desire a gift.</li>
			<li>Desire Spiritual Gifts</li>

			<blockquote>Colossians 3:2 &mdash; set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth.</blockquote>

			<li>We know more about "magic", darkness and evil, horoscopes, divinations, that we do the manifestations of the Spirit. In an attempt to ward off mystism and dark arts, it is a trap of the devil to convince us there isn't a Holy Power.</li>

			<li>Abuse of Spiritual Gifts and misrepresenting them has effected some to the point they are turned off and calous toward SPIRITUAL workings.</li>

			<li>A Vacuum has been created trying to fill up wiht the temporal. But PUT GOD FIRST.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>2. Purpose of Spiritual Gifts (What are they for?)</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>No Matter the task, the church will always need SPIRITUAL POWER to perform it.</li>
			<li>It is How we got the WORD OF GOD. "Holy men of God wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost."</li>
			<li><b>A Fully Equipped Body</b></li>

			<blockquote>1 John 2:20,27 &mdash;  But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</blockquote>

			<li>We need the product of the Spirit of God</li>

			<li>PROFIT WITHAL</li>

			<blockquote>1 Corintians 12:7 &mdash; But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</blockquote>

			<li>Not a position of man worship like they masses do with celebrities of sports and entertainment, but to the PROFIT OF ALL THE BODY.</li>

			<li>Spiritual Gifts are the building materials of God's house. (vs. degrees, human knowledge, earthly integration, well adjusted)</li>

			<li>Perfecting (Edifying) God's People (until that which is perfect is come) EPH. 4:12</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3. Nature of Spiritual Gifts (What are they? What does this look like?)</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>God's Spirit in Believers</li>
			<li>(unction and anointing) BEING LED (once by dump idols and now by the Holy Ghost) 1 Cor. 12:2,3</li>
			<li>Manifestations of the Spirit. (abilities of the HOLY GHOST)</li>
			<li>"GOD HATH SET SOME IN THE IN BODY ..."
				<ul>
					<li>The 12 Apostles (including Paul)</li>
					<li>Government (Spiritual authority)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>"What does a Spiritual Service look like? (What is missing?)
				<ul>
					<li>An Empasis on the Lordship of Christ (i must decrease, he must increase)</li>
					<li>Anointing with Oil</li>
					<li>Spiritual Songs</li>
					<li>Jubilant Praise</li>
					<li>Seeking, Waiting, Reaching, Pressing (feeling after God)</li>
					<li>Prophecy</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

		<blockquote>2 Corinthians 5:2,4 &mdash; For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: 4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</blockquote>
