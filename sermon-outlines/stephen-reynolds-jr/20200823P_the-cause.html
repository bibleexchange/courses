		<h1>The Cause</h1>

		<p><b>TEXT:</b> Acts 26:12-18</p>

		<blockquote>"a cause" <i>a principle, aim, or movement that, because of a deep commitment, one is prepared to defend or advocate</i></blockquote>


		<h2>Different Kinds of Causes and Different Levels of Importance</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Global Causes: global problems, world peace, hunger, save the whales, etc.</li>
				<li>Local Causes: local problems and needs, helping individuals, animal shelter</li>
				<li>Personal Causes: better myself, education, knowledge, experience, wealth, fame (2Ti 4:10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world...)</li>
				<li>Secular/Humanitarian Causes: causes that solve only temporal problems, protect the unborn</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Some Secular/Humanitarian causes are directly related to spiritual causes: The judgement of God and how we treat LIFE.</p>

			<p>Not all causes are equally important:</p>
			
			<blockquote>Mark 9:42-50 &mdash; And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. 43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:  44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.  45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:  46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.  47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: 48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. 50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.</blockquote>

			<blockquote>Luke 9:59-62 &mdash; Lu 9:59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  60  Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.  61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.  62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</blockquote>
 			
			<p>Paul testifies before King Agrippa:</p>

 			<blockquote>Acts 26:12-18 &mdash; Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; 17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</blockquote>

<h2>The Apostles Sealed Their Commitment to the Gospel Causewith Their Lives</h2>

<h3>1. Judas and James the Son of Zebedee</h3>
		
<p>The New Testament tells of the fate of only two of the apostles: Judas, who betrayed Jesus and then went out and hanged himself, and James the son of Zebedee, who was executed by Herod about 44 AD (Acts 12:2)</p>

<blockquote><b>Acts 12:1-4</b> &mdash; Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. 2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) 4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</blockquote>

<h3>2. Peter and Paul</h3>

<p>Both martyred in Rome about 66 AD, during the persecution under Emperor Nero. Paul was beheaded. Peter was crucified, upside down at his request, since he did not feel he was worthy to die in the same manner as his Lord.</p>

<h3>3. Andrew</h3>
<p>went to the "land of the man-eaters," in what is now Russia. Christians there claim him as the first to bring the gospel to their land. He also preached in Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey, and in Greece, where he is said to have been crucified.</p>

<h3>4. Thomas</h3>
<p>was probably most active in the area east of Syria. Tradition has him preaching as far east as India, where the ancient Marthoma Christians revere him as their founder. They claim that he died there when pierced through with the spears of four soldiers.</p>

<h3>5. Philip</h3>
<p>possibly had a powerful ministry in Carthage in North Africa and then in Asia Minor, where he converted the wife of a Roman proconsul. In retaliation the proconsul had Philip arrested and cruelly put to death.</p>

<h3>6. Matthew</h3>
<p>the tax collector and writer of a Gospel ministered in Persia and Ethiopia. Some say he was stabbed to death in Ethiopia.</p>

<h3>7. Bartholomew</h3>
<p>had widespread missionary travels attributed to him by tradition: to India with Thomas, back to Armenia, and also to Ethiopia and Southern Arabia. There are various accounts of how he met his death as a martyr for the gospel.</p>

<h3>8. James</h3>
<p>the son of Alpheus is one of at least three James referred to in the New Testament. There is some confusion as to which is which, but this James is reckoned to have ministered in Syria. The Jewish historian Josephus reported that he was stoned and then clubbed to death.</p>

<h3>9. Simon the Zealot</h3>
<p>so the story goes, ministered in Persia and was killed after refusing to sacrifice to the sun god.</p>

<h3>10. Matthais</h3>
<p>The apostle chosen to replace Judas. Tradition sends him to Syria with Andrew and to death by burning.</p>

<h3>11. John</h3>

<p>The only one of the apostles generally thought to have died a natural death from old age. He was the leader of the church in the Ephesus area and is said to have taken care of Mary the mother of Jesus in his home. During Domitian's persecution in the middle '90s,  he escaped unhurt after being cast into boiling oil at Rome and was then exiled to the island of Patmos where he wrote Revelations.</p>

<h2>His Cause Must Become Our Cause</h2>

<blockquote>Acts 26:12-18 &mdash; Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; 17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</blockquote>

<h3>PRICE</h3>
<blockquote>Matthew 10:39 &mdash; He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JIM ELLIOT &mdash; He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.</blockquote>

<p>In a brief devotional written by minister G.D. Watson titled "Others May, You Cannot":</p>
<blockquote> G.D. WATSON (1845-1924) &mdash; If God has called you to be truly like Jesus in all your spirit,
He will draw you into a life of crucifixion and humility. He
will put on you such demands of obedience that you will
not be allowed to follow other Christians. In many ways, He
seems to let other good people do things which He will not
let you do. || God will take you at your word. If you absolutely sell
yourself to be His slave, He will wrap you up in a jealous
love and let other people say and do many things that you
cannot. Settle it forever; you are to deal directly with the
Holy Spirit, He is to have the privilege of tying your tongue
or chaining your hand or closing your eyes in ways which
others are not dealt with. However, know this great secret
of the Kingdom: When you are so completely possessed
with the Living God that you are, in your secret heart,
pleased and delighted over this peculiar, personal, private,
jealous guardianship and management of the Holy Spirit
over your life, you will have found the vestibule of heaven,
the high calling of God.</blockquote> 
 </p>

<h3>PLACE</h3>
<blockquote>John 3:30 &mdash; He must increase, but I must decrease.</blockquote>
<p>Its the revelation of the person of Christ, that draws us to LESS OF ME AND MORE OF HIM></p>

<h3>PURPOSE</h3>

<blockquote>Daniel 1:8 &mdash; But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</blockquote>

<p>It will be neither convenient or easy to follow Christ with ALL OUR HEART. This journey cannot be made successfully by accident and chance but will require great PURPOSE and RESOLUTIONS. (conviction)</p>
