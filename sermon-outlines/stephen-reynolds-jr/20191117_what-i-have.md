# What I Have

> Psalm 119:14  I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
>
> Philippians 4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content

## 1. Hiram Despised the Cities in Galilee

- 1 King 9: 1Ki 9:10 Â¶ And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
   11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
   12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
   13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
   14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

- The farmland was **unappreciated** by the Seafaring King of Tyre even though he did appreciated the **WHEAT in chapter 5**.
- 1Ki 5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
   12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.

## 2. Esau Despised his Birthright

> Ge 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.

- To possess the divine birthright and be part of this chosen seed was the greatest blessing any one could hope to receive.
-  Esau is s a man who **lives only for the moment** and does not take the cost of his decisions into account. 
- The lusts of the flesh will corrupt the sincerest of spiritual hunger as they will give birth to death.

## 3. Demas Hath Forsaken Me Having Loved This Present World



>  2 Ti 4:10 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

- Not necessarily a love for pleasure and riches, but **LIFE itself**.

## 4. Joseph's Brothers

They didnt understand and were fearful.

> Ge 42:5 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.  27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, **What is this that God hath done unto us**?

They didnt even know what they had.

> Ge 44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. 17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
