<h1>Man's Need for God and God's Need for Man</h1>
<p>text: James 4:1-10, vs. 7</p>
<p>With more frequent violence in militant Islam and battle lines drawn over doctrinal differences, religion is increasingly being blamed as </p>
<ul>
<li>"the main source of hatred in the world". </li>
<li>"taking us back to middle ages"</li>
<li>humanist chaplain at Harvard University wrote "Good without God"</li>
<li>Neruroscientist Sam Harris in his "The End of Faith" it is not merely religious extremism that is the greatest problem confronting civilization, but it is rather faith itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't try to defend religion so much tonight as combat the most dangerous inference of these statement&hellip;.that, for whatever reasons, man does not NEED God.</p>
<p>But not only does man severly need God, but God also in another sense needs man.</p>
<h2>2. Man's Need for God</h2>
<h3>Man is Needy (In Time of Need)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Heb 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How often do we face circumstances too much for us? Where can you run to?</p>
<h3>Man Needs a Physician</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 9:12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mental Illness</li>
<li>Youth Criminality</li>
<li>Militant Religions</li>
<li>The World is Sick and Humanism can't fix it</li>
</ul>
<h3>God is the Supplier</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 4:19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. God's Need for Man</h2>
<p>Why would an eternal God need anybody?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and <strong>glorify your Father</strong> which is in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's need is born not out of a shortcoming in the Divine God, but out of His LOVE for His creation. </p>
<h3>God willingly yokes up with the repentant.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mt 11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>He Has Born Our Need</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>John 4:4 And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Donkey</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 21:3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Daily Prepare to be Useful to God</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Isa 43:10 <strong>Ye are my witnesses</strong>, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</p>

<li>Clay in the Potters Hand</li>
</ol>

<p>Isa 64:8 But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>A Trumpet to Sound Forth a Certain Sound</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>1Co 14:8,9 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? 9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>A Nail in a Sure Place</li>
