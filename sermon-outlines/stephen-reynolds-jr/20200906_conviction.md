## The Ministry of Conviction

### 1. The Holy Ghost in us will convict US of sin
### 2. The Holy Ghost in us will convict others of sin

- Manner of living
- Message

> 1Co 14:24,25 &mdash; But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 25 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.

### 3. Conviction Brings Division

>  Mt 10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

- Finney's "Anxious Bench"

### 4. To Undue Conviction Wrongly is to Work Against God (Short Circuiting God)

> Pr 24:24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: 25 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.




### 5. Conviction is a Measure of God's LOve

Re 3:9 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
