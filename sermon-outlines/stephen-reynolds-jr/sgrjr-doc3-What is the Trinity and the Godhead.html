The oftener we are mown down by you, the more in number we grow: the blood of Christians is seed [of the church]</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; He also held a unique view of persecution, &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">It never happens without God willing it, and it is fitting-even at times necessary-for Him to do so, to the approval or condemnation of His servants. . . this is his winnowing fan which even now cleanses the Lord&#39;s threshing floor-His church, winnowing the mixed heap of the faithful and separating the wheat of the martyrs from the chaff of the cowards... (When persecution strikes), the Church is mightily stirred; then the faithful are more careful in their preparations, greater attention is given to fasts and station days, to prayers and humility, to mutual charity and love, to holiness and temperance. Men have time for nothing but fear and hope. Therefore, it is clear that persecution, which works for the improvement of the servants of God, cannot be blamed on the Devil</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Born of a captain of a Roman Legion, Tertullian was provided with all the necessary education and training to be a lawyer. When he was about 40, Tertullian, a heath, was converted to Christianity. He exuberantly embraced the gospel and ably used his legal skills to defend Christianity from pagan attackers. Very eloquent and bold, he often very harshly reprimanded compromising Christians. He was also a leader in Church writings for he was the first Christian writer to write in Latin.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The following excerpt is from </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Columbia Encyclopedia</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, Sixth Edition, 2001-05:</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">On the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (De spectaculis, viii., xvii.), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theater and the amphitheater. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments (De cultu, v.-vi.), and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (De virginibus velandis). He praised the unmarried state as the highest (De monogamia, xvii.; Ad uxorem, i. 3), called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by Vestal Virgins and Egyptian priests, and he pronounced second marriage a species of adultery (De exhortations castitatis, ix.)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What does all of this have to do with the question concerning the Trinity? The answer is found in etymology&mdash;the science concerning the origins of words. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, an English word can trace its origin around the time of 200 AD to the Latin word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">trinitas</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> which was coined by none other than Tertullian. Because of his boldness, straightforward approach, and deep-seated conviction, he was disliked by many and even in his older years disowned or excommunicated by the Roman church. They were going to make him a saint because of his great influence on Christianity, but he was eventually deemed too legalistic. (I of course don&rsquo;t agree with the practice of &ldquo;sainting&rdquo; people in the Catholic sense, but it helps us see what caliber of a man he was.)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Just as many fought the man Tertullian, many people have bitterly fought his invention, the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Their argument is that the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">word </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">cannot be found in Scripture. People may be able to fight the word itself, but the doctrine the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> represents is unequivocally Scripture&mdash;I John 5:7 &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&rdquo; (see footnote 1)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">is not an exhaustive description of God in that of itself, but is a summary of (putting in a nutshell) what man understands of God through Scripture. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is simply a &ldquo;label&rdquo; designed to reference the great treasure chest of the revelation of God. Don&rsquo;t be distracted by the semantics of language, but place your emphasis on &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">what saith the Scripture</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&rdquo; and the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Illustration of this thought is given in the man holding a photograph whose subject was obvious to anyone looking at it. He told his friends he was showing it to, &ldquo;This is not a turkey.&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; They all questioned because it so obviously was a turkey. &ldquo;You see, this is not a turkey; it is only a picture of a turkey.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t eat a picture, nor can you commune as friend with friend with a statement of truth. God&rsquo;s promise is to reveal Himself to those that are hungry! (Matthew 5:6) Any sentences I could construct or even words a man can coin such as, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> are just at best &ldquo;pictures&rdquo; of a Living God. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before you continue reading ask yourself the following question, &ldquo;Am I looking for a good argument, what is more &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; or &lsquo;logical, or do I have a heart cry for the Lord to reveal Himself to me?&rdquo; (Matthew 11:27) If it is the first, it is a waste of time reading this paper for if your searching ends in the realm of intellect you can never know God. Your search must stretch into the realm of the Spirit where sight and reason are of no use and where the eternal and the absolute can be found. I do not seek to win an argument with the reader, and my only purpose in writing this paper is to give explanation of the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; this essay in itself cannot reveal God to you.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> abbreviates the following four Scriptural truths concerning God:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs19190108"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That God is one, and that there is but one God.</span></li><li class="cs19190108"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That the Father is a distinct Divine Person distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit. </span></li><li class="cs19190108"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That Jesus Christ is truly God, and yet is a Divine Person distinct from the Father and the Holy Spirit.</span></li><li class="cs19190108"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;That the Holy Spirit is also a distinct Divine Person. (see footnote 2)</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The thoughts of the previous sixty words can be expressed in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">three</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> syllables (an interesting &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo;)&mdash;Trin-i-ty. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">expresses two things: 1) Tri- </span><span class="csC382D2BB">three</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and 2) Unity- </span><span class="csC382D2BB">oneness</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. I would like to further expound on these two thoughts, using I John 5:7 as an outline: 1) &ldquo;There are Three&rdquo; &ndash; Distinction of Persons &amp; 2) &ldquo;These Three are One&rdquo; &ndash; Biblical Oneness.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Our text: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. &mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">I John 5:7</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I. There Are Three &ndash; Distinction of Persons of the Godhead</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Father is God and Distinct from the Son. One of the simplest illustrations from Scripture of this fact can be found in Matthew 27:46. Jesus is on the cross, the sky is black, and all the horror and ugliness of sin is evidenced in the scene. The scene reaches its climax of blackness as Jesus cries out, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo; God is Holy and cannot look upon sin, and when even the only begotten of the Father was the scapegoat bearing man&rsquo;s sin; He had to turn His back. This picture of the ultimate price of sin is blurred or even completely missed if the Father and the Son are described as only two names of the same person or explained as only </span><span class="csC382D2BB">manifestations</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of one Person. Is God some kind of actor, putting on a fa&ccedil;ade, pretending to be forsaken by Himself? The Father is distinct from the Son.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Son is God and distinct from the Father. 1 John 4:14 </span><span class="csC382D2BB">And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. On the mount of Transfiguration the Father again declares His approval of the Son. Matthew 17:15 </span><span class="csC382D2BB">This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> This approval is so essential and important because is shows the unity of the Son and the Father, but if that is ignored what is the point of this declaration? Could we paraphrase it, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">This is me, my name is the Father, listen to my other name, the Son, for I have pleased myself. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Please, excuse any hint of sarcasm. Simply, the Son is distinct from the Father.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Holy Ghost is God and distinct from the Father and the Son</span><span class="csC382D2BB">. Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. &mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Luke 3:21,22 We see in a practical scene, that the Holy Ghost is manifested &ldquo;like a dove&rdquo; and clearly is seen by the witnesses there that day as distinct from the Father and the Son. Any other conclusion taken from passage is absurd and boundless speculation. Again, what deception is God plotting here? The answer is given often that this is three manifestations of one God. Is Jesus, the Son God, or only a manifestation? God has appeared in the fire, the wind, and thunders, but these are not the essence of God or His person. The Son is in person God, and Jesus is the Son manifested in the flesh. The Holy Ghost was not manifested in the flesh and therefore we see a distinction from the Son. Who should the Spirit of Truth Testify of in John 15:26? It is not of Himself or of the Father, but of the Son. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Father in essence is distinct from the Son, the Son from the Father, and the Holy Ghost from the Son and Father, and we express this truth with </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are not three Gods, but God is one God in three persons. In other words, a triune Godhead.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">II. These Three Are One &ndash; Biblical Oneness of the Godhead</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(De 6:4; 1Ki 8:60; Isa 44:6; Mr 12:29,32; Joh 10:30; 17:22).</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The proper vocabulary is hard to find to describe God, but that does not mean we should deny Him of His fullness. Just because we can&rsquo;t grasp it, should we change Who God is? God is not Three. God is one, but a unique oneness peculiar to Himself having no true parallel. A oneness that He has promised we can enter into according to John 17:22.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">With all that has been said concerning the distinctness of their persons, you cannot divide Them from each other concerning importance, power, will, or existence. All act in different functions or parts in the work of salvation, but their work is in unison and not in contrast to or independent of each other. You cannot divide the Father from the Son or from the Holy Ghost in their will, authority, or power, but they work together with the same power and authority. There is order in the Godhead&mdash;the Father sent the Son and did only what the Father told him; the Son sent the Comforter, the Holy Ghost&mdash;but this does not mean one is inferior to another. This simply illustrates that God is orderly.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Is the Son in essence God or not? If the Son is God, which He absolutely with no place given for argument is, then He cannot cease to be in essence God for any amount of time. To say God is only sometimes the Son is to question the Deity of Christ. The same thought carries on over to the Father and the Holy Ghost. All Three are eternally existent for that is part of the very definition of Divinity&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">The same yesterday, today, and forever </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Hebrews 13:8).</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">They are one in existence, co-existent from before the beginning of the beginning and beyond where eternity ends. Genesis 1:1 expresses this thought with &ldquo;In the beginning, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Elohim&hellip;&rdquo; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Elohim is a plural noun and declares to us that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were all active in creation. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Let US make man in OUR image, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">is a very quote expressing the plurality of persons in God. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Again, Human language and my skill in expression fail to relate fully the essence of God, but in however we say it or anyone else says it let it be in a spirit of agreement with Scripture and its presentation of God. Whether you choose to use </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> or not is not as important as that you do not purposefully deny any part of the fullness of the Godhead. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;I John 2:22. Jesus, the Son, is God, The Father is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and God is One Lord (Deut. 6:4). That is what I mean when I say </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Tested by hundreds of years of careful theological thought, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Trinity </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">is merely the best of man&rsquo;s attempts to </span><span class="csC382D2BB">describe</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the fullness of the Godhead. Can we really hope to express in fullness the person of One who is infinite with terms conjured by the wisdom of mortal man? The book of Revelation is the clearest of illustrations to the answer to this question. John the Revelator speaks in the fourth chapter and verse three of the One on the Throne, &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&rdquo;At best, using the frail medium of human language, we can only speak of likenesses and comparisons which in reality come so short of describing the infinite and measureless Sovereign and Almighty God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE2DF19C1">FOOTNOTES</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
