		<p><b>TEXT:</b> Acts 26:12-18</p>

		<blockquote>1 Timothy 3:10 &mdash; And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. [tested]</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Ylt ... let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.</blockquote>

		<p>John Mark's Testimony. John Mark was a young man whose family had been changed and involved intensely with Christianity. His relative, <b>Barnabas</b>, generously sold land to support the church and helped unite Paul to the Church leaders in Jerusalem. John Mark’s <b>mother</b> collected saints for prayer in her home, and held and all-nighter that witnessed Peter’s angelic release from prison. From this environment of prayer, unity, generosity, and faith, <b>John Mark</b> accepted the call of evangelism. Traveling with Barnabas and Paul, he witnessed the thrill of gaining new converts to the Christian faith as well as the hardships of carrying the message of salvation. However, <b>without Biblical explanation</b>, John Mark decided to return to Jerusalem. Perhaps he was weary. Perhaps he was homesick. Perhaps he was second guessing his purpose. Maybe he was disgruntled. Maybe he even had ulterior motives.  For whatever reason, he left Paul and Barnabas. To Paul, this was a very bad decision, resulting in Paul’s inability to fully trust the young man. Therefore, after some passage of time, Paul rejected John Mark’s efforts to rejoin the evangelism team. ------------ ULTIMATELY:: </p>
