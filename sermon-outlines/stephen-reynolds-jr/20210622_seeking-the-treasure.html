<h1 id="sermon">Seeking the Treasure (Matthew 6:33; Isaiah 45:1-3)</h1>

<blockquote>Mt 13:44 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Isaiah 45:1-3&mdash; Isa 45:1 ¶ Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut; 2 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pr 2:1-9 &mdash; ¶ My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
 2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
 3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
 4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
 5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
 6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
 7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
 8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
 9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</blockquote>

<h2>Babylon's Treasure</h2>

<ul>
	<li>(210 years prophesied before) Cyrus (the great, a Mede) did not worship God, but had particular knowledge that God used to compell Him to deliver God's treasure. It was the promise "of hidden, or even buried treasure". Sardes and Babylon, when taken by Cyrus, were the wealthiest cities in the world. "Treasures of Darkness --- Buried Treasure" (fearing robbers)</li>
	
	<li>Babylon represents a GODLESS, WORLD SYSTEM, ANTICHRIST. <b>We don't need the knowledge of God.</b></li>

	<blockquote>Mt 13:44 ¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</blockquote>

	<li>Babylon was a GREAT city with many brass gates and it would take many years for Cyrus to prepare to make his move against it -- perhaps a lifetime. Preparing to Take the City and its treasure. Babylon captured the IMAGINATION and HEART of Cyrus.</li>
	<li>How could it not, its propagand was everywhere?</li>
	<li>Doesn't satisify. Not a  week seems to pass without hearing about some millionaire taking their own life or a pro athlete (who gets paid to play games for a living) is caught up in some violent crime.</li>

	<li>A DAY OF EXCITEMENT: Simone Biles "GREATEST GYMNAST OF ALL TIME" --- man broke shotput record at Olympic Trials this year. --- Exalted for a brief moment, but what about that gymnast before her and the longest standing olympic record shotput before....quickly forgotten, glory is fleeting when you seek  your own.</li>

	<li>They are chasing after fools gold---there's nothing to it. THEY ARE LOSING THEIR MINDS. Because they have no understanding of where the REAL TREASURE lies.</li>

	<li>At the end of the journey, ALL HAVE BEEN DISAPOINTED in the end. "AL COPONE's TREASURE". --- BUILD UP, ADVERTISING THE OPENING OF THE VAULT, -----> EMPTY!</li>


</ul>

<h2>Hidden Treasures -- Fear of God, Knowledge of God, Relationship with God</h2>

<blockquote>4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her AS FOR HID TREASURES;</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>hid treasures --- a secret storehouse, buried treasure</li>
	<li>Captain William Kidd (pirate) has supposedly buried some 45 treasures in Maine. 1 or more legendary treasures in Edgecomb, Wiscasset Maine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now if we were to try to find Captain Kidd's buried treasure, there are somethings we need to know and some questions to ask.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is the treasure worth? what kind of person was He? what her his priorities? what kind of treasure would such a man have? Part of God's treasure IS PEOPLE --- Cyrus thought when tearing up the floor boards he was find the treasure, but the real value was in those liek Daniel and his 3 friends!!!</li>

	<li>What is it worth to you? (bro. Dale) Hebrews 11:24-27 Moses left those treasures of Egypt choosing rather...</li>

	
	<li>BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO LOOK. <b>YOUTH CAMP!!!</b></li>
	<li>Research: No experienced treasure hunter, enters the field without FIRST doing DEEP research.</li>
	<li>Interview others in the search or in the past have searched. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM? WHERE DOES HIS FLOCK FEED?</li>
	<li>Learn about the ONE to whom the treasure belongs.</li>

	<li>Has he written anything that would guide us in our search? --- map, bible</li>

	 <li>where has HE BEEN? Messengers Sent to Shepherds and Wisemen Willing to Seek Him | Bethlehem (unwanted) | He's been teaching Children!!! | Not joining clicks, but establishing God's kingdom</li>
	 <li>RULES/LAWS: "Finders Keepers?" Romans times: half to you, half to emperor | England: belongs to the crown, but maybe you'll get a reward.</li>
	 <blockquote>Mt 7:7 &mdash; Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</blockquote>
	 <li>Tools: Metal Detector, get it tuned up!!!</li>
</ul>

<h2>CONCLUSION: Don't lose sight of the treasure</h2>

<ul>
	<li>INNOCENCE (the world will through all it has to strip you of it): "Pack of Winstons...whats that look?"</li>

	<li>Further Education, Jobs, Relationships</li>
