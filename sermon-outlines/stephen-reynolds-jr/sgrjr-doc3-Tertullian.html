		<p class="cs35586"><span class="csAEEDF97E"><img src="sgrjr-doc3-Tertullian_files/image0.png" width="555" height="7" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Tertullian lived in the ancient city of Carthage in what is now Tunisia, sometime around 200AD. Very little is known about his life - that little comes either from writers two centuries later<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#1"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>1</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, or from the scanty personal notes in his works<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#2"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>2</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. Much of it has been asserted to be untrue anyway by some modern writers<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#3"><span class="cs15E2927D"> </span><span class="csE481077B"><sup>3</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">He was born a member of the educated classes, and clearly gained a good education. Life in his times wasn&#39;t very different in some ways to the modern day - he indulged his passions as he saw fit, including sex, and like everyone else attended the games where gladiators killed each other and criminals were eaten alive, for the enjoyment of the spectators<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#2"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>2</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">But among the sights he saw, was that of Christians being executed this way. He was struck with the courage with which stupid and contemptible slave men and little slave girls faced a hideous death, against all nature; and after investigating, became a Christian himself, and turned his budding talents to writing in defense of this despised and victimised group<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#4"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>4</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Tertullian was the first Christian writer to write in Latin<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#5"><span class="cs15E2927D"> </span><span class="csE481077B"><sup>5</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and was described three centuries later as writing &#39;first, and best, and incomparably&#39;, of all the writers to do so. (by the unknown author of &#39;<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/tertullianistae/praedestinatus.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Praedestinatus</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">&#39;). His writing is aggressive, sarcastic and brilliant<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#6"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>6</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and at points very funny even after 2000 years<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#7"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>7</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. He was deeply conscious of his own failings<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#8"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>8</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and had a burning desire for truth and integrity<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#9"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>9</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. He was described by <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/jerome_biog.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Jerome</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> as celebrated in all the churches as a speaker<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#10"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>10</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">; and his works bear the marks of the need to keep an audience awake!<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#11"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>11</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> His erudition was immense. Much of what he read is lost, but what remains gives a picture of wide reading<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#12"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>12</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, which was celebrated even in antiquity<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#12a"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>12a</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">He wrote a great number of works - how many is unknown. Thirty-one are extant; lists of known <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/works_lost.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">lost works</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> are elsewhere on this site; but we have no reason to suppose this to be anything like an exhaustive list. Most of those extant have come down to us by the slenderest of threads, and the very nature of Tertullian&#39;s terse and ironic style, means that copyists made many errors, and in some cases his text is beyond certain restoration. Not all of his works were ever completed<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#13"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>13</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">His most important work is the </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Apologeticum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, in defense of the Christians. Running it close must be </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Adversus Praxean</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, in which the doctrine of the Trinity comes into clear focus for the first time, in response to a heretic who was twisting the biblical balance between the persons of the Godhead. In this work, he created most of the terminology with which this doctrine was to be referred (and is still), such as </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Trinitas</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, etc<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#14"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>14</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.&nbsp; His discussion of how heretical arguments are in general to be handled in </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De praescriptio haereticorum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> also deserves wider recognition.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Tertullian wrote no systematic theology; all of his works are brought forth by a local event, a persecution, or a heretic.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">In his time, the church finally decided to reject a movement calling itself &#39;The New Prophecy&#39;, and known later as <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/montanism.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Montanism</span></a></span><span class="cs15E2927D"><a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#15"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>15</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. The New Prophecy made no doctrinal innovations<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#16"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>16</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, but said that the Holy Spirit was calling Christians to a more ascetic position. But obeying the prophets inevitably meant a problem, if the bishop did not recognise their authority.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Tertullian had grown angry at what looked like compromise creeping into the church - unwillingness to be martyred, willingness to forgive more serious public sins<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#17"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>17</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> - and aligned himself with the Montanists. It is unclear whether this involved actually leaving the church<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#17a"><span class="cs15E2927D"> </span><span class="csE481077B"><sup>17a</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, but his later works are avowedly Montanist, and one or two explictly attack the mainstream church on these points. As such he was not recognised as a Saint, despite his orthodoxy, and his works were all marked as condemned in the 6th Century <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/condemnation.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Decretum Gelasianum</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">His later life is unknown, and we do not know if he was martyred or died of old age as Jerome says<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#18"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>18</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Churchmen have not liked him - he is not easy reading for those who prefer compromise and ambiguity to truth, and of ecclesiasticism there is no trace in his works<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#19"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>19</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. The rhetoric that impressed his contemporaries has been often laid hold of and twisted in misquotations by enemies of the Church<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#20"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>20</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.

And whenever the errors against which he wrote resurface, as they do from time to time, what Tertullian had to say about them will again be readable; who wrote &#39;first and best and incomparably&#39; <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/#26"><span class="csE481077B"><sup>26</sup></span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> against them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA5950118">References</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">For all works cited, look at the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/sources.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">bibliography</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> for a full reference.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">1.

He was brought up a pagan (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De paenitentia</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> 1.1), had a relative who turned a philosophical dialogue (the </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Pinax</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> attributed to Cebes, the friend of Socrates) into a cento of Virgilian verse (De praescriptio haereticorum 39.4), knew the rhetorical schools and could quote the peroration of a popular rhetor, named Phosphorus (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Adversus Valentinianos</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> 8.3), delighted in adultery (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De resurrectione mortuorum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> 59.3), and he married a Christian girl after conversion (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De uxorem</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">). His movement towards Montanism is attested by notes referring to them (e.g. </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Adversus Praxean</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> 1) and is discussed by Barnes.<br/>3.

No-one actually knows why or how this bright young pagan came to Christ, as Barnes has pointed out. However many writers (including <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/sources.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Bardenhewer, Quasten</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">) have seen Tertullian&#39;s description of how the sight of Christians in the arena affects the pagan in the </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Apologeticum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> as autobiographical. It is certainly true that Tertullian returned to the theme that the true note of a Christian is the willingness to face martyrdom (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De corona</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De fuga in persecutione</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">).<br/>5. See Quasten, II. Of course there are earlier scraps of work - the Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs - but these are anonymous. See also Vincent of Lerins in 434AD, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Commonitorium</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, 17, where he describes Tertullian as &#39;first of us among the Latins&#39; (Quasten IV, p.549).<br/>6. General agreement among writers both ancient and modern that have been cited so far on this one.<br/>7. For an example that appeals to me, see </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Apologeticum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> 40: &quot;If the Tiber rises so high it floods the walls, or the Nile so low it doesn&#39;t flood the fields, if the earth opens, or the heavens don&#39;t, if there is famine, if there is plague, instantly the howl goes up, &quot;The Christians to the lion!&quot; What, all of them? to a single lion?&quot;<br/>8. See the end of </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De Baptismo</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, where he asks the newly baptised to pray for &quot;Tertullian, a sinner&quot;. Or the introduction to </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De Patientia</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, where he describes himself, &quot;always burning with the fires of impatience&quot;.<br/>9. The word </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">veritas</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> (truth) is used 162 times in one of his works (Quasten, vol 2, p.247).<br/>10. See Jerome&#39;s version of Eusebius&#39; Chronicle, entry for 208AD, <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/jerome_biog.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">here</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> (from Barnes).<br/>11. In my opinion, anyway.<br/>12. See Barnes, p196, for an assessment. See also p.332 of the postscript in the 2nd edition, for a qualification, that Tertullian may have depended more on encyclopedias than he had at first thought. But see also F.G.Kenyon, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Books and Readers</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, p36, for a different view on the need to use compendia of knowledge - cheap papyrus books mean that at that period, there is no real need to suppose the unavailability of the actual texts quoted.<br/>12a.Vincent of Lerins in 434AD, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Commonitorium</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, 17<br/>13. Lists of works are derived from Quasten, and Barnes. Text problems are likewise discussed by both, and in the introductions of the critical editions. For an example of the problems, see <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/sources.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">T.R.Glover</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> on the Apologeticum, p.xxii ff. For the unfinished nature of </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Adversus Judaeos</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> and </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De cultu feminarum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> I, see Barnes, .<br/>14. For </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Trinitas</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, see Quasten, vol 2, p286, who gives ch.2 of Adversus Praxean as the first use of </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Trinitas</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> as a technical term by a Latin writer.<br/>15. For Montanism, see the references to Eusebius and Epiphanius on my <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/montanism.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Montanism</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> page. It&#39;s a large issue, and only peripheral to Tertullian, so I&#39;ve not listed much on this. Barnes gives some references, p130ff.<br/>16. According to Tertullian, in the fragment of his lost work </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De ecstasi</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> quoted by the author of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/tertullianistae/praedestinatus.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Praedestinatus</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.<br/>17. </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De fuga in persecutione, De pudicitia.<br/></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">17a. The earliest statements in favour of the argument that he did leave are by Jerome and Augustine.&nbsp; But there are some scholars who do not accept that they had any special knowledge.&nbsp; It is therefore argued that in view of the way that the early church venerated North African &#39;Montanists&#39; like St.Perpetua, and the use of Tertullian by St. Cyprian, that he must in fact have never been condemned, or done more than take part in a para-church grouping of those influenced by Montanism.&nbsp; See Tabbernee, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Montanist Inscriptions</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, pt II for this, and references to other scholars.&nbsp; In fact this view seems to have become orthodoxy in anglophone circles.&nbsp; The original article was Douglas Powell, <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.tertullian.org/articles/powell_tertullianists.htm"><span class="csC85D4811">Tertullianists and Cataphrygians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> (1975).&nbsp; I understand the issue is discussed in David Rankin, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Tertullian and the Church</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, (Cambridge University Press 1995),xvii+229 pp, 35, on p.27 with full bibliography, but I haven&#39;t seen this.</span><span class="cs8C9D0446"><br/></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">18. Jerome says he lived to an advanced old age, Barnes suggests we do not know this is true, and since his last known works place him about the age of 40, for all we know he may have been martyred (p.59).<br/>19.

		<p class="cs35586"><span class="cs680D5D61"><img src="sgrjr-doc3-Tertullian_files/image1.png" width="555" height="7" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs2C025596">I</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">f he ever came to speak at your church you would probably never forget him. He was passionate, articulate, totally committed. He boldly taunted the might of the Roman empire, courageously defended oppressed believers, and harshly reprimanded compromising Christians. In later life, he lost favor with much of the Church when he at least temporarily took up with the Montanists- what we would probably call today a puritanical-charismatic sect. He was the pacesetter as the church expanded its teaching and influence into the Latin speaking world, breaking new and fertile ground in theological understanding. For example, he coined the word Trinity, a word that does not appear anywhere in the Bible, to help us to understand the New Testament teaching about what God is like. He was one of the most fascinating leaders in all church history.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus was born about 150 A.D. in Carthage, North Africa, the city considered second in importance only to Rome in his time. His father was the captain of a Roman legion and provided Tertullian with the education and training to become a lawyer. When he was about 40, Tertullian was converted to Christianity. He exuberantly embraced the gospel and ably used his legal skills to defend Christianity from pagan attackers.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs680D5D61">Bait. . . Blood. . . Seed</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"><br/>Thirty-one of Tertullian&#39;s writings remain, touching on all areas of human life. His works include apologetic treatises, controversial attacks on heresies, and moral writings. His </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Apology</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> defending the Christian faith contains one of the earliest and most eloquent pleas for religious liberty. He argued that the church was self-supporting and provided the most peaceful citizens to the state. The government should be protecting such citizens, not persecuting them. Tertullian also saw, however, that the persecution of the church by the Roman authorities actually strengthened the Church of Christ: &quot;It is bait that wins men for (our) school. The oftener we are mown down by you, the more in number we grow: the blood of Christians is seed [of the church].&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Persecution was an ever present danger in Tertullian&#39;s time and place. Christians were often perplexed by it. Was it from the Devil? Should they flee to avoid persecution. Tertullian took a tough line as difficult to understand today as it must have been then for he saw even persecution as from God: </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">It never happens without God willing it, and it is fitting-even at times necessary-for Him to do so, to the approval or condemnation of His servants. . . this is his winnowing fan which even now cleanses the Lord&#39;s threshing floor-His church, winnowing the mixed heap of the faithful and separating the wheat of the martyrs from the chaff of the cowards... (When persecution strikes), the Church is mightily stirred; then the faithful are more careful in their preparations, greater attention is given to fasts and station days, to prayers and humility, to mutual charity and love, to holiness and temperance. Men have time for nothing but fear and hope. Therefore, it is clear that persecution, which works for the improvement of the servants of God, cannot be blamed on the Devil</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs680D5D61">Truth Not Custom</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"><br/>Tertullian had a tenacious sense of the truth, and frequently railed against the church&#39;s conformity to the world and compromise with surrounding paganism. The social life of his time (just like our time but in slightly different appearance) was riddled with idolatry. Tertullian believed the Christian&#39;s conscience should be sensitive to the idolatry associated with the gladiatorial shows, violent games, plays, literature, administration, and even business guilds. &quot;Our Lord Christ has surnamed Himself Truth, not Custom,&quot; and Christians should beware of being conformed to this world. The spirit of Christianity, wrote Tertullian, is of meekness, peace, and purity, while the public shows and sporting events only excite the wild and furious passions of anger and lust. Licentious speech is condemned by God, and what a man should not say he should not hear.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs680D5D61">Regarding Worldly Philosophies</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"><br/>In these early years church leaders were struggling to understand how they should relate the faith to worldly learning. Other Christians of this period, such as Justin Martyr (see issue # 50), sought common ground between Greek philosophy and Christian belief. He would consider someone like Socrates as perhaps a Christian before the time of Christ. Tertullian, however, demanded &quot;What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?&quot; Socrates, he asserted, was not a forerunner of Christianity: </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">For by whom has truth ever been discovered without God? By whom has God ever been found without Christ? By whom has Christ ever been explored without the Holy Spirit? By whom has the Holy Spirit ever been attained without the mysterious gift of faith? Socrates, as none can doubt, was actuated by a different spirit. . .</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">In keeping with his great sense of truth, Tertullian also wrote several works attacking the heresies of his day, writing against Gnosticism and expounding orthodox Christian belief, especially the doctrine of the Trinity. Some of his ascetic ideas were later adopted by medieval monasticism.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">He fought the battle on many fronts as Christians sought to find their way in the midst of a hostile pagan culture. But Tertullian, who had written so outspokenly about martyrdom and persecution, died peacefully sometime after 229 A.D.</span></p><h1 class="cs673C987F">

		<p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Though thoroughly conversant with the Greek theology, Tertullian was independent of its metaphysical speculation.

This is evident from his ascription to God of corporeity and his acceptance of the traducian theory of the origin of the soul. He despised Greek philosophy, and, far from looking at <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" title="Plato"><span class="cs15E2927D">Plato</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle"><span class="cs15E2927D">Aristotle</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and other Greek thinkers whom he quotes as forerunners of Christ and the Gospel, he pronounces them the patriarchal forefathers of the heretics (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De anima</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, iii.). He held up to scorn their inconsistency when he referred to the fact that <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates"><span class="cs15E2927D">Socrates</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> in dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesculapius" title="Aesculapius"><span class="cs15E2927D">Aesculapius</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De anima</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, i.).

It was partly this element which gave to his writings a formative influence upon the theology of the post-Nicene period in the West and has rendered them fresh reading to this day. He was a born disputant, moved by the noblest impulses known in the Church. It is true that during the third century no mention is made of his name by other authors. Lactantius at the opening of the fourth century is the first to do this, but Augustine treats him openly with respect. Cyprian, Tertullian&#39;s North African compatriot, though he nowhere mentions his name, was well read in his writings, as Cyprian&#39;s secretary told Jerome.</span></p><p class="cs35E6C7D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">[<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tertullian&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Specific teachings"><span class="csB956BC15">edit</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">]</span></p><h3 class="cs673C987F">

In each individual it is a new product, proceeding equally with the body from the parents, and not created later and associated with the body (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De anima</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, xxvii.).

For Tertullian the soul is, however, a distinct entity and a certain corporeity and as such it may be tormented in Hell (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De anima</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, lviii.). </span></li><li class="csD5B82D5A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The soul&#39;s sinfulness is easily explained by its <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traducian" title="Traducian"><span class="csB956BC15">traducian</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> origin (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De anima</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, xxxix.).

It exists in all men alike; it is a culprit and yet an unconscious witness by its impulse to worship, its fear of demons, and its musings on death to the power, benignity, and judgment of God as revealed in the Christian&#39;s Scriptures (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De testimonio,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> v.-vi.). </span></li><li class="csD5B82D5A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God, who made the world out of nothing through his Son, the Word, has corporeity though he is a spirit (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De praescriptione</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, vii.; </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adv. Praxeam,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> vii.). However Tertullian used &#39;corporeal&#39; only in the stoic sense, to mean something with actual existence, rather than the later idea of flesh. In the statement of the Trinity, Tertullian was a forerunner of the Nicene doctrine, approaching the subject from the standpoint of the Logos doctrine, though he did not fully state the immanent Trinity. A contraction of two Latin words: tri (three) and unitas (one), tri-unitas (three in one) pointed to God as one God in substance and nature, but three in person &mdash; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patripassianism" title="Patripassianism"><span class="csB956BC15">patripassianism</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in Rome, he used the words, &quot; Trinity and economy, persons and substance.&quot; The Son is distinct from the Father, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adv. Praxeam,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> xxv.). &quot;These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, &#39;I and my Father are one&#39; in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance.&quot; The very names &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; indicate the distinction of personality. The Father is one, the Son is one, and the Spirit is one (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adv. Praxeam</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, ix.). The question whether the Son was coeternal with the Father Tertullian does not set forth in full clarity; and though he did not fully state the doctrine of the immanence of the Trinity, he went a long distance in the way of approach to it<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#_note-1"><span class="csB956BC15"><sup>[2]</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></li><li class="csD5B82D5A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology" title="Soteriology"><span class="csB956BC15">soteriology</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Tertullian does not dogmatize, he prefers to keep silence at the mystery of the cross (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De Patientia</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, iii.).

While he nowhere gives a list of the books of Scripture, he divides them into two parts and calls them the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">instrumentum</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">testamentum</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adv. Marcionem</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, iv. 1). He distinguishes between the four Gospels and insists upon their apostolic origin as accrediting their authority (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De praescriptione</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, xxxvi.; </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adv. Marcionem</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, iv. 1-5); in trying to account for Marcion&#39;s treatment of the Lucan Gospel and the Pauline writings he sarcastically queries whether the &quot;shipmaster from Pontus&quot; (Marcion) had ever been guilty of taking on contraband goods or tampering with them after they were aboard (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adv. Marcionem</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, v. 1). The Scripture, the rule of faith, is for him fixed and authoritative (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De corona</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, iii.-iv.). As opposed to the pagan writings they are divine (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De testimonio animae</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, vi.). They contain all truth (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De praescriptione</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, vii., xiv.) and from them the Church drinks (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">potat</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) her faith (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Adv. Praxeam</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, xiii.). The prophets were older than the Greek philosophers and their authority is accredited by the fulfilment of their predictions (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Apol.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, xix.-xx.). The Scriptures and the teachings of philosophy are incompatible, in so far as the latter are the origins of sub-Christian heresies. &quot;What has <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" title="Athens"><span class="csB956BC15">Athens</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to do with <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem"><span class="csB956BC15">Jerusalem</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">?&quot; he exclaims, &quot;or the Academy with the Church?&quot; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De praescriptione</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, vii.). Philosophy as pop-paganism is a work of demons (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De anima</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, i.); the Scriptures contain the wisdom of heaven. However Tertullian was not averse to using the technical methods of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" title="Stoicism"><span class="csB956BC15">Stoicism</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to discuss a problem (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De anima</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The rule of faith, however, seems to be also applied by Tertullian to some distinct formula of doctrine, and he gives a succinct statement of the Christian faith under this term (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">De praescriptione</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, xiii.). </span></li></ol>

In his writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, he gives expression to these views.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csAEEDF97E">On the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De spectaculis</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, viii., xvii.), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theater and the amphitheater. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De cultu</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, v.-vi.), and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">De virginibus velandis</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">).

C.W. Marx): &quot;Do you not know that you are Eve? The judgment of God upon this sex lives on in this age; therefore, necessarily the guilt should live on also. You are the gateway of the devil; you are the one who unseals the curse of that tree, and you are the first one to turn your back on the divine law; you are the one who persuaded him whom the devil was not capable of corrupting; you easily destroyed the image of God, Adam.

I myself have seen a certain Paul an old man of Concordia, a town of Italy, who, while he himself was a very young man had been secretary to the blessed Cyprian who was already advanced in age. He said that he himself had seen how Cyprian was accustomed never to pass a day without reading Tertullian, and that be frequently said to him, &quot;Give me the master, &quot; meaning by this, Tertullian. He was presbyter of the church until middle life, afterwards driven by the envy and abuse of the clergy of the Roman church, he lapsed to the doctrine of Montanus, and mentions the new prophecy in many of his books. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He composed, moreover, directly against the church, volumes: On modesty, On persecution, On fasts, On monogamy, six books On ecstasy, and a seventh which he wrote Against Apollonius.

He was evidently by profession an advocate in the law-courts, and he shows a close acquaintance with the procedure and terms of Roman law, though it is doubtful whether he is to be identified with a jurist Tertullian who is cited in the Pandects. He knew Greek as well as Latin, and wrote works in Greek which have not come down to us. A pagan until middle life, he had shared the pagan prejudices against <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christianity</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and had indulged like others in shameful pleasures. His conversion was not later than the year 197, and may have been earlier. He embraced the Faith with all the ardour of his impetuous nature. He became a priest, no doubt of the Church of Carthage. Monceaux, followed by d&#39;Ales, considers that his earlier writings were composed while he was yet a layman, and if this be so, then his ordination was about 200. His extant writings range in date from the apologetics of 197 to the attack on a bishop who is probably Pope Callistus (after 218). It was after the year 206 that he joined the Montanist sect, and he seems to have definitively separated from the Church about 211 (Harnack) or 213 (Monceaux). After writing more virulently against the Church than even against heathen and persecutors, he separated from the Montanists and founded a sect of his own. The remnant of the Tertullianists was reconciled to the Church by St. Augustine. A number of the works of Tertullian are on special points of belief or discipline. According to St. Jerome he lived to extreme old age. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The year 197 saw the publication of a short address by Tertullian, &quot;To the Martyrs&quot;, and of his great apologetic works, the &quot;Ad nationes&quot; and the &quot;Apologeticus&quot;.

The appeal to the nations suffers from its transmission in a single codex, in which omissions of a word or several words or whole lines are to be deplored. Tertullian&#39;s style is difficult enough without such super added causes of obscurity. But the text of the &quot;Ad nationes&quot; must have been always rougher than that of the &quot;Apologeticus&quot;, which is a more careful as well as a more perfect work, and contains more matter because of its better arrangement; for it is just the same length as the two books &quot;Ad nationes&quot;. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The &quot;Ad nationes&quot; has for its entire object the refutation of calumnies against <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. In the first place they are proved to repose on unreasoning hatred only; the procedure of trial is illogical; the offence is nothing but the name of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, which ought rather to be a title of honour; no proof is forthcoming of any crimes, only rumour; the first persecutor was Nero, the worst of emperors. Secondly, the individual charges are met; Tertullian challenges the reader to believe in anything so contrary to nature as the accusations of infanticide and incest. <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> are not the causes of earthquakes and floods and famine, for these happened long before <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christianity</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. The pagans despise their own gods, banish them, forbid their worship, mock them on the stage; the poets tell horrid stories of them; they were in reality only men, and bad men. You say we worship an ass&#39;s head, he goes on, but you worship all kinds of animals; your gods are images made on a cross framework, so you worship crosses. You say we worship the sun; so do you. A certain Jew hawked about a caricature of a creature half ass, half goat, as our god; but you actually adore half-animals. As for infanticide, you expose your own children and kill the unborn. Your promiscuous lust causes you to be in danger of the incest of which you accuse us. We do not swear by the genius of Caesar, but we are loyal, for we pray for him, whereas you revolt. Caesar does not want to be a god; he prefers to be alive. You say it is through obstinacy that we despise death; but of old such contempt of death was esteemed heroic virtue. Many among you brave death for gain or wagers; but we, because we believe in judgment. Finally, do us justice; examine our case, and change your minds. The second book consists entirely in an attack on the gods of the pagans; they are marshalled in classes after Varro. It was not, urges the apologist, owing to these multitudinous gods that the empire grew. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Out of this fierce appeal and indictment was developed the grander &quot;Apologeticus&quot;, addressed to the rulers of the empire and the administrators of justice. The former work attacked popular prejudices; the new one is an imitation of the Greek Apologies, and was intended as an attempt to secure an amelioration in the treatment of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> by alteration of the law or its administration. Tertullian cannot restrain his invective; yet he wishes to be conciliating, and it breaks out in spite of his argument, instead of being its essence as before. He begins again by an appeal to reason. There are no witnesses, he urges, to prove our crimes; <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15015a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Trajan</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> ordered Pliny not to seek us out, but yet to punish us if we were known; &mdash; what a paralogism! The actual procedure is yet more strange. Instead of being tortured until was confess, we are tortured until we deny. So far the &quot;Ad Nationes&quot; is merely developed and strengthened. Then, after a condensed summary of the second book as to the heathen gods, Tertullian begins in chapter xvii an exposition of the belief of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> in one <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, the Creator, invisible, infinite, to whom the soul of man, which by nature is inclined to <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christianity</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, bears witness. The floods and the fires have been His messengers. We have a testimony, he adds, from our sacred books, which are older than all your gods. Fulfilled prophecy is the proof that they are divine. It is then explained that Christ is <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Word of God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> born of a virgin; His two comings, His <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">miracles</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, passion, <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">resurrection</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and forty days with the disciples, are recounted. The disciples spread His doctrine throughout the world; Nero sowed it with blood at Rome. When tortured the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> cries, &quot;We worship <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> through Christ&quot;. The demons confess Him and they stir men up against us. Next, loyalty to Ceasar is discussed at greater length than before. When the populace rises, how easily the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> could take vengeance: &quot;We are but of yesterday, yet we fill your cities, islands, forts, towns, councils, even camps, tribes, decuries, the palace, the senate, the forum; we have left you the temples alone&quot;. We might migrate, and leave you in shame and in desolation. We ought at least to be tolerated; for what are we? &mdash; a body compacted by community of religion, of discipline, and of hope. We meet together to pray, even for the emperors and authorities, to hear readings from the holy books and exhortations. We judge and separate those who fall into crime. We have elders of proved virtue to preside. Our common fund is replenished by voluntary donations each month, and is expended not on gluttony but on the poor and suffering. This charity is quoted against us as a disgrace; see, it is said, how they love one another. We call ourselves brethren; you also are our brethren by nature, but bad brethren. We are accused of every calamity. Yet we live with you; we avoid no profession, but those of assassins, sorcerers, and such like. You spare the philosophers, though their conduct is less admirable than ours. They confess that our teaching is older than theirs, for nothing is older than truth. The <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">resurrection</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> at which you jeer has many parallels in nature. You think us fools; and we rejoice to suffer for this. We conquer by our death. Inquire into the cause of our constancy. We believe this martyrdom to be the remission of all offences, and that he who is condemned before your tribunal is absolved before <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">These points are all urged with infinite wit and pungency. The faults are obvious. The effect on the pagans may have been rather to irritate than to convince. The very brevity results in obscurity. But every lover of eloquence, and there were many in those days, will have relished with the pleasure of an epicure the feast of ingenious pleading and recondite learning. The rapier thrusts are so swift, we can hardly realize their deadliness before they are renewed in showers, with sometimes a blow as of a bludgeon to vary the effect. The style is compressed like that of Tacitus, but the metrical closes are observed with care, against the rule of Tacitus; and that wonderful maker of phrases is outdone by his <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> successor in gemlike sentences which will be quoted while the world lasts.

It was probably about the same time that Tertullian developed his thesis of the &quot;Testimony of the Soul&quot; to the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">existence of one God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, in his little book with this title. With his usual eloquence he enlarges on the idea that common speech bids us use expressions such as &quot;<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> grant&quot;, or &quot;If <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> will&quot;, &quot;<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> bless&quot;, &quot;<a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> sees&quot;, &quot;May <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> repay&quot;. The soul testifies also to devils, to just vengeance, and to its own immortality. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Two or three years later (about 200) Tertullian assaulted heresy in a treatise even more brilliant, which, unlike the &quot;Apologeticus&quot;, is not for his own day only but for all time. It is called &quot;Liber de praescriptione haereticorum&quot;. Prescription now means the right obtained to something by long usage. In Roman law the signification was wider; it meant the cutting short of a question by the refusal to hear the adversary&#39;s arguments, on the ground of an anterior point which must cut away the ground under his feet. So Tertullian deals with heresies: it is of no use to listen to their arguments or refute them, for we have a number of antecendent proofs that they cannot deserve a hearing. Heresies, he begins, must not astonish us, for they were prophesied. Heretics urge the text, &quot;Seek and ye shall find&quot;, but this was not said to <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">; we have a rule of faith to be accepted without question. &quot;Let curiosity give place to faith and vain glory make way for salvation&quot;, so Tertullian parodies a line of Cicero&#39;s. The heretics argue out of Scripture; but, first, we are forbidden to consort with a heretic after one rebuke has been delivered, and secondly, disputation results only in blasphemy on the one side and indignation on the other, while the listener goes away more puzzled than he came. The real question is, &quot;To whom does the Faith belong? Whose are the Scriptures? By whom, through whom, when and to whom has been handed down the discipline by which we are <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">? The answer is plain: Christ sent His apostles, who founded churches in each city, from which the others have borrowed the tradition of the Faith and the seed of doctrine and daily borrow in order to become churches; so that they also are Apostolic in that they are the offspring of the Apostolic churches. All are that one Church which the Apostles founded, so long as peace and intercommunion are observed [</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">dum est illis communicatio pacis et appellatio fraternitatis et contesseratio hospitalitatis</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">]. Therefore the testimony to the truth is this: We communicate with the apostolic Churches&quot;. The heretics will reply that the Apostles did not know all the truth. Could anything be unknown to Peter, who was called the rock on which the Church was to be built? or to John, who lay on the Lord&#39;s breast? But they will say, the churches have erred. Some indeed went wrong, and were corrected by the Apostle; though for others he had nothing but praise. &quot;But let us admit that all have erred:&mdash; is it credible that all these great churches should have strayed into the same faith&quot;? Admitting this absurdity, then all the baptisms, spiritual gifts, <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">miracles</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, martyrdoms, were in vain until Marcion and Valentinus appeared at last! Truth will be younger than error; for both these heresiarchs are of yesterday, and were still Catholics at Rome in the episcopate of Eleutherius (this name is a slip or a false reading). Anyhow the heresies are at best novelties, and have no continuity with the teaching of Christ. Perhaps some heretics may claim Apostolic antiquity: we reply: Let them publish the origins of their churches and unroll the catalogue of their bishops till now from the Apostles or from some bishop appointed by the Apostles, as the Smyrnaeans count from <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12219b.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Polycarp</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> and John, and the Romans from Clement and Peter; let heretics invent something to match this. Why, their errors were denounced by the Apostles long ago. Finally (36), he names some Apostolic churches, pointing above all to Rome, whose witness is nearest at hand, &mdash; happy Church, in which the Apostles poured out their whole teaching with their blood, where Peter suffered a death like his Master&#39;s, where Paul was crowned with an end like the Baptist&#39;s, where John was plunged into fiery oil without hurt! The Roman Rule of Faith is summarized, no doubt from the old Roman Creed, the same as our present Apostles&#39; Creed but for a few small additions in the latter; much the same summary was given in chapter xiii, and is found also in &quot;De virginibus velandis&quot; (chapter I). Tertullian evidently avoids giving the exact words, which would be taught only to catechumens shortly before baptism. The whole luminous argument is founded on the first chapters of St. Irenaeus&#39;s third book, but its forceful exposition is not more Tertullian&#39;s own than its exhaustive and compelling logic. Never did he show himself less violent and less obscure. The appeal to the Apostolic churches was unanswerable in his day; the rest of his argument is still valid. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">A series of short works addressed to catechumens belong also to Tertullian&#39;s Catholic days, and fall between 200 and 206. &quot;De spectaculis&quot; explains and probably exaggerates the impossibility for a <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> to attend any heathen shows, even races or theatrical performances, without either wounding his faith by participation in idolatry or arousing his passions. &quot;De idololatria&quot; is by some placed at a later date, but it is anyhow closely connected with the former work. It explains that the making of idols is forbidden, and similarly astrology, selling of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07716a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">incense</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, etc. A schoolmaster cannot elude contamination. A <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> cannot be a soldier. To the question, &quot;How am I then to live?&quot;, Tertullian replies that faith fears not famine; for the Faith we must give up our life, how much more our living? &quot;De baptismo&quot; is an instruction on the necessity of baptism and on its effects; it is directed against a female teacher of error belonging to the sect of Gaius (perhaps the Anti-Montanist). We learn that baptism was conferred regularly by the bishop, but with his consent could be administered by priests, <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04647c.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">deacons</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, or even laymen. The proper times were <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05224d.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Easter</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> and Pentecost. Preparation was made by fasting, vigils, and prayers. Confirmation was conferred immediately after by unction and laying on of hands. &quot;De paenitentia&quot; will be mentioned later. &quot;De oratione&quot; contains aan exposition of the Lord&#39;s Prayer, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">totius evangelii breviarium</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. &quot;De cultu feminarum&quot; is an instruction on modesty and plainness in dress; Tertullian enjoys detailing the extravagances of female toilet and ridiculing them. Besides these didactic works to catechumens, Tertullian wrote at the same period two books, &quot;Ad uxorem&quot;, in the former of which he begs his wife not to marry again after his death, as it is not proper for a <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, while in the second book he enjoins upon her at least to marry a <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> if she does marry, for pagans must not be consorted with. A little book on patience is touching, for the writer admits that it is an impudence in him to discourse on a virtue in which he is so conspicuously lacking. A book against the Jews contains some curious chronology, used to prove the fulfilment of Daniel&#39;s prophecy of the seventy weeks. The latter half of the book is nearly identical with part of the third book against Marcion. It would seem that Tertullian used over again what he had written in the earliest form of that work, which dates from this time. &quot;Adversus Hermogenem&quot; is against a certain Hermogenes, a painter (of idols?) who taught that <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> created the world out of pre-existing matter. Tertullian reduces his view </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">ad absurdum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and establishes the creation out of nothing both from Scripture and reason. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The next period of Tertullian&#39;s literary activity shows distinct evidence of Montanist opinions, but he has not yet openly broken with the Church, which had not as yet condemned the new prophecy. Montanus and the prophetesses Priscilla and Maximilla had been long dead when Tertullian was converted to belief in their inspiration. He held the words of Montanus to be really those of the Paraclete, and he characteristically exaggerated their import. We find him henceforth lapsing into rigorism, and condemning absolutely second marriage and forgiveness of certain sins, and insisting on new fasts. His teaching had always been excessive in its severity; now he positively revels in harshness. Harnack and d&#39;Al&egrave;s look upon &quot;De Virginibus velandis&quot; as the first work of this time, though it has been placed later by Monceaux and others on account of its irritated tone. We learn that Carthage was divided by a dispute whether virgins should be veiled; Tertullian and the pro-Montanist party stood for the affirmative. The book had been preceded by a Greek writing on the same subject. Tertullian declares that the Rule of Faith is unchangeable, but discipline is progressive. He quotes a dream in favour of the veil. The date may be about 206. Shortly afterwards Tertullian published his largest extant work, five books against Marcion. A first draft had been written much earlier; a second recension had been published, when yet unfinished, without the writer&#39;s consent; the first book of the final edition was finished in the fifteenth year of Severus, 207. The last book may be a few years later. This controversy is most important for our knowledge of Marcion&#39;s doctrine. The refutation of it out of his own New Testament, which consisted of St. Luke&#39;s Gospel and St. Paul&#39;s Epistles, enables us to reconstitute much of the heretic&#39;s Scripture text. The result may be seen in Zahn&#39;s, &quot;Geschichte des N. T. Kanons&quot;, II, 455-524. A work against the Valentinians followed. It is mainly based on the first book of St. Irenaeus. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">In 209 the little book &quot;De pallio&quot; appeared. Tertullian had excited remark by adopting the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion"><span class="cs15E2927D">Greek pallium</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, the recognized dress of philosophers, and he defends his conduct in a witty pamphlet. A long book, &quot;De anima&quot;, gives Tertullian&#39;s psychology. He well describes the unity of the soul; he teaches that it is spiritual, but immateriality in the fullest sense he admits for nothing that exists, &mdash; even <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> is </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">corpus</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. Two works are against the docetism of the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06592a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Gnostics</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, &quot;De carne Christi&quot; and &quot;De resurrectione carnis&quot;. Here he emphasizes the reality of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christ&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> Body and His virgin-birth, and teaches a <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12789a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">corporal resurrection</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. But he seems to deny the virginity of Mary, the Mother of Christ, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">in partu</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, though he affirms it </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">ante partum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. He addressed to a convert who was a widower an exhortation to avoid second marriage, which is equivalent to fornication. This work, &quot;De exhortatione castitatis&quot;, implies that the writer is not yet separated from the Church. The same excessive rigour appears in the &quot;De corona&quot;, in which Tertullian defends a soldier who had refused to wear a chaplet on his head when he received the donative granted to the army on the accession of Caracalla and Geta in 211. The man had been degraded and imprisoned. Many <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> thought his action extravagant, and refused to regard him as a martyr. Tertullian not only declares that to wear the crown would have been idolatry, but argues that no <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> can be a soldier without compromising his faith. Next in order is the &quot;Scorpiace&quot;, or antidote to the bite of the Scorpion, directed against the teaching of the Valentinians that <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> cannot approve of martyrdom, since He does not want man&#39;s death; they even permitted the external act of idolatry. Tertullian shows that <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> desires the courage of the martyrs and their victory over temptation; he proves from Scripture the duty of suffering death for the Faith and the great promises attached to this heroism. To the year 212 belongs the open letter &quot;Ad scapulam&quot;, addressed to the proconsul of Africa who was renewing the persecution, which had ceased since 203. He is solemnly warned of the retribution which overtakes persecutors. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The formal secession of Tertullian from the Church of Carthage seems to have taken place either in 211 or at the end of 212 at latest. The earlier date is fixed by Harnack on account of the close connection between the &quot;De corona&quot; of 211 with the &quot;De fuga&quot;, which must, he thinks, have immediately followed the &quot;De corona&quot;. It is certain that &quot;De fuga in persecutione&quot; was written after the secession. It condemns flight in time of persecution, for <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God&#39;s providence</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> has intended the suffering. This intolerable doctrine had not been held by Tertullian in his Catholic days. He now terms the Catholics &quot;Psychici&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;spiritual&quot; Montanists. The cause of his schism is not mentioned. It is unlikely that he left the Church by his own act. Rather it would seem that when the Montanist prophecies were finally disapproved at Rome, the Church of Carthage <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05678a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">excommunicated</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> at least the more violent among their adherents. After &quot;De fuga&quot; come &quot;De monogamia&quot; (in which the wickedness of second marriage is yet more severely censured) and &quot;De jejunio&quot;, a defence of the Montanist fasts. A dogmatic work, &quot;Adversus Prazean&quot;, is of great importance. Praxeas had prevented, according to Tertullian, the recognition of the Montanist prophecy by the pope; Tertullian attacks him as a Monarchian, and develops his own doctrine of the Holy Trinity (see MONARCHIANS and PRAXEAS). The last remaining work of the passionate schismatic is apparently &quot; De pudicitia&quot;, if it is a protest, as is generally held, aagainst a Decree of Pope Callistus, in which the pardon of adulterers and fornicators, after due penance done, was published at the intercession of the martyrs. Monceaux, however, still supports the view which was once commoner than it now is, that the Decree in question was issued by a bishop of Carthage. In any case Tertullian&#39;s attribution of it to a would-be </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">episcopus episcoporum</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> and </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">pontifex maximus</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> merely attests its peremptory character. The identification of this Decree with the far wider relaxation of discipline with which Hippolytus reproaches Callistus is uncertain. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The argument of Tertullian must be considered in some detail, since his witness to the ancient system of penance is of first-rate importance. As a Catholic, he addressed &quot;De paenitentia&quot; to catechumens as an exhortation to repentance previous to baptism. Besides that sacrament he mentions, with an expression of unwillingness, a &quot;last hope&quot;, a second plank of salvation, after which there is no other. This is the severe remedy of exomologesis, confession, involving a long penance in sackcloth and ashes for the remission of post-baptismal sin. In the &quot;De pudicitia&quot; the Montanist now declared that there is no forgiveness for the gravest sins, precisely those for which exomologesis is necessary. It is said by some modern critics, such as Funk and Turmel among Catholics, that Tertullian did not really change his view on this point the writing of the two treatises. It is pointed out that in &quot;De paenitentia&quot; there is no mention of the restoration of the penitent to communion; he is to do penance, but with no hope of pardon in this life; no sacrament is administered, and the satisfaction is lifelong. This view is impossible. Tertullian declares in &quot;De pud.&quot; That he has changed his mind and expects to be taunted for his inconsistency. He implies that he used to hold such a relaxation, as the one he is attacking, to be lawful. At any rate in the &quot;De paen.&quot; he parallels baptism with exomologesis, and supposes that the latter has the same effect as the former, obviously the forgiveness of sin in this life. Communion is never mentioned, since catechumens are addressed; but if exomologesis did not eventually restore all <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> privileges, there could be no reason for fearing that the mention of it should act as an encouragement to sin, for a lifelong penance would hardly be a reassuring prospect. No length is mentioned, evidently because the duration depended on the nature of the sin and the judgment of the bishop; had death been the term, this would have been emphatically expressed. Finally. And this is conclusive, it could not be insisted on that no second penance was ever allowed, if all penance was lifelong. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">For the full understanding of Tertullian&#39;s doctrine we must know his division of sin into three classes. There are first the terrible crimes of idolatry, blasphemy, homicide, adultery, fornication, false witness, fraud (Adv. Marc., IV, ix; in &quot;De Pud.&quot; he substitutes apostasy for false witness and adds unnatural vice). As a Montanist he calls these irremissible. Between these and mere venial sins there are modica or media (De Pud.., I), less grave but yet serious sins, which he enumerates in &quot;De Pud.&quot;, xix: &quot;Sins of daily committal, to which we are all subject; to whom indeed does it not occur to be angry without cause and after the sun has set, or to give a blow, or easily to curse, or to swear rashly, or break a contract, or lie through shame or necessity? How much we are tempted in business, in duties, in trade, in food, in sight, in hearing! So that, if there were no forgiveness for such things, none could be saved. Therefore there will be forgiveness for these sins by the prayer of Christ to the Father&quot; (De Pud., xix). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Another list (De pud., vii) represents the sins which may constitute a lost sheep, as distinguished from one that is dead: &quot;The faithful is lost if he attend the chariot races, or gladiatorial combats, or the unclean theatre, or athletic shows, or playing, or feasts on some secular solemnity, or if he has exercised an art which in any way serves idolatry, or has lapsed without consideration into some denial or blasphemy&quot;. For these sins there is forgiveness, though the sinner has strayed from the flock. How is forgiveness obtained? We learn this only incidentally from the words: &quot;That kind of penitence which is subsequent to faith, which can either obtain forgiveness from the bishop for lesser sins, or from <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> only for those which are irremissible&quot; (ib.,xviii). Thus Tertullian admits the power of the bishop for all but &quot;irremissible&quot; sins. The absolution which he still acknowledges for frequent sins was obviously not limited to a single occasion, but must have been frequently repeated. It is not even referred to in &quot;De paen&quot;, which deals only with baptism and public penance for the gravest sins. Again, in &quot;De pud.&quot;, Tertullian repudiates his own earlier teaching that the keys were left by Christ through Peter to His Church (Scorpiace, x); he now declares (De pud., xxi) that the gift was to Peter personally, and cannot be claimed by the Church of the Psychici. The spiritual have the right to forgive, but the Paraclete said: &quot;The Church has the power to forgive sins but I will not do so, lest they sin afresh.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">The system of the Church of Carthage in Tertullian&#39;s time was therefore manifestly this: Those who committed grievous sins confessed them to the bishop, and he absolved them after due penance enjoined and performed, unless the case was in his judgment so grave that public penance was obligatory. This public penance was only allowed once; it was for protracted periods, even sometimes until the hour of death, but at the end of it forgiveness and restoration were promised. The term was frequently shortened at the prayer of martyrs. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Of the lost works of Tertullian the most important was the defence of the Montanist manner of prophesying, &quot;De ecstasi&quot;, in six books, with a seventh book against Apollonius. To the peculiarities of Tertullian&#39;s views which have already been explained must be added some further remarks. He did not care for philosophy: the philosophers are the &quot;patriarchs of the heretics&quot;. His notion that all things, pure spirits and even <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, must be bodies, is accounted for by his ignorance of philosophical terminology. Yet of the human soul he actually says that it was seen in a vision as tender, light, and of the colour of air! All our souls were contained in Adam, and are transmitted to us with the taint of original sin upon them, &mdash; an ingenious if gross form of traducianism. His Trinitarian teaching is inconsistent, being an amalgamation of the Roman doctrine with that of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08580c.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">St. Justin Martyr</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. Tertullian has the true formula for the Holy Trinity, </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">tres Personae, una Substantia</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are numerically distinct, and each is <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">; they are of one substance, one state, and one power. So far the doctrine is accurately Nicene. But by the side of this appears the Greek view which was one day to develop into <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01707c.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Arianism</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">: that the unity is to be sought not in the Essence but in the origin of the Persons. He says that from all eternity there was reason (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">ratio</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">) in <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, and in reason the Word (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Sermo</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">), not distinct from <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, but </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">in vulva cordis</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. For the purpose of creation the Word received a perfect birth as Son. There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> was neither Father nor Judge. In his Christology Tertullian has had no Greek influence, and is purely Roman. Like most Latin Fathers he speaks not of two Natures but of two Substances in one Person, united without confusion, and distinct in their operations. Thus he condemns by anticipation the Nestorian, Monophysite, and <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10502a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Monothelite</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> heresies. But he seems to teach that Mary, the Mother of Christ, had other children. Yet he makes her the second Eve, who by her obedience effaced the disobedience of the first Eve. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Tertullian&#39;s doctrine of the Holy Eucharist has been much discussed, especially the words: &quot;Acceptum panem et distributum discipulis corpus suum illum fecit, hoc est corpus meum dicendo, id est, figura corporis mei&quot;. A consideration of the context shows only one interpretation to be possible. Tertullian is proving that <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Our Lord</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> Himself explained bread in Jer., xi, 19 (</span><span class="cs8C9D0446">mittamus lignum in panem ejus</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">) to refer to His Body, when He said, &quot;This is My Body&quot;, that is, that bread was the symbol of His Body. Nothing can be elicited either for or against the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05573a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Real Presence</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">; for Tertullian does not explain whether the bread is the symbol of the Body present or absent. The context suggests the former meaning. Another passage is: </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Panem, quo ipsum corpus suum repraesentat</span><span class="csAEEDF97E">. This might mean &quot;Bread which stands for His Body&quot;, or &quot;Presents, makes present&quot;. D&#39;Ales has calculated that the sense of presentation to the imagination occurs seven times in Tertullian, and the similar moral sense (presentation by picture, etc.) occurs twelve times, whereas the sense of physical presentation occurs thirty-three times. In the treatise in question against Marcion the physical sense alone is found, and fourteen times. A more direct assertion of the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05573a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Real Presence</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> is </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">Corpus ejus in pane censetur</span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> (De orat., vi). As to the grace given, he has some beautiful expressions, such as: &quot;Itaque petendo panem quotidianum, perpetuitatem postulamus in Christo et individuitatem a corpore ejus&quot; (In petitioning for daily bread, we ask for perpetuity in Christ, and indivisibility from His body. &mdash; Ibid.). A famous passage on the Sacraments of Baptism, Unction, Confirmation, Orders and Eucharist runs: &quot;Caro abluitur ut anima maculetur; caro ungitur ut anima consecretur; caro signatur ut et anima muniatur; caro manus impositione adumbratur ut et anima spiritu illuminetur; caro corpore et sanguine Christi vescitur ut et anima de Deo saginetur&quot; (The flesh is washed, in order that the soul may be cleansed; the flesh is anointed, that the soul may be consecrated; the flesh is signed [with the cross], that the soul, too, may be fortified; the flesh is shadowed with the imposition of hands, that the soul also may be illuminated by the Spirit; the flesh feeds on the body and blood of Christ, that the soul likewise may have its fill of <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">God</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> &mdash; &quot;Deres. Carnis.&quot;, viii). He testifies to the practice of daily communion, and the preserving of the Holy Eucharist by private persons for this purpose. What will a heathen husband think of that which is taken by his <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> wife before all other food? &quot;If he knows that it is Bread, will he not believe that it is simply what it is called?&quot; This implies not merely the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05573a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Real Presence</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, but transubstantiation. The station days were Wednesday and Friday; on what other days besides Holy Mass was offered we do not know. Some thought that Holy Communion would break their fast on Station days; Tertullian explains: &quot; When you have received and reserved the Body of the Lord, you will have assisted at the Sacrifice and have accomplished the duty of fasting as well&quot; (De oratione, xix). Tertullian&#39;s list of customs observed by Apostolic tradition though not in Scripture (De cor., iii) is famous: the baptismal renunciations and feeding with milk and honey, fasting Communion, offerings for the dead (Masses) on their anniversaries, no fasting or kneeling on the Lord&#39;s Day and between <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05224d.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Easter</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> and Pentecost, anxiety as to the falling to the ground of any crumb or drop of the Holy Eucharist, the <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13785a.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Sign of the Cross</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E"> made continually during the day. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Tertullian&#39;s canon of the Old Testament included the deuterocanonical books, since he quotes most of them. He also cites the Book of Enoch as inspired, and thinks those who rejected it were wrong. He seems also to recognize IV Esdras, and the Sibyl, though he admits that there are many sibylline forgeries. In the New Testament he knows the Four Gospels, Acts, Epistles of St. Paul, I Peter (Ad Ponticos), I John, Jude, Apocalypse. He does not know James and II Peter, but we cannot tell that he did not know II, III John. He attributes Hebrews to St. Barnabas. He rejects the &quot;Pastor&quot; of Hermas and says that many councils of the Psychici had also rejected it. Tertullian was learned, but careless in his historical statements. He quotes Varro and a medical writer, Soranus of Ephesus, and was evidently well read in pagan literature. He cites Irenaeus, <a class="cs1ABBB7BF" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08580c.htm"><span class="cs15E2927D">Justin</span></a></span><span class="csAEEDF97E">, Miltiades, and Proclus. He probably knew parts of Clement of Alexandria&#39;s writings. He is the first of Latin theological writers. To some extent, how great we cannot tell, he must have invented a theological idiom and have coined new expressions. He is the first witness to the existence of a Latin Bible, though he seems frequently to have translated from the Greek Bible as he wrote. Zahn has denied that he possessed any Latin translation, but this opinion is commonly rejected, and St. Perpetua certainly had one at Carthage in 203. </span></p><h1 class="cs35586">

His admiration for Christian heroism under persecution seems to have been the strongest factor in his conversion. In 197 he returned to Carthage, where he married and became a presbyter of the church. About 207 he broke with the church and joined the Montanists in Africa. Soon after, however, he broke with them and formed his own party, known as the Tertullianists. <br/><br/>A zealous champion of Christianity, Tertullian wrote many theological treatises, of which 31 have survived. He wrote with brilliant rhetoric and biting satire. His passion for truth led him into polemics with his enemies. In his various works he strove either to defend Christianity, to refute heresy, especially Gnosticism, or to argue some practical point of morality or church discipline. His views on ethics and discipline, rigorously ascetic from the first, became progressively more harsh in his later works. After espousing Montanist doctrines, he was a severe critic of orthodox Christians, whom he accused of moral laxity. <br/><br/>Tertullian profoundly influenced the later church fathers, especially Saint Cyprian -- and through them, all Christian theologians of the West. Many of his works are accepted as orthodox by the Roman Catholic church and are included in the recognized body of patristic literature. Tertullian&#39;s writings demonstrate a profound knowledge of Greek and Latin literature, both pagan and Christian. He was the first writer in Latin to formulate Christian theological concepts, such as the nature of the Trinity. Having no models to follow, he developed a terminology derived from many sources, chiefly Greek and the legal vocabulary of Rome. He is regarded by some as the Father of Latin Theology. <br/><br/>The most famous work by Tertullian is </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">Apologeticum</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> (c. 197), an impassioned defense of Christians against pagan charges of immorality, economic worthlessness, and political subversion. </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">De spectaculis</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> (On the Games) explains and probably exaggerates the impossibility for a Christian to attend any heathen shows, even races or theatrical performances, without either wounding his faith by participation in idolatry or arousing his passions. </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">De idololatria</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> (On Idolatry) is by some placed at a later date, but it is anyhow closely connected with the former work. It explains that the making of idols is forbidden, and similarly astrology, selling of incense, etc. A schoolmaster cannot elude contamination. A Christian cannot be a soldier. To the question, &quot;How am I then to live?&quot;, Tertullian replies that faith fears not famine; for the Faith we must give up our life, how much more our living? </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">De baptismo</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> (On Baptism) is an instruction on the necessity of baptism and on its effects; it is directed against a female teacher of error belonging to the sect of Gaius. We learn that baptism was conferred regularly by the bishop, but with his consent could be administered by priests, deacons, or even laymen. The proper times were Easter and Pentecost. Preparation was made by fasting, vigils, and prayers. Confirmation was conferred immediately after by unction and laying on of hands. Besides these didactic works to catechumens, Tertullian wrote at the same period two books, </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">Ad uxorem</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> (To my wife), in the former of which he begs his wife not to marry again after his death, as it is not proper for a Christian, while in the second book he enjoins upon her at least to marry a Christian if she does marry. </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">Adversus Hermogenem</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> is against a certain Hermogenes, a painter (of idols?) who taught that God created the world out of pre-existing matter. Tertullian reduces his view to absurdity, and establishes the creation out of nothing both from Scripture and reason. <br/><br/>Of his doctrinal treatises refuting heresy, the most important is </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">De praescriptione hereticorum</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> (On the Claims of Heretics), in which he argued that the church alone has the authority to declare what is and is not orthodox Christianity. Like all Montanists, Tertullian held that Christians should welcome persecution, not flee from it. <br/><br/>Christian historians value many of his writings, especially </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">De baptismo</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> and </span><span class="cs7F95DE68">De oratione</span><span class="cs5E98E930"> (On Prayer), for the light they throw on contemporary religious practices.</span></p></body>
