<p>The Antichrist, will come at an economically difficult time. There will be war in different parts of the world, and he—through brilliant political moves along with an incredible charisma—will be able to do what no one else has ever done: bring economic stability to the world’s monetary system and bring world peace. By establishing this peace, he will deceive many. He will even convince the Jewish nation and the Arab nations to sign a peace treaty, paving the way for the long-awaited third temple.</p>
<p>His accomplishments will be so spectacular, so far-reaching and unprecedented, that many will hail him as the Messiah. But we are warned in Scripture that he is a deceiver.</p>

<li>. Halfway into his power play he will show his true colors, rebuilding the temple and committing the abomination of desolation (Daniel 12:11; Matthew 24:15). He will show himself to be a blood-thirsty dictator who will make Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Saddam Hussein look like lightweights in comparison.</li>

<li>Homosexual? Daniel 11:37 ... <i>Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women</i></li>
<li>Satan’s unholy trinity The Antichrist will not act alone. There will be a false prophet working with him. “Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone” (Revelation 19:20). Here we see Satan’s unholy trinity: --&gt;Satan, imitating God (and, for a short time, having the worship of people worldwide) --&gt; The Antichrist, masquerading as the Son --&gt;The false prophet, impersonating the Holy Spirit</li>
<li>The Antichrist will bring about a new religious system that will accommodate everyone.</li>
<li>The Antichrist will harness the world’s economic system. (Revelation 13:16-18)</li>

<p>The most immediate and obvious obstacle to realization of these goals is the fact that two historic Islamic structures which are 13 centuries old, namely the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, are built on top of the Temple Mount. Any efforts to damage or reduce access to these sites, or to build Jewish structures within, between, beneath, beside, cantilevered on top of, or instead of them, could lead to severe international conflicts, given the association of the Muslim world with these holy places.[15]</p>
