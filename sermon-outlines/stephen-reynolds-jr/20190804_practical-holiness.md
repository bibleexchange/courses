## Modern Issues - The Confusion (Jeremiah 6:7-20)

- God has no part in this!
- Neither has God obscured the path. It is increasingly difficult to be a Christian, but its not because God has made it so. NOT GOD'S FAULT.
- Not Everybody who says they are a Christian is saved.

1. v. 7 **Bullying** (oppression in her)
2. v.10-12 **Contempt for God's Word**
3. v.13 **Worldliness** (covetous, got to have the next best thing)
4. v.14 **Treachery of Prophets** (dressing down, alcohol, tattoos; Psychological Manipulation in "ministry")
5. v.15 **No Shame in their Sin**
6. v.18,19 **Won't be Corrected** (man-centered Gospel; Masculinity "toxic", merging of the sexes)
7. v.20 **Religious Sacrifice of no use to God** (Mysticism in Music (not "anointed"))

## Biblical Principles that are the Foundation of the Standards of Practical Holiness

## Thoughts

- A daily question we must ask ourselves as we look in he mirror of God's Word.
- Difference: Commands, statutes, principles, spirit of the rule
- Set the Ideal before people. (Platform standards)
- Reframing the question: Is it sin? vs. Is it Holy/Sanctified? (Where is the burden of proof?)
- Ordinances of man must no displace God's commands, but rather ECHO His commands.
- People's lives can be a standard ("be followers of me ..." 1 Cor. 11:1)
- https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/preaching-practical-holiness guidelines for how to preach practical holiness.  If a pastor wants to see his people become more holy, more pure, more pleasing to God in their kitchens and bedrooms and offices and backyards, what should he say to them? How should he preach?
- "out of bounds" personal convictions. Error of applying necessary personal standards corporately.
