<h1 id="sermon">Don't You Know What Time it Is? (Matthew 16:1-3)</h1>

<blockquote>Matthew 16:1-3&mdash; Mt 16:1 ¶ The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. 2  He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. 3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? 4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.</blockquote>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Some STRONG meat from Jesus</li>
	<li>The closer we live to this world the less aware we will be of the times we are in, but the closer we walk with God, His TIMETABLE becomes everything.</li>

	<li>Comes a time to drop the bullet into the chamber and fire away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>UNAWARE</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Satan works overtime to convince us, we have more time than we do. ()</li>
	<li>Mom getting us ready for school. "Just grab your stuff and get dressed in the car!"</li>
	<li>How many missed opportunities because we did not know the time?</li>
	<li>Captain's decision to "abandon ship" ... a giant cargo ship coming out of Norway capsized in 4 minutes.</li>
	<li>Sleep walking through life, MONOTONOUS, "everything just continues as it always has" (2 Peter 3:4)</li>
</ul>

<h2>AWARE (SOME ARE AWARE OF THE TIME)</h2>

<p>example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Noah (Genesis 7:1) knew it was time to gather into the Ark.</li>
	<li>David (1 Samuel 17) knew it was not time to hide but to be a witness.</li>
	<li>Political changes, church leaderships changing over, LIKE BIRTH PAINS signalling</li>
	<li>Heather and Jay, Not time to EXPERIMENT, my child's life is at stake.</li>
</ul>

<h2>HOW NOW SHALL WE LIVE? </h2>

<blockquote>Romans 13:11 &mdash; And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Soldier in the civil war was injured at the battle of Shiloh and so  was dispatched to the rear of the army. But it wasn't long before you was shouting to his captain, "GIVE ME GUN, this battle aint got no rear.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="study">Can You Feed Yourself? (Ecclesiastes 12:8-14)</h1>

<blockquote>Ec 12:8 ¶ Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity. 9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. 10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth. 11 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. 12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. 13 ¶ Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. 14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</blockquote>
