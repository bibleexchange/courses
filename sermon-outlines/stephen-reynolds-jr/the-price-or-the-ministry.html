<h1>A Mind for God to Work

<font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">John 12:1-8&mdash;Then Jesus
six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which
had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 2 There they made him a
supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at
the table with him. 3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of
spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his
feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the
ointment. 4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's
son, which should betray him, 5 Why was not this ointment sold for
three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 6 This he said, not that
he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag,
and bare what was put therein. 7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone:
against the day of my burying hath she kept this. 8 For the poor
always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</font></blockquote>
<p>THEME: Maintain a mind that allows God to work. Our mind can work
contrary to God if we do not put it in submission to Jesus.</p>
<h2>A Contrary Mind is Distracted</h2>
<p><strong>Where is your mind at?</strong> Been doing some thinking.</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>It is the nature of the carnal mind to resist God.  Romans
	8:7 Because the carnal mind is <b>enmity</b> against God:&hellip;</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>A mind contrary to the work of God, eliminates me from the
	blessing of being a part, but God will still accomplish his purpose.
		</p>
</ul>
<h3>RELIGIOUS LEADERS: How can I Stop this? (Other Priorities)</h3>
<p>In Mark 14 The Chief priests and the scribes was figuring how they
might take Jesus by CRAFT.</p>
<p>Flesh screaming, &quot;I need to get out of here.&quot; (preaching
on Hell Sunday -- looking for an exit.)</p>
<h3>I Can't Get Over How Much it Costs -If I was in Charge,would do
Differently</h3>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In Matthew 26, Mark 14 &amp;
	John 8 COMPLAINT IS FOCUSED CONCERNING THE COST OF THE PERFUME 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>too long, AC too cold (not cold enough) &quot;smells funny
	in here&quot; 
	</p>
</ul>
<h3>I Don't See How I benefit from this? (JUDAS)</h3>
<blockquote>...This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but
because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put
therein.</blockquote>
<p>We benefit when Christ is glorified, but ultimately the primary
purpose is the glory of Christ and not my comfort.</p>
<h3><strong>DENIAL</strong> of God's Handiwork: Can't be God, God
wouldn't Use a Sinner Woman</h3>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>In Luke 7, COMPLAINT IS FOCUSED CONCERNING THE WOMAN
	HERSELF. 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>How simple of a ministry, that really anyone could have done it.
They were embarrassed they didn't think of it first before this
woman. (Matthew 26 and Mark 14 a memorial unto her.)</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Just the preacher doing what a
	preacher does. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>This is a Divine Appointment 
	</p>
</ul>
<blockquote>**2 Cor 10:5 **&mdash;Casting down imaginations, and
every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God,
and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</blockquote>
<h2>A Mind for God to Work</h2>
<h3>My Gift I BRING to the Master</h3>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Stephen giving in the offering.
	( a particular excitement to share in giving) vs. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">One day considering pocketing
	the money. (keeping the gift for self) 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>Is $40 too much spend in preparing for the Lord's death?
	The most honored guest possible. It was her reasonable service as
	she had a mind for God to work. Eventually Judas betrays Jesus for
	about $15, the price of a slave. <strong>SHE DID WHAT SHE COULD.</strong>
		</p>
</ul>
<h3>My Work of Obedience is Much in the hands of the Master</h3>
<p>Her anointing of Jesus was a prophetic act. She did not REALLY
know what she was doing.</p>
<blockquote>...against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</blockquote>
<h3>I'm Ready to Receive the Ministry of the Master</h3>
<p>Just enough is said by the minister to get your attention toward
God for Him to do the work. An example without becoming a Lord over
your faith.</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Preacher Can't call you to the
	ministry 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>People can't effectively call you to a life of greater
	consecration. 
	</p>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>1 Cor. 3:6,7</strong> <em>I have planted, Apollos
watered; but God gave the increase. 7 So then neither is he that
planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the
increase.</em></blockquote>
<p>Vague challenges. &quot;Give it all to God.&quot; But what does
that mean, specifically for me? How do I work through this.</p>
<h3>My Troubles I Give to the Master (&quot;Troubled Mind&quot; The
Battle ground of the mind)</h3>
<p>Jesus knows how deep the trouble runs.</p>
<p>Who is this woman? - Mary the sister of Lazarus? They loved her,
but she seems to always make them look bad. - A Sinner? Her Tears and
Hair washed the feet of Jesus, &quot;Thy sins are forgiven.&quot;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Break the seal. Perfume. You have been holding back. Break the
seal. Sensitivity to the move of the Spirit of God. Tarry at his
feet.</p>
