## Love Toward Christ

> Philemon 1:5 &mdash; Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;

William R. Featherston  (1848–1875)  wrote the poem "My Jesus, I Love Thee" soon following his conversion at the age of 16. Featherston died prior to his 27th birthday, and is not known to have written any other songs. In 1876 Adoniram Gordon used the poem as lyrics for a hymn. Not much is known about Featherston, except that he attended a Methodist church in Montreal, that he was young when he wrote the poem (12 or 16 years old), and that he died at just 27 years of age. One story about how the poem became public is that Featherston mailed it to his aunt in Los Angeles who, upon reading it, quickly sought its publication. It wasn’t until  after Featherston’s death that Adoniram Judson Gordon (founder of Gordon College and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary) added a melody and published it in his book of hymns, thus forever transforming this poem to a song.

> 1 John 4:19 &mdash; We love him, because he first loved us.

1. My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
   For Thee all the follies of sin I resign;
   My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;
   If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
2. I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,
   And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree;
   I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
   If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
3. I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
   And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
   And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,
   If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.
4. In mansions of glory and endless delight,
   I’ll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
   I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
   If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.

## v.8 "I Have Much Authority" , but v.9 "for love's sake"

- on account of my love for thee, I entreat thee.

> Philemon 1:8,9 &mdash; Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

## v.10-19 "Onesimus" a Runaway Slave

- v.10 name "onesimus" means "profitable, useful" from a root meaning "to help".
- v.12 Justice appeared to demand that Onesimus return to Philemon, but Love inspired a letter.
