<h1 id="sermon">I'm Running for My Life</h1>

<blockquote>Hebrews 12:1-3 &mdash;1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and <strong>the sin which doth so easily beset us</strong>, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lu 24:13-15 &mdash; And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
God is Real --- We are fearfully and wonderfully made<br>
0. We are in a Race for our Lives/Souls -- You can get free of it and stay ahead of it<br>
1. What it is --- disappointing God<br>
- Weights --- hardness, disinterest<br>
- Besetting Sins<br>

<p>Sin is a gaurantee on the JUDGEMENT OF GOD. "the wages of sin is death". The greatest threat against a move of God among us will be how we handle sin in our midst. BEING SUPER RELIGIOUS/PIOUS ISN"T GOING TO CUT IT</p>

2. How we out run it<br>
- Best Defense is Steering Clear of its signs --- Don't play with it<br>
- Expose it --- doesn't like the light (don't hide it)<br>
- "With Patience" (patient continuance) -- stay in the race<br>
- Deliverance --- a more aggressive weapon needed<br>

- vs. 1, YOu've got some help --- 1 conversation away from a deliverance



<ul>
	<li>SIN IS EVERYWHERE --- Our success in our race against it will be determined by HOW WE DEAL WITH IT.</li>
	<li>CEV -- Sin that just won't let go</li>
	<li>Sin that is always near</li>
	<li>a more aggressive weapon is needed -- prayer and fasting.</li>
	<li>Is there sin in your life?</li>
	<li>Steer Clear, Get as Far Away as You Can</li>
	<li>Besetting sins</li>
	<li>Conviction of Sin</li>
	<li>Presumptuous Sins: taking the grace of God for granted.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge our sin and repent.</li>
	<li>"I Don't want to talk about it!" Provide no safe harbor for sin by our conversation. ("You aren't gonna tell daddy are you?")</li>
	<li>Paper and Pen in front to write on and trash can</li>
	<li>JUST ONE CONVERSATION FROM A DELIVERANCE</li>
	<li>The Lord's "ears are burning" --- Romans right ear = praise left ear = criticism</li>
	<li>Prayer, the Word and the Anointing of the Holy Ghost are always KEYS TO EVERY DELIVERANCE, but there is also the KEY of "CONVERSATION WITH THE SAINTS".</li>
	<li>I've identified a phonemon in the church, where it can quickly become innappropriate to discuss WEAKNESS and SIN. In an effort to "not give place to the devil", we give sin a place to hide.</li>
	<li>IT MATTERS WHO YOU TALK TO</li>
	<li>Understand what is happening to you is not original or unique, but the devil tries the same bag of tricks on us all.</li>
	<li>Accountability: Where you going? Who you going with? What are you gonna do when you are there? When will you be back? --- DO NOT BE SO QUICK TO DISMISS OR BUCK AGAINST ACCOUNTABILITY. No matter your age.</li>
	<li>What is DELIVERANCE? IN A PRISON HOUSE, a SNARE, BOUND  ==== set free, recover, rescue, save, to cause to escape for slip out</li>
	<li>The devil gets nervous when we begin to talk about the Lord and drawing nigh.</li>
	
	<li>Life altering seeds are sown in mere conversation.</li>

	<blockquote> Pr 18:21 Â¶ Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</blockquote>

	<li>"Great cloud of witnesses" We are not without resource!</li>

	<li>The devil will identify himself before to long. By Godly conversation we can EXPOSE the devil and His work.</li>

	<li>So long as you keep silent, you carry it alone. Let someone help you carry it.</li>
	<li>Taboo, Frowned on, We don't talk about that in my family. (Its going to come up somewhere!)</li>
	
	<blockquote>Ps 32:3 &mdash; When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>De 6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. [talk of the law with your children.]</blockquote>

	<li>I went from talking foolishly without control, to thinking "talking is a bad thing."</li>
	<li>Preacher, why you trying to get me to open up? I believe with confession, follows God's attention.</li>

	<li>Is there anything two people who trully love each other can't work out?</li>

	<li>Some haven't entered the "Youth Camp Conversation" yet. Just been absorbing it all or thinking.</li>
	<li>An Old Fashioned Altar is the place where we can talk about it all!</li>

	<li>You love the spiritual influence, but it just hasn't "added up", "wrong true", "seem real". I'd rather have my child come to me and say "the Bible is weird" then for them to say nothing.</li>

	<li>Take time so that "How you doing?" is more than just another way to say HI and bye.</li>

	<blockquote> Jg 11:40 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. {to lament or "to talk with"}</blockquote>

	<li>fighting he devil can be like fighting in the dark. but once his locationis exposed ... ! We know he is hindering, but where, how?</li>

	<li>Probably don't realize what is going on --- rebellion</li>

	<li>Missing God's Standard/Mark --- Disappointing God</li>
