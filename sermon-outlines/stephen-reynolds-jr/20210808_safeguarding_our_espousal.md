# Safeguarding Our Espousal

TEXT: 2 Corinthians 11:1-4

> 2 Cor. 11:1-4‚ÄîWould to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. 3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.

## INTRODUCTION

### 1. The ministry and responsiblities of the FAMILY/BODY towards his members.

### 2. Jewish Wedding
	- 3 Stages: 1) Match Making 2) Bethrothal (1 year) 3) Consumation (week long)
	- PRICE PAID
	- [MOHAR] Father of groom paid "Dowry" / "BRIDAL PRICE" / "PURCHASE PRICE OF THE BRIDE" to father of the Bride <<< This Price is logical as the marriage was not view merely as an agreement between 2 individuals but between 2 families. <<< the newly married man did not found a new home for himself but occupied a "NOOK" in his father's house. So the groom's family GAINED and the bride's family lost a valuable household member. (no suggesting of slavery here.)
	- [MATTAN] Gifts given by the groom to the Bride in addition to the MOHAR.
	- It became customary for a "GOOD FATHER" to give the whole or at least part of the MOHAR to his daughter. If he didn't he was viewed as unkind and harsh.
	- at Betrothal contract was signed
	- IN RECEIVING THESE GIFTS WAS A LEGAL RESPONSIBIILTY
	- "PUTTING AWAY and WRITING OF DIVORCEMENT"

### 3. THERE ARE UNDERCURRENTS OF DECEPTION (UNDERMINING OF THE WORK OF GOD)
2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. (clean, innocent, perfect, pure)
6:1 ‚ÄúWorkers Together‚Äù
9:2 ‚ÄúBoasted of your zeal in Macedonia‚Äù (visited twice and making 3rd trip)
What defenses do we have against deception?
Deuteronomy 11:16‚ÄîTake heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived‚Ä¶

## I. Family Meeting (the spirit Paul presents with in our text)

- Not Stepping Back but STEPPING UP (circle the wagons) - let's talk about it
- Our Fight must be UNLIKE how the devil works "MANIPULATIVE" -- We empower with truth and opportunity of spiritual experiences.
- THERE IS AN ELEMENT FIGHTING AGAINST PAUL 

> 2 Cor. 11:1,2‚ÄîWould to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.  

- He had bypassed them when he traveled to Macedonia (1:16,17)
- Had rebuke them in I Cor. (3:1 You are Carnal, Babies) <misunderstanding>
- We are striving for the **SOUL of the CHURCH**.

## II. BE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF DECEPTION

THE DANGERS ARE REAL & ARE MANY
> 3 But I fear, lest by any means, 
>2Co 2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
>2 Peter 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
ü°™AS LOOSE AND CARELESS AS WE ARE, THE DANGER IS EVER SO REAL.

THE DANGERS ARE SUBTLE
- VULNERABILITY OF THE FLESH AND CARNAL MIND
- SO OFTEN IT IS WHAT THE DEVIL LEAVES OUT IN HIS OFFER THAT WILL DESTROY US.
	-New Age Bible Versions: 1) I John 5:7 omitted 2)Phil. 4:13 ‚ÄúChrist‚Äù replaced ‚Äúhim‚Äù [NIV: I can do all this through him who gives me strength.]
	-‚ÄúThe big print giveth, the small print taketh away!‚Äù
- MUST WATCH & PRAY!
- SELF HARM --- What are we doing to ourselves? (the enemy within) MUSIC

## II. GLORY IN THE SIMPLICITY THAT IS IN CHRIST
as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. (CORRUPT‚ÄîPINE AWAY, WITHER) (Simplicity ‚Äìcompleteness, singleness, purity)
1 Cor 2:2For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
Satan makes additions to our godly profession that he might draw our attention away from Christ.
--though eve was beguiled  1. (v. t.) To delude 3. to while away; to divert.
1. works to our justification, Faith without works ( which stinks, dead! James 2:20)
2. exceptions to our love
3. detours to our walk
4. dogma to our doctrine(such a stronghold)
5. darkness to our light joy peace Matthew 6:23 ... the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! ( I Peter 2:9 Out of darkness into his marvelous light)
6. distractions to our mission


## IV. DON‚ÄôT BE SO QUICK TO CHASE AFTER ANOTHER (ESPOUSED TO ONE)

### 1. Another PREACHER, JESUS
 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.

know them which labor among us : Paul makes a directly personal plea to the Corinthians 
-to the flock not elders as Tim Titus revelation etc
--substance or style???
Tho I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge
rood: Not "impolite" in English Versions of the Bible ( 2 Corinthians 11:6 (idiotes, `though I lack technical training in rhetoric')
--accepted in god or exceptional? Not a whit behind ... Gods ministers are some of his gifts to the church eph 4:12,13... Do we appreciate them and honor properly
--heart or hirelings??
2 Corinthians 12:15 Will gladly spend and be spent for you!
2 Cor 11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy...

- Maintaining the LORDSHIP of Christ. --- "Lest any man should think of me ABOVE what he has seen or hear of me." A CAREFULNESS
- Self Promotion, Arrogance, Commercial Gospel

### 2. ANOTHER SPIRIT

- Emphasis on Body Ministry
- Entertain Criticism: help can come from unexpected places
- WHERE did you get that? HOW did you get that?
- 1 Kings 22:4 And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art,

### 3. ANOTHER GOSPEL

Study the word of god
--REALstudy of what is there instead of what you want to be told or have been told only looking for confirmation of your preconceptions. Real study allows the word to speak for itself. 
ü°™READ, STUDY, MEDITATE, MEMORIZE, BELIEVE
