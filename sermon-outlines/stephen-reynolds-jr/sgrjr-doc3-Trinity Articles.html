		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Christianity regards itself as a monotheistic religion, for it teaches the existence of one God - specifically, Yahweh, the God of the Jews. It shares this belief with two other major world religions, Judaism and Islam. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">However, Christian monotheism is a unique kind of monotheism. It holds that God is One, but that three distinct &quot;persons&quot; constitute the one God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This unique threefold God of Christian belief is referred to as the Trinity (from Latin </span><span class="cs71B604F8">trinitas</span><span class="cs7BA0F056">, &quot;three&quot;). </span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs291DB7DA">History of the Doctrine of the Trinity </span></h2>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">The doctrine of the Trinity took centuries to develop, but the roots of the doctrine can be seen from the first century. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">The word &quot;Trinity&quot; is not found in the New Testament, nor is the doctrine explicitly taught there. However, foundations of the concept of the Trinity can be seen in the New Testament, especially in the Gospel of John, one of the latest and most theologically developed of the New Testament books. <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#1"><span class="cs787F4D79">1</span></a></span><span class="cs7BA0F056"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Hints of Trinitarian beliefs can also be seen in the teachings of extra-biblical writers as early as the end of the first century. <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#2"><span class="cs787F4D79">2</span></a></span><span class="cs7BA0F056"> However, the clearest early expression of the concept came with Tertullian, a Latin theologian who wrote in the early third century. Tertullian coined the words &quot;Trinity&quot; and &quot;person&quot; and explained that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit were &quot;one in essence - not one in Person.&quot; <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#3"><span class="cs787F4D79">3</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">About a century later, in 325, the Council of Nicea set out to officially define the relationship of the Son to the Father, in response to the controversial teachings of Arius. Led by bishop Athanasius, the council established the doctrine of the Trinity as orthodoxy and condemned Arius&#39; teaching that Christ was the first creation of God. The creed adopted by the council described Christ as &quot;God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance (</span><span class="cs71B604F8">homoousios</span><span class="cs7BA0F056">) with the Father.&quot; <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#4"><span class="cs787F4D79">4</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Nicea did not end the controversy, however. Debate over how the creed (especially the phrase &quot;one substance&quot;) ought to be interpreted continued to rage for decades. One group advocated the doctrine that Christ was a &quot;similar substance&quot; (homoiousios) as the Father. But for the most part, the issue of the Trinity was settled at Nicea and, by the fifth century, never again became a focus of serious controversy.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Most post-Nicene theological discussion of the Trinity consisted of attempts to understand and explain such a unique concept. Gregory of Nyssa, in his treatise, </span><span class="cs71B604F8">That There are Not Three Gods</span><span class="cs7BA0F056">, compared the divinity shared by the three persons of the Trinity to the common &quot;humanness,&quot; or human nature, that is shared by individual human beings. (Ironically, this initially promising explanation has been seen by some to yield a conclusion quite opposite than the title of his work.) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Saint Augustine, one of the greatest thinkers of the early church, described the Trinity as comparable to the three parts of an individual human being: mind, spirit, and will. They are three distinct aspects, yet they are inseparable and together constitute one unified human being. </span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

			<span class="cs291DB7DA">Critics of the Trinitarian Doctrine, Past and Present</span></h2>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Despite its widespread acceptance among Christians, the doctrine of the Trinity has been a stumbling block to many non-Christians throughout its history. The fiercely monotheistic Jews rejected the idea of the Trinity since it first arose, it has been similarly rejected by Islam since that religion was founded, and many other men and women of all backgrounds have found the concept difficult to understand or accept. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">This section provides a brief summary of groups and individuals who have rejected the Trinity, presented in roughly chronological order.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD7DEB2B3">Judaism</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">In the New Testament, Jews are described as rejecting Jesus&#39; claims apparent claims to divinity, accusing him of blasphemy. In the Gospel of Mark, for instance, Jesus forgives a man&#39;s sins and some Jewish teachers thought to themselves: &quot;Why does this fellow talk like that? He&#39;s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot; <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#5"><span class="cs787F4D79">5</span></a></span><span class="cs7BA0F056"> In the Gospel of John, some Jews began to stone Jesus, explaining that they did so &quot;for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.&quot; <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#6"><span class="cs787F4D79">6</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">The great Jewish philosopher Maimonides also rejected the Trinitarian beliefs of Christians. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs7BA0F056">In his aversion to what he considered to be Christian dilutions of pure monotheism, especially in its doctrine of the Trinity, much of Maimonides&#39; philosophical critique of Christian theology is similar to Islamic arguments against it. In his earlier work, Maimonides translated his theoretical disdain of Christianity into practice. He deemed Christians to be idolators and bemoaned the fact that political necessity forced many European Jews to live in Christian societies. <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#7"><span class="cs787F4D79">7</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Today, Jewish counter-missionary movements like &quot;Jews for Judaism&quot; seek to educate Jews about why belief in the Trinity is incompatible with Judaism.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD7DEB2B3">Arianism</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Arianism is the name given to an anti-Trinitarian belief system taught by Arius, an elder in the Alexandrian church, in the early fourth century AD. Arius affirmed the uniqueness of God and denied the complete divinity of the Son (Christ). He taught instead that Christ was a created and changeable being, who, while superior to humans, is not of the same order as the one God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Arius and Arianism were condemned at the famous Council of Nicea in 325 AD, which proclaimed that the Son was of &quot;the same substance&quot; as the Father. After Constantine&#39;s death, however, Arianism flourished again for some decades and almost overcame the Nicene party. Arianism was finally condemned at the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD7DEB2B3">Islam</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">The sacred text of Islam, the Qur&#39;an (or Koran), explicitly denies the doctrine of the Trinity. It appears to understand the Christian Trinity as being the Father, Son and Mary: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs7BA0F056">And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): &#39;O &#39;Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) ! Did you say unto men: Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?&#39; He will say: &#39;Glory be to you! It was not for me to say that which I had no right (to say). <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#8"><span class="cs787F4D79">8</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD7DEB2B3">Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">The Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, a Christian group founded in the United States, rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Instead, it teaches a doctrine similar to that of Arius in the fourth century - Christ is the Son of God, a special being, created by God before the beginning of time, but not equal with God. Witnesses regard Arius as a forerunner of Charles Taze Russell, their movement&#39;s founder. <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#9"><span class="cs787F4D79">9</span></a></span><span class="cs7BA0F056"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">A Jehovah&#39;s Witness brochure entitled &quot;Beliefs and Customs that God Hates&quot; includes the Trinity, saying: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Is Jehovah a Trinity-three persons in one God? No! Jehovah, the Father, is &quot;the only true God.&quot; (John 17:3; Mark 12:29) Jesus is His firstborn Son, and he is subject to God. (1 Corinthians 11:3) The Father is greater than the Son. (John 14:28) The holy spirit is not a person; it is God&#39;s active force.-Genesis 1:2; Acts 2:18.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">In addition to the Bible verses cited above, Witnesses point out that it was the secular Emperor who proposed the doctrine of Christ as &quot;same substance&quot; with God, not the bishops present, and that the doctrine of the Trinity (i.e., including the divinity of the Holy Spirit) was not actually brought forth at Nicea at all. Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses also argue that the Athanasian Creed, which sets forth the doctrine more clearly, was not only probably not written by Athanasius himself, but may not have been composed until the fifth century. Finally, they note the presence of Trinitarian-type beliefs in pagan religion, and argue that paganism is the source of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity as well. <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#10"><span class="cs787F4D79">10</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csD7DEB2B3">Unitarianism</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">&quot;Unitarianism&quot; is the doctrine of the oneness of God, with the resultant denial of the Trinity. Today, the doctrine of unitarianism is expressed by the Unitarian Universalist Association and similar groups, which have their historical roots in sixteenth-century eastern Europe. Historically, Unitarian Universalists are defined by their rejection of the Trinity and their belief in the ultimate salvation of all humanity. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Today, however, Unitarians draw from a variety of religious traditions and do not focus on doctrine and creeds as much as love and justice between human beings. Because of this de-emphasis on doctrine, modern Unitarian Universalist arguments against the Trinity are scarce. However, the official Web site of the Unitarian Univeralist Association describes the early history of their beliefs this way: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs7BA0F056">During the first three centuries of the Christian church, believers could choose from a variety of tenets about Jesus. Among these was a belief that Jesus was an entity sent by God on a divine mission. Thus the word &quot;Unitarian&quot; developed, meaning the oneness of God. Another religious choice in the first three centuries of the Common Era (CE) was universal salvation. This was the belief that no person would be condemned by God to eternal damnation in a fiery pit. Thus a Universalist believed that all people will be saved. Christianity lost its element of choice in 325 CE when the Nicene Creed established the Trinity as dogma. For centuries thereafter, people who professed Unitarian or Universalist beliefs were persecuted. <a class="csF082EE06" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/#11"><span class="cs787F4D79">11</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs722CA83F">The Da Vinci Code</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs7BA0F056">Although neither a scholarly nor a religious source, Dan Brown&#39;s novel </span><span class="cs71B604F8">The Da Vinci Code</span><span class="cs7BA0F056"> is mentioned here because it has been widely read and it claims to present numerous &quot;historical facts&quot; about the development of the Trinity and other aspects of early Christianity.

Christians had to reconcile their belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ with their belief in the one-ness of God. In doing so, some stressed the one-ness to the point of considering Father, Jesus and Holy Spirit as merely three modes or roles in which God shows himself to mankind; others stressed the three-ness to the point of positing three divine beings, with only one of them supreme and God in the full sense. Only in the fourth century were the distinctness of the three and their unity brought together and expressed in mainline Christianity in a single doctrine of one essence and three persons. Some Christians still debate the differences found in the New Testament, where Christ declared &quot;I and my Father are one,&quot; but also prayed on the cross, &quot;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani&quot; (My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?), which is often explained that first sentence refers to Jesus&#39; divine nature and the second one to his human nature; another explanation is that the prayer on the cross quotes Psalm 22:1 in order to name the entire Psalm, interpreted as prophesying Jesus&#39; crucifixion.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In 325, the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea" title="First Council of Nicaea"><span class="csB956BC15">Council of Nicaea</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> adopted a term for the relationship between the Son and the Father that from then on was seen as the hallmark of orthodoxy; it declared that the Son is &quot;of the same substance&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousia" title="Ousia"><span class="csDF0905CC">ὁ&mu;&omicron;&omicron;ύ&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) as the Father.

However, this language is hemmed in with qualifications so severe that the analogy in view is easily lost, and is a source of perpetual controversy. The main points, however, are that &quot;there is one God because there is one Father&quot; and that, while the Son and Spirit both derive their existence from the Father, the communion between the Three, being a relationship of Divine Love, is such that there is no subordination </span><span class="csC382D2BB">per se</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

It should be noted that explanations of the Trinity are not the same thing as the doctrine itself; nevertheless the Augustinian West is inclined to think in philosophical terms concerning the rationality of God&#39;s being, and is prone on this basis to be more open than the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox" title="Eastern Orthodox"><span class="csB956BC15">East</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to seek philosophical formulations which make the doctrine more intelligible.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Christian East, for its part, correlates ecclesiology and trinitarian doctrine, and seeks to understand the doctrine of the Trinity via the experience of the Church, which it understands to be &quot;an ikon of the Trinity&quot; and therefore, when St. Paul writes concerning Christians that all are &quot;members one of another,&quot; Eastern Christians in turn understand this as also applying to the Divine Persons.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For example, one Western explanation is based on deductive assumptions of logical necessity: which hold that God is necessarily a Trinity. On this view, the Son is the Father&#39;s perfect conception of his own self. Since existence is among the Father&#39;s perfections, his self-conception must also exist. Since the Father is one, there can be but one perfect self-conception: the Son. Thus the Son is begotten, or generated, by the Father in an act of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">intellectual</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> generation. By contrast, the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit" title="Holy Spirit"><span class="csB956BC15">Holy Spirit</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> proceeds from the perfect love that exists between the Father and the Son: and as in the case of the Son, this love must share the perfection of real existence. Therefore, as reflected in the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filioque_clause" title="Filioque clause"><span class="csB956BC15">filioque clause</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> inserted into the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed" title="Nicene Creed"><span class="csB956BC15">Nicene Creed</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> by the Roman Catholic Church, the Holy Spirit is said to proceed from both the Father &quot;and the Son&quot;. (it would also be appropriate according to Western teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">through</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the Son.

One reason for this is that it undermines the personhood of the Holy Spirit; is there not also perfect love between the Father and the Holy Spirit, and if so, would this love not also share the perfection of real existence? At this rate, there would be an infinite number of persons of the Godhead, unless some persons were subordinate so that their love were less perfect and therefore need not share the perfection of real existence.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism" title="Anglicanism"><span class="csB956BC15">Anglicans</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> have made a commitment in their Lambeth Conference, to provide for the use of the creed without the filioque clause in future revisions of their liturgies, in deference to the issues of Conciliar authority raised by the Orthodox.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Most Protestant groups that use the creed also include the filioque clause.

Proponents find plurality in Old Testament details like the term &quot;Elohim&quot; and argue for example that Jesus accepted worship, forgave sins, claimed oneness with the Father, and used the expression &quot;I am&quot; as an echo of the divine name (according to some translations) given to Moses on Sinai. Those who reject the teaching for their part offer different explanations, arguing among other things that Jesus also rejected being called so little as good in deference to God (versus &quot;the Father&quot;) (Mark 10:18), disavowed omniscience as the Son, &quot;learned obedience&quot; (Hebrews 5:8), and referred to ascending unto &quot;my Father, and to your Father; and to my God, and to your God&quot; (John 20:17). They also dispute that &quot;Elohim&quot; denotes plurality, noting that this name in nearly all circumstances takes a singular verb and arguing that where it seems to suggest plurality, Hebrew grammar still indicates against it. They also point to statements by Jesus such as his declaration that the Father was greater than he or that he was not omniscient, in his statement that of a final day and hour not even he knew, but the Father (Mark 13:32), and to Jesus&#39; being called the firstborn of creation (Colossians 1:15) and &#39;the beginning of God&#39;s creation,&#39; (Revelation 3:14) which argues against his being eternal.

According to this view, a simpler idea of God was lost very early in the history of the Church, through accommodation to pagan ideas, and the &quot;incomprehensible&quot; doctrine of the Trinity took its place. As evidence of this process, a comparison is often drawn between the Trinity and notions of a divine triad, found in pagan religions and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism"><span class="csB956BC15">Hinduism</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

(First and second century Christian writings reflect a certain belief that Jesus was one with God the Father, but anti-Trinitarians contend it was at this point that the nature of the oneness evolved from pervasive coexistence to identity.)</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some find a direct link between the doctrine of the Trinity, and the Egyptian theologians of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria" title="Alexandria"><span class="csB956BC15">Alexandria</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, for example. They suggest that Alexandrian theology, with its strong emphasis on the deity of Christ, was an intermediary between the Egyptian religious heritage and Christianity.</span></p><p class="cs673C987F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Church is charged with adopting these pagan tenets, invented by the Egyptians and adapted to Christian thinking by means of Greek philosophy. As evidence of this, critics of the doctrine point to the widely acknowledged synthesis of Christianity with <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" title="Plato"><span class="csB956BC15">platonic</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> philosophy, which is evident in Trinitarian formulas that appeared by the end of the third century. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic"><span class="csB956BC15">Catholic</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> doctrine became firmly rooted in the soil of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenism" title="Hellenism"><span class="csB956BC15">Hellenism</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; and thus an essentially pagan idea was forcibly imposed on the churches beginning with the Constantinian period.

It is given to humans through the Divine union with humanity in Jesus Christ who, although fully God, died for sinners &quot;in the flesh&quot; to accomplish their redemption, and this forgiveness, restoration, and friendship with God is made accessible through the gift to the Church of the Holy Spirit, who, being God, knows the Divine Essence intimately and leads and empowers the Christian to fulfill the will of God. Thus, this doctrine touches on every aspect of the trinitarian Christian&#39;s faith and life; and this explains why it has been so earnestly contended for, throughout Christian history. In fact, while the oldest traditions hold that it is impossible to speculate concerning the being of God (see <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology" title="Apophatic theology"><span class="csB956BC15">apophatic theology</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), yet those same traditions are particularly attentive to Trinitarian formulations, so basic to mere Christian faith is this doctrine considered to be.</span></p><p class="cs35E6C7D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">[<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trinity&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Edit section: Similarities in the 16th-century Jewish Kabbalah"><span class="csB956BC15">edit</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">]</span></p><h2 class="cs673C987F">

Needless to say, not many Jews were so convinced, and Jewish Kabbalists believe that, even though superficial similarities exist between the Christian Trinity and some parts of Kabbalah, these are distinct beliefs and properly understood one does not imply the other.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

For them, the fact that Acts does not use the formula outweighs all other considerations, and is a liturgical guide for their own practice. For this reason, they often focus on the baptisms in Acts, citing many authoritative theological works. For example, Kittel is cited where he is speaking of the phrase &quot;in the name&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek" title="Koine Greek"><span class="csB956BC15">Greek</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: </span><span class="cs78AB3212">&epsilon;ἰ&sigmaf; &tau;ὸ ὄ&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) as used in the baptisms recorded in Acts: </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csEF2FAF9C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The distinctive feature of Christian baptism is that it is administered in Christ (</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&epsilon;ἰ&sigmaf; &Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;ό&nu;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), or in the name of Christ (</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&epsilon;ἰ&sigmaf; &tau;ὸ ὄ&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha; &Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;ῦ</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). (Gerhard Kittel, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1977), 1:539.) </span></p><p class="csEF2FAF9C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The formula (</span><span class="cs78AB3212">&epsilon;ἰ&sigmaf; &tau;ὸ ὄ&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) seems rather to have been a tech. term in Hellenistic commerce (&quot;to the account&quot;). In both cases the use of the phrase is understandable, since the account bears the name of the one who owns it, and in baptism the name of Christ is pronounced, invoked and confessed by the one who baptises or the one baptised (Ac. 22:16) or both. (Kittel, 1:540.) </span></p><p class="cs86BC4DBB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Those who place great emphasis on the baptisms in Acts often likewise question the authenticity of Matthew 28:19 in its present form.
