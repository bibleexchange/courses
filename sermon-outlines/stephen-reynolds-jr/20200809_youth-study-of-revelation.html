<h2>John's Introduction to the Book (1:1-3)</h2>

<p>In John's introduction to this book he introduces the reader to the subject, scribe and value of the book of Revelation.</p>

<blockquote>Revelation 1:19 &mdash; Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</blockquote>

<h3>The Subject of this Book (1:1)</h3>

<h4>It is a Revelation</h4>

<p>The Greek title for this book found in verse 1 is "Apokalupsis" which is transliterated "Apocalypse". When the book of Revelation is talked about and especially when it is called the "Apocalypse" it often gives quiet a chilling impression. Our minds often travel to "The anti-Christ" or "The Mark of the Best" and especially, "The End of the World". These are often made out to be the banner themes of this book, but nothing could be farther from the truth. "Apocalypse" does not mean "judgment day". "Apocalypse". means:</p>

<blockquote>something revealed, disclosed, manifested, or shown. As a verb it means to uncover and as noun it means an appearing.</blockquote>

<h4> It is a Revelation of Jesus Christ</h4>

<p>The Banner Theme of this book is Jesus Christ and His righteous conquest. From the first to the last verse, it is the Lamb, the King, the Bridegroom Who takes center stage. This is not a revelation of John but of JESUS (Savior, Christ, King). This book reveals truth concerning Jesus:</p>

<ol>
	<li>His Exaltation as the Son (Rev. 3:21; Acts 2:33)</li>
> Revelation 3:21--To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
<li> His ministry in the Church (Rev. 1:13)
> Revelation 1:13--And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
<li> His position in the throne (Rev 4:2; Eph. 1:20,21)
> Revelation 4:2--And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
<li> His rapture of the Church (Rev. 4:1)
> Revelation 4:1--After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
<li> His coming in power and glory (Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:30)
> Revelation 1:7--Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
<li> His raising the dead (Rev. 1:18; John 5:27-29)
> Revelation 1:18--I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
<li> His judgment of the nations (Rev. 14:7)
> Revelation 14:7--Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
<li> His reign and rule on the earth (Rev. 11:15)
> Revelation 11:15--And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
<li> His judgment on Satan (Rev. 20:1-2,10)
> Revelation 1:1,2,10--1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

<h4> It is a Gift of God</h4>
<p>Verse 1 says this revelation of Jesus Christ "which God GAVE unto Him" was in turn given by Jesus to His angel who gave it to John. The writer is describing a clear stream of inspiration from the throne of heaven which contests any suggestion that the following writing is of human origin and imagination.</p>

<h4> It is a Prophecy</h4>
<p>"To show unto His servants things which must come to pass shortly." This is a key to this book. v. 3 "The words of this prophecy" Ch. 4:1 "I will show thee things which must (come) be hereafter." Revelation is essentially a book of prophecy rather than history.</p>

<h4>It is Symbolic</h4>

1:1 says "&hellip;he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John." "Signified" is the Greek word "Semaino" meaning to give a sign or to express or reveal by signs. God in his infinite wisdom has chosen to use the language of symbolism and imagery to communicate this Revelation.
How can we unlock the symbolism of this book? Mainly by comparing scripture with scripture (2 Peter 1:20) do we understand its symbolism. This Revelation is profoundly positioned as the last book of the Bible. It not only contains prophecy of last things, but it is in its nature a climax to all Biblical revelation. We in part find understanding of the symbolism in Revelation by understanding previously given symbolism.
Some examples include: 1) The Four Living Creatures Ezekiel 1:5; Revelation 4:6 2) The 7 Churches of Asia were both literal and symbolic. As the New Testament Epistles were relevant to a first century Church so they are still relevant today. 3) Water of Life John 4:14; Revelation 21:6
This Revelation with all its symbolism was given to John by God's "angel". John himself was puzzled as to the role of this "angel" and eventually falls at his feet in 22:8 to worship him. In verse 9, the angel rebuked him saying he was only a "fellow servant" and that John must only "worship God". The Believer must keep in constant remembrance amidst all the majesty of God's Grace that all the glory belongs to God and we are just "His messengers".
## The Scribe of this Book (1:2)
> Revelation 1:1 &hellip;unto His servant John 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

### The Apostle John
### He bare record (1:2; John 1:1-14)
### He gave witness (I John 1:1-3; 20:31)

<h3> The Value of this Book (1:3)</h3>
### It is rewarding
"Blessed" - happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied
#### "He that readeth"
#### "They that hear the words"
#### "And keep those things which are written"
### It is enlightening (22:10)
> Revelation 22:10--Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.


<h2>The Premise of this Book(1:4-9)</h2>

<p>We will search out the source, subject, substance and circumstances of the book of Revelation.</p>

<h3> The Sources of this Revelation (1:4,5)</h3>
### John
He is the writer - the Scribe
### The Father
"Which is, which was, and which is to come."
### The Spirit
"From the seven Spirits which are before His throne;" SEVEN: "Hepta" - signifying to be full - "Pneuma" "Spirit" . Therefore, meaning: a "Seven-fold spirit". God is described here in the fullness of His office and powers.
### The Son
"And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth."
<h3> The Subjects of this Revelation</h3>
### The Churches
"To the Seven Churches in Asia" v. 4 not church but "churches".
### Their location (Asia) - v. 4
### Their need - v. 7
Each church had unique needs and problems so a special message is addressed to each of the seven Churches in Asia (Ephesus - Smyrna - Pergamos - etc.)
<h3> The Substance of this Revelation</h3>
### Grace - v 4 G-R-A-C-E: God's Riches At Christ's Expense
### Peace - v. 4 Peace from God brings peace with God. Peace with God brings peace with man.
### Consolation - v. 7 "Behold He cometh"
### Confirmation - v. 8 He will keep His word with you.
<h3> The Circumstances of this Revelation v.9</h3>
### Common Brotherhood - "your brother"
### Common Suffering - "companion in tribulation"
### Common Royalty - "in the kingdom"
### Common Promise - "patience of Jesus Christ"
### Common Place - "Patmos-a place of exile"
The Isle of Patmos was a place of EXILE with barren rocks that was located in the open sea. It was in this unfriendly place the awesome revelation was written.


<h1>B. Christ and the 7 Golden Candlesticks [1:9-20]</h1>

<blockquote>Revelation 1:9-20 &mdash; I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 14  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. 19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</blockquote>

<h2>THE WITNESS: HOW did John Hear and See</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Their Companion in Tribulation (on isle of Patmos 13sq miles area and 32 miles from the coast of Asia Minor, exiled there under emperor Domitian) It was in this unfriendly place the awesome revelation was written.</li>
	<p>According to Tertullian (in The Prescription of Heretics) John was banished after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome around AD 95.</p>
	<li>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day</li>

	<p>"In the Spirit" Ezekiel 37:1 (valley dry bones);  Re 1:10 (in the spirit on the Lord's day); Re 4:2 (And immediately I was in the spirit); Re 17:3 (carried me away in the spirit);
 Re 21:10 (he carried me away in the spirit )</p>

 <p>Received in the Spirit and to be understood only by the Spirit</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 2:14 &mdash; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</blockquote>

<p>This does not mean the book of Revelation cannot be understood, but that in order to fully understand it we must be in that same condition of communion with the Spirit of God as John.</p>

<blockquote>8 times in Revelation:  Re 13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith ....</blockquote>

<blockquote>Isaiah 50:4-- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, <b>he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned</b>.</blockquote>

</ul>

<h2>WHAT did John Hear and See (Revelation 1:9-20)</h2>

<h3> 1. His Voice</h3>

<ul>
	<li>a great voice</li>
	<li>as of a trumpet</li>
	<li>his voice as the sound of many waters</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clearly a VOICE that John heard but it was LIKE a TRUMPET--urgent, clear, strong, awakening, and startling.</p>

<p>God revealed Himself to Moses, on Mt.Sinai "voice of a trumpet exceeding loud." (Exodus 19:16) The Temple opened its doors in the morning at the sound of the trumpet. The Year of Jubilee came with the sound of the trumpet. Lev. 25:9,10 The Silence of the Age will be broken by the sound of a trumpet.
</p>

<blockquote>I Thessalonians 4:16--The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised.</blockquote>

<h3> 2. His Age</h3>

<ul>
	<li>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last</li>
</ul>

<h3> 3. His Vocation</h3>

<ul>
	<li> I saw seven golden candlesticks; And in the midst of the seven candlesticks (v.20)</li>
	<li> he had in his right hand seven stars: (v.20)</li>
	<li> and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword:</li>
</ul>

<p> His place is found <b>in the midst</b> of his church (PROPHET, PRIEST, KING)</p>


<img src="Youth Revelation Study/lampstand.jpg"/>

<p><b>The candlesticks</b> give light, illumination, and revelation which guide us, warn us and make us aware. The Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a light! (Zechariah 4:2-6; Numbers 8:1-4)</p>

<blockquote>John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
Matthew 5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.

Matthew 4:16-- The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
Luke 1:79-- To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
John 11:9-- Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
2 Corinthians 4:6-- For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</blockquote>

<p><b>"Golden"</b>
<b>GREAT COST</b>. The candlesticks were composed of the costliest metal.

<b>GREAT BEAUTY</b>. The tabernacle use filled with the use of gold. Gold is expressive of Godliness.

Psalm 96:9-- O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>

<p><b>7</b> 7 Churches = Entire Church Age. Completeness</p>

<p>God has His ministers in His hand. He holds, controls, owns and will reward them</p>

<h3> 4. His Divinity - the Christ</h3>

<ul>
<li> one like unto the Son of man</li>
<li> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; </li>
<li> and have the keys of hell and of death.</li>
</ul>

<h3> 5. His Clothing</h3>

<ul>
<li> clothed with a garment down to the foot,</li>
<li> and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. ( a golden belt Ephesisans 6 truth)</li>
</ul>

<p>FULLY CLOTHED</p>

<p>Clothing Signified Status</p>

<h3> 6. His Appearance</h3>

<ul>
<li>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;</li>

<p>His Wisdom and "ELDER"ness. Also a reminder of redemption  (sins red like crimson "white as snow")</p>
<blockquote>Isa 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</blockquote>

<li>his eyes were as a flame of fire;</li>

<blockquote>Re 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. (innermost parts)</blockquote>

<li>his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace;</li>
<li>his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</li>
<li><b>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.</b></li>
</ul>
