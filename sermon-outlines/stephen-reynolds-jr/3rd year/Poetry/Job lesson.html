Reynolds, Jr.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csAEEDF97E">Job 1:1a</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs8C9D0446">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the simplest lessons to learn from the book of Job is the role of humanity and its relation to God. The worldly wise are constantly searching to understand man&#39;s position in this vast universe. They ask questions such as, &quot;Are we evolving into some great super being?&quot; With this kind of mindset, men entertain such philosophies, as &ldquo;You are god you control your own destiny. You can be anything you want to be.&quot; All of this, leaving God out of the equation, is a recipe for vanity and ultimate destruction.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	From Job we can observe what man&#39;s role is not:</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	1. to be God&#39;s equal in the sense that God is accountable to man. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">38:3</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	2. to question God or His ways. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">38:4; 40:2	</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	3. to be happy with the good and curse God when the bad comes. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2:9,10</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	4. to live completely free from hardship and toil. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">3:25,26; 5:7; 14:1</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	5. to live so that a man&#39;s sole trust in his friends, or even his own counsel. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">	12:2; 18:7</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	6. to live free of God&#39;s will and help.(man is frail and in need of God.) </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">4:5</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	7. to demand anything of God. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">6:8</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">40:7</span></p><p class="csD20CCA14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	8. to criticize the hurting. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">42:7</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Considering these in retrospect we also observe man&#39;s genuine role and place is to:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1. submit to God as He is GOD ALMIGHTY, Sovereign, and Lord of ALL. He is the One that holds the reins and tries the hearts of men. Man must give account to God and stand before God in judgment. Every deed and word spoken must be accounted for before God.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2. judge God faithful. God asked Job, &quot;Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?&quot; Job and his friends have debated for the past 37 chapters and the Lord has remained silent. Now, after all the hot air of these men has been spued out, their mouths are stopped with this fourth verse. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Where were YOU when I.... </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is wisdom to leave the final judgment of a matter to the Lord and to trust his decisions.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3. emphasize the goodness of God and the fact that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Romans 8:28) To curse God in trouble to forsake our only source of help! Making God an enemy is the action of fools. The regenerated man must know that his role in the big scheme of things to believe </span><span class="csC382D2BB">to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. (Psalm 27:13)</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">4. acknowledge a result of sin present in the world is suffering. We have an adversary the devil that resists us and attacks us. The wonderful thing for the Believer in this is that the devil is on a &quot;leash&quot; and God our Heavenly Father holds this leash! Life is not a bed of roses and we cannot look at through rose-colored glasses. One that overcomes merely acknowledges the difficulty and then continues on to beat it. He does not wallow and self-pity and defeat and claiming all the world is upside and there is no reason left to live. Man&#39;s Divinely appointed role is to seek out that secret place, that place of hiding, where our lives our hid with Christ in God. (Col.3:3) Paul found this place because he declared in his testimony that he suffered great persecution, shipwreck, and even the buffeting of satan yet he glorified God saying, &quot;I press on.&quot; (Phil. 3:14.)</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">5. acknowledge God alone knows all and he is the keeper and giver of knowledge and wisdom. Man must realize at best he sees only in part; he sees through a glass darkly. (I Cor. 13:12) How foolish it is for a man knowing only a part of the story to set himself as a judge on the whole. Man&#39;s role is not to trust in his own understanding, but to walk in the wisdom God has given him and to remain faithful in keeping the Word of God. All trust outside of a complete dependence upon God is doomed to disappointment because of the frailty of human ability. (Job 8:14)</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">6. learn to obey God and follow his way for His way is best and the path of LIFE. Job had been successful in helping others and prospering, yet the thing he feared came upon him. He had helped others up, but now is he himself fallen and weak. It is absolutely absurd to march on in life attempting to find independence from God! He that thinks he has a sure footing will slip. The strong that have helped the weak will become frail. The young and courageous will become feeble. Man needs God! Running from God is futile for He is everywhere. Hiding from God is pointless for He sees all. Lying to God is foolhardy for He knows all. Doubting God is the worst course of action for there is nothing beyond His power to perform. The role of Humanity is to submit to God and yield to His dealings.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">7. acknowledge his indebtedness to God. Man owes everything he has and does good to the benevolence and grace of God. His role is in acknowledging his need of God to humbly inquire of the Lord and to Believe Him, as He is faithful to keep His Word. He is the Heavenly Father of the Believer and will withhold no good thing from them that ask Him. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (Matt. 7:11) Who is man to demand God? He is nothing.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">8. guard our tongue zealously. To require men to fit our diagnosis of their problems and our prescription is the height of pride. Have we so quickly forgotten the pit from which THE LORD pulled us out? Can He not do the same for those around us? We must be slow to speak the time of another man&#39;s trouble for we will be judged according to the Word of God. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Have you spoken the thing that is RIGHT?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (The Lord&#39;s indictment on Job&#39;s friends. Job 42:7.)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In conclusion, Job&#39;s plight is nothing foreign to the rest of humanity. He faced difficulty as all people do. He was tested in order to prove and strengthen his faith as all Believers are. He was required to answer to and submit to God, as every man is ultimately and definitely accountable to God. Job declared the promises of God in His darkest hour, &quot;For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:&quot; (Job 19:25) as every individual may take this position as well in contrast to self-pity and blasphemy. We can learn so much from this book and this man&#39;s life simply because like 100% of the rest of us, Job was a man.</span></p></body>
