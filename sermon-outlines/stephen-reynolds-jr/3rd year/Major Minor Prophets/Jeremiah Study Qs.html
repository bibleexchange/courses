We are not all set and ready to fly out at any moment, but we are in trouble. We have once known God, but we are fast slipping backward. It is the reality of life that even a family can become over time as strangers to each other. We have loved to Wander and are become as if a people that have never known God.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs75D4EA31">Wander</span><span class="csBCEB377D"> means: </span><span class="cs75D4EA31">to ramble here and there with any certain course or with no definite object in view; to range about; to stroll; to go away, to depart, to stray off, to deviate, to go astray, to be delirious, not to be under the guidance of reason; to travel over with a certain course; to traverse; to stroll through.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs75D4EA31">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs75D4EA31">The Screwtape Letters</span><span class="csBCEB377D">, </span><span class="cs75D4EA31">Five Kinds of Love</span><span class="csBCEB377D">, </span><span class="cs75D4EA31">Mere Christianity</span><span class="csBCEB377D">, and </span><span class="cs75D4EA31">The Chronicles of Narnia </span><span class="csBCEB377D">are a few of the many written works that have been popular in modern Christianity. Their author, a professing Christian, wrote much about God, and even shows much insight and wisdom. His writings and reasoning shouldn&rsquo;t be the test by which we test a man&rsquo;s spiritual experience. Jesus said, &ldquo;For every tree is known by his own fruit.&rdquo; Biographers would describe him in a particular setting with a cigar in one hand and wine in the other. C.S. Lewis also married a divorced woman when he was older. Without further exposition, In my opinion, he typifies this Church age. He claimed to know God, maybe knew a whole lot about God as far as intellect can grasp, but his manner of living depicts him as a stranger to the Holy God of Heaven.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">There is a great price to pay for our loving to wander. Jeremiah 14:2,3,9.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs5AC764FC"><span class="csBCEB377D">Our Gates are Black and Languisheth</span></li><li class="cs5AC764FC"><span class="csBCEB377D">Our Wells are Without Water</span></li><li class="cs5AC764FC"><span class="csBCEB377D">Our Ground is Dry and Hard</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csBCEB377D">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">1. America has puffed herself up with pride in her prosperity, but leaving God out of anything only breeds chaos. Our gates are covered in blackness. Gates and doors speak to us of opportunity, it was the place where the law was read, courts were held, and business transactions were made in the Bible. The gates of America which was once broadly proclaimed as &ldquo;The Land of Opportunity&rdquo; are covered in blackness. We have wondered far from where we began.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">2. Verse three, describes the church as a whole quite thoroughly. It speaks of dryness, dearth, and famine. The children in the verse are sent confidently to gather water. They go to the place that is expected to have water, should have water, and was constructed with the express purpose of being a place where people could draw water, but the children return with empty vessels, ashamed, and disappointed. In verse nineteen, they look for peace and find there is no good, and look for a time of healing and find only trouble. The Church was designed by God to be a house of peace, a hospital, and a place where living waters flow, but the masses come bearing their vessels every day looking for water and return with empty vessels. We have wandered.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">3. God is a stranger to even the people who claim Him as their God. It is observed on a farm that after a prolonged period of dryness the ground becomes hard and won&rsquo;t receive the rain. The very thing that it needs most, is a harm to it washing away the topsoil so that the land cannot bear fruit. We have wandered so far from the touch of God that we can continue on with church business without it. A genuine moving of the Holy Spirit would disrupt things. If the Word was preached in power and soundness, the church overall in our day wouldn&rsquo;t receive it as life giving water, but it would bring judgment upon it. They have itching ears and heap up teachers that say what they want to hear. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">This horrible condition Israel was in is why God tells not to pray for them. God is weary of there repenting or &ldquo;sorryness&rdquo; (15:6). It doesn&rsquo;t get into there heart. They wander out and cry for mercy, and then do it again. The Word of Lord will destroy such hearts because of the hardness that has developed in their love to wander. For their to be any hope for them, the fallow ground must be broken up. It isn&rsquo;t that the church is just waiting for God to move, but He stands calling for us to return (15:19). We are in such a case that even if Moses and Samuel stood before God pleading our cause, that He would not divert judgment. Our love to wander has brought us here.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csBCEB377D">You don&rsquo;t know a stranger&rsquo;s name. A name speaks to us of authority, power, and character. We are have become a people that say with our lips that He is Mighty, but we treat Him as a mighty man that cannot save. We proclaim He is our Deliverer and wallow daily in our sin. We have astonished Him. He has provided for every Believer to know the fullness of God, and yet we say that is not enough. What more could God do? What great depths of love could he show? With our continual wandering, we have responded to God like young children often do. It probably has happened to all of us. We spend money or time on a gift for a child and wait anxiously to see them smile when we give to them, and they respond, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; We stand there dumbfounded and astonished. That is what the Church has done to God. The Wayfarer (v.8) has no permanent dwelling. He stays only one night at a time. The Church cannot endure a sustained move of God because it is foreign to them. Their wandering has made Him a stranger to them, and they a stranger to Him.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs75D4EA31">&ldquo;Why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the Land?</span><span class="csBCEB377D"> </span><span class="cs75D4EA31">Leave us not,&rdquo; </span><span class="csBCEB377D">Jeremiah prayed to God interceding for his people. </span><span class="cs75D4EA31"> </span><span class="csBCEB377D">The problem is that God was not the one that had moved. Because of Israel&rsquo;s wandering from God, God appeared as one that is distant and a stranger. In truth, The Hebrews were the ones that had become strangers. Because they loved to wander they became strangers to God, and God in His Holiness cannot be known to the wanderer. Let us stop our wandering and return. The Lord is a Stranger to Wanderers, but He is the closest friend to the Faithful.</span></p></body>
