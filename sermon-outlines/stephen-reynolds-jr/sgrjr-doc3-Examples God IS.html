At it center was &nbsp;a large golden ball representing the sun, and revolving around it were smaller spheres attached at the ends fo rods of varying lengths. They represented Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and the other planets. These were all geared together by cogs and belts to make them move around the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; in perfect harmony.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One day as Newton was studying the model, a friend who did not believe the Biblical account of creation stopped by for a visit. Marveling at the device and watching as the scientist made the heavenly bodies move in their orbits, the man exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, Newton, what an exquisite thing! Who made it for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Without looking up, Sir Isaac said, &ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Nobody?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; replied Newton. &ldquo;I said nobody. All of these balls and cogs and belts and gears just happened to come together, and wonder of wonders, by chance they began revolving in their set orbits and with perfect timing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(from </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Our Daily Bread)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">God is in control of history.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
