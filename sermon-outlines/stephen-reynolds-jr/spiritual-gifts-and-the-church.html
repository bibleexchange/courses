<blockquote>But whatever the form of the task, the Church always needs spiritual power to perform it; a power not in itself, but which the King must supply. &hellip; Every means afforded by the King for the doing of His work is a charisma, a gift of grace. Hence the internal connection between work, office, and gift. -- Abraham Kuyper, <u><a href="#b1">The Work of the Holy Spirit</a></u></blockquote>

<h2>To Profit Withal (purpose)</h2>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 12:7 &mdash; But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</blockquote>

<p>for the general good</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 14:12 &mdash; Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel <b>to the edifying</b> of the church.</blockquote>

<p>"increase thy church"</p>

<blockquote>Matthew 6:10 &mdash; <b>Thy kingdom come</b>. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ephesians 4:15,16 &mdash; 15 But speaking the truth in love, may <b>grow up</b> into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, <b>maketh increase</b> of the body unto the <b>edifying</b> of itself in love.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Colossians 2:19 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with <b>the increase of God</b>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1 Thessalonians 3:12</blockquote>

<blockquote>1 Thessalonians 4:10</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<b>It is wrong</b>, therefore, to consider the life of individual believers too much by itself, separating it from the life of the Church. ... They exist not but in connection with the body, and thus they become partakers of the spiritual gifts." Abraham Kuyper, <u><a href="#b1">The Work of the Holy Spirit</a></u></blockquote>

<p>How can it profit others if a gift is hidden? The hidden gift must be stirred up as it is the Lord's and it is His intention FOR THE CHURCH!</p>

<h2>The Manifestation of the Spirit</h2>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 12:7 &mdash; But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</blockquote>

<h2>The Connectedness of Believers</h2>

<blockquote>Romans 12:15 &mdash; Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Galatians 6:1 &mdash; Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ephesians 4:4 &mdash; There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling;</blockquote>

<p>The Biblical Body EXCLUDES ISOLATION and creates a longing for fellowship.</p>

<h2>The Ability of the Church</h2>

<blockquote>1 John 2:20 &mdash; 20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1 John 2:27 &mdash; But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</blockquote>

<p>Does not mean to say that every individual believer possesses the full anointing, and in virtue of this knoweth all things. For if this were so, who would not despair of salvation, nor dare say: "I have, the faith"? Moreover, how could the statement, "Ye need not that any man teach you," be reconciled with the testimony of the same apostle, that the Holy Spirit qualifies teachers appointed by Jesus Himself? <b>Not the individual believer, but the whole Church as a body</b> possesses the full anointing of the Holy One and knows all things. The Church as a body needs not that any come to teach it <b>from without</b>; for it, possesses all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, <b>being united with the Head</b>, who is the reflection of the glory of God, in whom dwelleth all wisdom.</p>

<h2>The Nature of Spiritual Gifts</h2>

<p>OFFICIAL, EXTRAORDINARY, ORDINARY</p>

<p>ordinary service of the Church by its ministers, elders, and deacons.</p>

<p>ministries, gifts, workings</p>
<p>wisdom, knowledge, discernment of spirits, tongues and their interpretation.</p>

<p>:( Abraham Kuyper !!!! The charismata now existing in the Church are those pertaining to the ministry of the Word; the ordinary charismata of increased exercise of faith and love; those of wisdom, knowledge, and discernment of spirits; that of self-restraint; and lastly, that of healing the sick suffering from nervous and psychological diseases. <b>The others for the present are inactive</b> !!! :(. !!</p>

<h2>Speaking in Tongues</h2>

<p>The 3rd Sign of the Outpouring of the Holy Ghost</p>

<blockquote>Acts 2:1-4 &mdash; And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
2 And suddenly there came a (1) sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of (2) fire, and it sat upon each of them.
4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other (3) tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</blockquote>

<p>At Pentecost, they spoke a language above the influence of sin. At Jerusalem, only they understood it who were specially wrought upon by the Holy Spirit. The others understood it not. (Some heard in their native tongue and others mocked what they heard as the babblings of drunkards.</p>

<blockquote>Mark 16:17 &mdash; 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</blockquote>

<p>Speech in man is the result of his thinking; the languages were created in a judgment of division. Bringing all to one language is a restoration of a lost unity in Humanity. </p>
