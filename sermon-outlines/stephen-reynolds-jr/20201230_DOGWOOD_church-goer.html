		<ul>
			<li>Its where we bring of our "first fruits" to God. Exodus 23:19</li>
			<li>But we don't tithe "ill gotten gains" to God for they are an ABOMINATION. Deut. 23:18</li>

			<li>FAMILY TRADITIONS, UNITY, FOUNDATION of a Good home will include regular church attendance 1 Samuel 1:7 "as he did year by year"</li>
			<li>Young Samuel was "RAISED in CHURCH" (temple) 1 Samuel 1:24</li>
			<li> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, 1 Samuel 12:20, a SPECIAL PLACE, CONSECRATED PLACE, SANTIFIED PLACE (solomon dedicated the house of the LORD)</li>
			<li>The Presence of God filling the House 1Ki 8:10 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</li>

		  	<ul><li> stigma -civil disobedience now -no curiousity,know it all already (the available of so much information from the convenience of a phone in our hand fools us into the thinking sometimes that hearing about something is somehow equal to EXPERIENCING SOMETHING - fear What are you afraid of? - not a safeplace anymore "sanctuary" (R.Catholic.)</li></ul>

		  	<input type="checkbox" id="q1" />
		  	<ul>
		  		<li>Can't I know God in a solitary way? Part of the answer is in our text: </li>
		  		<li><blockquote>Hebrews 10:19 &mdash; Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,  20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 21 And having an high priest over the house of God; 22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: 25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</blockquote>

				<li>"BOLDNESS TO ENTER"</li>
				<li>LET US DRAW NEAR</li>
				<li>HOLD FAST WITHOUT WAVERING</li>
				<li>LET US CONSIDER ONE ANOTHER --> TO PROVOKE to love and good works</li>
				<li>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves -- its a testimony, its a practice that works!</li>
