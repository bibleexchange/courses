# Character Development

A sermon outline of Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

TEXT: Romans 12:1,2

> Romans 12:1,2&mdash;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

- &quot;be not conformed to this world&quot;

to fashion one thing like another. to think, to act, to be like the world

- &quot;but be ye transformed&quot;

Undergo a complete change

## I. Character Development Requires Commitment

### A. God is after Character and not Comfort

Christ did not die on the cross so we could live comfortably in this world. Christ&pos;s ultimate purpose is to be make us like Himself.

Christ is fitting us for Heaven and not here!

### B. Character is Developed Through Difficulty

It takes heat to mold metal.

The trying of your faith is more precious than of gold &hellip; though it be tried with fire&hellip;

> 1 Peter 4:12&mdash;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

<!-- -->

> 2 Corinthians 4:17&mdash;For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

I heard a woman described an incident that got mud on her shoes as if it was the trial of her life. That is not even a &quot;light affliction&quot; but that experience certainly cannot be compared with the glory of God!

### C. Life is Suppose to be Difficult

- The difficulty of life is what makes you.
- Most people expect to have heaven on earth. If you believe this you will become disillusioned or live in denial of reality

## II. Character Development has Responsibilities

> Ephesians 4:22&ndash;24&mdash; That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;  23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

### A. &quot;Put off the Old Man&quot;

Put off the old man which is corrupt. The old life is rotten and deceitful. The command to &quot;put it off&quot; implies there is a choice.

### B. &quot;Be Renewed in the Spirit of Your Minds&quot;

#### 1. Change Starts in the Mind

> Proverbs 23:7&mdash; For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

We are to think like Christ. To change your life, you must also change the way you think.

#### 2. Thoughts Produce Actions, Actions Produce Deeds, Deeds Produce Habits, Habits Produce Character.

### C. &quot;Put on the New Man&quot;

Effort has nothing to do with birth.
Effort has much to do with spiritual growth.

**Make every effort**:

> Luke 13:24&mdash; &hellip;strive to enter&hellip;
<!-- -->
> Romans 14:19&mdash; &hellip;let us follow after&hellip; [pursue, press]
<!-- -->
> Ephesians 4:3&mdash; &hellip;endeavoring&hellip; [to make effort]
<!-- -->
> 2 Timothy 2:15&mdash; &hellip;study&hellip; [spoudazo: to make effort, labor]
<!-- -->
> Hebrews 4:11 and 12:14&mdash; &hellip;let us labor to enter in&hellip;
> 2 Peter 1:5&mdash; &hellip;giving all dilligence&hellip; [add to, employ every effort]
<!-- -->
> 2 Peter 3:14&mdash; &hellip;be dilligent&hellip; [spoudazo]

## III. Character Development is a Process

&quot;renewing the mind&quot;

### A. We Grow in Grace

Christians grow old, but they need to grow up.

### B. Christ-likeness is not produced by imitation but by inhabitation

&quot;transformed&quot; &ndash; &quot;metamorphoo&quot; transfigured

God takes a caterpillar to a butterfuly
- changed on the inside
- we become like Himself
- we are made free to soar to new heights

Character development is progressive

- it is not instant nor automatic
- it is progressive development

God is more interested in who you are than in what you do. Character is more important than career.

A man is known by the company he keeps. (Psalm 119:63)
We choose to do right, God will help us.
We must cooperate with the holy Spirit.

- The Red Sea Opened &mdash; Moses Holding up the Rod
- The Jordan River Parted &mdash; Stepped in the waters
- The Walls of Jericho came down &mdash; as they marched in obedience
