<h1 align="center" class="style14" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">A New 
Cruse<o:p></o:p></h1>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal">Preached By Rev. James Reynolds Sr. at the 
Deliverance Center on March 25, 2007</p>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<h2 class="style15">OPENING THOUGHTS</h2>
<p class="style16">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style11">I am reminded of a time when they asked the elder Bro. Powers 
to testify.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was after probably 
eight or nine other preachers had been asked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Each preacher went on and said, “I just, I just can’t, I just can’t sit 
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I got to preach a little.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I just can’t sit down.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each 
one was saying the same thing for seemingly a half-hour or more—just carrying 
on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“I can’t sit down, I got to 
preach a little.” Bro. Powers then got up and he said, “Well brethren, you asked 
me to testify and I’m going to tell you how to testify.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I’m gonna go sit down.” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Sometimes a short sermon like that is more effective than a long one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know I have a reputation for being long, but I never spend a lot of 
time just to spend a lot of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I 
feel like God has given me something, and I need to deliver that to you in such 
a manner that you can grasp it because if you don’t understand what I am saying 
then it won’t do you any good.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, 
we try to lay it before you so you can understand it, grasp it, and apply it to 
your own life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This morning, I want 
to share some things with you that I believe God has been sharing with me, and I 
believe it will be a help to you—not only for today, but for the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
How many know that we need to have a move of God?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am talking about a genuine move of God, and not the kind we just 
advertise on a flyer saying we are going to have revival. I am talking about a 
revival when the Holy Ghost comes down and changes and gives direction to lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We need that kind of revival.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<h2 class="style15">OUR TEXT</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">II 
Kings, 2<sup>:</sup>19-22:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the 
situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is nought, 
and the ground barren. <sup>20</sup> And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put 
salt therein. And they brought it to him. <sup>21</sup> And he went forth unto 
the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the 
LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death 
or barren land. <sup>22</sup> So the waters were healed unto this day, according 
to the saying of Elisha which he spake.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The prophet’s response to those that were declaring to him the problem was, 
“Bring me a new cruse.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">The Condition of Jericho<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I 
want you to look with me at the condition that is behind this lesson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The city of Jericho is revealed here in three aspects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>You need to understand that <b>there was a condition that existed that 
needed God’s help</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><b>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">PLEASANT.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="style11">The men of the city came to Elisha and said unto him, “Behold 
I pray thee the situation of the city is pleasant.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One aspect of the city was that it was pleasant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Looking up the word in the Hebrew gives the idea that there is something 
very wonderful about this situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
Now, as far as the outward appearance of the city, it was good, pleasant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Hebrew word brings out the idea that it was favorable, privileged, 
and prosperous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p align="center" class="style12"><b>BAD WATER &amp; BARREN LAND<o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Jericho is a privileged, prosperous, and pleasant city, but the water is bad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Notice that the Scripture says the water is<i> nought</i>. <i>Nought</i> 
is the translation of the Hebrew word <i>rah</i>, which means <i>bad </i>or <i>
evil</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The water is contaminated. 
Because there is an element of poison mixed with the water, it is producing a 
barren condition in the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Verse 
19 says, “the ground barren.” <b>The ground could not produce</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The land was not producing, and the reason why the land was not producing 
was because the water was bad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<h3 class="style17" style="left: -357px; top: 14pt; width: 918px">The Condition 
of the Church</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">To 
me, this is a revelation of a spiritual principle that is in the Church today. 
First you look at the outward appearance of the church, the church is in a 
favorable condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How many know 
the church is doing well as far as the outward appearance?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They say there has never been a time when more people are going to church 
than today.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Outwardly, the 
appearance is pleasant, favorable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Jesus used the words in Revelation, He said, “Your rich, increased with goods, 
and have need of nothing.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He’s 
talking about the latter day church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
A church that has wrenched the reigns out of the hands of the Lord and is now in 
control of itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And He said, 
“Your rich, increased with goods, have need of nothing.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Could we agree with what Jesus was saying, that the church has become 
very prosperous as far as the outward appearance is concerned?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the water is contaminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Listen to what He says as He goes on there in Revelation, “...and knowest not 
that thou art wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not producing spiritually. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A 
church that He called has drifted so far away, they have become spiritually 
barren.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Number wise, they are doing 
well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Financially the do well, but 
spiritually there is a problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The water is contaminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What does 
that speak of?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Bible speaks 
about the Word as water.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Water of 
the Word produces life, but the Word here, in the hour that we face has become 
polluted, mixed with all kinds of heresies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A mixture in the teaching that is controlling the lives of many, and its 
producing barrenness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The apostle Paul said in Romans 16 verses 17 and 18 “...mark them...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You hear people say, “You should be careful.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here is Paul saying, “...mark them which cause divisions and offences 
contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. <sup>18</sup><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ... and by good 
words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The word ‘simple’ doesn’t mean that they are simpletons, but they are 
unlearned, (they) don’t have the knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And people are being swayed by the words of men that have become orators 
and not simply preachers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
They can spin all kinds of things and make people...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I remember when I was in school myself, a Nazarene brother came to the 
church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And we had an orator for a 
preacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He used to tell the folks, 
he says, “You know I can preach.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He 
knew he could.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And he had a lot of 
psychology.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Nazarene brother 
said to some of the students as they came out of church, he said, “I don’t 
understand.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said, “That man gets 
me to clap my hands when I don’t feel like it; (he) gets me shout when I don’t 
feel like it.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And he says, “When 
I’m in there, I feel these things but (when) I come out, I’m empty.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That’s what the water without the truth, does to people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It leaves them empty and barren.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>You need the truth!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Word 
of truth is what will put life into your spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Can anyone say amen?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again, Paul says in II Timothy 3: 4 and 5 he says, “Lovers of 
pleasure...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the saddest thing 
is, its not just the world that is involved with pleasures, even to the degree 
that all of these sports events are being promoted by the church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now I’m not against these things to such a degree that...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I don’t think that they ought to be promoted in the church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now you listen to what he says, “Having a form...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are the same ones that he said love the world and pleasures more 
than loving God, and having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And he said, “Don’t join up with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Get away from them.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The word ‘denying’ comes from a Greek word, to forsake, renounce, refuse to 
accept, reject.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And what is he 
saying?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because they love pleasure 
more than loving God, they reject what God has for them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Refusing, renouncing...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And 
isn’t it true that we hear of a lot of voices today say, “Oh, you don’t have to 
do that, you don’t have to do this, you don’t have to do the other.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Listen, if you’re a Christian and you’ve been born of God, there is an 
obligation upon you to live like Him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We name Him as our Savior, then let us walk like Him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>How many know that’s the Word of God?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Peter said this, II Peter the 2<sup>nd</sup> chapter verses 1 and 2, “...There 
shall be false teachers...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now 
they’ve warned us...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why is it that 
as many warnings that we have had through the Scripture, that we can’t seem to 
see where we are at?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jesus 
warned us, the apostles warned us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
And here Peter is saying, “There shall be...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He didn’t say, “There might be...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said there is going to be “...false teachers among you, who privily 
shall bring in damnable heresies, ...and bring upon themselves swift 
destruction. <sup>2</sup><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And 
many... and many shall follow...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
See this is the problem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is why 
the church has become barren, because many have followed “...their 
pernicious...” their evil ways, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And many... many...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dear God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">By 
reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil... Isn’t it true?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Boy, they can say all kinds of things about us, they can call us a cult, 
they call me a cult leader.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I’ve 
even got letters where they said, “You are the antichrist.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I don’t know if an antichrist that is going to follow the Word of God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But you see, they speak very freely against the truth because they don’t 
love the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And they’re in a 
very dangerous position because God said because the people did not love the 
truth, God will send them strong delusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>How many know we are living in a time when a lot of people have come 
under that spirit of strong delusion and they are going to hold to that?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They believe this is alright, all you got to do is go to church once in a 
while and be at least a good upright person in society...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It takes more than that, you must be born of God, and live it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Jude, the fourth verse, one little chapter, said “There are certain men crept in 
unawares, ungodly men...” Turning, they’ve come into the midst of the church and 
are turning the grace of God into lasciviousness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That is, it’s a license.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They 
can do as they want to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Rather than speak concerning their name at this time I’ll refrain from that, but 
there is one church they say is growing in leaps and bounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The minister said himself, “I don’t preach against sin, I just preach 
about grace and faith.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Grace and 
faith without principle will cause the church to become barren; spiritually I’m 
speaking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, the water has become 
polluted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You have to agree with me 
at least to some degree that the water of the Word of God has become polluted 
because men have mixed their doctrines and their ideas into the Scripture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now there is nothing wrong with the pure Word of God, but when you mix 
it, it produces death and barrenness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">So 
the church has become barren and unfruitful, spiritually.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, the appearance is pleasant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And they can...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And I’ve 
heard some of them say, “Boy we have come across the tracks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We are living on the other side of the tracks, and God is blessing us and 
prospering us.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One woman claims 
that she just bought a ten million dollar airplane to fly around.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Can you imagine Jesus, who wore sandals, and went around from town to 
town bringing the gospel without a place to lay His head...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Could you agree with me at least to some degree that the church is become 
spiritually barren?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m talking 
about spiritually.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Numbers, 
finances...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Now what is the cure?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Look at what 
he says there in verse 20, and he said, the man of God said, “Bring me a new 
cruse.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the condition that we 
face right now, we need a revival of spiritual truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There needs to be a reviving of spiritual truth, not men’s ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There needs to be a spiritual application of the life of Jesus being made 
manifest in the life of the believer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I see a lot of people that they...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Its like a drudgery, its almost a hardship to serve Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If you have Christ in you, and His life is flowing in you, it will not be 
a hardship, it will be a joy, it will be a thrill, it will be exciting to live 
for Him!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not just on Sunday, but on 
Monday, and Tuesday, and Wednesday, through the week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thank God there is something more than a religious experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Not only do we need spiritual life, spiritual power, but we need spiritual 
purity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The man of God says, “Bring 
me a new, a new cruse, a new cruse.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
Again the word comes from a Hebrew word that means to be fresh, new, not 
chipped, not cracked, not broken, a new cruse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>God is looking for vessels today that He can use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The man of God is standing in the position of God and he is saying, 
“Bring me a new cruse.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>God is 
saying, “I need a vessel, I need a vessel, bring Me a vessel that I can use.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A vessel prepared by God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Did 
you hear what I said?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A vessel 
prepared by God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>See there is types.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A new cruse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Do 
you know when a pot, a piece of pottery is made, it is made by the potter, 
molded and fashioned in the hands of the potter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And he is saying, “Bring me a new cruse, bring me a new pot, bring me a 
new vessel.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, not only is it 
prepared by God, but the potter always puts the clay, after it is formed, into 
the oven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It takes fire...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The vessel that God will use is going to have to go through the trials, 
go through the fire and not be cracked, chipped or broken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Are you listening?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh yeah, 
there is a price.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Why does He put the believers through the fire?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same reason the potter puts the clay through the fire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To make it strong, to make it durable, to make it hard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It won’t crack, it won’t fall apart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now we know the story, in the hands of the potter... the pot or the 
vessel became marred in the hands of the potter and the potter always did one of 
two things.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually three things, 
he would throw it back if it was the clay was not hard, he would throw it back 
into the mud and make it another vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But if it had gone too far, its beginning to get hard, he would set it up 
on shelf there to remain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would 
never be of value to anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then 
there was the third thing, if it was just falling all apart, he would throw it 
through the window out into the potter’s field and it was shattered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Dear God, don’t ever let the Lord get to the place where He throws you through 
the window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You say, “Well I can’t 
stand the heat!”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If you want to be a 
vessel that God can use, you are going to have to stand the heat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Now the vessel must also, not only be made by God, but it must be available to 
God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said, “Bring me, bring me a 
new cruse.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A vessel that has paid 
the price, gone through the fire...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
A vessel that now becomes an instrument in the hands of God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A new cruse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A vessel 
conformed to the image of Christ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
How many know that God wants to make you like Christ?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And we must understand...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
This is what God is after, a new cruse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One that looks like the original.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A 
vessel that God can pour Himself into and through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>See the whole thing is, this is what God did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn’t the vessel, it wasn’t the cruse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was what God did, and this is what the world needs, this is what the 
church needs, this is what this generation needs is a move of God in the life of 
the believers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of you 
understand what I am saying, and some of you are enduring it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I want you to understand that God is looking for a vessel, a new 
cruse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">We 
don’t need new dynamics, power teams, showmanship, and all of that kind of 
stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That’s taking the place of 
the gospel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They say, “Well we use 
this...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They produce after their 
kind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That’s the principle that’s in 
the Word of God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If you get people 
to accept what you are teaching and preaching, they’ll be hooked on that and 
they’ll be just like you taught.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But 
if we teach them the truth, the truth will transform their life’s and make them 
like Christ, a vessel that God can use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>God is looking for vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A 
vessel that is the image of Himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Now, when he says, “Bring me a new cruse...” he said, “...Put salt therein, 
salt...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there was ever a time 
when we needed salt...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where are the 
salt of this age?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We need the salt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Salt, according to what I see in the dictionary is seasoning, preserving, 
and healing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of you probably 
didn’t even understand that salt is good for healing sores.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">My 
grandfather used to cut wood for us, he lived with us quite some time, and he 
had a very sharp axe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And one day he 
was chopping, and evidently holding the block of wood and he gashed his thumb 
way down deep and he would take salt and pour it on to that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ooooouuuuuwwweeeeeee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yeah, 
it might have a healing element but it smarts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And my daddy used to say, “No smart, no cure.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But that thing healed because he kept putting salt...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I mean he’d just pour that salt in there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The prophet is saying, “Put salt in the vessel.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Salt is a type of the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
Jesus said in Matthew 5 and 13, “Ye are the salt...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Talking to the believer, talking to those that were real.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“Ye are the salt of the earth...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the salt is in you... not something that you carry under your arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said, “Put salt in it.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We 
need to have the truth in us, not just carrying it around.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We need to have that salt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
This is what the world needs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
is what the church needs because its become barren.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It needs the salt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“Bring me 
a new cruse, and put salt therein.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The results.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Look at verse 21, “And 
he went forth unto the spring...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He 
didn’t just take salt and through it into the water, he went to the fountain 
head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We need to get back to the 
fountain head where we missed God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
How many know that we have lived in a time where we have drifted so far away 
from God we don’t even know where we began?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This might shock you, but my mother told me one time, way back (in) my 
early experience with the Lord, she said, “You know James, the church wouldn’t 
even allow people to clean the church unless they were filled with the Holy 
Ghost.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only saved, but filled 
with the Holy Ghost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I think that’s 
missing today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
You know, the old timers, they say, you go into the church sometime and see them 
cleaning and then they’d go by the chairs and they would be praying for the 
chairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Listen, you get a Holy Ghost 
man praying for the chairs and praying for the people that set in those chairs, 
you’re going to have revival.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There 
is something missing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Right?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bring me a cruse with salt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Went forth to the spring of the waters and cast the salt in there, and said, 
Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So the waters were healed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He 
didn’t say the waters might be healed, he said, “So the waters were healed.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>God is still looking for vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A new vessel with salt in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The salt being poured into the waters made it pure, made it alive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Notice what he said there in the latter part of that verse, no more death 
or barren land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No more death...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pour the salt in and there won’t be any more death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is a lot of death today.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One church he said, “You say you have a name that you live and aren’t 
dead...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dear God, I trust that we 
have something more than just a name, that we live.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I want to be recognized, not by men...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was thinking as I picked up the newspaper yesterday, there was a couple 
women I think came up from Boston, claim they are preachers and are going around 
town... And like that its such a wonderful thing that they are doing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We’ve have been doing this for thirty-nine, forty years going through 
this city trying to teach people that Jesus Christ is the only way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Trying to rescue the perishing, care for the dying...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They don’t come our way and put us in the newspaper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
What is it the world needs?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Somebody 
to just sit along side them and say, “You know things can be different.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There has to be a difference in the heart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The waters were healed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not 
only was the waters healed, but there was fruitfulness, no barrenness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The church has lost its saltiness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>How many know most places that you go, and I’ve heard it...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I’ve been in some of them and there is not an ounce of conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Boy it used to be when the preachers would preach, sometimes you’d see 
somebody slip out of their seat and head for the altar long before the altar 
call was given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because the Holy Ghost was getting a hold of somebody’s heart and 
bringing them to the cross.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No more 
death, no more barrenness, life!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
Listen to what Jesus said continuing on in that statement, “If the salt has lost 
its savour, it is thenceforth good for nothing but be cast out and be trodden 
under foot of men.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What did Jesus 
say in Revelation to the church of Laodicea? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“If 
you don’t repent, I am going to spue you out of My mouth.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is talking about the condition that exists in the church today.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>You say that you are rich, increased with goods, and have need of 
nothing, but I say unto you that you are wretched, you’re poor, you’re blind, 
you’re naked, and you have need of Me, and He counsels them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
What am I saying to you this morning?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am saying God is looking for some honest, true, dedicated, committed 
new cruses, new vessels that are willing to serve God unreservedly, with truth, 
with salt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Salt that might bite a 
little, but in biting it brings healing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There will no longer be death nor barrenness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I 
am asking you this morning, are you willing to be a vessel God can use?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Are you willing to pay the price?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Are you willing for God to put you through the fire, to form, mold (and) 
make you hard and strong to stand against the opposition?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Are you willing?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I am asking 
you, Are you willing to stand alone?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I 
won’t tell you who it was, but one of the local pastors said to me, I was at a 
convention and he came up to me and he said, “Bro. Reynolds, I believe it just 
like you preach it, but if you preach that, you’ll walk alone.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What was he saying?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“I am not 
willing to walk alone.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But I can 
say to you this morning, I may stagger along the way but I am willing, I’m 
willing...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So I am putting it on 
you, are you willing to be that vessel that God is calling for?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A new cruse that’s got salt in it, that can bring healing to the 
pollution of this hour, of this day?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
We must admit that there is something wrong somewhere...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The doctrines have become polluted by heresy, false doctrines...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What is going to stem that?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
What is going to turn that around?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
What is going to bring revival?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s 
not just that we pray that God will do something.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>God is looking for a vessel that He can take and use in this day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That He can pour Himself into and through and touch the lives of men that 
are now bound in their sin, even though they confess Christ they need to have 
the life of Jesus flowing in them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
And I am asking you, Are you willing to be a vessel that God can use?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That God can pour Himself into and through, and change the complexion of 
the church today?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dear God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
The gospel has become polluted, has made the land barren.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In closing, how many is willing to say, “God, I am willing to be made a 
new cruse, and I am willing for You to put me through the fire, and I am willing 
to yield myself totally to You, where You can put truth into me that I can be a 
means of turning this thing around and seeing the name of God...”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We need revival folks, we need a real revival.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We need a moving of the Holy Ghost that’ll get a hold of people’s 
hearts...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m not talking just about 
sinners, I’m talking about the church, I’m talking about loose living people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We need to see them changed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
There’s barrenness, there’s pollution, there’s mixture, but there’s a gospel 
that we have here that can change the lives of people and turn them around and 
make them fruitful for God.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The land

</span>If the altar’s not big enough kneel behind somebody, kneel in these front 
seats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let’s make a commitment
