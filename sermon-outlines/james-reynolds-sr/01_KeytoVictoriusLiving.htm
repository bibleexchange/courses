				<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

				<span style="color:#333333">(1)</span> Be not drunk with wine,

				</span>To awake spiritually takes something more than just your 
				effort. I have watched people struggle. I have even had them say 
				to me, “Brother Reynolds, I&#39;m so tired. I&#39;ve tried, but I&#39;m not 
				making it.” But, the key is in in the last phrase of verse 
				eighteen. <b><i>“But, be filled with the Spirit.”</i></b><i> </i>
				I cannot awaken myself. I didn&#39;t awaken myself. I was going my 
				own way; doing my own thing when something very supernatural 
				happened. There came an awakening, first, of my need, and then 
				of the fact that He had a provision for my need. I could not 
				resurrect myself. I was dead in trespasses and sins. You were 
				too. It took the Spirit of God to put life into you. Amen? I can 
				remember way back when I first started serving the Lord. I tried 
				so desperately hard to understand the Word of God. I wanted to 
				understand, but it was a slow process. I began to realize that 
				if I&#39;m going to understand this then I am going to need His 
				help. It takes the Spirit of God to awaken us, to give us 
				resurrected life, and to give us light, truth and understanding. <o:p></o:p>

				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Paul is 
				drawing a contrast between the Spirit and the flesh. There was 
				and is and always will be a warfare between the Spirit and the 
				flesh. The flesh is always trying to bring you down and the 
				Spirit is all the time trying to lift you up. <o:p></o:p></span>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Paul uses 
				the term here: <b>“Be not drunk with wine…” </b>and, also, he 
				says <b>“…wherein is excess…”</b> I have heard preachers over 
				the years using this Scripture or this phrase in this Scripture 
				to say it&#39;s all right to drink a little as long as you don&#39;t go 
				to an excess. That is not what Paul was saying at all. The word 
				excess comes from the word <i>asotia</i>. Actually, it is two 
				words in one—&quot;<i>a</i>&quot; which is a negative and <i>sotia</i> or
				<i>sozo</i>&gt; salvation, being saved; therefore, <i>asotia</i> 
				means “no salvation.” “<b>Be not drunk with wine wherein</b> &lt;is 
				no salvation&gt;.” This verse has a whole lot more meaning than 
				just saying we should not drink wine excessively. <o:p></o:p>

				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

				is “<i>unsavedness</i>” that is “<i>totally lost</i>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In Titus, 
				the first chapter and the sixth verse, it is translated “riot”.
				<b><i>“They riot.” </i></b>It is the same identical word. Also, 
				in I Peter 4 and 4, again, Peter uses the same word and he uses 
				the term as the translators uses it here, <b><i>“riot”.</i></b> 
				Now, there&#39;s an adverb that comes from this noun <i>asotia</i> 
				that is used over in Luke fifteen and thirteen. It speaks about 
				the Prodigal Son. He wasted his substance with riotous living. 
				He wasted his substance in drunkenness. His elder brother said 
				later on not only in drunkenness but with harlots. <o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">What Paul is 
				doing here is balancing that which they had been doing with that 
				which they should be doing. He is not making room to drink 
				socially. It&#39;s the social drink that has destroyed many lives. 
				It takes the first one to get you to take the second one. Which 
				is like what Jesus said, “<i>If you drink of this water, you 
				will thirst again</i>”, and ”<i>you will thirst again</i>.” 
				There is no satisfaction. There is no consummation to it. Those 
				that drink wine will always be looking for more. “<i>But</i>”, 
				Jesus said, “… <i>if you drink of the water that I give you it 
				shall be in you a well springing up</i>…” “…<i>Springing up</i>…” 
				Thank God! You don&#39;t need the other! Can you say Amen? <b><i>“Be 
				not drunk with wine wherein is excess;”</i></b> What is Paul 
				saying? If you feed the flesh it has an awaited and ultimate 
				destruction, but you need to be filled with the Spirit.

				<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

				a commercial town and a busy seaport. It&#39;s wealth, just like 
				today, caused them say, “We&#39;re a very prosperous nation.” 
				America has been prosperous, but our prosperity came from God 
				Almighty. God has blessed and has been good to this nation, but

				goddess of the moon, while Bakus was the god of wine and 
				drunkenness. They say drunkenness was an epidemic in those 
				times. And this is what Paul is helping them to see. Here are 
				the people in Ephesus drinking, getting drunk, and destroying 
				everything they had. Riotous living and drunkenness always lead 
				to trouble and poverty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

			He didn&#39;t even know we were there. He told me afterward, “I used to 
			make as much as seven thousand dollars a day buying and selling wood 
			lots.” He said, “I had two new cars. I had a new home. Had a bank 
			account. I ended up in a little cottage,” he said, “over on this 
			other road.” And he said, “ I had come to the point where I was so 
			degraded that I used to bring booze home and put it in a container 
			under my bed and suck the booze through a hose.” He heard the music 
			coming from the tent, but he had no idea the tent was there. He 
			said, “When I heard the singing, I thought it was the angels singing 
			that judgment was coming.” And he said, “I jumped out of bed and got 
			on my knees and begged God to forgive me and save me.” Well, God 
			heard his prayer even if it was only in desperation, and then he 
			heard me preaching. He came to the meeting and turned his life over 
			to the Lord. Drunkenness will bring you down just as it did there in 
			Ephesus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

			Jesus felt that this was so necessary for His disciples that He told

			because you need Him. It&#39;s expedient that I go away for He&#39;ll not

			take a mathematician to understand that God was, God is, and always 
			will be, and there is nothing without Him. God doesn&#39;t live in 
			something; everything lives in Him. He didn&#39;t just speak like one of 
			these so-called evangelists preached “standing on the balcony of 
			Heaven [Where was Heaven before God created it?], and with a 
			boisterous voice He said, ‘Let there be...’” NO! In Him! You can&#39;t

			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

			Luke the eleventh chapter and in verse nine he says, <b><i>“And I

			</span>That word “ask” in the Greek has a continuation of thought,

			2. BE THIRSTY<o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The reason 
			why I think a lot of times we don&#39;t keep on asking and keep on 
			seeking and we don&#39;t keep on knocking is because we don&#39;t really 
			feel the need. You need to pray and, secondly, you need to be 
			thirsty. You need a hunger. A hunger that will drive you to your 
			knees and will not let you be satisfied until you have received. <o:p></o:p>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">I&#39;m sure God 
			did not do anything more miraculous for me than He wants to do for 
			you. I can recall when they told me about the Holy Spirit. I used to 
			watch many nights and the sun would come up as I sought for God. I 
			knew I needed to be filled and there was something in me that wasn&#39;t 
			satisfied. That doesn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t saved and that I wasn&#39;t glad 
			that I was saved. I knew I was saved. I knew I had been born-again. 
			I knew there was something missing, and I just couldn&#39;t seem to 
			leave it alone. I was hungry. I was thirsty. John seven thirty-seven 
			says, “<b><i>If any man thirst...”</i></b> He didn&#39;t say, “Now, if 
			you would like to be filled with the spirit come;” or, “If it&#39;s your 
			desire to be filled with the Spirit come.” He said, “If any man 
			thirst, let him come unto Me and drink and from his innermost being 
			shall flow rivers of living water.” This He spake of the Holy Ghost.

			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">You say, 
			“Well, how thirsty do you have to be?” The word that is used there 
			is the same word that Jesus used when He was on the cross in John 
			Nineteen. Jesus cries out and says, <b>“I thirst.”</b> They tell us 
			that in crucifixion the body temperature goes crazy—just sky high. 
			Every part of the body is fighting against that temperature, and so 
			the mouth becomes dry, the whole body is burning up with fever, and 
			the tongue gets thick. There in that place where He said,” I thirst” 
			is what He is saying to us. You need to have that kind of a thirst. 
			Not being satisfied with anything less. Are you hearing me? I 
			THIRST! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">I&#39;ve seen 
			people come down to this altar and pray, “God fill me with the Holy 
			Ghost” for maybe two or three times and then they are up and gone. 
			He wants you to be filled. Listen, if anything stirs this city it&#39;s 
			going to be people with the Holy Ghost. Hey, I&#39;m your friend. We&#39;re 
			both on the same side. I know that you need to be filled with the 
			Spirit. Your whole life will change. There will be struggles, 
			mountains, valleys, rivers, and fires, but you&#39;ll find that He&#39;ll be 
			there with you and you can make it with Him. In your own strength 
			you might not make it. The devils are determined on you not making 
			it, but if you&#39;ll let the Holy Ghost come in, He&#39;ll help you to make

			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
			Psalmist, I think, caught a truth way back there in the Psalms. He 
			said, <i>“<b>My soul thirsteth for the living God.”</b></i> What are 
			you saying? I&#39;m not satisfied with riches. You talk about a rich man 
			and a man that had authority? All David had to do was speak and a 
			man&#39;s head came off. He controlled. He had everything at his 
			fingertips, yet, he cries out in the midst of it all “my soul 
			thirsteth for God.” When you get to that point there&#39;s something 
			that will happen to you. When you say, “Nothing else satisfies; I 
			have got to have Him. I have got to have all that He has for me. I 
			want it. I need it. I have got to have it.” Again, Jesus said, “They 
			that hunger and thirst <i>might</i> be filled?” Shall be! SHALL be! <o:p></o:p>

			To be filled with the Spirit requires obedience. In John 14:15-17, 
			Jesus says, <b><i>“If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will 
			pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he 
			may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the 
			world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: 
			but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you..”</i></b> 
			“If you do what I tell you to do, I&#39;ll pray the Father, and He&#39;ll 
			send you the Holy Spirit and He&#39;ll be in you.” <o:p></o:p></span>

			says,<b> <i>“And we are His witnesses of these things; and so also 
			the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey Him.”</i></b><i>
			</i>Now, I&#39;m not gong to try to tell you that if you haven&#39;t 
			received the Holy Spirit it&#39;s because you&#39;ve been disobedient, but 
			it could be. You have to be obedient. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

			you have to make room for Him. I think this is what Paul had in mind 
			when he said...<b><i>&quot;and be not drunk with wine.&quot;</i></b> Wine is 
			destructive. That will destroy you. “<b><i>But be filled with the 
			Spirit</i></b>.” You need to make room. People still criticize the 
			innkeeper when retelling how Christ came as an unborn baby in Mary 
			and there was no room for Him. Preachers preach this Gospel and 
			don&#39;t have room for the Spirit. They have the mechanics. They have 
			the oratorical ability. They can get up and spin words and make them 
			sound good, but it is dead. The Scripture says that the letter kills 
			and it is the Spirit that gives life. [2 Cor. 3:6] Again, before I 
			even came into this pulpit this morning, I was saying, “Lord, if I 
			go in that pulpit, and just say words my words are empty. I&#39;m 
			depending on you. I&#39;m depending on the Holy Ghost to take the Word 
			and let it come alive and encourage somebody and strengthen somebody 
			and minister to somebody.” The Holy Spirit is the only One that can 
			minister to you. I think the songwriter put it so good when he said: <o:p></o:p>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
			Fifthly, you need to yield to Him. You say how do I yield? I went 
			through that. I had people shake me, shake my arms, and shake my 
			head. They would shout at me and say, “Yield! Yield! Yield!” Well, I 
			was trying, but I learned that in the same way that you have yielded 
			your members servants to sin and to thoughts or something that came 
			in your head, and you say “Oh, that&#39;s what I want to do.” (No! 
			That&#39;s what the devil wanted you to do, and you yielded your members 
			to that sin.) is the same manner that you yield your members to the 
			Spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			I&#39;m not going to stand up here this morning and tell you to just say 
			&quot;Bananas, bananas, bananas!&#39;&#39; Because that&#39;s all you will have when 
			you get through—Bananas. You can get lost in the Spirit. My 
			experience was He did not make me say something I didn&#39;t want to, 
			but He gave me something to say. Do you understand what I&#39;m saying? 
			When I was out there in sin I was a good servant. The devil would 
			say do <i>this,</i> and I would do it. I didn&#39;t know it was the 
			devil. I&#39;d probably hesitated if I’d known that, but I thought it 
			was something I wanted to do, so, I did it. I yielded myself to 
			those thoughts. I borrowed peoples’ cars without asking. Now, that&#39;s 
			not kosher; I&#39;m not proud of that. I yielded myself and Paul is 
			saying as ye yielded yourself servants to that yield yourself, give 
			yourself over, to God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
			You don&#39;t have to flop on the floor like a fish that is dying. I 
			have seen them thrash and kick around and knock things over. I have 
			even seen them run into posts, and split their heads open. Now, 
			that&#39;s not God. It can be one of two things: 1. It can be your own 
			soulish spirit, or 2. it can be an evil spirit. How many know that 
			the devil likes to mimic God? Yield yourself. Yield your members as 
			servants to Him. He made it easy; we make it hard. Amen. <o:p></o:p>

			The last thing in connection with receiving the infilling of the 
			Holy Ghost is that you need to believe. You are not going to be 
			filled with the Spirit unless you believe. You have got to believe 
			and keep on believing to the very end. I&#39;ve had people say to me, 
			“It must not be for me.” It is! It is for you! Peter said way back 
			there on the day of Pentecost, “It&#39;s for you and for your children 
			and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall 
			call.” Have you been called? It is for you. You need to believe that 
			is for you. Ephesians one and thirteen says, <b><i>“: in whom also 
			after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of 
			promise.” </i></b>You must believe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			The reason we need to be filled is that we need the <u>fire</u>. If 
			you come here week after week and service after service, and nothing 
			happens inside you, there is no fire lit, and there is nothing going 
			on, eventually you are going to get tired and you will be absent. <o:p></o:p>

			You need to GET the fire and then you need to KEEP the fire burning. 
			John said, “I baptize you with water unto repentance, but He that 
			cometh after me is greater than I. He shall baptize you not with 
			water, but with the Holy Ghost, <b>AND</b> <b>WITH FIRE</b>!” I 
			wonder if fire broke out in the pulpits across our land if maybe our 
			country will have a quick conversion. But you see we&#39;ve come to the 
			point where we compromise to keep people coming. We entertain them, 
			and we make them feel good. You See, I am no dummy. People have said 
			to me, “Brother Reynolds, you need to accept them where they are.” 
			He never called me to preach something that would make them feel 
			good. He called me to preach truth. I&#39;m telling you this morning 
			that this is a key to a victorious life. <b><i>“Be filled with the 
			Spirit.”</i></b> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			God never changes, and His power never wanes. It&#39;s the same. It 
			always energizes you. My wife often says to me, “I don&#39;t know how 
			you do it. (Get up every morning at five o’clock to pray.)” I don&#39;t 
			know either except that when the clock goes around He wakes me up. 
			He not only wakes ME up (because my Irish man has just as hard a 
			time as yours, but I don&#39;t let the Irish man talk. I jump up. I beat 
			him out before he gets the chance to open his mouth.) He’ll wake you 
			up, too. Do you understand what I&#39;m saying? He does that. The other 
			night, I think it was Tuesday night, I just felt like I wanted to 
			spend the night with the Lord. So, I prayed till early Wednesday 
			morning and stayed up all day and had my classes and got ready for 
			the service Wednesday night. Man, I felt like I was on fire! “What 
			are you trying to say, Brother Reynolds?” I&#39;m trying to tell you 
			that you can&#39;t do it in yourself, but He can! I&#39;m not trying to tell 
			you that you need to stay up all night, but sometimes when He comes 
			knocking you do. Would it not be a shame if He came knocking and you 
			say, “No, Jesus, I don&#39;t have the time; I have to go to bed?” 
			Remember when He came to the little a lady in the Song of Solomon? 
			She said, “I can&#39;t get up; I&#39;m in bed. I&#39;ve washed my feet, and laid 
			aside my garments. I don&#39;t want to defile my feet again.” Jump out 
			of bed! Answer the call! For He may be soon gone. Do we need the 
			fire in our pulpits? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			A lot of times people think the fire of the Holy Ghost is somebody

			it at all. William Branham, a little sawed-off-shrimp, never spoke 
			all the time I ever heard him like a lot of evangelists, but was 
			quite quiet, but when he said, “thus saith the Lord” it was like a

			happened to me. I had my Bible opened. I was a first year student at 
			Zion Bible Institute, and I had Larkin&#39;s Diagrams, which my mother 
			gave me. I figured Mother would never give me anything but what was 
			good. And, I&#39;m devouring all that I can find in these pages trying 
			to make a comparison with the Scripture, and all to once the Holy 
			Ghost came on me and said, “What your reading is wrong.” Then, He 
			began to show me what was right. From that time back in 1953 to this 
			day, I have never found anything wrong in what He said. I compared 
			it with the Scripture. Just like we should. Are you listening? <o:p></o:p>

			We are in darkness. Don&#39;t tell me you can understand this Book in 
			yourself. The natural man, the carnal mind, cannot understand this 
			Book. “<i>The Natural man understandeth not the things of God. For 
			they are spiritually discerned</i>.” [I Cor. 2:14] I&#39;m trying to 
			tell you this morning that you need the Holy Spirit in your life 
			helping you to know truth and let the fire burn. He will help you to 
			know truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			He will help your weaknesses and help your infirmities. In Romans 8 
			and 26, He said, “<i>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our 
			infirmities:</i>” Ephesians 3 and 16 he said, “<i>That he would 
			grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened 
			with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</i>” What is going to

			Somebody said to me one time, “Well, you were more fortunate. You 
			went off to Bible school and all that teaching helped you.” I&#39;ve 
			watched more kids backslide in Bible school than I ever did in the 
			church. You know why? It&#39;s because it&#39;s hard going. The devil can 
			knock your legs out from under you before you can get established. 
			He&#39;ll do that. I watched some fine young men. We started out with a 
			hundred and twenty in my class. There were forty-three of us, I 
			think, that graduated—finally made it to the end, and He said that 
			if you endured to the end, you will graduate. Out of those 43 
			graduates, I believe there were two of us that made it into the 
			ministry. Now that&#39;s a pretty poor percentage. <o:p></o:p></span>

			I&#39;m saying that the devil will make it as difficult as he possibly 
			can for you, and so you need to be filled with the Spirit. If you 
			are filled with the Spirit, the Spirit will help you in the times of 
			temptation. He will help you in the times when you feel like, “I 
			just can&#39;t go on. I can&#39;t take another step. I&#39;ve been hit from both 
			sides and just can&#39;t go on. I can&#39;t make it.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

			I know what I am talking about. Sad to say but I fell asleep driving 
			and I had my three boys with me: Jimmy, David, and Stephen. I 
			evidently was knocked unconscious. When I came to, I could hear 
			Jimmy hollering for help. He was on the back of the car. I don&#39;t 
			know how he got there, but he was on the back of the bumper and the 
			car was upside down. He was holding onto the bumper. Jimmy and I 
			were in the water. I ran and helped him get up onto the bank. I 
			could hear Stevie as he was running around, but I didn&#39;t know where 
			David was. My thoughts were, “He must be in the waters here 
			somewhere. I was going through the water looking for my boy. I 
			thought that he might be unconscious. Pretty quick a crowd began to 
			gather, and I heard them say when they saw me down there in the 
			water, “He&#39;s up here on the bank.” My heart sank. <o:p></o:p></span>

			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
			Just one year prior to that one year I stood by a casket and I said, 
			“I&#39;ll never preach Your Gospel again. Never will I preach It again.” 
			I took my ministerial card and my ordination card, and put it in the 
			casket, and closed the lid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
			I walked up to the crowd of people and saw my little boy with the 
			side of his head torn right open, and it was just like hands reached 
			inside of me, and held me. I&#39;m telling you that I couldn’t make it 
			by myself. I&#39;ve had others say, “How did you do it?” I didn&#39;t. He 
			held me. You say, “Didn&#39;t you care?” Care? I&#39;d rather die and have 
			him live. Oh, yeah, I cared. I cried many tears. I used to sit at 
			the table and see Jimmy pull his chair up, see Stevie pull his chair 
			up, and I could picture in my mind little David running across the 
			floor pulling his chair up, but he wasn&#39;t there. What I&#39;m trying to 
			tell you is the Hoy Ghost will come to you, hold you, keep you, stay 
			you in the storm, and make you strong. He helps our infirmities. Can 
			He do it? Hey, I&#39;m not telling you something I read in a book. I&#39;m 
			telling you about something that happened to me. He did it. And, 
			Yeah, I&#39;m sure there were tears I can&#39;t recall altogether, but while 
			I was looking at my little boy, I just know the feeling was it was 
			just like someone reached inside of me and was holding me. I looked 
			down and I said, “Jesus, I will preach your Gospel as long as 
			there&#39;s breath in these lungs.” I was foolish telling Him that I 
			wouldn&#39;t. I paid a tremendous price that I didn&#39;t need to pay. The 
			Holy Spirit can be to you what you can&#39;t be to yourself or anyone 
			else. You need to be filled with the Spirit. Religion will drive you 
			crazy, but the Spirit will cause you to live. The letter kills; the 
			Spirit gives life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			One last thing that doesn&#39;t really even need to be said: it gives us 
			power. Power not just to endure. Power to not just sit. Power not 
			just to show, but power to witness. He said, “<i>After that the Holy 
			Ghost is come upon you, ye shall receive power to be witnesses unto 
			Me</i>.” [Acts 1:8] Say, “Why do I need to be filled?” You need that 
			power. I&#39;ll tell you the reason why—It takes the Holy Spirit to 
			touch hearts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

			I can recall when I first started preaching that I didn&#39;t know the 
			first thing about preaching, and I couldn&#39;t carry a tune. My own 
			brother-in-law used to turn around and look right at my face and I&#39;m 
			there singing with all my heart and he would laugh right at me. I 
			was trying to do the best I could. I went out with a tent with no 
			piano player and no organ player. I had a piano, but I did not have 
			anybody to play it, and I would sing a cappella. I probably sang 
			somewhere in-between the keys, but every once in a while I&#39;d hit it. 
			I did my best, and I would preach. My own cousin came up to me and 
			said, &quot;You know, Cousin Jimmy, all you do is read a story and you 
			tell a story from the story.” I said, &quot;Doing the best I can.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
			</span>What I wanted you to see is that up in Northern New 
			Hampshire, in Pittsburgh. It&#39;s a town that when you go through if 
			you blinked your eyes you had gone through it. There were two people 
			going to church—the preacher and the piano player. We set the tent 
			up on a Tuesday morning; Tuesday night I started services. The only 
			advertisement I had was my uncle. He went out in a car and invited 
			his old logging friends, lumbermen, to come. The finest sermons 
			couldn’t produce what I see there in that little town. Now, I spend 
			a lot of time on my sermons. I know they&#39;re homiletical; I don&#39;t 
			have to ask you. I know they are because I work at it, but I have 
			never seen anything comparable to that revival. You know, these old 
			lumbermen, they used to come and sit right on the front row, and get 
			right out on the edge of the chair, and they&#39;d stare right at me. It 
			doesn’t take much when a man&#39;s mouth is wide open to just drop in a 
			little something. When I gave the altar call thirty-five people, I 
			mean big, rugged lumbermen, came rushing down to the altar; they 
			were literally running. They would come down and throw themselves on 
			the altar and cry, &quot;Oh, God, save me!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
