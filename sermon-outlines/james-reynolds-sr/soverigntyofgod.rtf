today to hear his voice high on nor your not have people say to a wealth of so-and-so doesn't believe that so-and-so doesn't believe this yet and that's man's ideas and that's man's interpretation and you've heard me say this a lot at times this was a personal experience myself with a preacher I looked him in the eyes and he had a conflict of what I what I was teaching what I preach them that I turned to him and I quoted a verse of Scripture from the word of God I quoted were a word I didn't add anything to it I didn't take anything away from it I simply quoted the word or word and he looked at me and he said well that's your interpretation is to what they're doing today if you will hear his voice hard on not your car's he was 12 and 25 says that this would say that you refuse not him say

we have a responsibility part I don't feel he doesn't ask us if you feel like there is a responsibility laid upon every believer will put it like this is that you need to always pray that you are not into temptation what is the what is the Lord say he was saying that if you don't pray you would end up in trouble flow is telling us that we need bright we was possibility to go to pray Conseil Chronicles 714 he said it like this if my people talking about his people people that know if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and Ray shall humble themselves and pray talking about his people and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land I will be familiar to us pray wasn't just a demand in the old times it's still a demand today that we pray you will find that all your problems and a lot of furor difficulties that you face if you spend some time in prayer all those problems will be dissipated God will work for you don't expect God to take care of your problem if you are amid times you've heard me tell about the one of the teachers design your lawyer and I know that he was very busy and that he said to us one day and one of the classes is that I don't have the time I have to do my prayer rug will it show he never had to tell me that just to hear him as he stood up
