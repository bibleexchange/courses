# The Renovation of the Mind

A sermon outline of Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

TEXT: Romans 12:2

> Romans 12:2&mdash;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

Remember that the subconscious mind does not reason between what is good or bad. It works on information that it receives.

What you think is often what you speak.

- You talk defeat
- You talk failure
- You talk fear

People say:

- &quot;I am a failure.&quot;
- &quot;I don&apos;t have a chance&quot;
- &quot; Things are going wrong for me.&quot;
- &quot;I&apos;ve always been like this.&quot;
- &quot;What is the use of trying?&quot;
- &quot;It is just too difficult to try.&quot;

The subconscious works hard for you to bring to pass what you think.

## I. The Mind is a Storehouse

The mind is somewhat like a computer. As a computer is programed with lists of commands to produce specific actions.

- Command Lists for a Word Processor
- Command lists for a Spread Sheet
- Command Lists for a Data Manager

What you put in, you can expect to get out. Garbage in, garbage out.

Matthew 15:16-20&mdash; And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  17  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  18  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  19  For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 20  These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

## II. To Get Information into the Mind

### A. Must Know How

Pray in the Spirit by the revelation of the truth by the Spirit of God.

### B. Must Have Right Information

### C. The Devil Put Wrong Information in

> 2 Corinthians 4:4&mdash;In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

&quot;tuphloo&quot; to make blind, obscure like smoke

## III. to Get Information Out of the Mind

Wrong, negative, bad information needs to be taken out.

> Romans 12:2&mdash;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

### A. The Need of Renewing the Mind

Our minds are cluttered with: fear, worries, disappointments.

&quot;renewing the mind&quot; &ndash; &quot;metamorphoo&quot; change into another form.

Undergo a complete change which under the power of God will find expression in character and conduct.

To make new restore, renovate, begin afresh

### B. The Process of Renewing the Mind

> 2 Corinthians 3:18&mdash;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

It is not easily formulated. In the natural, it is even impossible.

- Look to the Word of God

- Look to the Spirit of God (seek the glory of God)
