# The Lifeblood of Fellowship (IMPORTANCE - BASIS - STANDARD - SURETY)

A sermon outline of Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

## INTRODUCTION

An indispensable or vital part of fellowship with one another, is our fellowship with God:

> 1 John 1:7&mdash;
> But if we walk in the light,
> as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
> and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

Our Common bond is Christ.

## The Importance of our Fellowship

### Divided

Fellowship with God is vital to fellowship with man. The story of man's first quarrel with God (Gen. 3), is followed by man's quarrel with his fellow (Gen. 4).

> Isaiah 53:6&mdash;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

### Made One

The cross of Jesus was to bring us back into fellowship with God and, by effect, with one another.

> Romans 5:11&mdash;And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

### Fellowship is an Indicator

The more closely we fellowship with one another indicates our fellowship with God. Like the spokes of a wheel **the nearer the hub the closer the spokes**.

Our fellowship with one another is closely connected with our fellowship with God. What is a barrier between men becomes a barrier between us and God. The Scripture teaches us not to allow anything to remain between us.

> Matthew 5:23,24&mdash;Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; 24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

> 1 Corinthians 7:15&mdash;But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.

I AM NOT TAKEN HOSTAGE BY ANOTHER'S UNWILLINGNESS TO RECONCILE. I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO MY PART TO BRING PEACE --not 'you have to talk to me about this' / not a continual jarring and discord. Be careful that I have not CAUSED the discord and if I have, **make way for healing**.

A break in our fellowship within the household if faith, should cause us to carefully investigate ourselves.

## The Basis of our Fellowship

> "If we walk in the light&hellip;"

What does it mean to walk in the light or darkness? Light reveals/discovers and darkness hides.

1. Light reveals/discovers

> Ephesians 5:13&mdash;But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

2. Darkness Hides

When Adam and Eve sinned, they hid themselves. Sin and its Darkness makes a person UNREAL:

- **Disingenuous**. ----> not candid or sincere, typically by pretending that he knows less about something than he really does.
- **Pretending**
- **Window Dressing**

If something is done to pretend to be dealing with an issue or problem, rather than actually dealing with it, it is window dressing. &apos;perform a deed only for the sake of appearance&apos;.

- **Excusing Ourselves While Blaming Others**

This is WALKING IN DARKNESS.

> 1 John 1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, **we lie**, and do not the truth:

Walking in the light is the opposite of walking in the darkness.

## The Standard of our Fellowship

> "&hellip;as He is in the light.."

> 1 John 1:5&mdash;&hellip;God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

*God is the standard of our fellowship and NOT ONE ANOTHER.* If we are walking in DARKNESS yet say we have fellowship with God, **we LIE**.

> **ILLUSTRATION**: English evangelist George Whitefield (1714-1770) learned that it was more important to please God than to please men. Knowing that he was doing what was honoring to the Lord kept him from discouragement when he was falsely accused by his enemies. At one point in his ministry, Whitefield received a vicious letter accusing him of wrongdoing. His reply was brief and courteous: "I thank you heartily for your letter. As for what you and my other enemies are saying against me, **I know worse things about myself than you will ever say about me.** With love in Christ, George Whitefield." He didn't try to defend himself. He was much more concerned about **pleasing the Lord**.

> **ILLUSTRATION**: Grace Coolidge, the wife of President Calvin Coolidge, tried to surprise her husband by having his portrait painted. When it was finished, she hung it in the library of the White House. Later the same morning the President happened to walk into the library accompanied by a senator. They stared at the picture together in silence. Finally Coolidge commented quietly: **"I think so, too."**

## The Surety of our Fellowship

SURETY: a person who takes responsibility for another's performance of an undertaking, for example their appearing in court or the payment of a debt.

No matter how badly we have failed in the past &hellip;

> "&hellip;and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."

### The Light Reveals the Problem; the Blood Cleanses the Problem.

### Don't Run and Hide Because you have a problem, confess and be cleansed.

> 1 John 1:9&mdash;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

- The More the Light Reveals
	- The More we Confess
		- The More the Blood Cleanses
			- The More our Fellowship
