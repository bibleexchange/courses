# Conformity Versus Transformity

A sermon outline of Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

TEXT: Romans 12:2

> Romans 12:2&mdash; And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

## Introduction

- There is a great struggle going on.

- The Appeal of the conformist is to be like them that you not offend them &mdash; so you can win them.

## The Believer Must Be A Non-Conformist

> &hellip;Be not conformed&hellip;

- The Gospel is not a a rule of CONTROVERSY.
- The Gospel is a rule of DIRECTION.

The Believer is not different for the sake of being different. The Christian is going somewhere.

&quot;conform&quot; suschematizo [GREEK] &mdash; to fashion or shape one thing like another.

> 1 Peter 1:14&mdash;As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:

&quot;not FASHIONING&quot; (same word, suschematizo, as in Romans 12:2 &quot;conformed&quot;)

The Believer must not follow the following three things:

1. The Fashions of the World &mdash;  looking like the world
2. The Philosophies of the World &mdash; talking like the world
3. The Ways of the World &mdash; acting like the world

## The Believer Must Be A New Creation
 > &hellip;but be ye transformed&hellip;

Jesus transfigured (transformed) before the disciples. (Why could they not see His glory? The Flesh. )

The Glory of Christ was **let out**. The veil  of flesh was drawn aside.

The veil of our flesh must be drawn aside **to let the Glory in**

&quot;metamorphoo&quot; [GREEK] &mdash; to change into another former

- meta &mdash; implying change
- morph &mdash; implying former
- morphe &mdash; lays stress  on the inward change
- schema &mdash; lays sress on the outward change

> 2 Corinthians 3:18&mdash;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

We are &quot;changed&quot; / transformed as we behold Him:

- In Faith &mdash; Revelation, etc.
- In Obedience &mdash; doing His will
- in Appropriation &mdash; partaking of His Divine nature

Remember only those that have been transformed will be translated.

> Hebrews 11:5&mdash;By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
