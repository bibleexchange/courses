\viewkind4\uc1\pard\fs20 This is budged hours a welcome you to very comprehensive and in-depth study of the false gospel of Islam I like to do an expos\'e9 that will reveal to you the lies the demonic based whereby the Gospel of Islam has been originated pretty propagated and sorrowfully spread or I say it sure would spread around the world at the present time is dating one of them in a way that is very alarming this Islamic spirit was born within the spirit of the bondservant of the ball and made in was transferred into her son which against God's will and God's purpose of future blessing and prosperity and above all covenant was not established the hastiness of Sarah and Abraham to force the Acropolis and the dogs we'll brought about a setting that was not conducive to the fullness of God promised the government would just got to be the basis whereby we operate everything that we do is when the book of Genesis will briefly touch this as we move more into the false gospel of Islam and established that issue legal who was the son of the bondservant and directly the son of Abraham as well was not the seed of promise nor was he considered by God to be the firstborn of promise not established his setting with Abraham in Chapter 17 of Genesis verse six through eight and I will be exceeding fruitful I will make nations of being and kings shall come out of a will establish my covenant between me and the and thy seed after thee in their generations were everlasting covenant to be a goblin to be and to thy seed after the guy will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee little and wherein the artist stranger on the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God now for issue legal God did make a promise and established him and biblically I believe that I can show you the dish meal use the originator of the demonic and file spirits operate among the Arab world is the one who gave birth to a paper at his very blood updates the blood of Zionism and the blood of the Israelite which is the direct descendent of Abraham so Ishmael was born in Abraham's house to the bondservant Haggai Hagar and he mocked made fun proclaimed he was the firstborn and in many of the teachings of Islam will find out that these foolish people actually go back and lay claim on this original earth and promised that they believe belonged to Ishmael and the Bible says in Chapter 17 and God did declare in verse 20 and as for Israel I have heard the bugle via bless them and will make him fruitful and will multiply an exceedingly poor Princess Sally begat and I will make him a great nation like covenant will I establish with Isaac underlined that in your mind and I'll read it again starting in verse one but my covenant will either establish with Isaac would establish our bear on to the at this sad time in the next year now but were deploying my friend in fact it can not be debated or argued with and the Bible goes on to plainly tell us and establish without any variation that God understood the plight of Ishmael and gave the mercy and gave him understanding but in chapter 1 verse 12 gods of other Abraham would not be greenish embossed site because of the lab and this is dealing with casting them out and let's go back to verse nine and reading Sarah Saul the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had borne on the Abraham locking now I've been studying this mocking simply meant that he was mocking the fact that the promise existed for one yet to be born and he plainly stated with his mother with the spirit anymore than that he bears now that he will not be submissive to the will of government of God will be done there way that the very spirit of idolatry and false doctrine and religion but God said and I say again that Sarah Saul the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had borne on the Abraham mocking wherefore she sat on the Abraham Isaac has already been born I want you to out she said this bond woman and her son for the son of his bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with Isaac and this thing was very green is in Abraham's site because of his son God said on the Abraham led it not be greediest in my site because of the lab N. because of by bondwoman and all that Sarah had set under the Harkin on per her boys for in Isaac shall thy seed be called and he went on to say because of by seed I will make of this summer by bondwoman nation what he went on to say that Ishmael will be a while men in the earth you will be hated of every man and every man will ABM that certainly gives me an opening to teach what I need to teach in the next several hours if you want to stay with me we will explore we will bring you fax we'll bring you some very comprehensive dialogue that I think you need now our approach this beginning to alarm you and to startle you if that's the right term for you to understand what's going on today and they will go into the in-depth breakdown of Islam the Koran and all the other factions but for centuries Christians are recognized Islam is a false religion that's been up of four given but until recently Muslims or more hominids as they been known in the past have been the focus of evangelistic outreach is but today many people are considering Islam from a more ecumenical point of view I want to hear me it's often said that Christian Jews and Muslims are worshiping the same God but in different ways that's the new Lingle of our day they are trying to bring this diabolical ungodly even idolatrous religion on the level of a Christianity and daresay that we all have the same God we're just worshiping him in different ways and Muslims would capitalize on this misconception and now they are reversing it in urging Jews and Christians to worship the one God with their their their very smart and work together they save for solutions to the world's many social problems which important to know some of the history and false doctrines of Islam and to totally and adamantly reject this new approach which is fast growing and very erratically moving and we must understand that it's got to be rejected this is a fast growing religion and that the rapidly moving across the land which is a a lot that could be said in the deluding and the watering down of our resistance by compromise and an allowing sin and and carnality become illegal longer have the resolve to stand against it easier for us to just bland and accept them think may be these Muslim folks aren't so bad after all but you better wake up and realize that they are not an ecumenical movement they are diabolical murderers Christian and Jew hating movement and they will never change from who they are Islam began about 600 A.D. and what is modern Saudi Arabia Mohammed the prophet of Islam receive what is purported to be a revelation from God this revelation is known as the Koran while holy book of Islam from its dubious beginnings Islam has grown to approximately billion adherents worldwide for centuries Islam is exerted a great deal of influence over the people of the middle east and Africa even dominating Southern Europe for a time and even now vastly spreading through Central and the larger part of your today Islam is endeavoring once again to have a significant influence upon the culture and society of the Western world that new image of Islam is trying to present to the west something that is a far cry from fanaticism and violence advocated by many Muslim leaders nevertheless nevertheless the devotion of Muslims in the West to Islamic principles is as uncompromising as he is in any other part of the world the presentation of Islam in Europe and North America is characterized by intellectualism rather than the emotional wisdom how important for you to hear that the irrational religious frenzy by which Islam has become recognized worldwide is covered now by a false covering of civility very simple but even have over in the Africa they have on our television channel called the peace channel pays jack about bombs and we're talking about blowing people up with that today they call this big lie is that there are now a move would've civility Muslims around the world concur that Islamic laws and principles that precedent always take precedent over the decency and morality of civilization walking the streets killing blowing up bombing killing women and children sold around the world when the chips are down and all the facts are in Muslims will concur always that Islamic laws and principles that precedent over the decency and morality of civilization they are not civilized they are vile murderous and evil now no matter how intellectual civilized or scientific Islam is made to appear it is still a religion which embodies a number gospel and Galatians 16 and seven state it plainly I marvel I'm reading it that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would burn her the gospel of Christ the Lord declares that it has occurs Galatians 1 and eight but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you at him be accursed Christians must be prepared must be prepared to present the one true gospel of salvation to Muslims of course always desiring that they be delivered from their religious bondage but we must hold fast to the true and we must be able with what the Bible says and we must present them with the only salvation that exist and I will tell you in the most important thing for Christians to mellow when confronted with teachings of a false religion is what drew not be too forcefully stated that Christians must know the Scriptures we are going to be involved in evangelism we must know all the banjo was flying on an airplane from Dar es Salaam to Arusha Tanzania and on that flight are set down by gentlemen -- new American I suggest you said are you a Christian I said yes he said I hate American Christians are so well then you must be a stake in Muslim he said yes and we got into quite a discussion it was really in depth but in our discussion on "from his Koran he said that's not in our Koran I said you're like most Christians that I know you don't know your own Bible if we're going to be an evangelist we must all be eventual our message to Muslims is that they like all men are walls all are naturally at enmity with God in the shins 213 and you at the quick and we were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past he walked according to the course of this world according to the principal power of the air the spirit that now work with him but children of disobedience among who also we all had our conversation in times past in the laws of our pledge fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children around even as others there is no good in us that Tim Merritt God's favor and there is no good weekend due to an bear ourselves to him or to make us be well enough to be received I am Isaiah 64 six aware all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we do all state as a lead in our iniquities like to win have taken us away as three and 12 they all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that do a good knoll not one go on to read Romans 319 and 20 now we know that what things still are the laws say of it saith to them that are audible all that every mouth may be stop all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the deeds of the wall there shall no flesh be justified in his sight or by the wall is the knowledge of CM we are oral walls being lost and unable to affect our own salvation out of you now that God did all that is required to reconcile men to himself Christ bore our sin died on the crawls shedding his blood as a completely perpetual sacrifice for sin and he rose again bodily from the dead believing this testimony and the whole without exception crusting Jesus Christ for salvation is all that is necessary to be saying Romans chapter 5 verses one and then six and nine therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to God but God command of his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us the gospel if I could call a bet of Islam is something quite different similar to many modern calls Islam claims to revere the writings of all profits yet Muslims unequivocally subjugate the Scriptures to the prophecy of new Hamas in other words, the prophecies override supersede old scripters yet they daresay in their lying words that the writings of all profits are of importance a leaflet prepared by the Institute of Islamic information and education titled introducing Islam to non-Muslims states this Yule, the is the very last prophet of God to mankind is the final messenger of God his message was and is scaled to the Christians and Jews and the rest of mankind he was sent to those religious people to form them about the true mission of Jeeves's and the amazing Moses David Jacob Isaac and Abraham of his leaflet continues to say Mohammed is considered to be the sublimation and the culmination of all the prophets and messengers that came before him he purified the previous messages he purified the previous messages in other words the message of Christ and the Bible needed to be purified from a oddball duration and completed the message of God for all humanity he was entrusted with the power of explaining in interpreting and living with teachings on the Koran isn't that some that actually believe that Mohamed was the summation and the culmination of all the prophets and messengers that came before him and what was said by Jesus and the great memorable had to be purified you must recognize friends that Joseph Smith of the Mormonism trawls the Russellville witnesses Mary Aker added the Christian science Alan G. wide of the 7-bit mentalism have all claimed the same transcendent of far that they have come and superseded along with these Mohammed was the bearer of wicked doctrines I stated you can take it and play it to anybody trying to a Muslim and tell him I said Mohamed was always others of the bearer of wicked doctrines of the plunge mini into the outer darkness of a turtle torment among the insidious doctrines of Islam is the rejection of the doctrine of imputation introducing Islam to non-Muslims explains Muslims believe that people are born free of sin imagine that it is only after they reach the age of puberty and it is only after they commit sins that they are to be charged for their mistakes they teach that no one is responsible for can take responsibility for the sins of others as this is a denial of biblical teaching that all mankind sinned in Adam battled the Bible says that is Adam's sin has been imputed as the Bible teaches us into the air and our human race the Bible teaches this Romans 512 to 14 wherefore as by one man centered in to sin entered into the world and death by sin shall death passed upon all men were all have sin to that totally contradicts their doctrine that no one has them until they reach a certain age in their sins are not against them in the redrawn from two same was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no wall nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses a bundle over there that have not sin after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come out of this is a denial of the biblical teaching that the righteousness of God is imputed to man up on believing or rather that is that believers actually possessed the righteousness of our second rent is five and 2121 for ye have made him to be sin for us who noodles and that we might be made the righteousness of God in the M. by denying these true which are fundamental to the gospel of salvation by grace through faith alone Islamist lay the groundwork for a gospel if you make all of that of self righteousness and salvation by works in the Bible teaches that salvation is not a reward heaven is eternal abode of those who have received Christ the Savior Islam teaches that salvation is indeed a reward for reliable relative deity of righteousness the Koran states bimbos who scales are heavy they are successful and those who scales were lied or those who lose their souls in fact Muslims are encouraged to live with one another to attain your sustainers forgiveness and to a paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth which awaits the God can't just push them for charity and time aplenty and a time of hardship and restrain their anger and pardon their fellow men were God loves those who do good at their Koran from these denies the fundamental biblical teachings and the establishment of a religion of self righteousness follows the Islamic repudiation of the Savior there is no need for him and their diabolical teaching following is so important that Islam that was printed in very bold type in a leaflet entitled profit within Islam that equaled it the Koranic account of Jesus in a radically arrayed checks the concept of his divinity and Dubai and Sun ship the Institute of Islamic information and education publishes a leaflet entitled is Jesus really God in this they totally reject the biblical teaching that Jesus is God manifest in the flesh nevertheless for you in the word is plain was manifest in the flesh in first Timothy three and 16 bit cratered well as a man among men in John 1123 Jesus Christ as the forgive her of sin in Luke 520 and 11 in short the son and the father are one John 1030 the Lord Jesus Christ said that the religious of his day who rejected his deity if you believe not that IME you shall die in your sin John Aven 24 that's what the Bible says Islam unashamedly rejects the truth would compromise the gospel while many people today say that Christians and Moslems worship the whosoever transgressive in the bottom not in the doctrine of Christ Ave. not God John second John nine an even greater condemnation is pronounced by God in verse seven denying the doctrine of Christ reveals Islam as a deception and antichrist religion the Koran is substituted false doctrines with present another gospel Islam purports to be the way of peace but the end of Islam is the way of death Bible believers must not evil these eternal important boards rarely because Islam claims to esteem the patriarchs and the prophets the towers on stability and testify to the truth even as we cry out against the error of any false religion is important for God's people to be aware of the fact that many so-called Christians are willing to compromise the truth of God's word in the interest of building bridges with various religions Islam seems to be exerting itself in the area of religious dial men and women who claim to represent Christianity are quickly building the credibility of Islam as a true religion I hope you're following me instead of witnessing Christians are in courage to discover common ground with Moslems rather than exposing its errors Christians are told to search for the truth of Islam DOS Islam is gaining a respectability that they simply do not deserve what Christians are manifesting their open-mindedness Muslims are spreading their false propaganda under the cover of dialogue Muslims believe that all mankind must be brought into subjection to the spurious teachings of the Koran in order to experience peace and blessing they will not compromise that believe do you hear me they will not compromise it were the only ones that will Muslims believe that the doctrine of the incarnation of God is blasting they will not compromise that believe Muslims believe that Mohammed is the prophet who fully revealed the final truth they will not compromise that believe Muslims are devoted to their ideals and uncompromising with falsehood the moral system of Islam only the glorious liberating light of one true gospel would be able to break through such Gartner's although those who practice Islam professed to respect all those who are faithful dog dodges people it is their contention that one true isn't religion is Islam Muslims trace the true religion from Abraham through Ishmael but the Bible absolutely contradicts this notion of order talk about a Genesis 1715 to 21 makes it clear that God rejected this real confirming the covenant blessings including the full Philip of the true religion to Isaac alone Galatians chapter 3 deals with the subject of the true religion directly references the events of Genesis 17 and 21 Galatians 3 and it says in the Scripture are saying that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel in the Abraham saying in the shall all nations be blessed promise of salvation for Jew and Gentile was prophesied to come to the seed of Abraham were 16 relates the true religion the only gospel to the promise made to Abraham in Genesis 17.the Abraham and his seed were the promises made sense not antecedent as a mini but as of one and Tobias seed which is Christ Gospel preached the Abraham was a gospel of Christ delivered to Isaac not the gospel of Islam delivered through Ishmael Islam claims to be a religion of peace and tolerance it is in fact characterized by instability and religious bigotry it is our duty to stand for the gospel and against all other gospel duo, brought out message from a false spirit that totally opposes the gospel of grace message of Islam is up wreck comparison between the holy Bible and the Koran which is thereby better prophetically distorted so-called Bible and I'll bring up later in the study that Mohammed actually read on the ground foam at the mouth when the so-called angel came to him and gave him these documents and gave them these sayings that he wrote as a Koran and even spoke to his wife at one point and said that he thought he was being processed which I told one of percent agree I'm going to go now and continuing with the false gospel of Islam and I think he would be great if we take the Bible read it and they go straight to the Koran and read it now I do also understand that most Muslims are not allowed to read the Koran because they are told that the Koran is too holy and two Ford vans for them plus it's in the ad is to be read in Arabic written in Arabic and not a few of them not many of them even though all their Excel it doesn't really make sense as a Genesis 7 and seven and read what the Bible says and no one in and his sons and his wife and his sons lives with them into the Ark because of the waters of the flood now would look to the Koran assure which is one of their books Chapter 11 verse 42 and 43 of the Ark float with the multiple waves towering like mountains and Noah called out to his son who had separated himself from the rest guess I'm chuckling and the waves came between them and the son was among those overwhelmed in the flood of that's what the Koran says about the fact that no one is sons and his wife and their wives went into New York and God closed the door Mohammed Bible says that one of those songs that separated somehow in the waves came between them and the sum of overwhelmed in the flood completely hilarious but it was Genesis Aiden Ford read about mullahs are and have a comparison and they are arrested in the seventh month on the 17th day of the month among the mountains of a rare no insurer chapter 11 verse 44 of the Koran in the word went forth old earth swallow up by water and old sky would hold by rain and the water abated and the matter was ended and the ark rested on Mount Judah bimbo and the word went forth away with those who do roll that's the Koran mail would go on to Genesis Chapter 13 and continue this comparison in dealing with the great Abraham chapter 13 verse 18 then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plane of moderate which is in Hebron and built there an altar on to the Lord that's what the holy Bible says now that's read what Searle chapter 14 verse 37 as the site all our Lord I have made some of my all spring to dwell in the Valley without cultivation now this valley is the mecca and Valley where the Muslims believe I'm upholding the numbers telling you they believe Abraham built combo with Ishmael the Bible plainly state division was cast out as a little boy Orlando with the bondservant Hagar now they believe that in the Mac and Valley that Abraham built combo with Ishmael but start over all our Lord I have made some all spring to dwell in the Valley without cultivation by sacred house, in order or Lord that they may establish regular prayer shall fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them and feed them with troops so that they may give thanks not that's not what the Bible says that Abram did but that's what the prophetically distorted Koran says now were reading from the Koran assure a 13 story 14 and 37 and this is what the Koran says all our Lord I have made some among all spring to dwell in the Valley without cultivation abuses the Valley is in the mecca and Valley where the Muslims believe Abraham built combo with Ishmael could believe that Israel and Abraham were coworkers and workers together arrived solo was start again all our Lord I have made some among all spring to dwell in the Valley without cultivation by by sacred house, in order larboard that they may establish regular prayer shall fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them and feed them with troops killed so that they may do thanks I really trust that you can can comprehend this is not rolled back and listen to again and again and CEO abominable this Koran really use all right but called Exodus 2 and five and DU was Pharaoh and the daughter of Pharaoh the Bible says came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the Riverside and when she saw the ark among the flags you sooner made defective school in reverse six when she opened that she saw the child and behold the big Web and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the Hebrew two not with producer of chapter 28 versus eight in nine then the people of Pharaoh picked him up from the river it was intended that Moses should be determined adversary in the calls of sorrow for Pharaoh and the Hayman and their host were men of Sam Bell is known as the wife of a Rose said here is the joy of Ya for me and for the slaying and not it may be that he will be of use to us or we may adopt him as a son and they perceive not what they were doing our Bible which I believes is the daughter of Pharaoh the Koran comes along and says it was the wife of Pharaoh I don't have any trouble telling you which one I believe what you need to know who I distorted and prophetic this Koran is now let's go to the miracles of Jesus and St. John's got Gospel chapter 2 verse 11 the Bible says there's this beginning of miracles that Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him but here John gives us the record of Jesus first Mirko in Cana of Galilee changing the water into wine will compare this with the Koran's version concerning miracles of Jesus and sorrow three and 49 and appointed him a message or to the children of Israel with his message I have come to you with the sign from your Lord and that I make for you out of clay as it were the figure of a bird and breath and breathe into it and it becomes a bird but all is Lee have you ever heard anything more ridiculous and I heal those born blind and the lepers and I quick and the dead by all as leave and I declare to you what you eat and what you stored your houses surely therein is assigned for you if you did do we buy my friend anybody that could get any inspiration spiritually from such totally mixed up jargon as that I'm reading from what this massive powerful movement calls the holy Koran that they're willing to kill people if they insult there willing to kill people if they say anything against how could you do anything else but say something against something token using and doing mixed up an adverse in regards to the Bible all right now we will go to Zacharias punishment in one and 20 because Zachariah was to be mute until the child was born which was the entire period of his wife's pregnancy let's read what one and 20 says on the holy Bible and the old I'll shall be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because I believe is not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season was and what the Koran says and 03 and 41 to Zacharias said Omar Lord give me a sign by sign was the answer shall be that thou shalt speak to no man or three nights although vowel are not dumb eight hold contradiction and rewriting he's got a three nights the Bible says that it is for the in car just station. And God doesn't give a good Zachariah asking Ford it's completely distorted which is the pattern of the Koran a distorted with static book all right now let's go to the crucifixion Matthew chapter 27 verse 35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my bastard did they cast lots now you've got to listen closely sure for verse 157 this is what the Koran says and they said in bowls we killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary the messenger of Allah but they killed him not nor crucified him but so was made to appear it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no knowledge but only conjecture to follow through surety they killed him not new abominable liars they hold take away the crucifixion Matthew says then they crucified him and the mocking blaspheming is Koran says that they killed him not nor crucified him but so it was made to appear to them not listen what a mixed up mess and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no certain knowledge but only conjecture to follow for a brochure or do they killed him not that the comparison of the crucifixion now let's do a comparison on the deity of Jesus Matthew 16 and 16 and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the son of the living God that they read it again and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the son of the living dog now will go to the Koran sure nine and 30 the Jews call use Ira a son of God and the Christians call Christ the son of go that is a saying from their mouth in this they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say Allah's curse be on them how they are deluded away from true you you've got to let me read that blaspheming is verse from the Koran again and Peter said thou the Christ the son of the living God here comes the Koran saying the Jews call desire of some of God and the Christians call Christ the son of God this is a saying from their mouth know you liar is also from the mouth of Christ himself in this they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say Allah's curse be on them how they are deluded away from true that all to curl your hair the blaspheming is a mockery that is here in comparison that's movable now dealing with the authority of Christ will read from Hebrews 11 through 3.it was some great times and in divers manners spake in time past this is the holy Bible unto the fathers by the prophets have been these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he appointed heir of all things by law solely made the world's whom being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right-hand of the Majesty on high all right in comparison 05 and 75 Christ the son of Mary was no more the messenger that is what the Koran says Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger many were the messengers that passed away before him his mother was a woman of truth they had bowls to eat their daily food see how all of the make his signs clear to them yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the true Ma to me read it again the Koran and confrontation to Hebrews 113 Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger many were the messengers that passed away before him his mother was a woman of true they had bowls to eat their daily food to see how all of the make his signs clear to them yet see in what ways they are deluded away from true but go to God's nature and read John 316 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have ever lasting life sura three the ungodly Koran 32 and 57 old they Allah and his messenger but if they turn back all the love of not those who reject rate as to those who believe and work righteousness all will pay them in full the reward but all of of not those who do wrong by God so loved the whole world that he gave his only begotten son that will sell you at all a love of service as the book of services on a love of map those who reject a as to the wounds who believe and work righteousness all will pay them in full the reward but all the love of not those who do by God Allah is not my God in fact all it is not even a dog that's due with God's love in comparing the Bible and the Koran Romans five and they would God command of his love toward us in the wild we were yet sinners Christ died for us is that wonderful sura two 195 and the calls of all of those who fight you but do not transgress limits for all the love of not transgressors listened God he demonstrates his love towards us in five Romans five and it would God to move his love toward us into while we were yet sinners Christ died for us what the Koran says fight in the calls of Allah those who fight you got a killed a murder they blow him up they destroy them but do not transgress limits for all the love of not transgressors one of double talk concept that all of the small of sinners is repeated 24 times in the Koran are you hearing the concept that all of those not loves sinners is repeated 24 times in their Bible but I Bible tells us that God loves us know we're going to look to the Bible Ephesians 525 to 28 and see what the Bible says about wires and compare it husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so old men to love their wives as their own bodies in the love of his wife love of him self that's the holy Bible this is going to be interesting sura four and 34 men are as protectors and mountaineers mountaineers of women because Allah has given the one more straight than the other and because they support them from their means therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husband's absence what Allah would have them guard as to those women on whose part you fear does loyalty and ill conduct admonish them first next refused to share their bids and the last beat them lightly Arabic text does not include the word lightly it was added by a later translation but the Arabic text you need to mellow tells you to beat them refuse to share their beds and last beat them but if they return to obedience to God against them means of annoyance for Allah is most high most great above you all right but go to first Beta three and seven likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered but see what the\par
