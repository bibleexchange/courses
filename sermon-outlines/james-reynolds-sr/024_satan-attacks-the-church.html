Matthew 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church; <b>and the gates of hell shall not

bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven.\\</p>

There are all kinds of interpretation. Some say Jsus beuilt hs church
on Peter. What a poor foundation to build on! Before it was over he
cursed swore I don&apos;t even know Him. The rock is nothing else than
the Christ. He is the rock. God wants to talk to us today.

The reasons behind satan&apos;s attack: HE HATES THE CHRIST. Yet now
because of his position, he cannot touch the Christ. Jesus said to
his disciples:</p>

He can&apos;t find a thing! Christ laid it all down, he gave itall.
Satan was defeated as far as Christ was concerned at the cross. The
devil may have thought and I have heard eveangelists saying hell was
having a great time that day because crhist was on the Christ bu
little did they realize that the cros was part of God&apos;s plan.
Christ defeated the devil at the cross and brought live and victory
for us.</p>

Satan Hates the Christ and he hates the Church. Why does satan hate
the church? Because Christ lives in the church! The Scripture says,
he turned his vengueance on Christ&apos;s spiritual body the church and
the only way he can affect the head, who is Christ is to attach the
church Christ&apos;s body. The church is a people and the building.

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">sAtian
is a spoiler, He knows that any attempt to produce the spiritual
life through carnal effort is an abomination to God. the devil wants
you to exercise the flesh which is an abomination to God. God hates
the flesh. You can&apos;t work the work of God through the flesh. So
satan knows that any attempt to produce the spiritual work thorugh
the flesh is an abomination so satan does everything in his power to
cause the flesh to so called, &quot;glorify God. &quot; We see all kinds
of it. They are on the radio and television what is so called &apos;the
church&apos; but in reality that church could go on without EVETR seeing
the spirit move. It is moving in the flesh and God&apos;s hates the
flesh.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Looking
at the church. Much of what is being produced is in the flesh. God
rejects that which is done in the flesh. Satin is a deceiver he has
always been a deceiver from the beginning when he deceived Eve. I t
is amazing traveling to the universities to and seeing young people
preparing themselves to carry &apos;garbage.&apos; They re so filled with
this evolution! I didn&apos;t come form a monkey and yo udidn&apos;t
either. WE came from Adam and Eve and had Adam and Eve not failed we
would be different. But now because of Christ, we ahv ea chance. Much
of what the devil has done has been done from the flesh.</p>

you. Christ of God, went to the Cross and laid down his physical
body, but on the day of Pentecost by the Spirit of God He came into
the Body His church. We are the meeting place of God. A steeple does
not make a church, the poepl eof God are the church and the church is

and now 7-8 never hear d a sound in her life. I reached out my hands
and put my fingers in her ears. &quot; I curse you deaf spirit, come
out. &quot; As my wife played softely on the orgain, the little girl
grabbed her mother terrified of hearing sound for the first time.

still opens the ears of the deaf and the eyes of the blind. All power
in heaven and earth has been given to Christ. Is Christ in you? Then
His power is in you. Your part is to act in faith on God&apos;s word.
God is true to his Word.</p>

remember rthe first tiem I prayed for a man after getting out of
Bible school. There was a blind man on the street singing and playing
his according. I thought I had what it takes, after 3 years of bible
school . I got out of my car and said in the name o fJeus yees be
open and nothing happened and a turned an ran back to my car and
left. But one day God laid his ahdns on me and gave me power to cast
out devil s, heal the blind, deaf and lame.</p>

devil is out to deceive and devour and estory. That is why we have r
eligious world that filled with entertainment instead of a religious
world filled with the power of God. God manifesting his power in the
lives of people and Christ is glorified, the sick healed, and the
devil defeated.</p>
