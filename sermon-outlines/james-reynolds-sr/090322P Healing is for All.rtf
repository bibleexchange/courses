grasp a hold of the promise of God but I had a big castle in those days that I didn't make the motion for if I got excited and I made motion toward the thing would just take it in and at times I'd have to back up and get a hold of the pulpit and whole loan let it come down to even get my breasts with that one night night after night we been seeing God work miracles one minute Tom delay that was

cast out the spirits with his word and this is what I want you to get and healed some of the sick healed all law of the sick payola all the sick Matthew 12 verse 15 but when Jesus knew it he wrote her a missile from defense and great multitudes followed him and he hailed some of them I took the time to go through the Scripture of Jesus ministry alone and I found that there are 10 places was says over and over and over the healed all the healed all he healed all he healed all you getting the message what he did is still doing Matthew 14 verse 14 Jesus windfalls and sorrow great multitude and was moved with compassion told them any healed their sick after 15 verse 30 great multitudes came on them having with them those that were laying by Dom Main and many others and cast them down at Jesus they and he healed them why is it that we have such a hot job trust him is a true can he be trusted as a 19 verse two great multitudes I have no idea what that might encompass great multitudes
