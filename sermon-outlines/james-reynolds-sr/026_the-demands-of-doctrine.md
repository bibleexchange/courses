# The Demands of Doctrine

A sermon outline of Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

TEXT: Romans 12:2

> Romans 12:2&mash; 1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

## 1. BESEECH

&quot;parakaleo&quot; [GREEK] &mdash; call near (&quot;I beg of you&quot;)

## 2. THEREFORE

Reaches back into the previous chapters. In Chapters 1 through 8, CONDEMNATION &ndash; JUSTIFICATION &ndash; SANCTIFICATION &ndash; GLORIFICATION (the Believers&apos;s exalted position). In Chapters 12-16, Paul exhorts the Believer to a life conformed to the exalted position.

- Doctrine shows the exalted position.
- Exhortation urges to live in this exalted position.

Doctrine also informs of the resources of grace that enables the Believer to obey the exhortation.
