<h1><span lang="en">Introduction: Course Description &amp; Overview</span></h1> 

<p class="summary">This course will be partly introduction and for many bible students partly a review of general information concerning the Bible. We will study peculiarities, origins, structure, meaning, and versions of the Bible.</p>


<h2><span lang="en">Course Description</span></h2> 
<p><span lang="en">As we are giving an overview of the Bible, we will mainly consider general facts concerning the Scriptures. Much more time and study will be given in other courses to dig into the wealth and depth of Scripture. Because there is not "one size fits all" when it comes to teaching, each Bible Student will find they already know some things and other things never heard. Even the things heard, maybe you have forgotten and this course will serve as a good review for you that are somewhat familiar with the Bible and will serve as an introduction for those of you who are not so familiar. No matter what your familiarity with Scripture, I am sure you can glean from information given in this study.</span></p>
