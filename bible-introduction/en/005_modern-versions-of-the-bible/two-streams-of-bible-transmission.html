<h1><span lang="en">Two Streams of Bible Transmission</span></h1>
	
<p>The modern versions differ in meaning from the King James Version.</p>
 
<p>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</p>
 
<blockquote>Jeremiah 23:36--And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</blockquote>
<p>The new modern versions pervert the truth of THE WORD OF GOD!</p>
 
<h2>There are only two historical streams of Bible Manuscripts.</h2>
 
<h3>The manuscripts that came out of Antioch which are the source of pure Bibles and the KJV.</h3>
 
<h3>The manuscripts that came out of Alexandria which are the source of corrupted Bibles and the new modern versions such as the NIV.</h3>
 
<h3>Ninety-five percent of the existing manuscript evidence can be traced to the pure texts from Antioch and is in agreement with the KJV.</h3>
 
<h2>The pure stream of Antioch.</h2>
 
<li>Antioch which was located in Syria is the first place the saints were referred to as Christians.</li>
 
<li>The texts from Antioch are known as the Syrian or Byzantine text.</li>
 
<li>These manuscripts from Antioch are those that were received by the majority of the Christian church and referred to as the Received Text.</li>
<h2>The polluted stream of Alexandria.</h2>
 
<li>Alexandria is located in Egypt. It was a seat of false worship and pagan philosophy.</li>
<li>These Alexandrian texts were the source of Wescott and Hort's corrupt Greek New Testament and Jerome's Latin Vulgate.</li>
<li>The manuscripts from Alexandria were produced by Origen, Clement of Alexandria and other infidels who did not believe in the Divine inspiration of Scripture.</li>
 
<p>THERE ARE ONLY TWO STREAMS OF BIBLES: THE DEVIL'S STREAM FROM ALEXANDRIA, AND GOD'S STREAM FROM ANTIOCH!</p>
