 <h1><span lang="en">Inspiration: Deceptive Views</span></h1> 
<h2>The Bible was produced by natural inspiration.</h2>
<p>This false view holds that theBible is the product of genius of a high order, but not supernatural, orDivine. This is the type of inspiration that Milton, Shakespeare, or Confucius show in their writings. No man of intelligence, however, can go from readingShakespeare to reading the Bible without feeling that the difference between the two is more than just by degree. A book can be inspiring without being inspired. The Bible far supersedes the books of men.</p>
<h2>God used levels of inspiration to give us the Bible.</h2>
<p>This false view claims thatGod used different levels of control at different times in the process of inspiration. This view advocates that sometimes God used Divine inspiration and at other times, God only offered suggestions or promptings of instruction.</p>
<p>This is totally contrary to true Biblical inspiration.</p>
<h2>God only gave the concepts or thoughts to the men who wrote the Bible.</h2>
<p>Those who promote this false view advocate that only concepts or thoughts were given by inspiration. This position leaves the wording of the text to the minds of men. This again is contrary to the correct meaning of true Biblical inspiration.</p>
<h2>Only portions of the Bible are inspired.</h2>
<p>This is a dangerous false doctrine referred to as partial inspiration. This position states that the Bible contains the Word of God, but is not all of Scripture is inspired. Who then decides what is and what is not inspired? Such a theory leaves man in awful and fatal uncertainty.</p>
<h2>What is the correct understanding of the inspiration of the Bible?</h2>
<p>"Verbal and plenary inspiration" is the correct view. (Will be explained in greater detail next)</p>
