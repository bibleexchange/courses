	<h1><span lang="en">Perfect Unity of the Bible: Redemption</span></h1>

<p>Redemption is the one main theme of the Bible.</p> 	
<h2>Redemption is the action of purchasing or paying in full.</h2> 	
<p>Man has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus has paid the price in full with His shed blood upon the cross for the salvation of man. Salvation through the blood of Jesus is the main theme of the Bible. This theme can be found from Genesis to Revelation. The first promise of redemption is given in Gen. 3:15.</p> 
<blockquote>Genesis 3:15--And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</blockquote> 	
<p>This is a prophecy that The Messiah who would come from the seed of the woman would one day bruise the head of the serpent. The theme continues to the Book of Revelation.</p> 	
<blockquote>Revelation 5:9--And they sung a new song,saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred,and tongue, and people, and nation;</blockquote> 	
<p>This Scripture refers to the resurrected Christ who redeemed us by his blood.</p> 	
<h2>Christ the Redeemer is the main Person of the Bible.</h2> 	
<p>The blood sacrifices in the OT were a type of Jesus who is the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world. "Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing." (Rev. 5:12) The OT looks forward by faith to the cross of Christ. The Gospels portray Christ and His death upon the cross. The NT looks back upon the finished work of the cross.</p> 	

<p>Christ manifests Himself in the OT at different times in various ways. Christ is portrayed in type and in prophecy as the coming Messiah.</p>
