<p>Bible critics attack the Bible and its contents. They claim there is no "historical Jesus", "reliable science affirms evolution and discounts creation", and "the Bible is just man's writings with no greater value than any other writing of men.</p>

<td>Look unto me.&hellip;&quot;When, for the first time, I received the gospel to my soul's salvation, I thought that I had never really heard it before, and I began to think that the preachers to whom I had listened had not truly preached it. But, on looking back, I am inclined to believe that I had heard the gospel fully preached many hundreds of times before, and that this was the difference,--that I then heard it as though I heard it not; and when I did hear it, the message may not have been any more clear in itself than it had been at former times, but the power of the Holy Spirit was present to open my ear, and to guide the message to my heart&quot;
<br>
The minister did not come that morning; he was snowed up, I suppose. At last, a very thin-looking man, a shoemaker, or tailor, or something of that sort, went up into the pulpit to preach. Now, it is well that preachers should be instructed; but this man was really stupid. He was obliged to stick to his text, for the simple reason that he had little else to say. 
<br>
''Look unto Me; I am sweatin' great drops of blood. Look unto Me; I am hangin' on the cross. Look unto Me; I am dead and buried. Look unto Me; I rise again. Look unto Me; I ascend to Heaven. Look unto Me; I am sittin' at the Father's right hand. O poor sinner, look unto Me! Look unto Me!''
<br>
Preaching one day, Spurgeon stepped to the pulpit and uttered one declaration: "
Behold the lamb of God 
Who takes away the sin of the world. 
(Jn 1:29)"
<br>
Satisfied with the acoustics, he left and went his way. Unknown to him, there were two men working in the rafters of that large auditorium, neither one a Christian. One of the men was pricked in his conscience by the verse Spurgeon quoted and became a believer later that day!

<td>Scottish Evangelist “worship without clarity, prayer without passion – these describe the times of Matheson’s childhood church experience.”

His mother died after a lengthy bout of consumption. Her dying words urged him to come to the savior, but still he resisted. One year later, he heard a message by Andrew Bonar on Psalm 11 that prompted him to re-consider the state of his soul. Shortly after he sought out a private meeting with an elderly pastor who spoke clearly and frankly to the state of his soul and his need for Christ.
<br>
“Young man, were I to say I am pleased with you, you would go down that stair in a happy frame, but you are yet far from the kingdom of God. You have never yet dealt with the justice of God. His justice in condemning you for breaking his law has never entered your thoughts. I see you are angry with God for not giving you salvation as the reward of works. But it must be grace from first to last.”

On one occasion he handed out some 25,000 tracts in less than a week. Over the course of the war he would personally distribute 52,000 tracts, 622 bibles, 1,477 New Testaments in English. He gave away thousands more in French. After the war, he went to Sardinia where he distributed 2,347 Italian Bibles, 1,230 New Testaments and over 3,400 other books and tracts. Eventually he started and edited a gospel newsletter entitled, The Herald of Mercy, which would reach a monthly circulation of 32,000.

 He once said, “I do not know if ten minutes of my life ever pass without thinking of the salvation of souls.”
