<h2>The Textus Receptus</h2> 
 
<h3>The Latin phrase TextusReceptus means Received Text and refers to the Greek New Testament manuscripts as they were commonly accepted by the early church. There is aclear traceable stream of the inspired text that was commonly accepted by the early church. God has preserved His Word through the ages.</h3> 
<h3>99 % of over 5,200 manuscripts of the Greek New Testament agree with the KJV andErasmus' Greek New Testament. Less then 1% (. 08%) agree with the odd omissions and changes in the TNIV, NIV, ESV, HCSB, NASB, NRSV, NLB, CEV, NCV, NAB, andNJB. (G. Riplinger, â€œIn Awe of the Wordâ€, 2003)</h3> 
<h3>The Textus Receptus are theMSS which were used by the Reformers. TheChristian church recognizes the twenty-seven books of the Textus Receptus as being the New Testament Canon and all other MSS that remain are so contradictory and mixed up they cannot be considered trustworthy.</h3> 
<h2>The first printed Greek New Testament</h2> 
<h3>Erasmus published a Greek New Testament text in 1516. Erasmus used every available manuscript to print his Greek New Testament. He even referred to theLatin Vulgate which he believed to be greatly flawed and corrupt to insure that he looked to every possible source. He looked to gain the pure original meaning of the Holy Spirit inspired text. Erasmus' Greek New Testament was a faithful consensus of the handwritten Greek texts which were used before the printing press. He used every manuscript available and compared them with great care to insure a correct Greek New Testament would be printed and circulated for the first time.</h3> 
<h3>Erasmus did not create the Textus Receptus ; he collected and printed. He collected the many handwritten copies of Scripture in circulation and comparing one with the other discerned a true consensus among the MSS from which he printed his N.</h3> 
<blockquote>We should not attribute to Erasmus the creation of a â€˜received text,' but only the transmission from a manuscript text, already commonly received, to a <b> printed</b> form, in which this text would continue to prevail for three centuries. â€ -- Kenneth W. Clark, Greek manuscript scholar (emphasis added)</blockquote> 
<h2>The Holy Ghost guarded and preserved the true New Testament Text.</h2> 
<h3>God's Word will not pass away.</h3> 
<blockquote>Mathew24:35--Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</blockquote> 
<blockquote> I Peter1:23--Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by theword of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</blockquote> 
 
<h3>The Holy Ghost taught the Christians which books were inspired.</h3> 
<blockquote>John 14:25-26--These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter,which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</blockquote> 
 
<h3>The Holy Spirit also led the Christians as to which books were not inspired. Some books were mistakenly regarded as canonical by some of the early Christians. For example, Ireneus considered â€œThe Shepherd of Hermesâ€ to be inspired. The Holy Spirit would eventually fix the canon in its current form of the 27 books of the New Testament.</h3> 
 
<h2>The Received Text of the NT was preserved by the leaders of the Church.</h2> 
 
<h3>In the very beginning of the church the Apostles instructed the church as to which books were inspired and which books were not. Remember John, the last of the original Apostles, was instrumental in instructing the Church and passing on the true inspired manuscripts of the New Testament until approximately AD 100.</h3> 
<h3>The early church leaders passed on the manuscripts of theNew Testament. Ignatius and Polycarp, leaders of the early church, were taught by the Apostle John giving them direct Apostolic instruction as to the knowledge of the inspired manuscripts. Polycarp taught Irenaeus who would continue as a leader in the church. The leaders instructed their successors in the truth of God's Word.</h3>
