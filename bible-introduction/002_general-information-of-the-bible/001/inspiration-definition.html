<h1><span lang="en">Inspiration: Definition</span></h1> 
<h2>What is meant by the term inspiration?</h2>
<h3>Webster's dictionary defines inspiration as: The act of breathing into anything.</h3>
<h3>The word inspiration is derived from the Latin in spiro meaning to â€˜breathe in'.</h3>
<h3>The word inspiration literally means God breathed</h3>
<blockquote>2 Timothy 3:16--All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.</blockquote>
<p>The phrase given by inspiration ofGod is translated from the one Greek word: theopneustos, which is derived from Theos - God and pneumaThe Holy Ghost. Pneumais derived from a word that means breath. The literal translation of this phrase (given by inspiration of God) is: <b>GOD BREATHED.</b></p>
<h2>The word inspiration is used in reference to the Divine origin of the Scriptures. The Bible was not just written by the mind and hand of man. The Holy Ghost breathed the Word into the men who were the human tools of the Divine Author.</h2>
<blockquote>II Peter 1:21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</blockquote>
<p>The prophecy in this context refers back to verse 20 which says: Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. These verses refer to the prophecy contained in the Scripture. The Scripture did not come to us by man. The men were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. This Divine action of God moving upon man to give them the Word is what is meant by inspiration.</p>
<p>Do we have an inspired Word of God?Yes, we do! But, simply answering yes to this question is certainly not enough. Every Believer must know beyond all doubt that their Bible is none other than the breath of the Almighty God. (2 Samuel 23:2; Acts 1:16; Mark12:36)</p>
<p>All Scripture is excellent inspirit, beautiful in language and grand in prophetic imagery, but its superiority is not in natural talents nor is Scripture words of mere human invention, but its excellence lies in the fact its <b>words are breathed byGod.</b></p>
