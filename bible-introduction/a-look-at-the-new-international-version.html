<h2>The first NIV was published in 1978.</h2>

 <h3>The NIV has been endorsed by the Catholics and is promoted as an accepted translation for Roman Catholics to use.</h3>
 
<h2>The NIV adds and takes away from the Word of God.</h2>
 <h3>God gives warning to those who take away the word of God.</h3>
<p>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</p>
 <h3>The NIV completely takes away 17 key verses and removes 64,576 words. That is approximately 8% of God's Word that is taken away.</h3>
 
<h2>The new 2011 NIV Edition is moving toward a gender neutral version.</h2>
 
<h3>This edition has been rejected by several denominations because of the gender inclusive wording.</h3>
 
<h3>There have been some corrections made in some verses while changes have been made in others.</h3>
 
<h3>This is a move towards a homosexual gender neutral version.</h3>
