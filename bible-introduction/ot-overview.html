<p><span lang="en">In the front of most Bibles is an index of all sixty-six books. From this index we can find where to turn to find each book. This is an invaluable aid to the novice but should not be used as a crutch for the serious Bible student. People spend much time developing their craft and honing their skills. The Christian ought to diligently and daily improve their knowledge of the Scriptures. One way we can increase our knowledge of the Bible is to memorize the names of the Books of the Bible in their order.</span></p>
