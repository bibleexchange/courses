<h1>New Testament Testimony of the Old Testament Canon</h1> 
<h2>Jesus confirmed the authority of the Old Testament Canon.</h2> 
<h3>Jesus referred to the three divisions of the OT Canon: the Law, theProphets, and the Writings.</h3> 
<blockquote>Luke 24:44--â€¦all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses ,and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me.</blockquote> 
<h3>It was common knowledge at the time of Christ that the OT was divided into these three sections. By mentioning these sections, Jesus was confirming the authority of the OT Canon as divided. The Jews of Jesus day would have understood that He was referring to the complete Canon (of the Old Testament) in this statement:</h3> 
<h4>Jesus questioned the Jews: Did not Moses give you the Law? --John7:19</h4> 
<h4>Jesus mentions the Law and the prophets. -Mt. 5:17; 22:40.</h4> 
<h4> Psalms generally refer to the section more commonly called The Writings.</h4> 
<h3>Jesus read from the book of Isaiah. Lk. 4:17-21. Jesus referred to this passage as Scripture and thus confirmed the authority and inspiration of the text.</h3> 
<h3>Jesus would not have quoted the OT books if they were not inspired.</h3> 
<h2>TheNew Testament confirms the authority of the Old Testament.</h2> 
<h3>There are about 263 direct quotations from the OT in the NT. The use of these quotes in the NT indicates that they were considered to be theAuthoritative Word of God.</h3> 
 
<h3>Paul referred to the OT writings as Scripture. Rom. 10:11; 11:2;Gal. 3:8</h3>
