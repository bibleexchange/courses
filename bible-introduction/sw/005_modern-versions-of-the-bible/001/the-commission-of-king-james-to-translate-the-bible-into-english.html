	<h1><span lang="en">The Commission of King James to Translate the Bible into English</span></h1>
	<h2>The newly crowned King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in 1604.</h2>

<h3>The conference consisted of church leaders gathered to address problems in the church.</h3>

<h3>The Puritan president of Corpus Christi College, John Reynolds made a motion for a new translation of the Bible.</h3>

<h3>A plan was formed to search out the best learned men to work on this translation.</h3>

<h2>The resolution of King James:</h2>
<blockquote>That a translation be made of the whole Bible, as consonant as can be to the original Hebrew and Greek; and this to be set out and printed, without any marginal notes, and only to be used in all churches of England in time of divine service.</blockquote>
<h3>A resolve was made to keep the translation to the meaning of the original Hebrew and Greek.</h3>

<h3>There were to be no marginal notes included in this translation.</h3>

<h3>This was to be the standard Bible for the Church of England used in all times of Divine service.</h3>

<h2>Translators were appointed by King James to complete the work.</h2>

<h3>King James sought out the best qualified men. These men were the best Biblical scholars and language experts of their day. Many of them spoke several languages fluently.</h3>

<h3>Strict guidelines were set for the process of translation.</h3>

<h3>The King James Version was published in 1611.</h3>
