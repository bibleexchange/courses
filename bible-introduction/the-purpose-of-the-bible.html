<h1><span lang="en">The Purpose of the Bible</span></h1>
<h2><span lang="en">The Bible was written that men might believe, understand, know, love, and follow Christ.</span></h2> 
<h3><span lang="en">That men might believe that Jesus is the Christ. The main theme of the Bible is redemption through Jesus Christ. The word christ means "the anointed one", and refers to the Messiah. Men need to believe that Jesus is the Savior. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes. (Rom. 1:16)</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 20:31--But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">That men might understand who Christ is. Jesus reveals Himself through His Word. The Bible tells us that the Scriptures testify of Jesus. Men need to understand through the Word that Jesus is the messiah; He is the savior and the only source of Salvation.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 5:39--Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">That men might know Christ. The Bible helps men to know Christ. The songwriter stated, "I'm glad I know who Jesus is!" Paul desired to know Christ in a greater way. Christians can know who Jesus is, and also know Him in a personal way sharing fellowship with Him.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 17:3--And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">That men might love Christ. According to the Scripture, in order for a man to love Christ he must keep the Words of Christ which are contained in the Bible. We need to study the Bible so that we can obey the Word of God and love Jesus.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 14:23--…a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him…</span></blockquote> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">I John 2:5--But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected…</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">That men might follow Christ. The word Christian means "one who follows Christ." The Bible was written that men might follow Christ.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 10:27--My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</span></blockquote> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 12:26--If any man serve me, let him follow me…</span></blockquote> 
<h2><span lang="en">The Bible reveals the purpose and plan of God.</span></h2> 
<h3><span lang="en">Concerning Salvation. The Bible explains that salvation is received through faith in Jesus and reveals man's need of salvation.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 3:16--For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">Concerning the Church. The plan of God for His Church is that she should be glorious, holy and without blemish. There is much instruction given to the Church in the Bible.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">Ephesians 5:27--That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">Concerning the last days. The Bible reveals God's plan for the last days. We understand from the Bible that we are living in the last days and God gave us warning of what would come to pass in these last days.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Timothy 3:1--This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</span></blockquote> 
<h2><span lang="en">The Bible is God's written Word to man.</span></h2> 
<h3><span lang="en">1. It is a sure Word of prophecy. The Bible is the infallible Word of God. It does not merely contain God's Word, but is God's Word. The Bible is a sure word in a dark hour.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Peter 1:19-21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; where unto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">It is a solid foundation. (I Cor. 3:11) The Word of God is a solid foundation of our faith. Jesus is the Rock of our salvation. Jesus is the Word that became flesh. When everything else is sinking; the Word of God will not fail.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Corinthian 3:11--For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span></blockquote> 
<h3><span lang="en">It is the infallible, inspired Word of God. The word inspiration means "God breathed." There is life in the Word which is the very breath of God. God's Word is without error or contradiction.</span></h3> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Timothy 3:16--All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</span></blockquote> 
<h2><span lang="en">The Bible is the final authority.</span></h2> 
<h3><span lang="en">1. Preaching and teaching must be founded upon God's Word. (II Tim. 4:2) Paul told Timothy to preach the Word. The Word is the foundation for our faith. (Rom. 10:17) What we believe and preach must be in harmony with the Bible.</span></h3> 
<h3><span lang="en">Every question must be settled with the Word of God. The Bible must be the absolute authority in every area of question in the lives of men. The authority of the Word of God must never be questioned by the saint of God. This is why we need to know beyond all doubt that we have the Word of God today.</span></h3>
