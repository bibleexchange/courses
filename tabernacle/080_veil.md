# Lesson #8 The Veil, Exodus 26:31-33

> Exodus 26:31-37 &mdash; 31 ¶ And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made: 32 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of silver. 33 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy. 34 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place. 35 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side. 36 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework. 37 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

## Introduction

### A. Veil on Woman

The use of the veil on woman is much more general in use in modern times than in ancient times. In ancient times the veil was adopted only in exceptional cases.

- It was used by betrothed maidens in the presence of their future husbands, especially at the time of the wedding:

> Ruth 3:15 &mdash; Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.
<!-- -->
> Song of Solomon 5:7 &mdash; The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
<!-- -->
> Genesis 24:65 &mdash; For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

- Also used by women of loose character for purposes of concealment as in Tamar in her deception of Judah in Genesis 38:14.

- Among the Jews of the New Testament age it appears (not absolutely a fact) to have been customary for the women to cover their heads (not necessarily their faces) when engaged in public worship. (1 Corinthians 11:2-16)
 
### B. Moses Veiled

> Exodus 33:18 &mdash; And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

Moses prayed "She me Thy glory" and the Lord invited Moses to stand near Him. (This was a hazard, last time in chapter 32 the people sinned when Moses went up into the mount.)

> Ex 34:28-35 &mdash; And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. 29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

- The radiance in Moses ... Original condition at creation? Adam and Eve wailed with God, unaware of their nakedness

- The Glory of God's Law 

> 2 Cor 3:7 &mdash; But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: [was glorious = came into being with glory]

In veiling himself missed became a type and figure of his own dispensation.

- Moses Veiled

> 2 Corinthians 3:13 &mash; And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:

Not just to hide the brightness from which they shrank (As in Exodus 34:33, Moses veils himself AFTER he speaks the Word of God.), but so they wouldn't see the glory fade Paul wrote that Moses put the veil over his face that they might not see the end, the fading away of that transitory glory. 

For the Jew, it was as though it were permanent and unfading.

The end .... Romans 10:4; 1Timothy 1:5 -- aim or intention, it's abolished : brought to nought

No attempt should be made to conceal the gospel anymore! No disguise 2 Cor 2:17 

John 16:33-34 the holy ghost discloses not conceals

Hebrews 6:19 Hebrews 10:20

The children of Israel could not bear to look on the glory, even though it was perishing and evanescent. The English rendering, "which glory was to be done away," ( in the act of passing away)

## The Antitype of the Veil

The ultimate fulfillment of the type of the Veil of the Tabernacle is the Man Christ Jesus. Hebrews 10 speaks of the Veil as the "His flesh". The Veil is a clearly established type in Scripture.

> Hebrews 10:19,20 &mdash; Heb 10:19 ¶ Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

> Mark 15:38 &mdash; And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

- Willingly ignorant that the veil has already been torn away.

2 Cor 3:15 ,16 &mdash; But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. 16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.

## I. The Materials for the Curtains of the Veil

Blue, purple, and scarlet on  backdrop of fine twined linen of cunning work with cherubim's. The humanity of Jesus in His perfection was the "cunning work" of God. He was God's great masterpiece. The cherubim speak to us of glorified humanity: humanity in its highest state of perfection. (Some regard the cherubim as a high order of angelic beings.)

## II. Three-fold Support of the Veil

(Pillars, Hooks, Sockets)

> Exodus 26:32 &mdash; And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of silver.

### A. Pillars

4 pillars in number. There are 4 records given us a divenly inspired revelation of Christ's life, death, resurrection and ascension in the gospels. 

The 4 pillars may also illustrate the truth found in 1 Corinthians 1:30

> 1 Corinthians 1:30 &mdash; But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

Pillars made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. The person of Christ in human and Divine natures.

### B. Hooks of Gold

Divine righteousness.

### C. Sockets of Silver

These are a figure of redemption. The redemptive work of Christ is the foundation for all.
