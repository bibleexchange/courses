# Lesson #11 Altar of Burnt Offering, Exodus 27:1-8

## Introduction

> Exodus 27:1-8 &mdash; And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits. 2 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. 3 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basins, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. 4 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof. 5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar. 6 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass. 7 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it. 8 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was showed thee in the mount, so shall they make it.

(Exodus 38:1-7; Leviticus 17:11; Hebrews 9:22)

The Brazen Altar was the foundation of the whole worship of Israel. There was no approach to God and no worship accepted by by way of the Altar of the blood Atonement. The Brazen Altar was the first object seen upon entering the Outer Court of the Tabernacle. It is a remarkable type of Jesus Christ in His person and His sacrificial work.

## Names Given to the Altar

1. The Brazen Altar, Exodus 38:30
2. "The Altar" by way of pre-eminance, Exodus 29:12
3. Altar of Burnt Offering, Exodus 35:16

## Materials Used in the Construction of the Altar

Both Shittim Wood and Brass (explained later) were used in constructing the Brazen Altar. (Exodus 27:1,2)

1. Shittim Wood

Shittim or Acacia was a desert growth. This is a type of the flesh and humanity.

> Isaiah 53:2 &mdash; For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. 

It was necessary that Christ should become incarnate.

> Hebrews 10:5,10 &mdash; Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: 10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 

2. Brass/Bronze

- Brass

> Deuteronomy 8:7-9 &mdash; For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; 8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 9 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

> Job 28:1,2 &mdash; Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. 

When the children of Israel were asked to give in the building of the Tabernacle, they gave from what they had received from the spoils given them by the Egyptians, and they had given so much that they were commanded to stop giving. Out of the abundance of what they gave was Bronze. A total of 6,700 lbs. of bronze was given.

- BRASS (or is it BRONZE?) IN THE BIBLE

In ancient Israel there was no such metal known as brass. During Bible times bronze was an alloy of copper and tin and was used to an enormous extent.

AT THE PRESENT: The term BRASS is applied to an alloy having copper (55%-90%) and zinc (10%-45%) as its essential components. Modern Bronze is an alloy of copper, tin, zinc, phosphorus, and sometimes small amounts of other elements. Bronzes are harder than brasses.

IN THE KING JAMES VERSION:  The term translated BRASS could be more accurately translated BRONZE, since the alloy used was copper and tin (Ex 27:4). In some Scriptures just copper is meant (as in Deut 8:9 where a mineral not an alloy is intended). The one Hebrew word for copper and bronze was rendered brass by the King James translators because at that time the word BRONZE had not yet been introduced into the English language. BRASS appears in the English Bible, referring to either pure copper or to an alloy of copper and tin.

- Judgment

The main use for the 6,700 lbs. of bronze was in the tabernacle furniture within the outer court, in the places where exceptional strength and heat resistance was important. Bronze has a melting point of 1,985 degrees. Since the altar was a place where intense heat was present it was overlaid with bronze. 

Bronze represents Divine judgment. When Moses raised the bronze serpent (Numbers 21:9) it spoke of the power of the serpent being judged through the raising of the Son of God (John 3:14).

- Firm and Enduring

"Bronze," is used in Scripture as the symbol of what is firm, stubborn, strong and enduring, thus we see "gates of bronze" (Ps 107:16), "hoofs of bronze" (Mic 4:13), etc. Is is mentioned in reference to people and cities.

Bronze typifies the divine character of Christ who took upon Himself the fire of God's wrath, holiness and justice by becoming a sin offering.

> 2 Cor 5:21 &mdash; For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

> Matthew 27:46 &mdash; And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 

## Dimensions of the Altar

The Altar of Burnt Offering was seven and a half feet in length and breadth and four and a half feet in height. It was twice the length and height of the Ark of the Covenant. In fact, it had capacity enough to contain all the other vessels of the sanctuary. This is rich in meaning: within one great sacrifice on the cross every blessing is comprehended.

> Romans 8:32 &mdash; He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? 

## Horns of the Altar

- Might

In Exodus 27:2, the horns are mentioned which are symbol of prevailing might and strength. 

- The Gospels Influence

These horns pointed in every direction, signifying and presenting salvation to the four corners of the earth (north, south, east, west).

> Mark 16:15 &mdash; And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

- For Binding the Sacrifice

Sacrifices were bound to the altar before slain, but it was not nails but love that held Christ on the cross!

> Psalm 118:27 &mdash; God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar

> John 10:18 &mdash; No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

- Refuge for the Sincere

> 1 Kings 1:50 &mdash; And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 

> 1 Kings 2:28 &mdash; Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

Typical of the poor sinner, who flees for refuge to lay hold of the Gospel. 

Also we find a solemn lesson in Exodus 21:14.

> Exodus 21:14 &mdash; But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.

For the presumptous sinner and hyprocrite, the atonement of Jesus provides no shelter while he so continues.

## Vessels of the Altar

> Exodus 27:3 &mdash; And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basins, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.

All of the vessels of the altar were made of Brass &mdash; a type of judgment.

- The **Pans** to receive the ashes
- The **Shovels** to remove the fire from the Brazen Altar to censers.
- The **Basins** to Receive the Blood from the sacrifice offered.
- The **Flesh Hooks** for placing the pieces of the offering in order on the altar and arranging them so as to be consumed.
- The **Censers**  or **Fire Pans** were used to hold the burning coals from the Altar of the Burnt Offering to be carried to the Altar of Incense in the Holy Place.

## Grate of the Altar

> Exodus 27:4,5 &mdash; 4 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof. 5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar. 

The Brazen Altar was hollow, but on the inside half way from the top was a grating or network of Brass upon which the sacrifices were laid. The grating was the exact height of the Mercy Seat. There can be no mercy ministered to us apart from the blood sacrifice. The vilest sinner can obtain mercy through the blood. Even The moralist, if they reject the blood, can claim no mercy.

## Fire of the Altar

- The fire on the Altar was first kindled by God.

> Leviticus 9:24 &mdash; 

- Strange Fire is a Counterfeit fire that emanates from some other source than God. Divine Fire consumes all such other fires!

Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire in Leviticus 10:1,2.

- It was never to go out as a type of Christ our continual sacrifice.

> Leviticus 6:12,13 &mdash; 

- Fire is a symbol of God's Holiness. 

Fire symbolical of God's Holiness is expressed in 3 ways:

1. APPROVAL - Exodus 3:3; Lev. 9:24; 1 Kings 18:38; Acts 2:3
2. PURIFICATION - Mal. 3:2,3; Matthew 3:11,12
3. CONDEMNATION - Genesis 19:24
