1. The Garden of Eden - Genesis 3:8 "in the cool of the day; the presence of the Lord"
2. **Moses' Tabernacle** - Exodus 25:8,9 "portable; temporary dwelling place"
3. **Solomon's Temple** - 1 Kings 8:1-13 "a more permanent dwelling; destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar"
4. **Zurubbabel's Temple** - Ezra 3:11-13 "poor and insignificant in comparison with Solomon's temple; shorter than that of Solomon’s Temple by about 90 feet; destroyed/remodelled by Herod"
5. **Herod's Temple** - Matthew 24:1,2 "enlaring and beutifying of Zurrabbabel's temple begain in 19 BC.; The construction began with the Holy Place, then was the portion set aside for the altar of burnt offering and the officiating priests. Next to it was the court for the Israelites who came to watch the service. By the side of that was the court of the women, and behind it was the court of the Gentiles with the royal porticos (porches) of Solomon. All around the Temple Mount beautiful marble porticos were constructed. A wall surrounded the whole area and a small portion of it remains to this day, known as "The Wailing Wall; destruction foretold by Jesus; destroyed by Titus in 70 A.D."
6. **God with Us** - 1 Corinthians 6:19; John 11:25-26 "Jesus was offered a sacrfice for all on the cross that we might know life eternal"
