## Fellowship with God: Worship and Service

- In the study of the tabernacle we will find keys to our fellowship with God. God desires to dwell in the midst of His people. God gives His people a desire for his presence. (e.g., King David desired to build God a house. David also desired a constant habitation in God's house. ) That desire must be tended to.
- Key to Our Worship and Service to God, every detail of the tabernacle portrays God’s act of Redemption.
- The Holiness of God, The Sinfulness of Man, the reconciliation through Jesus Christ and the Salvation of the lost are all portrayed in the main divisions of the tabernacle.

> 1 John 1:3&mdash;That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
<!-- -->

## Moses' Tabernacle is One Place in a Series of God's Dwelling Places

1. The Garden of Eden - Genesis 3:8 "in the cool of the day; the presence of the Lord"
2. **Moses' Tabernacle** - Exodus 25:8,9 "portable; temporary dwelling place" (actively used for over 400 years!)
3. **Solomon's Temple** - 1 Kings 8:1-13 "a more permanent dwelling; destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar"
4. **Zurubbabel's Temple** - Ezra 3:11-13 "poor and insignificant in comparison with Solomon's temple; shorter than that of Solomon’s Temple by about 90 feet; destroyed/remodelled by Herod"
5. **Herod's Temple** - Matthew 24:1,2 "enlaring and beutifying of Zurrabbabel's temple begain in 19 BC.; The simplicity and plainness of Zerubbabel's temple inspired Herod to take on the project so as to make a name for himself. The construction began with the Holy Place, then was the portion set aside for the altar of burnt offering and the officiating priests. Next to it was the court for the Israelites who came to watch the service. By the side of that was the court of the women, and behind it was the court of the Gentiles with the royal porticos (porches) of Solomon. All around the Temple Mount beautiful marble porticos were constructed. A wall surrounded the whole area and a small portion of it remains to this day, known as "The Wailing Wall; destruction foretold by Jesus; destroyed by Titus in 70 A.D."
6. **God with Us** - 1 Corinthians 6:19; John 11:25-26 "Jesus was offered a sacrfice for all on the cross that we might know life eternal"

## The Tabernacle and the Gospel of Jesus Christ

The paramount message of the tabernacle is the Mediator between God and man &mdash; the Lord Jesus Christ. Through Jesus Christ man's relationship and fellowship with God as God intended is restored. What was lost between man and God in the Lord is restored through the ministry of Jesus Christ.

The Gospel message is not confined to the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but can be found in profound types throughout the Old Testament, as well. The Gospel message is particularly represented in the details and activities involving the tabernacle. It all points as a map to the greatest treasure: the Lord Jesus Christ!
