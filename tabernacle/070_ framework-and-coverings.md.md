# Lesson #7 Coverings and Framework, Exodus 26:1-30

## Introduction

The solid framework of the Tabernacle was composed of 48 boards &mdash; north: 20, south:20, west: 8. The boards were held together by 5 bars, 4 of which were slipped through rings on the outside and one middle bar which ran through the center of each board. The boards were made of shittim/acacia wood, overlaid with gold, which had for their foundation sockets of silver. The Tabernacle had 3 outer coverings (Badger, Ram and Goat) and beautiful curtains within for both the Holy Place and Most Holy Place.

## I. Coverings of the Tabernacle, vs. 1-14

Let's begin by looking at the outside coverings and continue to the inner coverings.

### A. The Tabernacle's Exterior had 3 Outer Coverings, 7-14

The sandstorms and winds of the desert were kept on the outside of the Holy and Most Holy by the exterior coverings of the tabernacle.

1. Badger Skin, vs. 14
 
- A Protective Covering: The outermost and visible covering was the badger skin. If afforded protection to all within. 
- Durable Covering for Feet: The badger skin is mentioned (apart from the Tabernacle) in Ezekiel 16:10. In Ezekiel 16, the badger skin is used for sandals.
- Covering of Tabernacle Articles During Transport: The badger skin was also used to cover the various articles of the Tabernacle when on the march. 
- It speaks of Christ and His protection.

> Isaiah 32:2 &mdash; And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

- Illustrative of the natural man's view of Christ. 

The badger skin was bleached with the sun and wind and spoke of severity and roughness. The natural man sees Christ only as the carpenter's son. How few have anointed eyes to penetrate and appreciate the mysteries and glories of His character. Man, outside of Christ, sees no beauty in Him. He is blinded and only as the Spirit reveals Christ does man desire Him.

> Isaiah 53:2,3 &mdash;

<!-- -->

> Psalm 22:6 &mdash; 

Jesus was not popular with the world and even the multitude that followed Him did so for "the loaves and fishes", but when He would take them into the deeper spiritual lessons they forsook Him and walked no longer with Him. After all His compassionate ministry their answer was, "Crucify Him, Crucify Him!". The world saw Him in the day of His humiliation and still see Him today, as it were, wrapped in badger skin. No one knew what the Tabernacle was like from the outside view. So with the true Tabernacle, Jesus Christ. We must be in Him to know Him.

2. Ram Skin, vs. 14

> 14 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins. 

The covering or ram's skin was dyed red. This symbolizes Christ as our Atonement. The badger skin reminds of the humiliation of Christ and the ram skin speaks of the shed blood of Christ. 

> Isaiah 63:1,2 &mdash;

<!-- -->

> Philippians 2:8 &mdash;

Everywhere there was Ram skin there Badger Skin. Wherever the blood extends, the Omnipotence is there to protect. This is illustrated when God substituted the ram to be offered in place of Isaac.

3. Goat Hair, vs. 7-13

> 7 ¶ And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make. 8 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure. 9 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle. 10 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 11 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. 12 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle. 13 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.

In Old Testament worship, the goat was principally used in connection with the the sin offering (Lev. 16). The sins of the congregation weer laid upon the head of the scape goat, and he was sent away into the wilderness bearing sin away. Jesus suffered without the camp with our sin laid upon Him that we might be made righteous.

> 2 Corinthians 5:21 &mdash; 

The goat's hair speaks of Christ our righteousness. The junction (Ex. 26:10-11) with loops of blue and taches of brass: blue&mdash;heaven; brass&mdash;Divine judgment. Heaven's grace and meeting man's need through Divine judgment.

### B. The Tabernacle's Interior Was Covered with Beautiful Curtains, vs. 1-6

> Ex 26:1 ¶ Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them. 2 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure. 3 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another. 4 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. 5 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another. 6 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle.

The beautiful curtains within formed the ceiling for both the Holy Place and the Most Most Holy Place. Contrast the roughness of the badger skin with the curtains of the fine-twine linen

## II. Framework of the Tabernacle, vs. 15-30

> 15 ¶ And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up. 16 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board. 17 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 18 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward. 19 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. 20 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards: 21 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 22 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards. 3 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 24 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners. 25 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 26 And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 27 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward. 28 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end. 29 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold. 30 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.
