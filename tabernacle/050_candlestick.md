# Lesson #5 Candlestick, Exodus 25:31-40

> Exodus 25:31-40 &mdash; 31 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same. 32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side: 33 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick. 34 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers. 35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick. 36 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold. 37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. 38 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. 39 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. 40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount.

## Introduction

The candlestick is the second most costly (the Ark of the Covenant is first) and most elaborately constructed of all the sacred vessels of the Tabernacle. It was made out of a talent of pure gold beaten with hammers until it assumed its proper shape. The seven bowls on the tops of the branches were supplied with pure oil which burned continually.

## The Gold

Made with a talent of gold, the Candlestick weighed about 75-110 lbs. and would be worth $1.5 - $2.1 million in gold today.

Gold is a type for Divinity.

## Christ, The True Light


John 8:12; 9:5; John 1:9; 2 Corinthians 4:6

## The Church, (SEE NOTES)

## The Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit is seen in both oil and the fire.

- oil Luke 4:18; hebrews 1:9; Isaiah 61:3; Psalm 92:10; Psalm 104:15; Matthew 25:3-10
- fire John 15:26; (Spirit of Truth; Illumination) Acts 2:3

## The Word

(see notes)

## The Light

### A. Only in God is there light. 

Only gold and oil were used in the making of the candlestick. 

### B. There was no natural light in the Holy place. 

We cannot see or understand God by natural means. God alone can illuminate our mind and bring revelation of Himself.

> Proverbs 3:5
> 1 Corinthians 2:14

### C. The High Priest kept the candlestick supplied with oil continually. 

With snuff dishes he removed the burnt matter that the light should shine undimmed. Christ is our Great High Priest who exercises His High Priestly care over His Church. He gives the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He walks in the midst of His Church to replenish with oil, and trim the wicks. The light was always to burn.

### D. The Wicks Speak of Humanity

The wicks set forth our humanity which must be submerged in the oil of the Holy Ghost. Always remember that the precious Hand that is trimming the wick is "nail scarred"! The tongs and snuff dishes were of gold aslo, for the whole matter was a direct result of Divine operation.
