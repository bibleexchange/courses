# Bible Bowl Rules

Players compete over their knowledge of a particular section of Scripture in a competitive game. Two prizes will be awarded: 1) first award will be for the most verses quoted from memory and 2) second for the most points at the end of the quiz.

## Order

This Bible Bowl is divided into 5 parts:

### 1. Scripture Memory

Prize #1 will be awarded to the player who quoted the most verses successfully. A Consolation prize will be awarded for all players who quoted a minimum number of verses.
