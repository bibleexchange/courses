Prisca (Priscilla) - female - wife of Aquila - was involved with Paul in ministry and with husband in
teaching ministry - church meets in her home - of six times the two are mentioned, Priscilla is
mentioned 3 times first. Acts 18:2,18,26; Romans 16:3, 1 Corinthians 16:19; 2 Timothy 4:19

> Acts 18:18&mdash;And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him **Priscilla** and **Aquila**; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

Achaia -- Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia 

> Romans 15:26 &mdash; For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem

Paul ministered in Achaia in Acts 18; Paul mentions Achai in Acts 19:21 (Macedonia and Achaia, (writes Romans from Corinth) then Jerusalem, then Rome) and their offering for the saints at Jerusalem.

"First Fruits of Achaia" (compare Romans 16:5 and 1 Corinthians 16:15)

(Acts 18, Paul's 3rd Missionary Journey) 

> 1 Corinthians 16:15 &mdash; I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

"Macedonia and Achaia"

It was then one of the two provinces (Macedonia being the other) into which Rome divided Greece when it fell under their dominion.

- male - greetings to an unknown number of those who are in Aristobulus’ household.
Note that Aristobulus is not greeted. Does this mean that he is not a Christian? He is probably not
greeted because he is dead. Possible that he was the grandson of Herod the Great - the brother of
Agrippa I. He may have lived in Rome as a private person and was a friend of the Emperor
Claudius. He may have died in 45 or 48 A.D. A more remote possibility is that he is the son of
Herod of Chalcis and ruler of Armenia Minor - who may or may not have been a part of this
household in Rome. It is possible that this household, after the death of Aristobulus, had
connections with the imperial household of Rome and was still known by his name.
