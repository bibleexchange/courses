			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Heb. 5:11 "dull of hearing"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 6:9-12 Spiritual sluggishness– vs. 12 "slothful". They are warned of the subtle dangers of being sluggish. Theyare strong in love, obedience and hope, but warns them not to be inconsistentas others. Spiritual alertness and obeying the truth are the only safeprevention against sluggishness. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">6:13-20 The divine promise and thedivine oath. While urging the believers to remain steadfast, unmovable from thetruth, but always abounding in the work of God, Paul reminds them of theexample with Abraham. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">God made promise under oath, and keptthe promise though Abraham waited long in faith and patience.The two immutablethings, God's Word and oath based on His character of truthfulness andfaithfulness was worked out first in Abraham's heart, then he received thefulfillment of the promise. We must consistently partake of the Nature of Godbefore we can have the fulfillment of the promises.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 10:36; 3:6,14; 4:1,2,11;&nbsp;5:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">To have eternal life – you must beborn of His nature</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">To have Spirit-filled life – youmust be baptized of His Spirit</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">To have the fullness of life – youmust be perfected with His nature</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">It takes faith in the promise tohelp you partake of the Divine Nature of God and with His Nature you canreceive the fullness of His promises.There are promises to every believer andthen there are promises only for the overcomer.
