<h1>First Love -10:32-39</h1>
<blockquote>Heb 10:32, &quot;ye endured a great fight of afflictions&quot; 
33 &quot;ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions&quot; &quot;ye became companions of them that were so used&quot;
34 &quot;ye had compassion of me&quot; 	&quot;knowing in yourselves&quot;
35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</blockquote>
<p>They endured a great fight of afflictions because after they were illuminated, they professed their faith to those that were yet in darkness and ignorance; weighted down and coming short of what God has provided for them.</p>
<p>They endured fearful Persecutions because they professed their faith in Christ.</p>
<p>They professed their faith in Christ with companions</p>
<p>They professed their faith in Christ with compassion</p>
<p>They professed their faith in Christ with confidence $quot;knowing in yourselves$quot;.</p>
