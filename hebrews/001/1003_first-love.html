<h1>First Love -10:32-39</h1>
<blockquote>Heb 10:32, “ye endured a great fight of afflictions” 
33 “ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions” “ye became companions of them that were so used”
34 “ye had compassion of me” 	“knowing in yourselves”
35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</blockquote>
<p>They endured a great fight of afflictions because after they were illuminated, they professed their faith to those that were yet in darkness and ignorance; weighted down and coming short of  what God has provided for them.</p>
<p>They endured fearful Persecutions because they professed their faith in Christ.</p>
<p>They professed their faith in Christ with companions</p>
<p>They professed their faith in Christ with compassion</p>
<p>They professed their faith in Christ with confidence $quot;knowing in yourselves$quot;.</p>
