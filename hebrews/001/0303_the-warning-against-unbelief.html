<h1>The Warning against Unbelief (3:12-19)</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The hardness of heart in thewilderness generation is compared with those who reject the Gospel. The messageis given in a form of warning "Take Heed" If you don't prevent unbelief fromgetting in, unbelief will prevent you from getting in. The attention has beenon yesterday - Past Israel</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 3:7 The Holy Spirit says"Today" Tomorrow is only a Promise 4:6,7</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> vs. 13 daily promise to thebeliever and obedient (4:9-10-36)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> vs. 15 "If ye will hear"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> vs. 16 "When they heard"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "Provoked" v.16 "Sinned"&nbsp;v. 17 Believed not" v.18</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> vs. 19  No faith - No entrance</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Hebrews 3:10-13,17-19</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The contrast between Heb. 3 and 4is:</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">·        3:19 "They could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">·        4:3,12-16 Could enter by faith</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">(Compare Heb. 3-4 with Rom.7-8)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">*Wilderness Experiences*</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The power of the Egyptians on theIsraelites had been broken by a series of marvelous miracles. Ex. 5-12</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Israel stood victorious on theshores of the Red Sea. Ex. 14:1-2</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Then faced their first test afterleaving Egypt. Ex. 14:10</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Ex. 14:15 "Go Forward" was theword from God</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Ex. 14:13 "Stand still" was theword of man</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Ex. 14:31 Israel on the other shoreof the Red Sea saw the great work of God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">They watched long lines of corpsescome up to the waters edge. This should have been a sign to Israel that youcan't fight God. Many men of Israel at this time now can focus on their dreamsof future possessions in the Promise Land.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The subtle devices of unbeliefdestroyed them. Only two, Joshua and Caleb made their dreams come true. One byone the bodies that fell in the wilderness were buried in the sand. It took 40years for all of them to die. A constant murmuring and moaning of grief washeard in their camps. Sin grieves God 3:10-11,19</p>
			<h1>A.    TheConditions in the Wilderness</h1>
			<h2>1     Unrest - tents constantly being struck by winds. Have you evertried to sleep in a tent? How about live in one? Contending with the weatherconstantly. Pitched many times in the same spot. Could not enter into God'srest because of unbelief.</h2>
			<h2>2     Aimlessness - They wandered in a desert place.They found no cityof habitation.</h2>
			<h2>3     Unsatisfied longings - Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted (3:10)always erring in their hearts</h2>
			<h2>4     Sand storms - When the hot wind is blowing the light powdery dustand sand, it always finds its way into the eyes, nose, mouth, lungs, and ears,piercing through the clothes and irritating the skin, making it sting andcausing unbearable pain.</h2>
			<h2>5     Mirages - Many oasis seen to attract the weary traveler, but ashe reaches them he finds his hopes were deceived, his thirst was mocked and hisheart hardened. His hope fades away into the air. His faith decreases. His lovedeceases.</h2>
			<h2>&nbsp;"We are made partakers ofChrist" Heb. 3:14By grace through faith in truth. We must listen to the Wordor it will take conditions like these to make us partakers of Christ. Two outof two million five hundred thousand were made partakers of the Promise Land atthat time. Moses was allowed later. (Matt. 17:1-8 Mark 9:2-10; Luke 9:28-36)</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Jesus knows the way through thewilderness, all we have to do is believe and follow.</p>
			<h1>B.     TheCause of Unbelief in the Wilderness Heb. 3:19</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Unbelief raises a barrier whichshuts us off from the blessing. The devil can't shut off the blessing, but hecan set a snare to attract you and when you are drawn away from the path thatGod is leading the devil will build a barrier that you can't get back on track,therefore, shuts you off from the blessing. ONLY by faith in God's Word can youovercome. Unbelief thrives on three conditions.</p>
			<h2>1     Murmuring. Num. 14:1-4 "They murmured." </h2>
			<h2>Ex. 16:2,3 No bread; Ex. 17:3 Nowater</h2>
			<h2>2     Departing from the living God Heb. 3:12</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Detoured, side tracked, drawnaway of your own lusts. The Israelites forsook the fountain of living water. (Jer.2:13) They went into the mountains and hewed them out cisterns. The cisternswould break loose and not hold any water.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Unbelief is like the fungus thatwould grow on the side walls of their broken cisterns. Fungusgrows in the dark and feeds on dead things. Unbeliefcan't stand the sunlight of fellowship with God. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">If there is a decrease in our heart,it will affect our commitment, prayer life, our close walk with God, our enjoymentand respect for worship in the house of God and unbelief is sure to manifestitself in many ways every time. Keep your heart right with God all the time. Backsliding- Heb. 3:12</p>
			<h3>a.      The Subjects -"Brethren"</h3>
			<h3>b.     The Cause -"Unbelief"</h3>
			<h3>(the fruit of an evil heart)</h3>
			<h3>c.      The Manner - Turning away from God for something else.</h3>
			<h3>d.     The Preventative -"Take heed"</h3>
			<h3>(Examine) – Closely scrutinize.</h3>
			<h2>3     They failed to learn their lessons well. 3:16-19 </h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Not all provoked God, but thosethat sinned grieved Him forty years. All that sinned fell in the wilderness. Theydidn't have faith in the promises. Ex. 3:8 Psa. 78:19 They didn't take holdof His guarantee. Heb. 3:18; 4:2</p>
			<h1>C.     TheCaution Heb. 3:12</h1>
			<h1>Hardness of heart produces unbelief.</h1>
			<h2>4     It is an evil heart.</h2>
			<h2>5     It is an unperceived process. Constantly hearing the truth and notobeying it will cause your heart to harden.</h2>
			<h3>e.      &nbsp;"Take heed" Guard against an evil heart. Heb. 3:12 Anevil heart harbors sin. It all starts when the tender heart begins to harden.</h3>
			<h3>f.      &nbsp;"Take heed" Guard against a hard heart. Heb. 3:13; IICor. 13:5 Hard hearts are unbelievable.</h3>
			<h3>g.     &nbsp;"Take heed" Guard against the deceitfulness of sin.Heb. 3:12-13</h3>
			<h3>h.     &nbsp;"Take heed" Guard against unbelief. Heb. 3:12,14 Holdconfident faith steadfast unto the end.</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Take warning, a house settles whenthe stress comes. We are His house and we must be partakers of Him. He is theRock that can't be moved.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">We can only partake as we holdfastthe confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. Heb. 3:6; 4:16; 3:7,13,15;&nbsp;4:3,7,9,14,16</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "Today" - Now is God's time; "Take heed"- "Today"; "Hold fast" - "Today"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">·        Heb. 3:7 The Holy Ghost says "Today"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">·        3:13 The Apostle says "Today"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">·        4:17 The Word of God says "Today" Psa. 95:7-11</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">A chain of faith will lead to perfection in Christ. Fullydeveloped son's of God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)</p>
			<h1>D.    TheConfession of Faith as Sons of God (Heb. 4:14; 3:14; 2:10)</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">When you begin to question the Wordof God you are in trouble. Confession must be by acknowledgment of the Truth. Realfaith holds fast to the Word. Real faith confesses the Word. Many have lostconfidence in the Word because of surface reading and negative preaching.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Faith in your senses is unbelief. Jonah1:8 If you accept the physical evidence you make void the Word. Heb. 10:23 "Without wavering" Faith agrees with theWord. Unbelief agrees with the pain. Doctors practice -Jesus HEALS.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Don't tell how you hurt - confesswhat the Word says. God's Word is trustworthy (Num. 23:19; Heb. 4:12).Yourfeelings are not trustworthy - don't hold on to what you feel. Don't fear yourproblem but fear God. Heb. 4:1A wholesome Godly fear:</p>
			<h2>1     The blessing of a Godly fear - "His rest"</h2>
			<h2>2     The offer to the God-fearing believer - All the promises of God</h2>
			<h2>3     Those that fear God but not enough may - "come short" of the promises.</h2>
			<h2>4     The warning -"Let us therefore fear"</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Remember when you confess yourfaith in the promises as son's of God that it is of the spiritual nature andnot the physical gender as a man.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The nature of our temptations willgenerally prove where we really are spiritually. Confess the Word with fearand obedience.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The higher the moral character themore subtle the temptations. Christ could never be tempted with the course andcommon sins. Christ is the Son of God and He was tempted and we will be temptedthe same as we grow more and more like Him. "If thou be the Son of God" 4:3</p>
			<h2>1     He was tempted to seek a lawful thing in an unlawful way. Matt. 4:3,4 "AfterwardHe hungered" Matt. 4:2 (Temptation to satisfy yourself) He was tested for beingthe Son of God. Matt. 4:3; 27:43</h2>
			<h2>2     He was tempted to make a display of His power for the honor of His ownname. Mat. 4:6 &nbsp;"Cast thyself down" were the words of the devil, he knew hecouldn't cast Christ down so he tried to get Him to cast Himself down. Thescheme was if He cast Himself down, angels would bear Him up. (Temptation tohonor yourself.)</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">We are never to display our gifts,power, authority, abilities, money, song, speech or works just to show we arethe sons of God but for His Honor and Glory. (II Tim. 2:15; I Peter 4:10-14)</p>
			<h2>3     He was tempted to accomplish the purposes of God by adopting adishonoring method. (Matt. 4:8,9; Zech.14:9; I Chron. 29:11; Rev. 11:5)</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">&nbsp;(Temptation to step outside of theFather's plan and bypass the agony of the cross.)  - To expect thepromised blessing by using means that oppose the Word and are contrary to thecharacter of God.-</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">There is a hunger for the Kingdomof God and it can only be attained through worshipping God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Adam and Eve fell to thistemptation. Abram did when he took Hagar. Israel did when they asked for aking.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Gospel of Christ must be preachedwith the anointing  of the Holy Ghost and received by faith, anything else is fallingshort.</p>
			<h2>4     He was tempted to speak unadvisedly with his lips. Luke 11:53,54 Set awatch over your tongue.</h2>
			<h2>5     He was tempted to save himself by forsaking the cross. (Matt. 27:40-43) An often repeated temptation is to deny the cross (suffering).(Gal. 2:20; Matt. 16:24,25; Heb. 13:12,13; I Peter 4:14; Heb. 11:26; Matt.11:28-30)</h2>
