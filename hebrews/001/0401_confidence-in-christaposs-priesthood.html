<h1>Confidence in Christ's Priesthood 4:14-16</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The vast attention put uponJerusalem brought about it's destruction in 70 AD.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Priest ministered in theJerusalem temple. There on certain days, weeks, months and years animals wereslain as sacrifices and prayers were made to God on behalf of the sinfulIsraelite.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Bible records also sacrificesmade by the head of the household in every family: Noah, Job, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.Each one acting as priest, building altars and offering sacrifices. Cain andAbel offered sacrifice.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Cain's offering wasconsidered selfishness.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Abel's offering wasconsidered a sacrifice.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Gen. 3:21 God made sacrifice forAdam and Eve.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Ex. 19 At Mount Sinai the Jewishsacrificial system was added.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The certain Priests would minister in a specific structure, according to the  God-given pattern, called theTabernacle, and later was replaced by the  Temple. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Aaron and his sons were consecrated as priests, and the effective ceremonial laws and rituals were added to thelife of Israel.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Christian Church is built onOld Testament foundations.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The law was not abolished but fulfilled in Christ. That is the ceremonial laws and rituals were not done away with. Thelaw can only be satisfied through Christ. Eph. 2:11-22</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> CHRIST JESUS, THE SACRIFICER AND THESACRIFICE</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Christ in you, the hope of glory. Col.1:27</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> You are the temple of the Lord. ICor. 3:17</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> We have an alter. Heb.13:10</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> We have a Great High Priest. Heb.4:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Called and made a High Priest by theFather </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Heb.5:5-10; 6:13-20; 7:11-28</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">&nbsp;"Our High Priest has passed intothe heavens" and is sitting at the Father's right hand ready to stand to the attentionof every confident believer. Jesus' exalted position is the foundation ofChristian confidence.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The earthly high priest entered theHoly of Holies once every year. Christ, once for all, and forever continually.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> A DOUBLE NEGATIVE:</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "we have not a High Priest which cannot betouched with the feeling of our infirmities" Heb. 4:15</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Christ is our only Great High Priest, He is divine in Spirit and human in body. Because of His Divine Nature, He has perfect love, because of His human nature experiencing the pressures and problems of human life, yet without sin, He has compassion on us. 	</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Christ knows the nature of humanity in that He became man.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> He was the same, "He was tempted inall points such as we."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> He was different, "Yet without sin."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> I Cor. 15:22 In Adam all die - inChrist all are made alive.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Christ is perfectly able andwilling to intercede for us. The ancient Israelite had to stand afar offbecause of sin; unable to enter. Into The Holy place much less the Holy ofHolies.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The throne of grace...The throneroom of God...The presence of God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">We have been made nigh by the bloodof Jesus. Eph. 2:13</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">With Christ, our High Priest inHeaven, the believer need not stand afar off ...</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> ...and timidly seek help through an earthlyminister, but to have confidence......a HOLY BOLDNESS...to enter by faith thepresence of God for Jesus has identified Himself with us and made it possible.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">"LET US THEREFORE COME BOLDLY UNTO THE THRONE OF GRACE"&nbsp;4:16</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 9:13,14 Sealed by His own blood</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 10:14-23 The new and living wayopened to us</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 10:35-39 Cast not away thereforeyour confidence</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 13:5-16 Offer the sacrifice ofpraise to God continually.</p>
