<h1>Spiritual Dullness of the Hebrews</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">1. Lack of growth in knowledge 5:11-14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The writer of Hebrews is enthusedwith his subject but he becomes disturbed because of the Spiritual immaturity of his audience. Jesus was called of God an High Priest after the order ofMelchizedek (5:10), a truth filled with meaning to be expounded in chapter 7.&nbsp;Much is to be said, but the Christians are (dull of hearing, 5:11), immatureand therefore not prepared to receive instruction.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Immature Christians not only hurtthemselves, by robbing themselves, of the Spiritual benefits which accompanymaturity, but they rob others also. Christians should be "teachers" (5:12),sharing their Spiritual blessings with others both within and without thechurch. &nbsp;It is the entire church that has been called to a teaching ministry.(Matt. 28:19, The Great Commission includes the command "teach all nations.")&nbsp;Some Christians have and are special gifts to the church. (Eph. 4:11,12)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Instead of being teachers, however,the immature Christians had need that one teach them again "the firstprinciples of the oracles of God" (5:12). Teachers who should be reaching thelost must spend their time reinstructing the immature. You have let slip fromyou the elementary truths of God's Holy Word! If this is so, then truly youmust be taught  again. (John 5:39) He warned us against this.&nbsp;(2:1)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The plea continues (5:13-14) youshould move on (not back up) from the milk stage to the meat stage. We are commandedto "grow in grace and  in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior JesusChrist. (II Peter 3:18) "Growing up into Him in all things (Eph. 4:15). Paulsaid, "When I became a man, I put away childish things." (I Cor. 13:11)&nbsp;"Brethren be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children,but in understanding be men." (I Cor. 14:20)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The milk drinker is "unskillful inthe word of Righteousness." (5:13) We should cherish the milk.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> &nbsp;- "The first principles of theoracles of God." 5:12</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> &nbsp;- "The principles of the doctrineof Christ." 6:1</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> &nbsp;- The rudiments of Christianfaith."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> &nbsp;- "The facts of God's grace inChrist.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Remember, milk is not to be givenconstantly. All should rest in the great truth of God's love and theredemption wrought by Christ at Calvary, and then move on to maturity. (A lifeof service.)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Gen. 22</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">II Sam. 24:23,24</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">I Chr. 21:22-25</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Acts 9:6</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Phil. 2:12-18</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Rom. 12:1</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Matt. 5:1-48</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The strong meat Christian is mature(5:14) "by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern bothgood and evil. The babe will be a disinterested spectator in the battlebetween truth and error, but mature Christians will be an active participant.&nbsp;The Hebrews were rooting for a side of truth, but they had not joined thebattle for truth. Babies are excused from fighting, but (meat eaters) matureChristians should be where the going is rough. The Christian is called to puton all the armor of God (Eph. 6:11) and fight the fight of faith. "Fight the goodfight of faith and lay hold on eternal life." (I Tim. 6:12) The distinctionbetween good and evil (5:14) involves more than theology. It is "by reason ofuse" that the "senses are exercised to discern both good and evil."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Since the milk Christian (if youplease) is unable to enter the battle, he is forced to act like a child "tossedto and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight ofman and of cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive." (Eph.4:14) Through the process of growing, our ability to discern matures.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Development of the Spiritual Man</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:7-14; 6:9-15</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Spiritual growth doesn't justhappen because you were saved. You must be fed the Word by the Spirit. Heb.5:14 (I Peter 2:2) You must exercise what you learn. Heb. 5:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Total obedience doesn't just happenbecause you are saved. Total obedience must be learned. Heb. 5:8,9</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Total perfection doesn't justhappen because you are saved. Total perfection must be attained. Heb. 5:9; 6:1</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Remember, God's plan of salvationis eternal. Heb. 5:9 Eph. 3:11</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">God's plan of salvation isprogressive. Heb. 5:9; 12:2</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">"Author andFinisher"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The provisions are given to us thatwe may grow. II Peter 1:3,4; I Peter 5:10; Heb. 5:14; 6:1</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Howimportant is the revealed Word? Heb. 4:12</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Theexercise is, putting into practice the Word that is revealed.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">TheRevelation of the Word prevents temptation in every trial.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 4:15 Matt. 4:4,7,10; 26:41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke 4:4,8,12; 22:40,46</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Revelation of the Word providesstrength in every trial. Heb. 5:14,7; Eph. 6:10</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Revelation of the Word perfectsobedience in every trial. There are stages of spiritual growth, you can beperfect in the state that you are in, but if you stay there and do not develop,you will never reach the full stature of Christ. Eph. 4:13</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Does thespiritual man need development?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">5:11 Dull of hearing 6:12 Slothful 5:13Unskillful</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">I. The Need for Developing the Spiritual Man</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 1. A development in Spiritual hearing</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Heb. 5:11; Rev. 2:7 Dull ofSpiritual Hearing</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 2. A development of Spiritual vision</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Heb. 6:12; Eph. 1:18 Be not slothfulin receiving Spiritual insight</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 3. A development in Spiritualdiscernment</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Heb. 5:14; I Cor. 2:15 The Spiritualman must develop so he can discern.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">II. The Means ofDeveloping the Spiritual Man</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 1. By the Word (Heb. 4:15; 6:5,12)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 2. By Revelation</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Rom. 1:17 Faith – Faith</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> II Cor. 3:18 Glory – Glory</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> II Peter 3:18 Grace – Grace (John1:16)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 3. By Exercise Heb. 5:14 "by reason ofuse"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> It is not enough just to readand memorize your Bible. It is not enough just to have a revelation of thetruth. You must exercise what God gives you. Put the revelation to practice inyour life. Exercise in the Spiritual Law that God has created. This is not anexercise of the mind by what you think, but an exercise of what God puts inyour spirit. Heb. 5:13,14 I Cor. 2:10-16 Phil. 2:5-11 I Peter 4:1,2 </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Luke 16:8The children of this world are wiser than the children of light.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Remember there are two that use theLaw. I Cor. 2:12 Matt. 4:8</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">We must be led by the Holy Ghost. Heb.6:4 Rom. 8:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">III. The Extent ofDeveloping the Spiritual Man</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 1. "Of full age" Heb. 5:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 2. "To be teachers" Heb. 5:12</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 3. "Let us go on unto perfection" Heb.6:1</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 4. "Many sons" Heb. 2:10</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 5. "Senses exercised to discern" Heb.5:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 6. "Inherit the promises" Heb. 6:12&nbsp;(fully)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 7. "Save them to the uttermost"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 7:25 "Seeing" see what Christ isdoing and do that with Him.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">IV. The Diet ForDeveloping The Spiritual Man</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 1. "Strong meat" 5:12,14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 2. "The word of righteousness" 5:13</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 3. "Principles of the oracles of God" 5:12;&nbsp;6:1</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 4. "The good word of God" 6:5</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">5. "The heavenly gift" 6:4</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 6. All that the "Holy Ghost" brings 6:4</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 7. Divine revelation "enlightened" 6:4</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">8. The need for pressing ONto maturity. 6:1-3</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">In the appeal for maturity theauthor bids us leave "the principles of the Doctrine of Christ." (6:1) Thatmeans advance "GO ON" not forsake or neglect. MOVE ON – BUILD ON –GO ON.We are not to lay again "the foundation of repentance from deadworks" (6:1) Repentance and faith toward God are excepted through Christ, they areChristian fundamentals</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Christian has seen himself as asinner who has broken the law of God. He has seen his sin as an offense toGod. The very goodness of God leads us to repentance. (Rom. 2:4) Thisrepentance involves a turning away from dead works which are not the fruit ofthe Spirit of the living Christ. The works of the unbeliever are dead and evil</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Good works are the fruit ofsalvation. (Eph. 2:10) We have repented of our dead works, we need not to goover that ground again, and again and again but to see that foundation laid andmove on to maturity.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">"All the building fitly framed together" (Eph. 2:21)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">"Faith toward God" (6:1) is of course basic to the Christianexperience. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The one who comes to God must believe. (11:6)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "The steps of faith" (Rom. 4:12)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "From faith to faith" (Rom. 1:17</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "Add to your faith" (II Peter 1:5)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "GO ON" (Heb. 6:1)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "The doctrine of baptisms" (6:2)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Although the Christian churchknows one baptism (Eph. 4:5), the Old Testament recorded many "washings" whichtypified the cleansing which was required before any one could approach God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">It was a basic fundamental ofChristian faith to distinguish between the Christian rite of baptism, whichaccompanied a profession of faith in Christ and the many ceremonial washings ofthe Old Testament.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">"The laying on of hands" (6:2), anelement that every believer should understand. It symbolized (transfer) - Lev.16:21 - Mark 5:23 - Acts 6:6</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">"The resurrection of the dead"(6:2), an important element in preaching of the early church. Acts 2:24 ICor. 15:17,18, 52-57 Rom. 8:11 Acts 17:31,32 John 11:24</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Confidence in the resurrection ofJesus builds confidence in the heart of the sinner to be saved and in the heartof the Christian to be resurrected from the dead in the last day."Eternal Judgment"(6:2)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Jesus was declared to be the Judge of the quick and the dead. Acts 10:42</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Christians who received the epistle of Hebrews knew all these things. They are basic doctrines. The writer wishes to leave – build – go on from the foundation to the finish – "Let us go on unto perfection." "If God permit." 6:3</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">6 steps than 1 II Sam. 6:13</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">1. Repentance</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">2. Faith</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">3. Cleansing</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">4. (transfer) Rely on Christ</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">5. (Resurrection) future state –builds confidence</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">6. (Eternal Judgment) final state – builds endurance</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">7. Perfection</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">3. The danger of falling away from Christ, 6:4-8</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">A believer cannot loose hissalvation as long as he trusts and obeys the Lord. A believer can leave hissalvation. Those who turn their back upon the Lord are likened to the earthwhich drinks in the rain from heaven but yields thorns and briers. 6:7,8 Thethorns and the briers are destroyed because they are worthless </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">to God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">We can understand the danger offalling away from Christ by the lesson on the Parable of the Sower.- Matt.13:1-23- Mark 4:1-20- Luke 8:1-15</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Jesus was conscious of two thingswhile the multitudes gathered to hear </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Him.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">(1) Their enthusiasm was more curiosity thanreceiving truth.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">(2) There were many reasons why much of what He saidwas lost by them.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The prepositions used in Matt. 13:4-8 supply the key to thediversity of hearers.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (1) Some fell "by " thewayside. Vs. 4</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (2) Some fell "upon" stonyplaces. Vs. 5</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (3) Some fell "among" thorns.Vs. 7</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (4) Some fell "into" good ground.Vs. 8</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> What did Jesus mean in Matt. 13:12?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">(1) Thatif the hearer is to benefit from the Word, he must possess a condition of heartsuitable for the reception of the truth, which will then multiply.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">(2) If thehearer does not possess such a condition of the heart, the truth he hears and"thinketh he hath" will be lost to him. Luke 8:18; Matt. 13:13-16</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Jesus made a distinction betweenthose who do not respond to the truth and those who do, same as Heb. 6:7,8. Whyare some unresponsive to the truth?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (1) Becausethe "lack of Spiritual understanding."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> IICor. 3:14; John 8:43-47; I Cor. 2:12-14; Rom. 12:2</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (2) Becauseof a "hardened heart."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Matt.13:15 Mark 6:52; 8:17-21 II Cor. 3:14-16</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (3) Becauseof a predisposition against the truth.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Matt.13:15 Mark 7:9 Matt. 23:37</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (4) Becauseof their unwillingness.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Matt.13:15 "closed their eyes" purposely</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Dullof hearing – plugged their ears on purpose.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Matt. 13:11 shows the truth iswithheld from those who don't want the truth. Matt. 11:25,26; Matt. 13:16,17 Theprivilege of learning secret methods of God's working by His Word, only nowbeing revealed. Not everyone can know – But some can – Matt. 13:18 "Hear yetherefore the parable of the sower"</p>
