<h1>I Feel Like Something Good is About to Happen</h1>
<p>Bill Gaither / Gaither Music / ASCAP</p>

<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>I have learned in all that happens, just to praise Him</span>
<span class='song-line'>For I know He's working all things for my good</span>
<span class='song-line'>Every tear I shed is worth all the investment</span>
<span class='song-line'>For I know He'll see me through, He said He would</span>
<span class='song-line'>He has promised eye and ear can hardly fathom</span>
<span class='song-line'>All the things He has in store for those who pray</span>
<span class='song-line'>I just feel like something good is about to happen</span>
<span class='song-line'>And brother, this could be that very day</span></p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>Yes I've noticed all the bad news in the paper</span>
<span class='song-line'>And it seems like things get bleaker everyday</span>
<span class='song-line'>But for this child of God it makes no difference</span>
<span class='song-line'>It's bound to get better either way</span>
<span class='song-line'>I've never been more thrilled about tomorrow</span>
<span class='song-line'>Sunshine's always bursting through the skies of gray</span>
<span class='song-line'>I just feel like something good is about to happen</span>
<span class='song-line'>And brother, this could be that very day</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>I just feel like something good is about to happen</span>
<span class='song-line'>I just feel like something good is on its way</span>
<span class='song-line'>He has promised that He'd open all of Heaven</span>
<span class='song-line'>And, brother, it could happen any day</span>
<span class='song-line'>When God's people humble themselves and call on Jesus</span>
<span class='song-line'>And they look to Heaven, expecting as they pray</span>
<span class='song-line'>I just feel like something good is about to happen</span>
<span class='song-line'>And, brother, it could be this very day</p>

<h2>Tag</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>I just feel like something good is about to happen</span>
<span class='song-line'>And brother, this could be</span>
<span class='song-line'>Sister, this could be</span>
<span class='song-line'>Brother, this could be that very day</p>
