<h1>James</h1> <h2>The Writer of the Epistle of James</h2> <p>James 1:1 &quot;James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;&quot; Servant: &quot;a bond man; in subjection; a voluntary slave&quot; (Only the will of God will be performed.)</p> <p>This simple signature tells us the writer was well known to his readers and needed not lengthy introduction. He was a man highly esteemed among them, one who stood in a position of recognized spiritual authority, and one whom they were obliged to obey. There are four men named James&apos; who lived around the NT era, but &quot;James the Brother of the Lord&quot; stands as the most probable writer of this epistle.</p> <h3>James the son of Zebedee &amp; brother of John.</h3> <p>This man was the most prominent &quot;James&quot; in the gospels. He was one of the &quot;sons of thunder,&quot; originally a fisherman with John (his brother), along with Peter and Andrew. He became a disciple of Jesus, He was one of the three inner disciples and was later martyred by Herod Agrippa I, as recorded in Acts 12:2 (A.D. 44). There is not much chance that this James could have written this letter before he was killed, and there is no tradition arguing that he did.</p> <h3>James the son of Alphaeus, another disciple.</h3> <p>Very little is known about this James, the brother of Matthew (Levi). He was another disciple of our Lord, but again, there is no hint that he is the one who wrote this epistle. Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13</p> <h3>James the father of Judas the disciple</h3> <p>(Judas Thaddaeus). This man is even more obscure. Not a likely candidate</p> <h3>James the brother of Jude &amp; half-brother of our Lord.</h3> <p>Also known as James the Less, This James appears to be the writer of the epistle of James. He is not so identified, but much about his character is revealed that is in keeping with what is known about him. This choice is also in keeping with tradition which tells us that he remained in Jerusalem and that Peter, James, &amp; John chose James, the brother of Jesus to be the pastor of the Jerusalem church after the ascension of Christ (cf. Clement of Alexandria). The fact that he does not so identify himself (as our Lord's brother) may be an indication of his humility, but it also reveals the standing and personal authority he had over his readers. He was a man well known and highly esteemed in the new Christian community. &quot;James, a servant of God and of Jesus Christ&quot; was sufficient identification for them</p> <p>James is first introduced in Matthew 13:55 as one of our Lord's brethren. John 7:5 relates the sad fact that even as late as six months before the crucifixion (the feast of tabernacles), James was still an unbeliever. </p> <p>I Cor. 15:7 tells us that in the midst of the resurrection appearances of Christ, &quot;He was seen of James.&quot; A little later, a number of people are recorded as meeting for prayer with the apostles in the upper room, as they awaited Pentecost; among them were &quot;Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brethren.&quot;</p> <p>In Gal. 1:18-19 Paul is describing the events of his life following his three years in Arabia after his conversion; at this time he spent two weeks with Peter in Jerusalem and also met another important church leader, &quot;James the Lord's brother.&quot; By the time of Acts 12:17 James was evidently already a leader in the Jerusalem church, for Peter, released from prison, asks that the news be reported to James. In Acts 15:13 James is the one presiding at the great council of Jerusalem which met to decide the important question of the relationship of Christianity to the Mosaic law; his leadership role is evident. </p> <p>In Gal. 2:9 Paul refers to him as a &quot;pillar&quot; of the church&mdash;equal to Peter and John. So far James has come from his unbelief! The remaining references to James (Gal. 2:12-13 &amp; Acts 21:18-19) reveal his zeal for the Mosaic law. He was evidently in firm agreement with the decision of the Jerusalem council (Acts 15:13-19), but he was also careful to keep peace between the Gentile believers and the more &quot;legalistic&quot; Jewish Christians (verse 20). Perhaps he himself (as Peter, cf. Gal. 2:11) carried this matter too far; this does not minimize his standing as an apostle, however (Gal. 1:19). (Note: At least four other men beside the original 11 have apostolic status: Matthias [Acts 1:26], Barnabas [Acts 14:4, 14], Paul, and James.) He was &quot;nicknamed&quot; &quot;James the Just&quot; because of his recognized piety, and was said to have &quot;knees like those of camels&quot; because of his much time spent in prayer. Josephus records that James was martyred during an uprising against Christians while Ananus was high priest in 62 A.D.</p> <p>He was elected to the oversight of the churches of Jerusalem; and was the writer of the Epistle ascribed to James At the age of ninety-four he was beat and stoned by the Jews; and finally had his brains dashed out with a fuller's club.</p> <p>Details of James the Less&apos; martyrdom are found in the writings of Josephus, Eusebius, and Jerome. When Festus, the governor of Judea, died, Nero replaced him with Albinus. About the same time, Herod Agrippa II replaced the Jewish high priest Joseph with Ananus. After Festus died and before Albinus had arrived in Judea to replace him, the new high priest decided to pressure James the Less to deny that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God. Ananus was taking advantage of a lapse in leadership at the end of Festus&apos; reign. Similar circumstances at the end of Pilate&apos;s reign over Judea led to the stoning of Saint Stephen.</p> <p>The Jewish high priest asked James to stand on the Temple wall and speak against Jesus to the crowds which had gathered in preparation for the Passover. James instead spoke in favor of Jesus as the Christ; many heard him and many were converted. So the Jewish religious leaders threw James down from the Temple wall. Yet he did not die from the fall, so they began to stone him. Still he did not die from the stoning, so a man took a fuller club (used to beat out clothing) and clubbed him to death. In this way died James the Less, one of Twelve Apostles and the leader of the Church at Jerusalem for 30 years.</p> <h2>The Purpose of Writing</h2> <h3>Address all Believers</h3> <p>&quot;To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.&quot; 1:1</p> <p>To the brethren--including the entire church of Jewish Christians.</p> <p>1:1; 1:16; 2:1,5,14; 3:1; 4:11; 5:7,9,10,19</p> <h3>Encourage Perfection in Christian Character</h3> <p>The epistle of James is a manual of instructions for holy living and a practical guide to Christian life and conduct. As a guidebook for true religion, James gives a pattern showing the characteristics of true faith.</p> <h3>Warn of Vices</h3> <p>In encouraging the perfection of Christian character, James warns of many vices: fatalism, fanaticism, formalism, favoritism, falsehood, fierce spirit, foul talk and evil speaking, and fearlessness and boasting to name a few.</p> <h4>Fatalism, which threw its sins on God</h4> <blockquote>James 1:13&mdash;Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God&hellip;</blockquote> <h4>Fanaticism, which, under the cloak of religious Zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces.</h4> <p>Many men do not have real convictions of their own and they try to live up to the standards of others and find themselves frustrated.</p> <blockquote>James 1:20&mdash;For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. </blockquote> <h4>Formalism consists in washings and outward ceremonies.</h4> <p>Whereas he reminds them that true religion consists in active love and purity.</p> <blockquote>James 1:27&mdash;Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. </blockquote> <h4>Favoritism - Respect of persons. James 2:1-18</h4> <h4>Falsehood, which had made words and oaths play-things (3:2-12)</h4> <h4>Fierce spirit, Friendship with the world. Partisanship</h4> <p>If you&apos;re under the influence of a strong false view, fierce, unkind and contemptuous spirit, &quot;ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts.&quot; Attempting or pretending to defend true religion, and to boast of your works or success in silencing an enemy; is not pure religion, nor true wisdom, and to profess either without giving God the full Glory is to lie against the truth.</p> <blockquote>James 3:14&mdash;But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. </blockquote> <h4>Foul Talk or Evil Speaking</h4> <blockquote>James 4:11&mdash;Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. </blockquote> <h4>Fearlessness and Boasting</h4> <p>James 4:16&mdash;But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p> <h3>Instruct in Patience</h3> <p>The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh. We need to have full Revelation of God&apos;s Word that we may understand God&apos;s Eternal Purpose. Patience&hellip;</p> <h4>in trial (1:2)</h4> <h4>n good works (1:22-25)</h4> <h4>under provocation (3:17)</h4> <h4>though treated with fraud (5:4)</h4> <h4>under oppression (5:7)</h4> <h4>under persecution (5:10)</h4> <blockquote>James 5:7-9&mdash;Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain 8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. </blockquote> <h3>The book of James is not merely informative but inspirational, as well.</h3> <p>The object of the writer is to inspire men to enforce the practical duties of the Christian life. In James 1:2-12 James gives five urgent requirements of faith and in so doing he illustrates faith&apos;s spiritual vitality. WE NEED FAITH; without it we will die. In order for faith to remain true and alive it must be added to. Faith can only be added to as it is exercised. Faith is to always be in action, not just in motion doing something, but doing the Will of God.</p> <h2>Theme &amp; Key Text</h2> <h3>Theme: True faith produces good works.</h3> <p>1:3,4,25,27; 2:18,20,22,26; 3:17,18; 4:6-11,17; 5:7-9,12,15,17-20</p> <h3>Key Text: James 2:17,18</h3> <blockquote>James 2:17,18&mdash;Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. </blockquote> <h2>Textual Outline</h2> <h3>Chapter 1 &mdash; Practical instruction on Christian living</h3> <h3>Chapter 2 &mdash; Show no partiality vs. 1-13 &mdash; &quot;Faith without works is dead&quot; vs. 14-26</h3> <h3>Chapter 3 &mdash; The power of the tongue &mdash; Earthly wisdom vs. heavenly wisdom</h3> <h3>Chapter 4 &mdash; The friend of the world is the enemy of God</h3> <h3>Chapter 5 &mdash; Corrupted rich men &mdash; Be patient &mdash; More practical instruction on Christian living</h3> <p>The whole book of James is dealing with practical everyday living according to the Word of God. When he begins and ends the book, he deals with several points briefly, but in the main body of the book/letter, he singles out several important issues and takes some time to deal with them individually.</p> <h2>Topical Outline</h2>

</div> <h3>The Trying of Your Faith (Joy and Patience) James 1:1-27</h3> <h4>There are five urgent requirements of faith: Joy, Patience, Wisdom, Unwavering Mind and Love.</h4> <h5>Joy</h5> <p>Count it a joy to serve God even when your faith is being tried. We can have a Joy that will rejoice in the Promise rather than react to the problem. Where Christ is working there is Joy. James 1:2 &quot;Count it all joy&quot; 5:10; 4:9</p> <h5>Patience</h5> <p>Know that the trial is to work Patience so that we press in, press through and press on. Patience is a sign your faith is working. Patience has its place with Faith and Joy unto Perfection. Where Christ is working there is Patience.</p> <blockquote>James 1:3&mdash;The trying of your faith worketh patience.</blockquote> <blockquote>James 1:4&mdash;Let patience have her perfect work.</blockquote> <h5>Wisdom</h5> <p>Ask for Wisdom and it shall be given. We are given the Unction to speak and act wisely in the hour of trial. Where Christ is working there is wisdom.</p> <blockquote>James 1:5&mdash;If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God&hellip;</blockquote> <h5>Unwavering mind</h5> <p>We need a humble mind that will always depend on the Lord. A faith that refuses to respond to the surging billows of doubt in the hour of trial. Endurance has its place with Faith and Love through every trial. Where Christ is working there is endurance (1:12) with an unwavering mind.</p> <blockquote>James 1:6&mdash;&hellip;nothing wavering&hellip;</blockquote> <blockquote>James 1:8&mdash;A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</blockquote> <h5>Love</h5> <p>Pure Love never fails to make faith work perfectly. Faith and love are content with God&apos;s dealings in the hour of trial. Where Christ is working there is Love.</p> <blockquote>James 1:12&mdash;Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</blockquote> <blockquote>James 1:2&mdash;My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</blockquote> <h4>There are diverse temptations and trials. 1:2</h4> <h5>Faith tried by the Word. Ps. 105:19; Jer. 23:29; I Cor. 3:13; I Peter 1:7,22</h5> <p>Promises (1:12) /Father of lights (1:17) /Word of Truth (1:18) /engrafted Word (1:21,23) /The Perfect Law of liberty (1:25) /Gospel: pure &amp; unspotted religion /Wisdom from Above (3:17)</p> <p>God tests and never tempts (James1:12-13). God tests to prove our faith, correct our conduct and to perfect our character.</p> <p>God allows temptation (James 1:2, 12-13; 2:5; 5:13; I Cor. 10:13).</p> <ul> <li>Psalm 119:67 Because we didn&apos;t listen directly to the Word of God.</li> <li>James 1:14 For the unbeliever to see his faults and weaknesses.</li> <li>I Cor.3:13 The fiery trial reveals to others who you really are.</li> <li>I Cor.15:57; II Cor. 2:14 God gives victory and causes Triumph.</li> <li>Matt. 4:1-4; Rev. 12:6; 13-16 The wilderness experience is a feeding time spiritually.</li> </ul> <p>God rewards those that truly love Him. James 1:12</p> <h5>Faith Tried by Afflictions, Hardships, Tests, and Trials. Affliction is any condition that produces suffering or pain.</h5> <h6>There are two types of affliction:</h6> <p>THE FIRST is designed to judge sin (Isaiah 53:4; Matthew 24:29; Romans 2:9)</p> <p>THE SECOND is designed to purify and perfect the believer (James 1:2-4; 5:13; Rom. 5:3-5; 8:18 II Thess. 1:4-7; Isaiah 48:10; 63:9; Hosea 5:15; II Chron. 33:12; I Peter 5:9,10).</p> <h6>In both cases you that are spiritual must be a help to those that are afflicted (James 1:17; Gal. 6:1; I Cor. 2:15).</h6> <h6>How to pray in affliction.</h6> <table> <tr><td>INSTRUCTION</td><td>REFERENCE</td></tr> <tr><td>Learn to pray through alone.

(Wisdom and Meekness) James 1:22-3:18</h3> <blockquote>Jas. 2:18&mdash;I will shew you my faith by my works.</blockquote> <p>Because the kingdom of God is not a natural kingdom (Luke 17:20) our faith is justified in the eyes of those that behold our good works. Matt. 5:16; Eph. 2:10</p> <blockquote>I Pt. 2:12&mdash;&hellip;by your good works which they shall behold , glorify God&hellip; </blockquote> <p>Gal. 5:6; I Thess. 1:3; 2:13; Phil. 2:12-13 ; I Jn. 3:18, 23-24; Titus 3:8; 1:13-14; 2:11-14</p> <h4>Your faith without good works&hellip;</h4> <ul> <li>will not profit James 2:14-16</li> <li>will not live James 2:17,20,26</li> <li>will face the judgment Revelation 2:12</li> </ul> <h4>Your Faith receives the engrafted Word of God with meekness unto perfection.

(finding fault harshly and unwisely)</blockquote> <blockquote>Proverbs 2:6&mdash;In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.;</blockquote> <blockquote>Ecclesiastes 2:26&mdash;For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. </blockquote> <p>Psalm 105:22 (Teach wisdom).

Obedience to the word to good conduct unto good character. Perfect faith to perfect conduct unto perfect character</p> <p>Right character should always produce right conduct. The proof of a man&apos;s faith is a manifestation of Christ&apos;s life.</p>

<h1></h1> <h2>Introduction 1:1-4</h2> <h2>Fellowship with God 1:5 to 2:28</h2> <h2>Divine Sonship 2:29 to 3:24</h2> <h2>The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error 4:1-6</h2> <h2>God is Love 4:7-21</h2> <h2>Faith 5:1-12</h2> <h2>Conclusion: Christian Confidence 5:13-21</h2> </div> <h2>Introduction 1:1-4</h2> <p>John begins this letter without introducing himself. Quite likely he was so familiar to his audience that he needed no introduction. He begins by saying that he was a personal witness of the &quot;Word of life&quot; (Jesus Christ), that he had personally heard Him, saw Him and handled Him. He declares this &quot;eternal life&quot; to them that they may have fellowship with him and that their joy may be full.</p> <h2>Fellowship with God 1:5 to 2:28</h2> <p>Here, John gives the evidence of those who truly have fellowship with God:</p> <h3>They walk in the light (1:5-7)</h3> <p>There are many false teachers who twist the scriptures and deceive many, but our conduct ultimately proves whether we live in the truth of God&apos;s Word and have the Spirit of God.</p> <h3>They repent upon the awareness of sin (1:8)</h3> <p>They will not tolerate sin in their lives or treat it lightly, but will deal with it upon discovery.</p> <h3>To be like Christ and obedient to His Word (2:2-6)</h3> <p>If we have fellowship with God, we will be an imitator and revealer of Christ and live a life of obedience to His Word as He was obedient to the Word of the Father.</p> <h3>They love the brethren (2:7-11)</h3> <p>They will keep this commandment that was given in the beginning and has been renewed up through the years.</p> <h3>They have no love for the world (2:12-17)</h3> <p>They will hate the spirit of this world and sin which is the enemy of that Life that resides within them.</p> <h3>They have pure doctrine (2:18-28)</h3> <p>There are many false teachers with the spirit of antichrist, but those who have fellowship with God need not be led astray by the subtle and plausible arguments of those who promote error for they have the Spirit to lead them into all truth.</p> <h2>Divine Sonship 2:29 to 3:24</h2> <p>Here, John gives the evidence of those who have divine sonship:</p> <h3>A righteous walk (2:29 to 3:10)</h3> <p>The Christian is to show an absolute antagonism to sin because:</p> <h4>His divine sonship and the desire to become like Jesus (2:29 to 3:1-3)</h4> <h4>Sin is the transgression of the law of God &mdash; i.e. rebellion against God. (3:4)</h4> <h4>Because of Christ&apos;s character and His atoning work for us. (v. 5-7)</h4> <h4>Because of the diabolical nature of sin. (v. 8)</h4> <h4>Because of the godly nature of the Christian life. (v. 9)</h4> <h4>Because the final test as to whether we are children of God or children of the devil lies in our actions. (v. 10)</h4> <h3>Love for the brethren (3:11-18)</h3> <h2>I The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error 4:1-6</h2> <h3>The appeal v. 1</h3> <p>No matter how &quot;right&quot; a teacher, prophet etc may seem, his words are to be tested.</p> <h3>The test v. 2</h3> <p>Those who will confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. Those who are not of God and bear a false and deceiving spirit will claim to speak for God and to present divine truth, but not by Jesus Christ. They do not glorify Him and confess that Jesus Christ, as God, came to this earth and lived as a man.</p> <h3>The conflict v. 4</h3> <p>It is evident that these believers had encountered these false teachers, but had held to the truth.</p> <h3>4. The contrast vs. 5-6</h3> <p>Godly men attract men who are similar in love and devotion to God. False teachers and men who are of the spirit of this world also attract those who are similar in spirit.</p> <h2>God is Love 4:7-21</h2> <h3>The call to love v. 7</h3> <h3>The reason for love: &quot;God is love&quot; v. 8</h3> <h3>The proof of divine love: God&apos;s sacrifice vs. 9-10</h3> <h3>The claim of love: God&apos;s love for us calls on us to love our brethren v. 11</h3> <h3>The result of love in us:</h3> <h4>The manifestation of God&apos;s presence vs. 12-16</h4> <h4>Boldness v. 17</h4> <h4>Absence of condemning fear v. 18</h4> <h3>The proof of our love:</h3> <h4>The proof of our love for God is a love for our brother who is made and renewed in God&apos;s image. v. 19-21</h4> <h4>The proof of our love for the brethren is found in our love for God. 5:1-2</h4> <h4>The proof of our love for God is manifested in keeping His commandments. v. 3</h4> <h2>Faith 5:1-12</h2> <h3>The victory of faith 5:4-5</h3> <h3>The threefold earthly witness of faith vs. 6-8</h3> <h3>The heavenly witness vs. 9-12</h3> <h2>Conclusion: Christian Confidence 5:13-21</h2> <h3>The substance of the Christian confidence &mdash; the assurance of eternal life. v. 13</h3> <h3>The manifestation of Christian confidence.</h3> <h4>Outwardly the power of offering effectual prayer. vs. 14-17</h4> <h4>Inward conviction &mdash; &quot;We know.&quot; vs. 18-20</h4> <h3>Concluding exhortation v. 21</h3> <h2>A brief summary of each chapter</h2> <h3>Chapter 1</h3> <p>We must live our lives in obedience to the Word of God (truth, &quot;light&quot;) that our faith be not a mere profession and that we may have fellowship with the Father, the Son and with each other.</p> <h3>Chapter 2</h3> <p>Sin not. Keep His commandments. The proof or evidence that we know Him, that we are &quot;in Him&quot; is that we keep His commandments and love our brother. Love not the world. We have an unction or anointing that teaches us the truth and keeps us from error. Abide in Him.</p> <h3>Chapter 3</h3> <p>We are sons of God. We shall be like Him. Those who are sons of God and desire to be like Him, must purify themselves as He is pure. Jesus came that He might take away our sins. If we belong to God, we will love our brother and will not live under sin. If we are of the devil, we will sin. Believe on Jesus Christ and love your brother, not only in word, but also in deed.</p> <h3>Chapter 4</h3> <p>Try the spirits. Those that are of God will love the truth and confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. Love one another. As He is, so are we in this world. If we love God, we will also love each other. Evidences that we are in Him:</p> <h4>We will have the love of God and manifest it toward one another. (v. 7-8)</h4> <h4>We have received of the Spirit (v.13)</h4> <h4>We will confess that Jesus is the Son of God (v. 15)</h4> <h4>We will &quot;dwell in love&quot; (v. 16)</h4> <p>Perfect love:</p> <h4>Gives us boldness in the day of judgment (v. 17)</h4> <h4>Removes all fear (v. 18)</h4> <h3>Chapter 5</h3> <p>If we believe that Jesus is the Christ, we are born of God. We know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep His commandments. This is the love of God that we keep His commandments. Those who are born of God overcome the world by faith. The Spirit is truth. There are three that bear record in heaven . . . and these three are one. There are three that bear witness in earth . . . and these three agree in one. The witness of God is greater than the witness of men. We that believe have this witness in us. If we ask anything according to His will, He hears us and if He hears us, we have what we ask for. There is a sin not unto death. All unrighteousness is sin. He that is born of God keeps himself and does not sin.</p>

<h1>II John</h1> <h2>General Details</h2> <h3>Who it was written to:</h3> <p>Whereas the first letter of John was written to the Christian family in general, this second letter of John was written to a particular individual in that family whom he names as &quot;the elect lady and her children&quot;.</p> <h3>Why written:</h3> <p>He wrote to warn a hospitable Christian lady against entertaining false teachers and admonished her to be on the lookout for deceivers who were going about saying that Christ had not actually risen in the flesh. He also included an urgent plea that they should show their love for God and His son Jesus by obeying the commandment to love each other and live their lives in obedience to the Scriptures. </p> <h3>Theme:</h3> <p>The believer&apos;s duty to love and obey the truth and to avoid fellowship with its enemies</p> <h6>When written:</h6> <p>The Book of II John would most likely have been written at about the same time as John's other letters, I and III John, approximately A. D. 90</p> <h3>Where written:</h3> <p>Probably at Ephesus where John lived and ministered after leaving Jerusalem</p> <h3>Contents:</h3> <h2>I. Introduction 1:1-3</h2> <h2>II. Walk in truth, love and obedience 4-6</h2> <h2>III. Do not participate in heresy 7-11</h2> <h2>IV. Conclusion 12-13</h2> <h2>I. Introduction 1:1-3</h2> <p>John does not name himself in this letter, but begins this letter by simply introducing himself as &quot;the elder&quot;. No doubt her familiarity with him was such that no other introduction was necessary. He speaks of loving them in truth and for the truth. He pronounces grace, mercy and peace to them from the Father and the Son in truth and love.</p> <h2>II. Walk in truth, love and obedience 4-6</h2> <p>In v. 4, he rejoices that there were those who were walking in the truth and in v. 5 reiterates the command that they should love one another. In verse 6, he states that those who walk in love will walk in obedience to the Lord&apos;s commandments.</p> <h2>III. Do not participate in heresy 7-11</h2> <p>In verse 7, John speaks of the &quot;deceivers&quot; and how to identify them. In verses 8-9, he admonishes them to beware that they do not allow themselves to be influenced by these false teachers lest they not only lose reward, but lose their very relationship with God. In verses 10-11, he tells them not to receive them into their house or to bid them Godspeed lest they be partakers of their evil deeds. They must be careful not to aid them in any way in their evil work and so take part in it.</p> <h2>IV. Conclusion 12-13</h2> <p>John had many things he wanted to communicate to them, but chose to wait that he might tell them in person &quot;that our joy may be full&quot;. He passes on a greeting to them in closing. It is of utmost importance that we check everything we see, hear, and read, though it come under the label &quot;Christian,&quot; with the Scriptures. We cannot emphasize this too strongly because one of Satan&apos;s greatest weapons is deceit. It is very easy to be deceived by a new and exciting doctrine that appears to be based on the Word of God but which, if examined closely, is in fact a departure from it. If what we see, hear, and read does not line up explicitly with Scripture, then it is false and not of the Spirit, and we should have nothing to do with it.</p>

<h1>II John Study Questions</h1> <h2>What is the commandment that &quot;we had from the beginning&quot; that John reiterates?</h2> <h3>That we love one another</h3> <h2>How did John say we would know the many deceivers that have entered into the world?</h2> <h3>They &quot;confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh&quot;.</h3> <h2>How do we know that we &quot;have the Father and the Son&quot;?</h2> <h3>We will &quot;abide in the doctrine of Christ&quot;. i.e. we will live in obedience to the teachings and Word of Christ.</h3> </div> 

<h1>III John</h1> <h2>General Details</h2> <h3>Who it was written to:</h3> <p>John sent this short letter to Gaius, a member of a local church to whom John had sent teachers.</p> <h3>Why written:</h3> <p>To commend Gaius for receiving the teachers he had sent and who were entirely dependent on the hospitality of believers and to denounce Diotrepnes inhospitable and tyrannical actions.</p> <p>The reason John wrote this letter, judging from its contents, seems to be as follows: John had sent a group of teachers with letters of commendation to the various churches, one of which was the assembly to which Gaius and Diotrephes belonged. Diotrephes was in position of leadership of this church and because he &quot;loveth to have the preeminence among them&quot; (v. 9) would not show hospitality to these teachers. What&apos;s more, he would excommunicate any member of his church who would receive them. Gaius, a member of his church, refused to be intimidated and received these teachers who later reported his kindness to John. It seems that John was about to send these teachers out a second time (v. 6) and exhorts Gaius to continue his ministry of love to them. John apparently wrote a letter of remonstrance to Diotrephes, but was ignored. In response to this, John expressed his intention of paying a personal visit to this church and of deposing this ecclesiastical tyrant.</p> <h3>Theme:</h3> <p>The duty of hospitality toward the ministry and the danger of domineering leadership</p> <h3>When written:</h3> <p>The Book of III John was most likely written at about the same time as John's other letters, I and II John, approximately A. D. 90</p> <h3>Where written:</h3> <p>Probably at Ephesus where John lived and ministered after leaving Jerusalem</p> <h3>Contents:</h3> <h2>Introduction 1:1-4</h2> <h2>Encouragement for Gaius 5-8</h2> <h2>Do not follow that which is evil, but that which is good 9-12</h2> <h2>Conclusion 13-14</h2> <h2>Introduction 1:1-4</h2> <p>John does not name himself in this letter, but begins this letter by simply introducing himself as &quot;the elder&quot;. John probably didn&apos;t need to identify himself or to establish his authority because he was well known to the people of the local churches and his brief letter was carried to Gaius by the teachers whom he sent. John expresses a love for Gaius &quot;in the truth&quot; and a desire that he might prosper and be in health. He rejoices that he is walking in the truth.</p> <h2>Encouragement for Gaius 5-8</h2> <p>John commends Gaius for his hospitality to the traveling workers. He speaks of Gaius&apos; faithfulness and love for the brethren.</p> <p>John said that the teachers he had sent went &quot;taking nothing of the Gentiles&quot;. Apparently they took no provisions with them so they were dependant on the hospitality of the believers and the believers should receive them so that they might be &quot;fellowhelpers to the truth&quot;.</p> <h2>Do not follow that which is evil, but that which is good 9-12</h2> <h3>John tells them of the self-exalting and domineering Diotrephes &mdash; an evil example v. 9-10</h3> <p>In verse 11, John says, &quot;He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.&quot; It is impossible for an unregenerate sinner to &quot;do good,&quot; to walk in obedience to the Word of God. Only a born again believer can do the will of God and then only as he is empowered by the Spirit of God. The sinner does not have God&apos;s love working in his heart that he might love God or his brother as God requires in His Word. Nor does he have the grace of God to enable him to &quot;do good&quot; so his works show that he is not of God.</p> <h3>John also mentions the well-reported Demetrius &mdash; a good example v. 12</h3> <p>It is not certain who this Demetrius was, but the context lends to the belief that he was one of the teachers whom John had sent, possibly the one carrying the letter.</p> <h2>Conclusion 13-14</h2> <p>John had many things to write to them, but chose not to as he believed he would see them shortly at which time he would communicate these things to them in person.</p>

<h1>Jude</h1> <h2>General Details</h2> <h3>Who it was written to:</h3> <p>To believers in general</p> <h3>Why written:</h3> <p>To warn them against apostates within the church who, though having denied the faith, still retained their membership.</p> <h3>Theme:</h3> <p>The duty of Christians to keep themselves spotless and to contend earnestly for the faith in the midst of apostasy</p> <p>There is a similarity between Peter&apos;s second letter and that of Jude; they both deal with apostasy in the church and describe the leaders of that apostasy. Dealing with this subject it seems that Jude quotes from Peter. (Compare II Peter 3:3 and Jude 18) They both describe the same kind of false teachers &mdash; men of loose morals and shameful excesses. Also Peter describes a future apostasy whereas Jude speaks of it as present. Peter describes the false teachers as godless and extremely dangerous but not at their worst. Jude describes them as depraved and as lawless as they can be. Also it is interesting to note that Jude quotes directly from the book of Enoch, which is otherwise not part of the Bible canon. He cites Enoch's prophecy that the Lord would come with many thousands of his saints to render judgment on the whole world. He also paraphrases an incident in a text that has been lost about Satan and Michael quarrelling over the body of Moses.</p> <h3>When written:</h3> <p>Probably between 70 &amp; 80 A. D.</p> <h3>Contents:</h3> <h2>Introduction 1-2</h2> <h2>Warnings against the false 3-16</h2> <h2>Admonition and conclusion 17-25</h2> <h2>Introduction 1-2</h2> <p>The author of this letter is believed to be Jude, the brother of James and the half brother of Jesus. Mark 6:3 Jude begins this letter with a fairly formal introduction of himself calling himself by name and identifying himself as, &quot;the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James&quot;.</p> <h2>Warnings against the false 3-16</h2> <p>At first, Jude had intended to write to them concerning &quot;the common salvation&quot;, but because of the presence of false teachers, he had felt the need to warn them to contend for the truths of the Gospel v. 3-4.</p> <p>Jude illustrates the doom of such teachers by giving three examples from the Old Testament, namely His own people that believed not, the angels that kept not their first estate and Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them (v. 5-7). These men who continually gave themselves to their own sinful desires were guilty of fleshly sin and of rebellion against authority (v. 8) and spoke of authority in terms that Michael the archangel did not dare to use in addressing Satan (v. 9). These speak evil of things they do not understand and in the things they do understand by mere natural instinct, in these things they defile themselves (v. 10). Scripture (v. 11) and nature (vs. 12-13) prefigure their sin and their doom. These are the ones that Enoch prophesied of (v. 14-15). Jude describes these men as men who grumble and complain, who are not content with their lot in life, men who go after their own desires and are controlled by their passions, they are boastful and arrogant and show admiration for men&apos;s persons and pay people flattering compliments to gain advantage. They create divisions, are utterly fleshly (carnal) and do not have the Spirit of Christ (vs. 16-19).</p> <h2>Admonition and conclusion 17-25</h2> <p>Jude reminds the believers of the words of apostles in the past who had warned them of such men and admonishes them to build themselves up in the faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, continue in God&apos;s love, ever looking to Jesus (vs. 20-21). Their attitude toward those in error is they should have compassion on the weak ones who have wavered and others they are to save by great effort, but always watchful lest they should be defiled with the filthy garments of tainted doctrine and sensual living (vs. 22-23).</p> <p>Jude concludes by praising Him who is able to keep the believer from falling into apostasy and sin and who is able to present him blameless before His presence (vs. 24-25).</p>
