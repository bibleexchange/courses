		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must relate to a local body and not become an island to ourselves. To separate ourselves from the local body is unscriptural. We are all parts of the same body. Not one of us is to be independent of the other. It is God&rsquo;s plan and purpose that each member of his universal body be joined to a local body of Believers. A man, or woman, who refuses to join themselves to a local body of Believers often feels they are wasting their effort. This type of spirit is a rebellious and independent spirit and is contrary to Scripture. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Within the Old Testament tabernacle, there was a designated place of worship. The Believer was not to remain at home to worship. He was to gather with the local body in a designated place of worship. There is no Scriptural basis for remaining at home to worship while the local body is gathering even if you do enjoy the &ldquo;Electronic Evangelist&rdquo; more than the local elders.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Church order and leadership were clearly seen in the Old Testament. Aaron and his sons were a type of the N.T. fivefold ministry. (Eph 4:13) The watchmen on the walls of the cities of Israel are a type of the leaders of the N.T. church who are watching for our souls. It is the responsibility of the elders to guard against those with erroneous teachings who would kill and destroy the body. (Heb. 13:17) The shepherds upon the hillside of Judah and Israel were a type of God&rsquo;s chosen leadership for his church today. They are not only entrusted with the care and guidance of the flock but of feeding the flock of God with nourishing spiritual food.

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In his Word, God offers a pattern for the formation of local churches. First, he directed Believers to assemble together in given locations. (Heb. 10:25) Next he ordains where to establish a local church, often where not to.(Acts 16:6-10) God puts into place the leadership ministries he would have in each local assembly.(Acts 14:23) Though most in the church recognizes that God designates leaders, they do not give much thought about the fact that God also brings in &nbsp;&nbsp;embers. (I Cor. 12:18) We should carefully consider God&rsquo;s placement in the best church for them, especially in this day of running to and fro by many church members.(Job 1:7) If God sets us in a particular church as members or leaders, we must remain there until God moves us and not before. Never should we move because we have been offended.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Nowhere in Scripture does God teach a denominational type of church government. Each local church is to be a sovereign body, even though they are to enjoy fellowship with other local assemblies. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The church is first to be a spiritual &ldquo;organism&rdquo; and then to be an &ldquo;organization&rdquo;. Good church government will not produce spirituality. In the church of the living God, there must be life before structure. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After there is life, good structure in the form of church government will help to maintain life. As a family requires parents, and as a flock requires a shepherd, so the household of faith requires spiritual leaders. We need the fivefold ministry so that we may come to maturity within the body. (Eph. 4:11-13) Leaders cannot give what they do not possess. They must meet the scriptural qualifications seen in I Timothy 3. A common error today is the belief that we do not need men to lead us, that &ldquo;we have the Holy Spirit to lead us, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; The Spirit leads and governs the church through human vessels. (Heb. 13:17) To bypass everyone and seek leading only from God is usually the &nbsp;sign of a rebellious and independent spirit. These people often use a verse of Scripture out of context, such as, I Jn. 2:27 to justify refusing submission to God-anointed and God-called teachers. If we choose to reject the teaching that God has ordained, a strong oversight in the ministry within the Body of Christ, God will permit us to find isolated Scriptures to satisfy our rebellion and independence. God appoints leaders and directs them to set the house in order. (II Thess. 2:10-12)</span><a name="_Toc306116093"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></a></p><h1 class="csC1DF526">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Since we are living in the last days we must completely open to the moving of the Holy Ghost, who is endeavoring to restore the New Testament pattern to the Local Church. The ministry of the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; was restored when the Word of God was once again given its rightful place among the people of God after having come out of the Dark Ages or the Devils millennium. During this time the Word was withheld from the body of Christ and held only in the hands of an elite, select group of so-called theologians.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In these last days the Spirit is striving to restore the ministry of the &ldquo;works&rdquo; of Jesus by empowering the Believer to do the same works that He did.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 57.75pt;"><span class="csC382D2BB">Verily, verily I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do he shall do also: and greater works then these shall he; because I go unto my father</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. (John 14:12)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	God is challenging the representatives of His Church to break away from tradition and to get into the flow of the Spirit if we ever expect to progress toward God&rsquo;s ideal for the Local Church. Those who refuse to move with the Holy Ghost are the ones who bring division to the Body of Christ. Jesus taught us that, just as you can&rsquo;t put new wine into old wine skins, the fullness of the Holy Ghost cannot enter old contaminated lives (Matthew 9:16-17). Even the Church has crawled into the ditch of &ldquo;this is the way we have always done it.&rdquo; It is time to break from these traditions under the leadership of the Holy Ghost.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	It is often those who want to flow with the Spirit who are forced to out of their nests - out of their accustomed place of worship and body of worshipers. When this happens you may mistakenly feel it is man who has forced you out. In reality, it is God leading you to higher heights and deeper depths in Him. Even though it is God&rsquo;s hand leading you, a time of shock and disorientation will inevitably follow this upheaval. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	It is important that we recognize our life and ministry after a spiritual shake-up. The old rubble must be removed if we are to ever to rebuild according to the pattern the Lord has shown us. We must also remember that, as in Nehemiah&rsquo;s day, God is able to take some of the old charred stones from the rubble, clean them up and use them in the rebuilding process. It would be a mistake to write off each and every one who seemed to be resisting the purpose of God&rsquo;s pattern since they may be the very ones that God will restore and use in His rebuilding process.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	We must strive in every respect to see that the New Testament patter is restored to the Local Church. This can only occur with a combination of the intensive study of all Scriptures and the anointing of the Holy Ghost. We should never settle for second best. Copies are never as good as the originals they attempt to mimic. Rehoboam discovered the inadequacy of copies when he built shields of &ldquo;brass&rdquo; to replace the shields of &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; which his father, Solomon, had made.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	We must always reach for the &ldquo;IDEAL&rdquo; which God has revealed by his spirit and in His Word. Sadly, we are living in a day when people are ready to believe and accept anything that has any semblance whatsoever to God. Scripture exhorts us to go on unto perfection and we must strive for the ideal in our life and work for the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	We must that which has been revealed thus far and work with the Spirit to build upon it. To do this we must be flexible without compromising. It is possible to blend and maintain an uncompromising Spirit at the same time. Many have become so pliable that they played into satan&rsquo;s hand and have shipwrecked their faith as well as that of those who follow. Others become so ridged in their old ways that they have become stagnant in their experience and work for the Lord. I am in no advocating leaving the old paths of holiness for the new so-called social gospel. In reality, the social gospel is no gospel at all. Remember, I stressed the importance of flexibility while remaining uncompromising.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Sadly, many have lost sight of God&rsquo;s plan and purpose for the Local Church. &nbsp;All too often a great move of God&rsquo;s Spirit is followed by the organization of a new denomination or, at least, a body of churches formed under one central headquarters. These organizations are formed in an effort to maintain doctrinal truth and purity within the church. However, as we shall see further in our study, the organization has done just the opposite of what it was intended to do.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	As we study God&rsquo;s pattern for the Local Church, we must properly interpret Scriptures or, as Paul said, &ldquo;rightly dividing the Word of Truth,&rdquo; (2Timothy 2:15b). At this time, I would like to mention a few major principles for interpreting the Scriptures:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Scriptures must be interpreted as follows:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Literally</span></li><li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Morally</span></li><li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Prophetically</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First, I will discuss the &ldquo;literal&rdquo; or &ldquo;historical&rdquo; method of interpreting the Scriptures. It is very helpful to have a working knowledge of the history, geography, culture, and language of the Bible. Often, the &ldquo;literal&rdquo; is the key to the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;. In our day too many people have such inner conviction that the Holy Ghost will teach them that they ignore the necessity of an in-depth study on their own with teachers who are under the anointing of the Holy Ghost. As dry and unspiritual as a meticulous study of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; aspects of the Bible may seem at times, we must always remember that as we dig into the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; we will find the Spiritual.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Secondly, as we strive to interpret Scripture, we must consider the &ldquo;principle&rdquo; or &ldquo;moral&rdquo; teaching found in every text under study. We can only do this by thinking about that which may be applied to any and every age or period of time. This type of study will consist more of application than interpretation. In order to discover the moral teaching of many Scriptures, it is necessary to know the meaning of names and places first. Then, as you see the Old Testament story unfold before you, you will begin to see the many principles which apply to our day. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The last principle of interpretation that I will consider is the &ldquo;prophetic&rdquo; or &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; means of interpreting Scriptures. When we study the Bible in this manner, we must remember that the overall plan of God points to the Church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><a href="#_ftn0" name="_ftn_GoBack0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[1]</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;The prophetical interpretation of Scripture always requires an ample amount of proof texts for each point or doctrine we wish to emphasize.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Jesus himself taught us that he veils truth from those whose ears are dull and whose hearts are closed (Matthew 13:10-17). To really understand the Word of God, it must be in our hearts and not just in our heads. It is necessary for us to have a proper Spiritual experience to properly interpret the Word of God. Because God wants his children to serve and obey him of their own free will, he has left enough loopholes in Scripture for those who desire to continue in their own willful ways, to do so. As ironic as it seems, he will permit them, by taking a Scripture out of context or by reading into it what they desire to see, to find Scripture to convince themselves of the eras they wish to embrace (2Thessalonians 2:10-11). </span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftn_GoBack1"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[2]</sup></span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	It is absolutely necessary that those who genuinely desire to walk in all of God&rsquo;s truth remain spiritually sensitive less they also be deceived. It is especially confusing when we see ones who reject certain revealed truth moving in the ministries in gifts of the spirit, or seemingly doing so. It is important to note that is as important as the gifts of the spirit are they are indicative of spiritual maturity. Spiritually maturity is evidenced by a life abounding in the fruits of the spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) and a life persisting in obedience to all the revealed will of God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Some key questions to ask ourselves as we study the Scriptures are:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs51A9ED8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Obvious sense of a passage of Scripture is not to be ignored. Do not try to read some deep spiritual truth into a Scripture portion by excluding the obvious. Don&rsquo;t forget, that which was natural came first and then that which is spiritual. Adam &ndash; Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The key is always near the door, a difficult passage may be explained by another passage which is very clear. Even the Old Testament is understood by the New Testament. Every Doctrinal truth has its headquarters passage. &nbsp;At the same time, all Scripture pertaining to that doctrine must fit into the doctrine itself.	 Do not come to a dogmatic conclusion about any given doctrinal truth until all Scriptures pertaining to that doctrine can fit into your conclusions. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Do not think that God has chosen to conceal his divine truth. He definitely desires to reveal His spiritual realities to us. He does this progressively, piece by piece, as we have already seen in Isaiah 28:9-13. He begins this revelation by the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; which are seen in the Old Testament, then leads us on to the &ldquo;spiritual truths&rdquo; or &ldquo;realities&rdquo;, which are seen in the New Testament. Revelation leads progressively to the cross, to the &ldquo;ONE NEW MAN&rdquo;. He is endeavoring to bring us into the fullness of the stature of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The truths that the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; or &ldquo;natural&rdquo; portray are permanent but the natural objects themselves are not. We must see the meaning behind many of the natural terms used in the Old Testament to rightly discern the spiritual truths portrayed (i.e. Jew, Israel, covenant, circumcision, Zion, etc.). These terms are used to point to the progressive work of God. Always keep in the foreground of your mind&rsquo;s eye that God does not retrogress. God restores without retrogressing. He is using Old Testament words with a new center of focus. That center is the cross of Christ. We need the eyes of our hearts enlightened (Ephesians 1:18).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	As we look at the natural, we may consider the nation of Israel. She must blend in with the Church. Her restoration today could well be a type of God&rsquo;s work in restoring the New Testament pattern to the Church in these last days. God is pointing us to the spiritual while we observe the natural dealings of God with humanity. Those who emphasize the natural dealings or works of God, have very little capacity for the spiritual truths that those natural things are striving to convey.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In this Chapter we&rsquo;ve gone from the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; to the &ldquo;substance&rdquo;, from the &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, to the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;, and this is no time to retrogress to the natural or the shadow. Let us go on unto perfection, to completion in Him. The Church is, and will continue to be, throughout this age, God&rsquo;s means of revealing His will and purpose for humanity.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h1 class="csC1DF526">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples and instructed them for 40 days, after which he ascended to heaven.

The disciples were filled with the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:4), and the apostle Peter preached his first sermon, urging men to repent and believe in Jesus Christ as their Messiah and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (verse 38). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Pentecost is named after the Greek word </span><span class="cs619CFE26">pentekostos,</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"> which means 50th.

The truth was there even if those who lived at the time didn&rsquo;t comprehend it. Now it has been revealed by his spirit. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The church was instituted by Christ-it came into being through the Life and Ministry of Christ himself. The entire message of the church was centered on Christ from the very beginning (Genesis 3:15; Revelation 13:8). </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">As we look into the life and ministry of Christ we see God&rsquo;s revelation of His Eternal Purpose. For example Christ writes in Hebrews 1:1,2 &ldquo;God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom, also he made the worlds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">When Jesus said, &ldquo;I will build my church,&rdquo; in Matthew 16:18, he was leading us from the type to the anti-type, from the shadow to the substance, from the natural to the spiritual. This is nothing more then the fulfillment of the natural order of events. Contrary to the belief of some, the rock upon which Christ was to build his church, was the revelation of who he was and the public confession that Peter referred to when he said, &ldquo;thou art Christ, the son of the living God&rdquo; (Matthew 16:16). With this revelation, the foundation of the church was laid. Our task is to build upon this foundation, keeping in mind that Christ is both the foundation and chief cornerstone of a great Building, the church.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">All natural barriers cease to exist when the church came into existence. Now all Holy Ghost filled believers are a part of that building. Everyone baptized into the body of Christ are living stones within the house of God. There is no longer a separate plan for Jew and Gentile. All the saved are one family in Him, all the Holy Ghost filled saints are one body in him. There are still prophesies to be fulfilled, which pertain to certain nations, but these will not take priority over God&rsquo;s plan for his Church and they will in no way hinder the progress of God&rsquo;s great building, THE CHURCH, THE BODY/BUILDING of Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s plan. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Just as the church was portrayed in the Old Testament and instituted by Christ, the Holy Ghost is structuring it today. In the same way old wine skins can not hold new wine, it is necessary to provide new structure for the church. This new structure is seen as an organism. The church throughout the New Testament is portrayed as a body. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">For a body to be effective each member must function properly. The ministry of the body depends on the whole body and not on one or even just a few members of the body. Christ is the head of this body, the King of the Kingdom. We make up the entire body and are a part of him. The head is unable to function without the rest of the body and, in like manner, the body can not function without the head. Our relationship with him is often likened in scripture to the husband and wife relationship. The body of believers complement Christ and are to become complete in him. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Christ dwells in the church by His Spirit. As Christ dwelt in a fleshly body to become the sacrifice for sin, today he dwells in his body, (The Church) for the purpose for rescuing sinners. Are we allowing him to accomplish this great mission through His body, which body we are a part? </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The church is a living organism. Adam, as God&rsquo;s son (Genesis 2:7) is a type of the church today. The church is made up of believers who are the children of God with the promise to become fully matured sons of God (1John 3:2). As the bride was taken from Adam, while he was in a deep sleep (Genesis 2:21), so the bride of Christ will be taken out of the church while the church is asleep. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this be the day?</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Jesus said, concerning the living organism of which the church is to be, &ldquo;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&rdquo;. Also, the apostle John, in first John 5:11,12 wrote that:</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&ldquo; this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his son. He that hath the son hath life; and he that hath not the son of God hath not life.&rdquo; Obtaining life and proclaiming life to others is what the church is all about. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	In an analogy of the church as the body of Christ, the work of the Holy Ghost can be seen as similar to the work of the circulatory system. His job is to give life to the body by flowing through all of the believers. In the same way as God gave man a skeletal system, God has also given the church a set form. The skeletal system of man provides him with shape and form and sets all parts in their appropriate place, so God has provided an organizational structure for the church to follow which allows the body to function effectively. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Just as the blood flows through our natural bodies, the Holy Ghost flows through the body of believers. The scripture tells us that &ldquo;the life of all flesh is the blood (Leviticus 17:14)?&rdquo;. It is the Holy Ghost that gives the spiritual body life. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">It is only as each member permits the spirit to flow through him or her, that health and the ability to function effectively will be maintained in the entire body. It is the Holy Ghost that keeps each member healthy and active in the Work of God. The body can only function properly if each member is capable of accomplishing his appointed purpose within the body. This can only come to pass as individuals allow the Holy Ghost to flow through them with both gifts and graces to minister to the needs of the rest of the body. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">For anybody to function properly it not only needs the flowing of life spoken of in the previous paragraph, it must also have a set form. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">In Genesis 2:7 it is stated that &ldquo;the LORD God formed man&rdquo;. This refers to the fact that the LORD shaped man with organization. Even a casual observation of the human body comes up with the conclusion that man is truly, &ldquo;fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalms 139:14), man is put together in an organized fashion. &nbsp;The organization of the church provides her with shape and form, just as the skeletal system does for the physical body. It supports the organs, holding each in its place, enabling them to relate to the other properly. Just as the skeletal system is necessary for life, organization is necessary for spiritual life in the church. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The organizational structure within the church must be kept as simple as possible and in accordance with the pattern revealed in the scripture. However, if we ignore organization all together we are disobedient to God&rsquo;s order. The scriptural pattern for the organization of the church is very basic. &nbsp;The groups of officers of the church are called elders and deacons. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The elders are always presented in the scripture in the plural form. For example, it is stated in Acts 14:23 that, &ldquo;they had ordained them elders in every church.&rdquo;17There should be more then one elder in each local church. They must be qualified scripturally (1Timothy 3:1-7, Titus 1:5-9) before being placed into the governmental leadership of the house of God. Elders may follow into one of five ministerial categories or perform multiple of any or all of these ministries, presented in Ephesians 4:11 &ldquo;and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;The witness of the Holy Ghost to the individual reveals the ministry or ministries to which elders are called. Only then is it confirmed by the same spirit through gifts of the Holy Ghost and then shown unto other elders to the body. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	The very title deacon implies the duties they will perform. The word itself means servant. They were called to serve in the temporal duties of church work (Acts 6:1-4). Deacons are to be spiritual men with a holy love for the body even though their work is to be more on the natural or physical level. The purpose of calling them into existence was to release the elders from temporal duties so that they could give themselves to the spiritual aspects of the work of God. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">When the twelve apostles called for the selection of seven assistants&rsquo;, deacons, to perform the natural work that was claiming much of their work, they proclaimed in Acts 6:2 &ldquo;it is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">It is obvious from the appointment of the deacons, that God is concerned with the natural every day needs of our life as well as with our spiritual needs. You will notice in Acts 6:1, that the widows were being neglected because the apostles were overloaded with not only the spiritual aspects of the work but also the natural.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">This brings us to a truth, found in Acts 6:2, which is often neglected in our day of &ldquo;super-spiritualism and mysticism&rdquo;. REASON or COMMON SENSE has a very important, indispensable, role in the work of God. Notice the wording of the apostles &ldquo;it is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables&rdquo;. The results of dividing the natural and spiritual aspects of the word of God are recorded in Acts 6:7, &ldquo;the word of God increased and the number of disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">This confirms the wisdom of both the appointment of the deacons of the natural tasks, and the releasing of the elders for the spiritual work in the church. If we lack reason or common sense we are not spiritual at all.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The more heavenly minded you are the more earthly good you will become. There are those who lack common sense. The men chosen to be deacons were to be spiritual men, with a concern for the everyday needs for those within the church. Even though their work is temporal, the deacons must also be qualified scripturally (1Timothy 3:8-13).</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	The church, structured by the Holy Ghost, has been striped of her glory by false doctrine and spiritual decline. Historically, when Gods people have sinned by disobedience, rebelling, and unbelief, they have been given over to their enemies for chastisement. The church has surely had her dark ages. The climb in apostasy which was spoken of as coming upon her in the last days, has come upon us today. Apostasy and decline begin with leaders. In order to have any lasting restoration we must have restored leaders, &ldquo;and there shall be, like people, like priests&rdquo; (Hosea 4:9). As leaders of God&rsquo;s flock we can not expect the flock to rise any higher then we are ourselves. During the period of time when Hosea wrote this passage, there was a dearth of the knowledge of God and an increase of sin and corruption seen within the priesthood. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">God proclaims that, because of this lack of knowledge, not only leaders but the people would utterly fall (Hosea 4:6,14). Joel, in chapters 1 and 2 of his prophesies, presents us with a vivid picture of spiritual decline and restoration. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Revelations, chapters 2 and 3, are prophetic of different periods of times throughout the church age. The scriptures show some definite sin problems which progressed until complete corruption prevailed. These problems included but were not limited to, &ldquo;loss of first love&rdquo; (Revelation 2:4,) &nbsp;but fell into blasphemy in 2:9 </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The blessed hope that we have is God will have a people in the last days.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

We are God&rsquo;s building and he is not going to have a rundown shack, but a temple fit for the king to dwell in. When he finishes with his church, how glorious it will be! </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">God has made every provision for his church to be built and restored as he would have it (Ephesians 4:9-15). The purpose of the five fold ministry of the elders is to bring his church to maturity, perfection, and completeness. It will be a glorious church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. We will give praise to him (Ephesians 1:12-14). &nbsp;19 One thing that points to the fact that God will send a revival and restoration in these last days is the fact that Jesus hasn&rsquo;t returned which proves that there is still some restoration to be completed. Peter states, in Acts 3:20-21 that, &ldquo;he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, since the world began&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The basic truth, associated with the tabernacle of David (Acts 15:13-17), is that there is to be a restoration of praise and worship. This restoration can even now, be seen transpiring before our eyes.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;(Joel 2:23) &ldquo;he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain in the first month&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">The early rain refers to God bestowing on us the power of the Holy Ghost which the early church had, while the latter rain refers to God pouring out upon us the power which this last century church has experienced, especially in the early 1900&rsquo;s as seen in men like smith Wigglesworth. </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Jesus asks that we acknowledge this on a daily basis when he taught us how to pray, &ldquo;thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.&rdquo; (Matthew 6:10).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	First, let us look at his rule on earth. God only rules where his rule is acknowledged. His earthly rule only exists on two levels. On the first level, he rules in the lives and heart of the individual believer. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Are study is more concerned with the second, the local assembly of believers. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The scriptures reveal several things about the kingdom. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First, the good news of Christ is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew reports, &ldquo;Jesus went about preaching the gospel of the Kingdom.&rdquo; (Matthew 4:23). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Second, the kingdom is at hand here and now. John the Baptist commanded us, in Matthew 3:2, to &ldquo;repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Third, entrance into the kingdom is only through the new birth. Jesus emphasized this in his interview with Nicodemus when he said, &ldquo;except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God,&rdquo; (John3:3). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Forth, the kingdom is within the believer. When the Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied that, &ldquo;behold, the kingdom of God is within you&rdquo; (Luke 17:21). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Even while on earth, as believers we have a part of the affairs in the kingdom. The scriptures teach us emphatically that we have authority over angels, demon, disease, the world, and sin. (1Corintians 6:2-3, Mark 16:17-18, Romans 6:11-14). This authority should not be mistaken for a guarantee that the believer will not suffer any tribulation. Even though we have the power to work miracles, we must remember that in this present state in the kingdom, there is a degree of tribulation involved. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul exhorted the believers of his day who were subjected to much persecution by assuring them &ldquo;that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (Acts 14:22). Jesus also warned, in John 16:33, that &ldquo;in the world you should have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.&rdquo;. As we face the trails of life let us ascertain that we are in Christ. It is only as we are in him, that we are found to be overcomers, worthy to be a member in the kingdom at the time of the end when Christ subjecting himself to the father presents the kingdom unto him (1Corinthians 15:24). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	There are numerous erroneous views concerning the kingdom. Some see it all Jewish. If this is so, there is not one scripture concerning the kingdom, which could relate to the church. Others see the kingdom as all future. If it were all future, none of the scriptures pertaining to the kingdom could relate to today. Still others see the kingdom as all literal and leave no room for any spiritual application to the scriptures speaking to us of the kingdom. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	God fit truth together to fit his eternal plan. Man tends to separate and categorize truth, forgetting that he has a limited vision of god&rsquo;s eternal plan for the ages. The kingdom is not separate from God&rsquo;s plan. It blends in with the church of the living God. Which is God&rsquo;s one new Man, his holy nation and royal priesthood. Christ died for the Church he came to build. His dealings are first with the church, God&rsquo;s spiritual Israel, and then with the nations. The millennial reign will simply be a continuation of the one great kingdom of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE6E4F8C4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In summery, we have briefly studied what the Bible has to say about the kingdom. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We have seen that the kingdom and the church are one. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must endeavor to see the kingdom in its spiritual form now and not just as a natural reality for the future. As all studies of the Holy Scriptures, we must give the Holy Ghost freedom to apply the scriptures concerning God&rsquo;s entire kingdom to our lives. It may mean being open to truths contrary to traditional views of the kingdom. Jesus was an example of this when he rebuked the religious people of his day to holding so rigidly to traditions that they couldn&rsquo;t see the true teachings of the scriptures (Mark 7:5-9). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	While studying the kingdom, as with any other doctrine of the scriptures, each and every scripture pertaining to that subject must fit into the doctrinal conclusions you arrive at. If you can&rsquo;t fit each scripture into your conclusion, it would be best to draw no conclusion at all, until the Holy Ghost is able to open the eyes of your heart to the matter. As Paul writes in Ephesians 1:18, &ldquo;the eyes of your understanding being enlightened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The church is in Christ, unbelieving Israel as a nation is not. Paul explains in Rom. 9:31-33: &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">but Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness. Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but as it were, by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone. As it is written: &quot;Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense, and whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After Paul is saved and filled with the Holy Ghost we begin to hear of churches being </span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">established</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> &ldquo;Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (Acts 9:31).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Barnabas was to go as far as Antioch (Acts 11:22), and they quickly developed Acts 13:1. they were called the churches of the Gentiles (Rom.16:4).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Holy Ghost Believers are the body and Christ &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">He is the head of the body, the church</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, (Col 1:18), Eph. 5:23 </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Christ is head of the church</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">;&rdquo; &nbsp; Christ is the head of his body the church, which did not exist until after Christ ascended (Eph. 4:7-11, Eph. 1:22).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Holy Ghost filled Believers become a living temple, each person is united with the others like bricks in a building. in the old Testament Israel had a physical temple, the Holy Spirit did not dwell in every person who had faith.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The church is from &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; (Rev. 5:9).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The terms Israel and the church should never be confused.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;In the book of Acts, both Israel and the church exist simultaneously.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">------------------------</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">Eph 2:11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; &nbsp;12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: &nbsp;13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. &nbsp;14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The new entity the church is made by &ldquo;the blood of His cross&rdquo; not the Old Testament sacrifices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col 1:20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christ&rsquo;s blood that purchased the church, again distinguishing the sacrifices of the Old covenant that was for Israel.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s purpose was to bring a spiritual birth to us individually and bring both Jews and Gentiles that were separated to be together a new entity- called the Church. Jesus sent the one He promised to empower them for the ministry so they would carry the message to the world. Acts 1:5 views Spirit baptism, our entrance into Christ and becoming the church as a future event. The church was birthed by the Spirit at Pentecost, Israel existed for 1500 years prior</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After the Holy Spirit gave the church its birth, Acts 2:33 everyone throughout history that believes in the gospel continues to become part of the church by spirit baptism (1 Cor.12:13), by being baptized in &nbsp;the Spirit. You don&rsquo;t join a church you are baptized into it. The Greek word for church is is ekklesia (used 114 times in the New Testament) it means a called out assembly (Ek = out of Kaleo= to call).</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Until the New Testament, the Church was &nbsp;a Mystery</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Eph 5:32&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Church of God was known only in types and shadows before Christ came and and before the Holy Ghost was given in Acts chapter two.

But the church is not in the Old Testament. Why?</span></p><p class="cs19A9F50E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Matt 16:18&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock </span><span class="csBAF33195">I will build My church,</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Throughout the New Testament the church is liken a house built upon a foundation- which is Jesus and those who confess who He is as Peter did. Since one did not (nor could not) confess this in the Old Testament they cannot accurately say the nation of Israel was the Church. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is only in this passage and Mt.18 that a church is first mentioned, and the prevailing view would be His instructions for the future.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	It is imperative to our study of the local church that we understand the difference between the &ldquo;Church&rdquo; and &ldquo;Churches&rdquo;. The Church, when it refers to the universal body of believers, speaks of god&rsquo;s general overall plan as given in the message of Ephesians. The church, when it refers to a local body of believers, speaks of tangible, real manifestation of His body in a given locality.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The &ldquo;Church&rdquo; is mystical, invisible, universal, and general. Jesus was referring to the church when he said, in Matthew 16:18, &ldquo;...upon this Rock, I will build my Church.&rdquo; It is singular, for God has only on &ldquo;Church&rdquo;. It is the same Church in the past, present, and future.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The &ldquo;churches&rdquo; are real, concrete, visible, local and specific. Matthew speaks to us of a specific local group of believers when he writes, &ldquo;Tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church,&rdquo; (Matthew 18:15-17). It is the &ldquo;Universal Church,&rdquo; as it is taking on local or temporal form. Revelation chapters 2 and 3 were written to specific local churches, as were numerous other epistles such as Ephesians, Galatians, I and II Corinthians, Philippians, I and II Thessalonians. Thus we see that it is the local church with which we have to deal and that all local churches are part of the universal church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	he word &ldquo;Church,&rdquo; Greek &ldquo;Ekklesia,&rdquo; means, &ldquo;to summon forth&rdquo; or, &ldquo;to call out the people&rdquo;. The equivalent in Hebrew is &ldquo;Qahal&rdquo; which is often translated &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; or &ldquo;Congregation.&rdquo; It is used 70 times in the Old Testament in such scriptures as Psalms 22:22 when David writes: &ldquo;...In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.&rdquo; In the Old Testament it has the connotation of summoning forth for the purpose of hearing from God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In the New Testament the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; also included the thought of being called &nbsp;for an purpose-- even for a town meeting. This usage is seen in Acts 19:32-41 when the town clerk of Ephesus spoke to Demetrius and his followers of the necessity of solving town problems in a lawful assembly which precluded the necessity for individuals taking matters into their own hands.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In our study of the word &ldquo;Ekklesia&rdquo; we will be considering it in the context of a local body of believers gathered together for worship and fellowship. &ldquo;Church&rdquo; was a common word in use in New Testament times. It was frequently used in speaking of a gathering, and , as always, Jesus and the writer of the New Testament used words as familiar to their hearers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	As we consider the &ldquo;Ministry&rdquo; of the church we must recognize that it consists of REAL people, with REAL needs, in a given locality. Thus, as seen in I Corinthians 11:29-32, we must properly discern the Body of Christ and its needs. If we are going to have any REAL MINISTRY, our vision must not only be in the MYSTICAL REALM. We must relate tot he local body as an active organ or member of that body.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	No man is an Island unto himself. To separate ourselves from the local body is unscriptural. It is the same as a man choosing to live his life without any national affiliation. We are all parts and joints of the same body. Paul teaches this in Ephesians 4:16 when he wrote:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;For whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which, 	every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every 	part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The effectiveness of our ministry, individually or collectively, depends upon the spiritual health of each member and their relationship to each other. Not on of us is to be independent of the others.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In our day there is a lack of emphasis on the necessity for any form of local structure, which requires local leadership. Today, many do not seem to realize that the local church is God&rsquo;s permanent order for this, the Church Age. The structure of the local church mat vary with size or locality, but, none the less, it is still God&rsquo;s order fro this age. The local church is God&rsquo;s pattern for evangelizing the world and bringing his people to maturity.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Violation of God&rsquo;s ordained order is the main cause of confusion and of much wasted effort within the Body of Christ. A man, or woman, who refuses to join themselves to a local body of believers often feels like they are wasting their effort just as the children of Israel must have felt when they wandered in the wilderness. The unaffiliated believer may also feel the same confusion as the children of Israel felt when they were in captivity in Babylon. It is God&rsquo;s plan and purpose that each member of his universal Body be joined to a local Body of Believers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Church order and leadership were clearly seen in the Old Testament. Aaron and his four sons, the Tabernacle Officers, was a type of the fivefold ministry seen in the New Testament. Aaron and his sons and the New Testament Elders were given responsibility for the spiritual oversight of God&rsquo;s people. Many of the leadership positions held by those in the Old Testament are types of the positions held by New Testament leaders.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The Levites of old can easily be compared to the Deacons of the New Testament. &nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Levites in the Old Testament and the Deacons in the New Testament were responsible for the physical, temporal duties within the local body of believers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Within the tabernacle itself, there was to be a designated place of worship. The believer was not to remain at home to worship. He was to gather with the Local Body in a designated place of worship:</span><a name="_GoBack"></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;there shall be a place which the Lord you God shall choose to call his name to 	dwell there...Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every 	place that thou seest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	(Deuteronomy 12:11, 13)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is no scriptural basis for remaining at home to worship while the local body is gathering even if you do enjoy the Electronic Evangelist more than the Local Elders. This type of spirit is a rebellious and independent spirit and is contrary to the clear teaching of the Word of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The WATCHMEN on the walls of the cities of Israel are a type of the leaders of the New Testament Church who are watching for our souls. In Hebrews 13:17, believers are urged to:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they &ldquo;WATCH&rdquo; for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Just as the life and welfare of the city and its inhabitants depended upon the alertness of the WATCHMAN, so the life and welfare of the Body of Believers depends upon the alertness of the Elders. It is the responsibility of the Elders to guard against those who would steal in unawares, with erroneous teachings and charisma, to destroy and to kill.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The SHEPHERDS upon the hillside of Judah and Israel were a type of God&rsquo;s chosen leadership for his church today. Today&rsquo;s leaders are not only the leaders of God&rsquo;s spiritual flock. They are not only entrusted with the care and guidance of the flock but also with the responsibility of feeding the flock of God with wholesome and nourishing spiritual food.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	If God&rsquo;s present day &ldquo;SHEPHERD&rdquo; will grow good green pastures to feed the flock sufficiently, he will amply provide for the needs of the flock God has given him. He may even notice that some sheep from less fertile pastures will break through the fence and feed in his pasture. God will add to his flock in the most unusual ways.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	God uses the terminology of the shepherd when making reference to his people and leaders in the New Testament. Paul, in Acts 20:28, warned the Elders of Ephesus to:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the 	Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, feed the church of God, which He hath 	purchased with his own blood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Various terms such as &ldquo;Feed,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pastor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shepherd,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; are used to make reference to those who have oversight of His flock.</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftn_GoBack2"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[3]</sup></span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In the Old Testament the office of PROPHET was very important in the spiritual aspect of leadership. The PROPHET was to speak to the people fro God more often than not. The call to be a prophet was accompanied by the call to a holiness walk before the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	A study of the lives of the Old Testament Prophets reveals that this was not only a very lonely ministry but also a physically dangerous one. It was, however, a very rewarding ministry spiritually. A good example of the way in which God rewards His prophets can be seen in the manner in which God called Elijah home:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;...there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both 	asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven,&rdquo; (II Kings 2:11)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In these last days, the ministry of the Prophet is to be restored in a vivid fashion. As we look around, the need for the ministry of the prophets is ver evident. Will you answer the call to the Prophetic Ministry?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	It is time for us to look at church Leadership specifically in the context of the New Testament. First and foremost is the teaching concerning the fivefold ministry, which is found in Ephesians 4:8-15.</span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftn_GoBack3"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[4]</sup></span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The fivefold ministry is referred to as &ldquo;GOD&rsquo;S GIFT&rdquo; to the church for the purpose of bringing her to maturity and unity. God has often chosen the &ldquo;SPOILS&rdquo; of the battle--men who were base, uncouth, and crude--to sanctify and fit for leadership positions. What precious gifts the fivefold ministry is to the church!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Just as the individual members cannot function properly unless they are in the context of the local body, men called to the fivefold ministry were given to the local church. In order to function effectively in their given ministry they must join themselves to the local body and move in and out from the local body.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The New Testament carries a stronger emphasis upon spiritual leadership then does the Old Testament. The New Testament is the spiritual fulfillment of the Old Testament leadership, which we have previously studied.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The book of Acts offers a good pattern for studying strong leadership in the local church. It offers the workable illustration of the teachings of the Epistles. In the early chapters of Acts we see a very simple form of government, beginning with only Apostles, then adding Deacons and finally Elders in all the churches. Elders included all of the Fivefold Ministry and not just the Apostles.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The book of Acts also shows the development of the local churches. All of the Epistles were to a local church or to an Elder within the local church. There were about 25 to 30 Local Assemblies mentioned in the New Testament. The letters to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 were written to the messengers (Angels), or pastors, of each of those local churches. In the early church, Angels were spoken of as &ldquo;WATCHERS&rdquo;. We might see these letters to the church as Christ&rsquo;s message, through the prophet, to the pastors of the churches.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Strong leadership</span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftn_GoBack4"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[5]</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is the clear teaching of the New Testament. Even though the New Testament mandates a strong leadership, the structure itself is always kept simple, the simpler the better. Simplicity eliminates the power struggles, which occur so frequently among leadership ministries today.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	A spirit of antichrist, nothing new to human society, seems to prevail in our day. It was present in the apostle John&rsquo;s time (I John 4:1-4), and is seen even more strongly today. As believers, we need not fear this spirit but we need to be watchful, those of us who are called into leadership ministries must be especially vigilant. We must always remember that He that is within us is greater than the spirit of antichrist, which is in the World.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The spirit of antichrist is vividly manifested today in the breakdown of authority seen on every hand. It has touched every facet of life--&rdquo;civic&rdquo;, &ldquo;secular&rdquo;, &ldquo;military&rdquo;, &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;, and has even effected the &ldquo;church&rdquo;. Scriptures exhort us to emphasize the necessity of submission to those in authority in the church, the home, civil government, on the job, and in the military. We must earnestly contend for this truth lest the enemy gain an advantage over us. Don&rsquo;t allow a rebellious, unsubmissive spirit to control any phase of your life. This spirit will surely bring destruction.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The spirit of antichrist is endeavoring to coerce us into denying that Christ &ldquo;IS COME&rdquo; in the flesh.</span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftn_GoBack5"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[6]</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Christ is very present in his body today and he will continue to be present throughout this age. Are we not the body of Christ here on earth and does he not dwell in that body in a ver real way? Paul answers this question in Colossians 1:27 when he speaks of: &ldquo;...Christ in you, the hope of glory,&rdquo; and again in II Corinthians 4:10,11 when he writes: &ldquo;...that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The enemy of our soul is trying very hard to bring the believer to a point where he no longer recognizes the salvation given him by Christ&rsquo;s death in redemption and his continuing salvation experience. If the enemy can bring us to the point where we no longer properly discern the body of Christ many of us will experience sickness and some will even die prematurely as is indicated in I Corinthians 11:29,30. Foolishly, we frequently seem to tempt God as we blatantly and boldly strut about as though these verses did not exist in God&rsquo;s Holy Word.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In establishing proper authority within the local church, the Holy Ghost will never violate the priesthood of the believer. He will not hinder the effectiveness o the ministry of the individual as he functions in the body. Proper Scriptural leadership doesn&rsquo;t bring bondage. To the contrary, it brings liberty. God&rsquo;s work isn&rsquo;t moved forward b men&rsquo;s opinions but y men&rsquo;s obedience to God&rsquo;s established pattern as it is found in His Word. All that God has established in his Word brings liberty when properly put into practice.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Just as in the days of Jeremiah, a major concern of our Lord today is the restoration of both Flocks and Shepherds. In the Old Testament God promised that he would restore both if His people would:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;Turn, O backsliding children---And I will give you pastors, according to mine 	heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding,&rdquo; (Jeremiah 	3:14,15)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This promise is repeated in Jeremiah 6:2,3.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In His Word, God offers a pattern fro the formation of local churches. Nowhere in Scripture does God teach a denominational type of church government. Each local church is to be a sovereign body, even though they are to enjoy fellowship with other local assemblies. This was practiced in New Testament times.</span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftn_GoBack6"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[7]</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Now, let&rsquo;s look at the specific pattern that God has offered for the formation of local churches. First, he directed believers to assemble together in given locations:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; 	but exhorting one another; and so much more, as ye see the day 	approaching,&rdquo; (Hebrews 10:25).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Next, He ordains where to establish a local church and often where not too. God may indicate the right location for a church to an individual via vision, witness of the Spirit, or in some other manner (Acts 16:6-10).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	God puts in place the leadership ministries He would have in each local assembly. The Lord gives each local church the leaders they deserve and/or need. Luke, under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, recorded the responsibility of Senior Elders to assure that those being placed into leadership meet theScriptural qualifications:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;...When they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed,&rdquo; (Acts 14:23).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Though most in the body recognizes that God designates leaders, they don&rsquo;t give much thought--pro or con--about the fact that God also brings in members. Paul writes, in I Corinthians 12:18, that: &ldquo;...now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.&rdquo; We should carefully consider God&rsquo;s placement of members in the best church fro them--especially in this day of running to and fro by may church members. It is recorded in Job that:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;The Lord said unto Satan, whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it,&rdquo; (Job 1:7).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Going to and fro in the earth is the business of our adversary. If God sets us in a particular church as members or Leaders, we must remain there until God moves us and not before.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Just as some believers come and go at their own beckoning, others whom God would move out remain with a bad spirit and bring disunity. He gave the fivefold ministry to watch, warn, instruct, rebuke, and pray to the best of their ability under the leadership of the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They should be sensitive to any spirit of disunity in the congregation and they should act against it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	We regularly see that some will leave who should have stayed, while others will stay whom God would lead to further and richer ministries. Each individual stands or falls to his own master. God will not force us against our wills. He may, however, make us wish we had obeyed His voice when he directed us to move or to stay.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Never! Never! Never! should we move because we have been &ldquo;offended&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;We must always make right what was wrong before leaving the nest, even if we are moving at the direction of God. If we make a wrong move, there is, generally, opportunity to make corrections and get back into the will and purpose of God for our lives. God still allows U-turns</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	God is well able to equip and enable us to accomplish whatever ministry He places upon our lives. Our goal is to edify, encourage, and comfort one another. The Holy Ghost is given that we might do this effectively. God equips both leaders and members to accomplish their several ministries within the body: &ldquo;But the manifestation if the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,&rdquo; (I Corinthians 12:7).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	There are some basic principles of church government, which we must observe if we want to fully follow God&rsquo;s pattern. The church is first to be a spiritual &ldquo;organism&rdquo; and then to be an &ldquo;organization&rdquo;. However, we cannot ignore either &ldquo;life&rdquo; or &ldquo;structure&rdquo; if we desire spiritual strength and maturity as a body of believers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Good church government will not produce spirituality. When God created Adam, there was structure before there was life. However, in the church of the living God, there must be life before structure. After there is life good structure in the form of church government will HELP to maintain life and will assist each organ to effectively relate to the other members. Don&rsquo;t depend on good church management to produce what only a healthy ministry of the Word is capable of producing. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	God is looking first for good shepherds, and feeders, and then for good administrators. If we dedicate ourselves to feeding, He will help us to administer. He can anoint us with the gifts of &ldquo;Ruling and Governments,&rdquo; or he can anoint others in leadership to assist along these lines. In the two portions of Scripture, (Romans 12:4-13; I Corinthians 12:7-11) dealing with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, we see that God made provision for the ruling and governing of His flock: Romans 12:8, &ldquo;He that ruleth with diligence,&rdquo; and I Corinthians 12:28, &ldquo;God hath set some in the church--helps, governments.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In II Chronicles 12:9,10 the Scripture tells us that while Rehoboam was in a backslidden condition the King of Egypt came and carried away the shields of gold which Solomon, Rehoboam&rsquo;s father, had made for the purpose of going before him as he entered the house of God. Rehoboam in this sad condition took it upon himself to replace these with shields of brass. Brass in the Scriptures speaks to us of judgement. So we see instead of going into the house of God with the divine blessing upon his life he is entering under the condemnation of God&rsquo;s judgement. How far do we have to go in the wrong direction before we have only a form of godliness left? Let&rsquo;s never specialize in substitutes, not when we can have the real thing.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	It never pays to take the service of God into our own hands, God insists that we do things his way and not our way. The entire church, each member and each leader, must be a vita</span><span class="csA7555675">l </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">organ, alive and functioning effectively in the body. Until this is put into practice it only theory and is unprofitable.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	As we consider the foundations of spiritual church government, there must first be quality, then procedure; first condition, then method; first organism, then organization. As we look at quality, the elders and deacons, must be qualified Scripturally. As a family requires parents, and as a flock requires a shepherd, so the household of faith requires spiritual leaders. We need the fivefold ministry so that we may come to maturity within the body.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Leaders can&rsquo;t give you what they don&rsquo;t possess. They must meet the Scriptural qualifications seen in I Timothy 3. If we lower the standards (qualifications) of God&rsquo;s Word, it will show up in the quality of the work produced. This brings frustration for both the shepherd and sheep alike.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Church leaders must be firmly established in present revealed truth and be able to convey it to the body of believers. It is essential that feeding be the heart of any ministry. Good government cannot exist without good feeding. Without good feeding, all types of disease and complications will set in and eventually the church will die though you may still have the skeleton (FRAME).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	A common error today is the belief that we don&rsquo;t need men to lead us, that &ldquo;we have the Holy Ghost to lead us--don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; The Spirit leads and governs the church through human vessels (Hebrews 13:17). To bypass everyone and seek leading only from God is usually a sign of a rebellious and independent spirit. These people often use a verse of Scripture out of context, such as I John 2:27:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not 	that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and 	is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath aught you ye shall abide in him,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">to justify refusing submission to God-anointed and God-called teachers. He gave teachers. The reason for this is given in Ephesians 4:8-15 where we are told that all of the fivefold ministries, including teachers, are given to the church to bring her to perfection, unity, and maturity.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	If we desire to go our own way instead of accepting the truth of God&rsquo;s Word, he will permit us to take a scripture out of context to support any error we choose to believe. This will be to our own destruction (II Thessalonians 2:10-12). If we choose to reject the teaching that God has ordained a strong oversight ministry within the body of Christ, God will permit us to find isolated Scriptures to satisfy our rebellion and independence. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	God appoints leaders and directs them to set the house in order. They must, as in Old Testament times, walk in the Spirit of unity and submission to one another. It was commanded, in Isaiah 52:8, that:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for 	they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is to be no power struggle within the body of believers, the Elders are to flow together in unity. By following the Scriptural pattern of plurality of Elders, there is a balance between those who would be harsh and those who would be permissive. In the past I have seen this balance work wonderfully in they Body of Christ. Strangely, God seems to give an unusual blend of ministries to each local church. Ministries compliment one another and bring a balance that edifies the whole body. In order to have this supernatural blend of ministries, each leader needs to be quickened to the fact that God only governs through men to the degree that He is able to GOVERN THE MAN HIMSELF. If God can&rsquo;t govern you, don&rsquo;t be mistaken in thinking that He can govern through you. He cannot.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The leaders of the local church are not to &ldquo;lord&rdquo; it over the flock nor to make decisions independent of them: &ldquo;Neither as being Lords over God&rsquo;s heritage, but being ensamples unto the flock,&rdquo; (I Peter 5:3). A true theocracy is God leading through men who are called and ordained by God, who recognizes the scriptures as the final voice of authority.</span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftn_GoBack7"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[8]</sup></span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Every leader must ask himself if he is a dictator or a theocrat. Leaders must be well acquainted with the scriptures and be able to lead the body into a life which compliments scriptures. Their authority is delegated from God in accordance with scripture. Authority does not come from man--neither from others nor from the leaders themselves.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In a thorough search of the scriptures, you will not find a single instance where the Elders were voted into office by the people. The possible exception to this is found inActs 1:26.</span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftn_GoBack8"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup>[9]</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Even if we consider that God allowed lots to be cast in order to choose the twelfth Apostle, it is not this practice which we frequently see in churches today. In many churches politics and personalities become heavily involved, and carnal nature often is the deciding factor. Senior ministers always appointed theElders after the individual&rsquo;s ministry had been proven and confirmed by God. Even then no appointment was made until the Scriptural qualifications had been met.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	 The Elders work was always spiritual work and the true people of God willingly submitted to them because of the Divine call upon their ministry. Their ministry both proved itself and made room for itself: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men,&rdquo; (Proverbs 18:16). There was never any coercion from either the people or the individual to get a man into office.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The people chose Deacons when men were found who were qualified for the work. Next, they were presented to the Elders for approval and ordination. This is first seen in Acts 6:1-8. The Apostles saw the rationality of being released from the temporal tasks within the Body of Christ. They called upon the body to choose qualified men. After the nominees were presented to the Apostles, they prayed and laid hands upon the Deacons, setting them aside for their work.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	As leaders of God&rsquo;s heritage we are not to rule without considering the flock. If we try to lead with an independent spirit we will eventually lose the respect and cooperation of the flock and may even drive some into rebellion. An example of strong leadership and response, of cooperation between followers and leaders can be seen in the relationship between Jonathan and his armourbearer:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&ldquo;And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine hear: turn thee; 	behold, I am with thee according to thy hear,&rdquo; (I Samuel 14:7).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is also illustrated in the relationship between Ezra and the Israelites as seen in Ezra 10:4: &ldquo;Arise: for this matter belonging unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage and do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Let&rsquo;s follow the Scriptural pattern. It is God, who established the Scriptural chain of command, so why shouldn&rsquo;t He work though it? However, leaders must be extra sensitive to the moving of the Spirit since it is an important part of their ministry.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Before there can be any lasting spiritual growth in the body there must be unity and fellowship. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Leadership must teach this by example and precept. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Only when we are in one accord can God flow freely through the body. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When there is division and carnality even the gifts and ministries are unable to edify. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Let us examine the Corinthian church, as seen in I Corinthians 1:5-12, &nbsp;for one example of unedifying worship and ministry. This church excelled in the gifts of the Spirit. However, due to division, strife, and carnality within the church, the gifts were not edifying to the body. Therefore, Paul saw the necessity for exhorting them, in I Corinthians 12-14, concerning the operations of the gifts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	 A genuinely heaven sent leader will produce love and unity among the believers.

		<p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">Chapter Five</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">The Independent Church And It&rsquo;s Government In Focus</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Every New Testament church was an independent church. They were &ldquo;self-governing&rdquo;, &ldquo;self-supporting&rdquo;, and &ldquo;self-propagating&rdquo;. Each was completely free of all ecclesiastical authority outside of it&rsquo;s own local membership.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Organized groups of churches with a central headquarters did not come until much later. This latter structure was intended for the purpose of maintaining moral purity and doctrinal truth. Although it was a noble aim within itself, it was not seen or taught in the context of the New Testament pattern. In fact, this type of church government tends to constitute unscriptural authority for the local church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The New Testament pattern for the authority of the local assembly is solely &ldquo;self-governing&rdquo;. There is no pattern of denominational ecclesiastical leadership seen within the context of the New Testament. The leadership of each new Testament church rested within it with them at times looking also to those who founded the work.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Independent churches should not be &ldquo;lawless&rdquo; or &ldquo;divisive&rdquo;. It is of utmost importance that all churches have fellowship and unity with other local bodies of believers. Otherwise we could very easily become stagnant and self-centered in our worship and efforts for the Lord. Although inter-congregational fellowship is necessary, the concept of denominational control for the sake of purity has not proven to be effective. Nearly all-historic denominations have turned to liberalism, modernism, apostasy, and lack spiritual power. This is not only true of the old line denominations but also of many of the more recently formed ones, those formed within the last eighty years or so. These facts show us that the denominational concept has failed to do exactly what it was meant to maintain.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	I must confess that some, if not many, &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; have also been deficient in these areas. The very fact that they are independent, however, has confined their lack of purity and doctrinal error to a given body or, at worst, to a given locality. The denominational concept allows the error to spread rapidly throughout a particular denomination. The rapid spread of denominational groups within the Pentecostal ranks have accepted divorced and remarried brethren into the ranks of the ministry. This is not only true of doctrinal error such as this but is also seen in the liberal life style among many of the denominational ranks.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	There are several &ldquo;safe-guards&rdquo; of authority remaining within the local assembly. It retards the misuse of authority by politically ambitious men. In the denominational structure there is ample room for politics to become involved as there comes the need for sectional, district, and national leaders. Thus, men strive for these positions outside of the local assembly. It also hinders false doctrine from spreading beyond the local church. Finally, it keeps groups of churches from forming into denominations.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Error and heresy generally come because of lack of spirituality and sound doctrine--not as a result of the wrong kind of church government. Those found in these errors are usually divisive and lawless or completely spiritually dead. It is very easy to become spiritually dead when the proper mixture of the study of the Word and the anointing of the Holy Ghost is not present in an individual&rsquo;s life. This leaves us open for error. A spiritual person is one who, as he delves into the Word, seeks the anointing to illuminate the Word to his heart and mind. The spiritually dead are those who, though they may as readily study the Word, they look at it from a carnal, natural outlook and in turn, often become very heady and high minded.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	It is difficult to establish what New Testament church government was like since the lack of Scriptural information on the subject makes it so that we cannot accumulate a complete blueprint of the construction of the church. However, enough is given in Scripture for us to build a firm foundation of proper New Testament church government. We will find that ALL MAJOR ORDER was given and ALL MAJOR QUESTIONS were answered within the Holy Scriptures. We must accept the New Testament pattern as valid for us today.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	As an example we will begin by looking at the church in Jerusalem and glean what we may from her. Though the Apostles and original leaders of the early church located their ministries, for a time, in and from Jerusalem, it was by no means a legislative body for all the local churches then established. By reading the book of Acts very carefully we can find the there are no Scriptures that contradict this view. We will look further into the reality of Acts 15 in Chapter 7 of this book.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The first twelve chapters of the book of Acts deal primarily with the churches at Jerusalem, Samaria, Caesarea, and Antioch. The first church to be set in order was, naturally, the church at Jerusalem, since the first converts worshipped there. This can be seen in a review of Acts 1-7. It was in this church that the first Deacons were chosen so that the Elders (Apostles) could be released from their temporal duties to be able to give them fully to the spiritual work. We also see in this church the development of the fivefold ministry as seen in Ephesians 4:11,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	&ldquo;And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and 	some, pastors and teachers;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The second local church, documented in Acts 8, was established in Samaria. It was founded under the leadership of Philip, who was one of those firstDeacons chosen in Jerusalem. In the interim, he had progressed to the position of Elder since he is spoken of as Philip theEvangelist in Acts 21:8. There is no indication that either the Apostles or the church at Jerusalem sent him to Samaria. His mission to Samaria was not a pre-planned evangelistic mission. We see strong evidence within this very chapter that he was an Elder of the body of Christ who moved under the direction of the head of the church, the Lord Jesus Christ. Notice Acts 8:26,29,39, &ldquo;The Angle of the Lord spake unto Philip,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spirit said unto Philip,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	If only the leadership of the churches of today would be under the same leadership and direction. How much better than man&rsquo;s leadership or that of some headquarter doing the directing. There were no superiors, or mission boards directing the New Testament church but, rather, the Holy Ghost directed it. How much better off our churches would be today if they would rely wholly and completely upon His direction.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The next church, documented in Acts 10, was established at Cornelius&rsquo; house at Caesarea. Here, again, we see that it was completely and altogether under divine direction and not under man&rsquo;s direction. God used a series of supernatural means to bring about the establishment of this church, even against Peter&rsquo;s better judgement, who was the instrument used to be the founder of this church. For we see that Peter, a Jew would not enter into tho home of a Gentile, which Cornelius was. However, God, through a vision, convinced Peter that it was completely God&rsquo;s will for him to go into Cornelius&rsquo; house and preach to them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Finally, we see the church of Antioch being set in order in Acts 11:19-30. This church was not established by the original Apostles but by other able men called and chosen of God for this purpose. Never, never, never, in Scripture do we see one church put in a place of authority over another church. This is an important principle of church government for us to keep in mind. Authority over the local church is, only and always, the responsibility of the local church leadership, under the direction of the &ldquo;ONE HEAD,&rdquo; the Lord Jesus Christ, by the anointing of His Spirit.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	While on this thought, I would like to mention that the principle of local independence is the patter for the ministry of the Elders. Pastors have no authority over other Pastors, nor do Apostles have authority over Pastors, etc. The authority of each individual within the five-fold ministry lies within each ones own sphere of ministry, &ldquo;For we are laborers together with God,&rdquo; (I Corinthians 3:9). An Elder is not under the direction of other ministries, yet we do see that the Elders of the local assembly do release other Elders to the clear leading of the Holy Ghost for that individual&rsquo;s life and ministry.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Notice in Acts 13:2-4 that Paul and Barnabas were released, not sent, by the remaining Elders at Antioch that they might follow the clear leading of the Holy Ghost, who in reality is the one doing the sending. If there is a need for disciplining an erring Elder, it is the responsibility of the responsibility of other Elders within the given local assembly to administer the discipline.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	This is a good place to stress the necessity of all Elders being part of a local assembly yet free to work out of the local assembly. However, some may choose not to be part of a local body to their own detriment. It could be that they would rather not be in the position where discipline could be administered when needed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Each Elder is responsible to minister the Word with, &ldquo;power and demonstration of the Spirit,&rdquo; (I Corinthians 2:4). Only then will our ministry be effective. It is alwasy well to remember that our ministry is not to have dominion over the souls of men, but to be &ldquo;HELPERS,&rdquo; in building their faith according to the power that works in us (II Corinthians 1:24; Ephesians 3:20b).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Though one church, or one Elder, does not have dominion over another there is a New Testament pattern for &ldquo;mothering&rdquo; churches. Keep in mind, however, that it is for the purpose of sheltering the new body in its infancy. When &ldquo;mothering&rdquo; a new church we are to help provide scriptural ministry, to help establish and protect her in her early stages. It should be solely, not an administrative relationship. Also it should be a completely voluntary relationship on both ends of the ministry--the mother church and the mothered church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	All leaders of both assemblies must qualify for leadership as per I Timothy 3. It should be the call of the Elder or Elders establishing the new assembly to do so. It is not to be the decision of the mother church to establish the new work. She is simply there for support and protection in the early period of the new church&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	In concluding our thoughts concerning the first churches to be established in Acts 1-12 we must recognize the special call of the Apostles. Jesus called the twelve, &ldquo;And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named Apostles,&rdquo; (Luke 6:12,13). This was in the divine plan and design for the church. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The number twelve represents divine government and administration. A brief look at some Bible twelve&rsquo;s will bear this out. Jacob had twelve sons who became the twelve tribes of Israel. At Elim we see twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees (Exodus 15:27). Could this be typical of these twelve sons and the seventy elders of Israel in the Old Testament and the twelve Apostles along with the seventy Jesus send out in Luke 9:1; 10:1?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	In the Tabernacle we see the twelve stones in the Breastplate (Exodus 28:21), twelve loaves of shewbread (Leviticus 24:5). In the Temple twelve oxen bore the molten sea (I Kings 7:25). These are similar to the twelve Apostles who bore the Gospel of cleansing, with the washing of water by the Word (Ephesians 5:26).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	In Revelation we see twelve stars (12:1), twelve gates, twelve angels, twelve tribes, twelve foundations, names of twelve Apostles of the Lamb, twelve pearls (21:12-21), and the tree of life bearing twelve manner of fruit (22:2)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	In the light of all of this we must say that the twelve Apostles had a unique place in the building of the church. First, we must recognize that they were personally chosen, trained and commissioned by the Lord Jesus Himself. Thus, their word and doctrine was final and authoritative, &ldquo;And they continued steadfast in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship,&rdquo; (Acts 2:42). Paul also wrote that the Church was, &ldquo;...built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,&rdquo; (Ephesians 2:20).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	In this aspect of their work and ministry, the Twelve had no successors. This part of their ministry was &ldquo;PERFECT&rdquo; and &ldquo;PERMANENT&rdquo;. However, their ministry of church planting and caring is a continuing ministry. The ministry of the Apostles has not ceased in this respect, &ldquo;And God hath set some in the church, first Apostles,&rdquo; (I Corinthians 12:28).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	No one man or specific group of men is essential in our day for Christ is the builder of his church (Matthew 16:18). He is building by HIs Spirit. His Spirit will call, direct, lead, empower every worker to accomplish his work in His way.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The last sixteen chapters of Acts cover the expansion of the church outside Judea. We see churches being established throughout the Roman Empire. Roughly seven years was spent on ministry solely within Judea, before this expansion began. The church, the body of believers, not just the local assembly, was well established both numerically and spiritually. Those that were scattered were not babes in Christ. This may possible provide a good clue as to why, when the church began to establish local churches, throughout the Roman Empire, they grew rapidly both numerically and spiritually.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Next, I would like us to take a brief look at the church in Antioch, the third largest city in the Empire. While the church remained at Jerusalem, the bud of Christianity opened, but when it reached Antioch it burst forth into full bloom. The congregation at Antioch was, naturally, a strong Gentile congregation while the one at Jerusalem was strongly Jewish. The Gentile church was vividly portrayed in Ephesians 2:11-22. This church was not established by the twelve Apostles, yet it was built upon their foundation (Ephesians 2:20) since the church was built upon their doctrine, even though their bodily presence was absent.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	We see the five-fold ministry spring forth in its fullness at Antioch, &ldquo;Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain Prophets and Teachers,&rdquo; (Acts 13:1). The Church at Antioch did not &ldquo;Ordain&rdquo; or &ldquo;send&rdquo; the laborers, they simply &ldquo;released&rdquo; them to &nbsp;the clear direction of the Holy Ghost (Acts 13:2-4). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	 The Scriptures make us wonder who it is that is directing many of the ministries of today, &ldquo;the Church,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Overseer,&rdquo; or the Holy Ghost&rdquo;. Is it &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thus saith the board&rdquo;? We should not intend to destroy sound Scriptural church government, but neither do we want to do away with Holy Ghost government and replace it with human government. Human government has destroyed many a man&rsquo;s ministry, and weakened many a local church&rsquo;s ministry by missing God&rsquo;s direction and anointing. To have God&rsquo;s best for our ministry and for His church; we must always be under the direction of the Holy Ghost, both individually and collectively.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	This brings us to ask how does one know he leading of the Holy Ghost for our own specific ministry? In considering the five-fold ministry the Holy Ghost will burn His call into your inner being. God will, in some way, speak to you personally about you own calling. It may be through Scripture, to your inner consciousness, by the witness of the Spirit to your hear, through that still small voice, or even by a strong compulsion to fill a need. Thereafter it may be confirmed by outside ministries, such as the prophetic ministry.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	All to often, individuals tend to rely of the confirmation of an outside ministry to direct them and it plays havoc with both their ministry and the local church. For those of us who are presently functioning in our ministry, let us not violate the &ldquo;priesthood of the believer&rdquo;, and try to direct everyone into the ministry we think they should be called to. Yet, as the Spirit leads us, let us permit Him to use us to confirm the young seeker in the direction the Lord is leading him into.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h1 class="csC1DF526">
			<a name="_Toc306116097"><span class="csE1B23F0B">Chapter 6: </span><span class="csAE26C675">Principles of Church Government</span></a></h1>
		<p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">Chapter Six</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">Principles of Church Government</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs1769A51A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Care is taken to insure proper balance in all of God&rsquo;s dealings with men. The same is true of principle pertaining to church government. There are two extremes used by churches to maintain proper balance in church government, which we will consider. There may be other forms of church government that we could consider , but we will limit our study to the two extremes typified in Revelation Chapters 2 and 3.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	These two extremes are illustrated by the NICOLAITANE and LAODICEAN spirit (Revelation 2:6, 15; 3:14). NICOLAITANE is derived from two Greek words meaning, &ldquo;to conquer the people&rdquo;. LAODICEAN is take from two Greek words meaning &ldquo;the justice of the people&rdquo;. These were not the only two churches seen to utilize the two major extremes in church government. THese two forms of government have been prevalent throughout the Church Age, and are still seen today in the vast majority of churches.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Let us look briefly at the Laodicean spirit. It symbolizes the form of government that adheres to the principle of the &ldquo;Justice-Rule-Democracy&rdquo; of the people. Many of our churches today operate under this flag. ALL is transacted ia the voice of the people. This speaks to us of a Democratic or Congregational type of church government. All officers and matters of business are decided upon by a vote of the body of believers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	As appealing as the LAODICEAN for of government is to the natural man, and as great as it is in civil government, it is not seen anywhere in Scripture as God&rsquo;s order of business for the Church Age. This type of government is always run on the OPINIONS of the people.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Unfortunately, the voice of the majority is all too often a carnal voice. Under this system churches often choose, to their own destruction or at least to their own destruction or at least to their own &nbsp;detriment, pastor&rsquo;s who are not God&rsquo;s choice for that local assembly at that time. Often, under this Democratic, or might we say Laodicean, spirit, the pastor&rsquo;s hands are tied as he tries to follow the leading of the Holy Ghost when it comes to the leadership of the local assembly. As we can readily see without any further explanation, this Spirit must be soundly opposed and resisted as not being God&rsquo;s will for the local assembly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Let us now look at the other end of the spectrum, the NICOLAITANE Spirit. This makes reference to a dictatorial type of of church government or the Papal type of church government. It speaks to us of the clergy becoming a ruling class. This spirit demands that people come to God through their leaders. These leaders may be called &ldquo;Elders&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shepherds&rdquo; or any number of other titles.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The dictatorial type of church government ignores the Scriptural teaching of the &ldquo;priesthood of the believer,&rdquo; as seen in I Peter 2:9. Peter clearly teaches that each believer has the privileges and responsibility to come before God themselves as members of, &ldquo;a royal priesthood&rdquo;. Paul also teaches this in Hebrews 4:16:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	&ldquo;Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain 	mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The individual members of the body should be taught and encouraged to seek God personally for their individual needs. However, while members should be instructed to seek the Lord themselves, they also need to be encouraged to share their burdens with and pray for each other as instructed in James 5:16. They also need to recognize that there is a need, at times, for calling upon the elders for prayer and the laying on of hands. An over-emphasis on the doctrine of laying on of hands, solely by the Elders, could have created this &ldquo;Nicolaitane spirit&rdquo; and error within the church. Is it possible this is why God inspired Paul to write &ldquo;Lay hands suddenly on no man,&rdquo; in I Timothy 5:22?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Let us look at some of the consequences, which will naturally arise when the Nicolaitane spirit prevails in a local body of believers. The first malfunctioning of the assembly, will be that the leadership of the church will not only control the manifestation of the gifts in the assembly, but they themselves will often be the only ones functioning in these gifts. This monopoly on the gifts of the Spirit suppresses all other believers from operating via the gifts of the Holy Ghost.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The suppression of the operation of the gifts will not always be outward or direct but will often happen through indirect means or simply through the projection of the leadership&rsquo;s domineering spirit. By monopolizing the gifts of the Spirit, the leadership borders on the verge of assuming a role that is to be strictly reserved for the Holy Ghost. The Scriptural pattern, as seen in I Corinthians 12:7, is for each member to move and function as the Holy Ghost would direct, &ldquo; But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to ever man to profit withal.&rdquo; The Nicolaitane Spirit ignores this pattern as it disregards the &ldquo;priesthood of the believer&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The root cause of many men resorting to this form of leadership is twofold. It takes both &ldquo;Self-Denial&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Flesh&rdquo; on the part of a leader to permit the Spirit to use who He will to minster as He would. It requires faith to trust the Holy Ghost to govern the affairs of the church. It is much easier to the &ldquo;CARNAL&rdquo; natural man to do things in a natural way, especially if the individual is endued with natural gifts and charisma. The sad result is that this seems to be very successful.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	One weakness of the modern pastorate is that he fails to produce a strong lay ministry. However, this error is being corrected in many circles today and is proving very fruitful. Praise God! He is still in the work of restoring the New Testament pattern. We can only produce &ldquo;Much Fruit&rdquo;, as we follow the scriptural pattern.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	To develop spiritual people we must permit the exercise of spiritual ministry and spiritual gifts. This isn&rsquo;t going to come to pass just by hearing good, meaty, nourishing sermons. There must be a moving of the spirit in the individual heart and life, which motivates the believer into service in the Holy Ghost. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	There seems to be some confusion today concerning the difference between TEACHING people and LEADING people in to an actual ministry of exercising of their gifts and callings. LEADING must occur in public and in private counsel. LEADING must include encouragement to help the believer cooperate with the Holy Ghost, as He would use them. The spiritual effectiveness of a church can only be measured by its ability to function effectively as a body. We need a thorough restoration of the body ministry today, which will produce an increase of the body through the salvation of souls.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	One last error which prevails as a result of the Nicolaitane spirit today is the funneling off of promising young ministries to the Bible Schools. This directly results from the failure to nurture a body ministry within the local church. Those with promise arise in our assemblies &nbsp;during times of spiritual renewal and show yieldedness to the moving of the Holy Ghost. Due to the lack of capable leaders within the local body who will take them under their wing and train them for the work of the ministry, we ship them off.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Many problems arise for local assemblies, which encourage promising young men to attend Bible School rather than remain in their local churches to receive training. First, we are taking the lifeblood and vitality out of the local assembly. This leaves the assembly much like a home where the children have grown and all the teens have finally left leaving the home without the excitement and life which once radiated in it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Second, this practice places the promising young enthusiast into a false atmosphere. I am not using the word &ldquo;false&rdquo; in the sense that it is error but rather that it is not a &ldquo;Real Life Experience&rdquo;. In the Bible School atmosphere an abundance of young, lively, energetic, anointed believers are thrown in together. Students do not experience the real tests, trials, and responsibilities of every day life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	When many students come out of the Bible School atmosphere to take leadership in the local assembly, their lack of any practical experience in the everyday life of the Christian results in disappointment at the absence of the high gear, hyper-spiritual atmosphere which they are accustomed to in the Bible School. I am speaking primarily of those who have had little or no local church affiliation previous to the Bible School experience.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Third, the Bible School now is overloaded with what we might call &ldquo;The Cream of the Crop,&rdquo; as far as zeal and enthusiasm is concerned. As a result, the church is robbed of its vitality. Fourth, since the local church is God&rsquo;s order for this age, the Bible School acts as a parasite. The Bible School not only has no scriptural means for bodily members since each Christian is directed to be a part of a local church but also has no Scriptural means for financial support. If the local church is God&rsquo;s order for this Church Age, our tithes and offering are to be brought into the local church. The faculty of the Bible School should be attached to a local church as well.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	If Bible School teachers were active members in their local assemblies it is possible that the local church would have enough teachers to carry on the ministry she was intended to carry on--to train her own promising young recruits under the existing Elders. This is clearly God&rsquo;s &ldquo;IDEAL&rdquo; for the present Church Age.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Having spelled out some of the errors of the dictatorial or Nicolaitane form of church government, let us briefly compare this erroneous spirit with the spirit of theocracy. The dictator is no-submissive to other leadership ministries. The spirit of theocracy not only submits to these other ministries but also even seeks their counsel in the decision making of God&rsquo;s program. The dictator sees challenges of his decisions as a threat instead of a check, which may bring balance within the assembly.</span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftn_GoBack9"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>[10]</sup></span></a><span class="csA7555675"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	We have looked at the Democratic and the Dictatorial types of church government and the problems associated with these is that they are not God&rsquo;s order. The secondary problem is that both of them are run on the opinions of men, whether it is by one man or a number of men. God does not have opinions, God KNOWS. We must not replace God&rsquo;s order with something of our own making.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	God&rsquo;s order is a theocracy, where God is able to govern his people the way he chooses. It is not the Pastor being run by the Deacons and the Elders, nor is it the Pastor lording it over the Deacons and Elders, but rather where God rules through a multiple of of ministries, a plurality of Elders through which God governs the local assembly. Jesus is the only perfect dictator. The Nicolaitane spirit violates God&rsquo;s order for multiple ministries.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	We must understand that the Dictator might simply lack understanding of what God&rsquo;s ideal is. It may not be that his motives are wrong. Out purpose here is to reveal what God&rsquo;s ideal is. We must always be aware that just because something works is no sign we must accept and embrace it. It must be Scriptural. Isn&rsquo;t the Word of God our supreme and final authority?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Quality must always be the standard and not quantity. Success--as an Elder or as a local body-must be measured over a long period of time by its fruitfulness. What about churches which should come from our work? This is truly a Scriptural means of evangelism. Are we mothering any new works? Healthy growth, which always tales time, is a good measuring stick for success.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	There are definite problems, which arise when leadership predominates the body ministry. An assembly may survive, even for a prolonged period, with these problems evident internally, however she will be a weak assembly. The domineering spitit steals initiative and joy from the body and replaces it with fear, frustration, antagonism and resentment. A ministry of this type attracts weak, overly dependent believers and creates division and a lack of harmony.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Good church government must begin in the heart. For God can only govern through a man if he is able to govern the man himself. For the church to function effectively each member, including the leaders must be completely governed by the Lord. Each member must be submissive to the Lord and His order of church government. This is the reason why the qualifications for Elders are so rigid.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The importance of submitting our entire lives to the will of the Lord is emphasized in Proverbs 25:28, &ldquo;He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.&rdquo; Christ must govern His kingdom. He has His own chosen means of doing this. We must individually recognize and yield to His government:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	&ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be 	upon his shoulder:---of the increase of his government and peace there shall be 	no end, upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom, to order it, and to 	establish it with judgement and with justice from henceforth even for ever,&rdquo;(Isaiah 	9:6-7)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	There are certain principles of church government which must be observed if we are to have a healthy church. There are principles to be observed in the formation of a governing body. We must somehow find ways as a leader to share our vision, doctrine, and faith with &ldquo;key men&rdquo;. We must inculcate this into them if at all possible, and, as we do, permit God to draw the team together he so desires. He will put in those who will help give the whole &ldquo;balance&rdquo;. Every building needs a solid foundation. It is imperative that leaders move slowly but steadily toward the goal of building a team which will bring honor to God and His building.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	As we are attempting to build a solid foundation, we need to be on the lookout for common mistakes which occur in these early stages which create problems for years to come. First, the old saying that, &ldquo;haste makes waste,&rdquo; holds true in the ministry. Do not over-structure too soon. It is better to do the work yourself until you have qualified men to place in position.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Second, don&rsquo;t create jobs that require leaders until you have qualified leaders to fill the jobs. It is better to under-program than to over-program and put unqualified men in leadership, thus lowering the quality of the work. For that is exactly what will happen if the qualifications for leaders are not met.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Third, too many get so involved &nbsp;in the program that they fail to become real spiritual feeders. They fail to create a true atmosphere of worship and intercessory prayer. Worship binds the body together like no other force. Begin now to feed, pray and worship and see what God will do in your assembly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Fourth, all too often leaders are afraid to encourage fellowship among the flock. Their fear of this may be justified. The fellowship of members can create problems because of gossip. Leaders may also fear that new leaders may arise and cause division in the flock. Despite the potential problems, nothing will encourage body ministry, prayer and worship like the saints coming together for mutual fellowship on other than scheduled church times.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Fifth, one predominate mistake among leaders in these early stages is that they busy &nbsp;themselves with &ldquo;waiting on tables&rdquo;. The result is that leaders are overworked. This error conditions the body to the spirit of &ldquo;letting the leaders do it&rdquo;. This makes it difficult for the people to move effectively and responsibly into &ldquo;body ministry&rdquo;. They will always wait for the Elders to do it. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Proper growth requires quality leadership, so we must work for quality and not quantity. Never institute a &ldquo;program&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ll call it that for a lack of a better word, until you have a definite need of it for the nurture and admonition of the flock. Only begin a new program if you have qualified leaders to carry it on.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Many are still asking, &ldquo;How can I develop or produce a body ministry within my flock?&rdquo; A leader&rsquo;s ultimate success or failure seems to rest on his ability or lack of ability to produce a body ministry in his assembly. If you are not able to do this, there are only a few alternatives left for you. None of them sounds attractive to me. All of the alternatives I am going to discuss are contrary to God&rsquo;s pattern for His church so fast and pray, and work and worship until you develop God&rsquo;s pattern.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The alternatives are to either drop out of the ministry, to retrogress to the Laodicean or Democratic type of church government, or to become a spiritual dictator. The first is a sad alternative when you the Word burning in your hear. The second is contrary to the teaching of the Bible--another sad alternative. Some have seemed to be successful at the dictatorial type of church government as long as they have lived, but what happens when the &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; dies? The work generally crumbles and the sheep scatter-some lost forever. Personally, I&rsquo;ll settle for God&rsquo;s pattern as difficult as it is at times to develop. It is worth all the discipline and effort involved, for it yields tremendous rewards.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	We need the ability to draw people out and not suppress them. In this process we need a balance between a strong hand of restraint and guidance, while leaving room for freedom of expression. To do this effectively, the Pastor must be totally involved with the flock in prayer, fellowship, and worship. This should include times of extracurricular activities when possible. It is imperative for the pastor create a relaxed atmosphere if the flock is to feel comfortable and at ease around him. It is only as people are at ease that the Holy Ghost will be able to effectively flow through them to minister to others.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	I firmly believe that this attitude can be developed without sacrificing the &ldquo;Pastor&rsquo;s authority&rdquo;. It is sad the way some Pastors degrade their position in an effort to build friendship in the flock. These friendships can be built without demeaning the Pastoral position.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	As we are building the body ministry we must be careful to build a &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; body ministry. We need both the sensational (Evangelistic) type of ministries as well as the stability of the teacher. Whichever type of ministry we are called to, we would be wise to build some around us in a ministry that would help bring balance and augment our ministry. Complimentary ministries fill in that gaps, which our ministry may leave in nurturing the body. Serious problems arise if all we have is one type of ministry.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	There are many that will not pay attention at all unless there is a sensational preacher on board. They need real excitement in the air continuously. However, a continuous diet of this will definitely stunt a believer&rsquo;s growth.Growth of any lasting effect comes from a solid intake of the Word. It is not that we don&rsquo;t need the spectacular--we do--but a steady diet of this is not conducive to spiritual growth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	People nurtured in the &ldquo;revival atmosphere&rdquo; will only go so far in their spiritual growth and then they will level off. In order to keep them, the Revivalist will have to think up all sorts of &ldquo;gimmicks&rdquo; to keep things moving. The greatest danger to this kind of ministry by itself is that its adherents seem, more often than not, to live inconsistent lifestyles. This occurs because much, if not all, of their motivation is external rather than internal. This type of ministry could easily create frustration in the leadership, for without a doubt they will be overworked since there will be a lack of qualified men to share the workload.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	At the same time there are some problems, which may arise, if all we have is a &ldquo;teaching ministry&rdquo;. The greatest of these problems could well be the lack of true vitality. As Paul so aptly points out in II Corinthians 3:6, &ldquo;The letter killeth but the Spirit giveth life.&rdquo; People need to be motivated from within but they also need an amount of external motivation.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The &ldquo;sensational preacher&rdquo; must continue to be sensational and at the same time build and develop a teaching ministry around him. As he does this, he must build the credibility and authority of the other leaders among the flock. The same theory is true if your ministry is basically a &ldquo;teaching ministry&rdquo;. You must strive to build a spectacular ministry around you and at the same time build the credibility and authority of other leaders among the flock. Whoever you put into leadership, you must be able to direct your congregation&rsquo;s &ldquo;respect&rdquo; and &ldquo;submission&rdquo; toward them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	What about building what we might call an &ldquo;Organization&rdquo; or &ldquo;Administration&rdquo;? &ldquo;MEN&rdquo; are the tools God always uses--they were what Jesus used to build His church. As with machinery, so with organization; there must be power to make it function effectively. The purpose of organization is to channel life into the body. If we keep this in mind we will be less apt to over-structure. Always be careful to keep the organization as simple as possible. It is better to under-structure than to over-structure. The goal is to sturcture as needed with qualified leaders.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Church organization can easily be flexible enough to adjust to changing needs and conditions. However, the organization will only accomplish God&rsquo;s work to the degree that God is permitted to work in and through the whole body. Each organ must be alive and functioning. Organization is a means to an end but the primary emphasis must be placed on the final results.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Should we close down a branch of the organization if it is not producing life? There are various possibilities to be examined before finally deciding to close a ministry down unless we get direct counsel from the Holy Ghost to do so. Without the direct intervention of the Spirit, it is necessary to consider the aim of our organization. Don&rsquo;t look upon this as a failure. It could be that the Lord is leading to greener pastures and more fruitful ground. It is also possible that said program has simply come to the end of its life for the need of the organization.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	In the closing remarks of this chapter, let us consider some principles involved in the delegating responsibility and authority. The unhealthy delegation of authority can cause problems, which the body may never outgrow. I would advise that you proceed with care or you could carry a deformity with you for all of your spiritual life as a body of believers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The success or failure of any branch of the work reflects on the immediate leaders and then on the Elders and Pastor of the assembly. This awesome thought makes delegating responsibility and authority one of the key areas of church government. There are several precautions that can be taken in the undertaking of this task, which I will now discuss. First, we must always avoid making snap decisions. Let God lay the plans slowly and steadily concerning what and who he would have you delegate the responsibility of a particular outreach to. Remember that the world wasn&rsquo;t created in one day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Second, make sure that one and only one person does not decide important decisions. We must always consider the counsel of the Elders.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Third, each individual assigned to a task must be given a clear and useful job description. They must feel their job is important and useful, and that it is channeling life to those involved. They must also feel that it is adding to the fulfillment of the whole body.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Fourth, always radiate the attitude that we are laborers together. Never let other receive from you the attitude that, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the chief&rdquo;. This is true whether we be pastor or an under-shepherd overseeing an arm of the body of believers. We never outgrow being a servant.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Fifth, always assign tasks to fit the individual&rsquo;s &ldquo;faith&rdquo;, &ldquo;vision&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ability&rdquo;. Nothing is more frustrating than doing that for which you have no vision or ability. Over-loading a willing worker could easily be the straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Sixth, time spent in communication with workers is time well spent. The lack of communication has destroyed more homes and churches than any of us realize. Others must not be shrugged off. They must sense your sincere interest in what they need, are doing, and even how they feel.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Seventh, be sure any individual you choose tu put in a job or give responsibility has the proper training to perform the task successfully before you leave them alone. Possibly one of the most frequent reasons for the failure of various branches of the organization is the lack of sufficient training.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Eighth, when assigning a task of responsibility to an individual, inform him of the scope of his responsibility. Let him know how far he can go in decision making before it is necessary for him to consult the Elders. Make sure that they not only know when they should call the Elders, but that they may call upon them at any time without being thought of as incompetent.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Ninth, make sure that you can and do trust the one you are delegating authority to. If you don&rsquo;t trust them problems will arise in you relationship with them at a later date. It may not be their fault; it may be that your lack of confidence could create suspicion. Make sure he is ethical, loyal and stable in life and doctrine.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Tenth, the wisest counsel is to seek out those who are one with you in spirit and vision. This is even more important than their ability to do a job. We cannot build a strong body if some organs are diseased or out of joint (functioning independently). Cancer is nothing more than organs of the body that are moving independently, in rebellion, to the well being of the whole body. We need to find balance. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	A person may have a good heart but may not have &ldquo;spiritual ennablement&rdquo; or &ldquo;power to perform&rdquo;. This could be very damaging both to the individual and to the brach they are leading. If you have any question concerning the life or attitude of one you are considering for leadership, you should be open with him. Discuss your questions with him hoping to find a solution, even considering the possibility that you are in error concerning the question. You know it is possible you are wrong.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	<br/></span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><a name="_Toc306116098"><span class="cs2C025596">Study Questions Two (Ch. 4-6)</span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Chapter 4</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">CHAPTER SEVEN</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">PLURALITY OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The Scriptures speak of only two groups of ruling bodies within the local church&mdash;Elders and Deacons. &nbsp;All of those ruling in the house of God MUST meet the qualifications found in I Timothy 3. &nbsp;We see the results in many churches today of deviating from the qualifications. &nbsp;As the standards for leadership have been lowered, we have seen a corresponding lowering of the quality of the work being performed in the body of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The early church is still our example in this respect, as well as in all others. &nbsp;There was no rush to install either Deacons or Elders in the early church. &nbsp;Both offices required that qualified men be carefully &nbsp;sought out to fill these positions. &nbsp;To turn from the standards of leadership presented in I Timothy 3, even though they may seem very rigid, is to frustrate the &ldquo;plans&rdquo; and &ldquo;principles&rdquo; of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	A plurality of leadership is seen throughout the New Testament. &nbsp;Nowhere is one man in complete charge of the work of God. &nbsp;Jesus himself began with twelve Apostles who, excluding Judas Iscariot, carried on the work in its infancy, following the ascension of Christ. &nbsp;We find, in Acts 15:2, that there were other Elders added to the apostolic group as the church in Jerusalem grew. &nbsp;As the need arose, Deacons were added to this body of believers.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Many of the Elders, some of whom were at one time Deacons, were mentioned by name. &nbsp;It seems evident that these Deacons had progressed to the place of Elders, such as Philip the Evangelist as seen in Acts 6:5; 21:8. &nbsp;Agabus the Prophet and James the Pastor of Jerusalem church of Acts 15 were also given by name as having become elders in Jerusalem along with the Apostles.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The church of Jerusalem is not our only example. &nbsp;The church at Antioch of Syria is another vivid example. &nbsp;We see here, also, a pattern of mothering other churches, as well as plurality of ministry. &nbsp;Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch to strengthen the church that had begun there. &nbsp;After staying there a while he went to Tarsus to get Paul to come and work with him. &nbsp;There was certainly a plurality of Elders. &nbsp;A year or so later, Prophets went up from Jerusalem to help in the ministry at Antioch. &nbsp;So it seems that, for a time, anyway their leadership came from a mother church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	As time progressed there were Prophets and Teachers in Antioch. &nbsp;It seems quite evident that some within the church had developed to the degree of being ordained as Elders. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure that they were qualified before Barnabas, Saul and possibly even, Agabus would set them into a place of leadership. &nbsp;We even see the church at Antioch sending Elders from themselves to minister to others. &nbsp;Is not this the Scriptural pattern&mdash;&ldquo;freely ye have received, freely give&rdquo;? &nbsp;We are commanded to go into the entire world and make disciples, not just sit at home and grow fat spiritually.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The church of Ephesus is another good example of the plurality of Elders. &nbsp;As discussed in Acts 18:18,19, the plurality of Elders was even seen in the pioneering stages of this church. &nbsp;God doesn&rsquo;t mean for one man to be responsible for a work by himself. &nbsp;His pattern, even in the early stages of a work is for two or more ministries to work together. &nbsp;We see, in Acts 20:17, that more Elders were evidently added to the church.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	This seems to have been the pattern, wherever churches were started. &nbsp;Paul and Barnabas set in a plurality of Elders in all the churches that they established (Acts 14:23). &nbsp;Whenever assistance was sent to the churches, it was delivered by the Elders of one church into the hands of the Elders of receiving church. &nbsp;The Elders are always to play a predominant roll in the leadership of the churches.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	I feel to emphasize again that you will never find the word Elder in its singular form when in reference to leadership over the church. &nbsp;Yet we must affirm that one Elder is generally considered as &ldquo;chief&rdquo;, &ldquo;senior&rdquo; or &ldquo;head&rdquo; Elder within the local assembly. &nbsp;There are several men who were considered &ldquo;head&rdquo; Elders in the New Testament church. &nbsp;For example, Peter (Acts 5:3), &nbsp;James, the Lords brother, (Acts 15:13) and definitely Paul who established churches and remained to mature them. &nbsp;We also have the letters to the churches in Revelation Chapters 2 and 3, which were to be given to the &ldquo;angels&rdquo;, &ldquo;messengers&rdquo;, or the chief Elder of those individual churches.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Even though the scripture is emphatic in teaching a plurality of Elders, it does not teach an equality of Elders. &nbsp;Each ministry must be given freedom to function within its own sphere, and each will more likely be at different levels of maturity and capabilities in their given ministries. &nbsp;There is to be no power struggle. &nbsp;Each Elder has his own ministry, which he is responsible for.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	One astounding purpose for the plurality of Elders is found in the sphere of church discipline . &nbsp;Discipline carried out by one man loses its effect and authority. &nbsp;It often does not accomplish its intended purpose&mdash;restoration. &nbsp;Instead, it often stimulates rebellion and the loss of the one being disciplined. &nbsp;A plurality of leadership encourages submission from the flock. &nbsp;The decisions of a group of spiritual men will be adhered too much more readily than that of on man. &nbsp;A plurality of Elders is protection for Elders and flock alike bringing with it the greatest benefit to both sheep and shepherd.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The plurality of Elders and church discipline is also to be considered in the context of the need for the discipline of Elders as well. &nbsp;Under God&rsquo;s pattern of leadership, no man is standing independent of the whole. &nbsp;The plurality of the Elders leaves opportunity for an Elder to be disciplined as well as and as effectively as any member of the body. &nbsp;This is equally true whether he be Pastor, Teacher, Evangelist, Prophet, or Apostle. &nbsp;We need to &ldquo;submit to one another,&rdquo; for the good of the whole body (I Peter 5:5).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Another positive effect of plurality of Elders, is the fact that it brings proper &ldquo;balance&rdquo; to the body in all matters. &nbsp;Since each of the Elders will not only be at a different level of maturity but will also have a different type of ministry, the Elders will be able to augment on another in the feeding ministry and in the ministry of the Word. &nbsp;This is also true of discipline. &nbsp;In disciplinary matters, a plurality of Elders brings checks in various ways as to either speeding or slowing the process as need may be.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In the remainder of this chapter, I would like us to briefly analyze Acts 15. &nbsp;This chapter has been used and abused to support every conceivable type of church government. &nbsp;It has been used to support denominational authority of local churches since this chapter can be used to show that the church at Jerusalem had authority over other churches. &nbsp;Acts 15 has also been used to support the contention that the senior pastor is the final voice of authority within the local church since James, the chief elder, had the final voice. &nbsp;However, none of these contentions are supported if we carefully exam the situation as it is literally recorded in Holy Writings.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Brethren from the Jerusalem church who had brought erroneous teaching to Antioch and were causing division had infiltrated the church in Antioch. &nbsp;Paul and Barnabas, mature brethren, did what was right and proper by going to the root and source of the problem when they confronted the Elders of the church in Jersualem, the home church of the troublesome brethren. &nbsp;They presented the problem, which these brethren had brought and sowed, into the Antioch church. &nbsp;The whole church at Jerusalem eventually became involved, or at least informed, about what was transpiring. &nbsp;It is very evident from the scripture that they were in agreement with the decisions of their Elders. &nbsp;What a healthy situation as we see the Elders all together in getting the mind of the Spirit-even though it was the chief Elder what that mind was. &nbsp;Then, praise God, the whole church body stood behind the decision of their Elders. &nbsp;Please study Acts 15 carefully in relation to this thought.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The church in Jerusalem was sought out&mdash;not because it was the top ecclesiastical authority, but because it was the source of the problem. &nbsp;James, the senior Pastor at Jerusalem, voiced the final decision of the whole and not just that of himself. &nbsp;It was definitely a &ldquo;thus saith the Lord&rdquo;, and was confirmed by all present. &nbsp;There were no powers of persuasion, or gifts of salesmanship, influencing the minds of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, there was a definite word of the Holy Ghost to direct the affairs of the local church, which is always in order.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span

class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">CHAPTER EIGHT</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE MINISTRY OF AN APOSTLE</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In the next few chapters of this book we will be looking at the separate ministries of the apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. &nbsp;We will be looking at them in the order given in Ephesians 4:11 not because this is necessarily their order of importance, but simply because this is the order in which the key verse mentions them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The first task to complete in considering the ministry of an apostle is to decide upon a definition of an apostle. &nbsp;An apostle is one sent forth as a messenger, with a commission, under the authority of one doing the sending. &nbsp;This defers from the definition of a disciple since a disciple is a follower who follows with the intent of learning and putting what is learned into practice. &nbsp;All true Christians are disciples (including those who apostles).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In relation to the Christian faith, an apostle is one called out from among the disciples and sent forth as seen in Luke 6:13 &ldquo;and when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles&rdquo;. &nbsp;With these thoughts behind us, we will now look at New Testament Scriptures pertaining to the ministry of an apostle. &nbsp;In doing so we will observe the different examples of apostles. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The first example of an apostle is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself. &nbsp;Truly, he is our example in all matters pertaining to the Christian faith and ministry. &nbsp;In Hebrews 3:1 he is spoken of as: &ldquo;the Apostle and High Priest of our profession.&rdquo; &nbsp;These titles speak to us of his relationship to God and his ministry to man. &nbsp;He was definitely one sent forth with a Divine Commission. &nbsp;Thank God that he was not only &ldquo;sent forth&rdquo;, but that he was obedient to the end to carry out the fathers will. This is clearly illustrated in Christ&rsquo;s own words in John 17:3-8.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The next example of the ministry of the apostle is the calling and work of the original twelve as listed in Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:14-19, Luke 6:13-16. &nbsp;The original twelve apostles as well as all succeeding apostles were chosen from those who were already disciples.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As with any of the fivefold ministry, all apostles are personally chosen by the Lord Jesus Himself. &nbsp;It is not within the authority or choice of men to appoint apostles nor to appoint any of the others of the fivefold ministry. &nbsp;The most that man can do is confim those that God has chosen.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	One important factor I would like us to notice in this all important decision of Jesus in choosing the twelve is that he spent the previous night in prayer (Luke 6:12). &nbsp;This within itself tells us that the Lord takes great care in His choice of leaders for his work.. IT should also speak to us of the necessity of, saturating major decisions with much prayer to God before coming to a final conclusion. &nbsp;This is also true in the practice of laying hands upon those to be set apart for the service of God in any special ministry.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The original twelve apostles (possibly with the exclusion of Judas Iscariot) were to have a place of permanence throughout the ages&mdash;along with the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel (Revelation 21:14). &nbsp;This in itself should cause us to move prayerfully as we work for God, &nbsp;for how much of what we are doing is of eternal value</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The third category of apostle mentioned in the New Testament is the false apostle. &nbsp;Satan is not going to waste time, talent, and labor copying anything that is not genuine. &nbsp;Thus, when I see one of counterfeits around I know that there must also be the authentic, &ldquo;Real&rdquo; ministry being copied. &nbsp;This is also true of prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. &nbsp;God has the genuine and Satan has the counterfeit or false. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be disillusioned by the false but be encourage that the real is genuine enough for Satan to be willing to expand the effort to copy it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	There was on apostle who seems to have had a special call to establish the church among the Gentiles. &nbsp;This, of course, is none other than Paul, who was previously known as Saul of Tarsus (Romans 11:13, Acts 9:15). &nbsp;He speaks of Himself over twenty times as an apostle. &nbsp;He was the first man recorded to make any systematic effort to evangelize the Gentiles. &nbsp;Some have reason to believe that he is the Divine replacement of Judas Iscariot rather than the Matthias of Acts 1:26.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The ministry of an apostle is to be a continuing ministry throughout the Church Age. &nbsp;God gave this ministry, along with the other four, as a gift to the church to bring her to perfection. &nbsp;It is impossible to imagine that the ministry of an apostle could be discontinued before the church is brought to perfection, at the end of this Church Age. &nbsp;We still need every gift that God has given to the church. &nbsp;When the church has come to perfection, it will be presented to Christ without spot or wrinkle or any such thing (Ephesians 5:27). &nbsp;He is coming for a perfect &nbsp;bride. &nbsp;I, for one, feel the need for every provision he has made to bring me to perfection. &nbsp;Because certain fragments of the church have failed to recognize and utilize all the gifts and ministries that Christ provided her, they are in the poor condition they are in today.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	There are various references in the New Testament to apostiles, other tha n Paul or the twelve as discusses previously. &nbsp;There were apostles with Paul in Iconium as well as in other places of miniustry (Acts 14:4; Romans 16:7; Galatians 1:19; I Thessalonians 1:1, 2:6). &nbsp;We find the word &ldquo;Apostle&rdquo; possibly applies to about twenty-five persons in the New Testament since it is also sometimes translated &ldquo;Messenger&rdquo;. &nbsp;Titus seems to have fit into this category since he was one who was establishing churches and setting things in order within the local churches (Titus 1:5).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Next, we will examine the ministry of the New Testament apostle. &nbsp;In any study of this nature, there are some questions that we must ask ourselves. &nbsp;First, who sent the apostles mentioned in the New Testament? Second, where were they sent? Third, what was the commission of these men?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In &nbsp;answering these questions we will begin with the original twelve. &nbsp;They were called, trained and sent by Christ Himself. &nbsp;They were sent to the worldwide church. &nbsp;This mission continues, even to the end of the Church Age, via their ministry of laying down the foundational truths for the entire Church Age. &nbsp;Paul wrote, in Ephesians 2:20: &ldquo;And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The ministry of the original twelve apostles seems to go even beyond the Church Age and into eternity (Revelation 21:14). &nbsp;Their writings were inspired and preserved as &ldquo;Gospel&rdquo;. &nbsp;They were truly a young church and a means of nurturing her to maturity. &nbsp;They set forth the early structure of the church, outlined the qualifications for the ministering body and took the initiative to see that proper leadership was set in place. &nbsp;They baptized converts, preached the gospel, taught doctrine, etc.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The ministry of apostle is an ongoing ministry for the church of all ages. &nbsp;The ministry of an apostle today is similar to that of the twelve. &nbsp;A modern day apostle must be chosen, trained, and sent by Christ just as the original twelve were. &nbsp;Ther are to ground the church in the truth that has already been laid down so that the church will not be blown about with every wind of doctrine. &nbsp;The twelve laid down the &ldquo;Foundational Truths&rdquo; which the apostles of today are to minister.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The vision of today&rsquo;s apostles goes beyond one local assembly since they are sent to the church at large. &nbsp;Their ministry will expand as pastors recognize the call of God upon their lives and call upon them for assistance. &nbsp;A man will never have to push his way to the front, &ldquo;(his) ministry will make room for itself&rdquo; (Proverbs 18:16). &nbsp;The ministry of the modern day apostle will be one of seeking to preserve unity and cooperation within and among local assemblies. &nbsp;We see this spirit vividly in the ministry of Paul, in his striving to write to those who are divisive, as in the church of Corinth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Apostles are also to be concerned with the ministries of individuals. &nbsp;They will endeavor to nurture promising young men into their ministries, sometimes by taking them under their wing for a season of training. &nbsp;They will also, at times, as the Spirit leads, function via the gifts of the Spirit in confirming God&rsquo;s call upon specific members of the local assemblies.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The present day apostle may also be active in establishing new churches and setting the new churches in order, returning to them on occasion to nurture and strengthen them in their faith. &nbsp;We have not only the example of Paul and Barnabas but also of many modern missionaries who function along this line. &nbsp;It is possible these brethren are considered apostles in the eyes of the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	It would not be correct to include all missionaries in this category since many serve as clerks, doctors, mechanics, pilots, etc. in the mission field. &nbsp;However, some are true apostles as well as prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. &nbsp;The ministry and works that follow a man will be proof of his calling. &nbsp;This is not true only for apostles. &nbsp;It is equally true for those who are called to other ministries (I Corinthians 9:2).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h1 class="csC1DF526">

The teaching ministry is vividly seen in his life and ministry. His teaching and preaching are tactfully blended together. This is seen clearly in Matthew 4:23 and 9:35 when he is described as:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	 &ldquo;teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Jesus&rsquo; words are described as teaching with authority and life in Matthew 7:29 and John 6:63. His words were not only delivered with authority but they were and still are infused with life giving power. The Word is quick (living) and powerful (Hebrews 4:12). How much more would we accomplish in the teaching ministry if it were the Word of God we would give forth instead of our own words or opinions?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	I will endeavor to examine several New Testament teaching concerning the teaching ministry. It is clear that there is a definite and distinct ministry of teaching presented in the New Testament. However, it is necessary to proclaim emphatically that teachers are to be called and equipped by the Spirit of God. This is just as true of the teaching ministry as it is with any of the five-fold ministry. The ministry of teachers is to be duly recognized and approved by the other Elders within the Local Assembly.</span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftn_GoBack10"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>[11]</sup></span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The teaching ministry is to be a continuing ministry within the local assembly. It is a ministry that is to be passed on so that each succeeding generation will have the benefit of this much needed source of spiritual strength and growth. God never intended the teaching ministry to domineer in the five-fold ministry. He also never intended for it to be neglected:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	&ldquo;Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all 	good things.&rdquo; (Galatians 6:6)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">In Timothy 2:2, Paul exhorted young Timothy to see that others would be properly equipped to carry on the work of the ministry:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	&ldquo;The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit &nbsp;	thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">If this were the only verse in the New Testament referring to this subject it would stand alone to emphasize the necessity of the continuing ministry of the teacher since it shows a sequence of four generations of Christian teachers (Paul to Timothy to faithful men to others) all dependent on the teachings of their predecessors.	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	James also instructs his readers in the teaching ministry. In chapter three, verse one of his Epistle, he warns his brethren that they should: &ldquo;not be many masters (teachers), knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.&rdquo; I believe this exhortation cautions us to walk very carefully and to be completely assured of our calling into a ministry---whether it be that of the teacher or any of the other of the five-fold ministries. James places an awesome responsibility on all those within the teaching ministry because teaching has a greater impact on the lives and character of those being taught. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	James 3:1 offers a sharp warning against thrusting ourselves forward in the teaching ministry. We must not only completely sure that we have bee called by God, but that God has also equipped us to fulfill this call. Eve then it is necessary for us to step into the ministry in all humility and be sure that our example is teaching the same message as our words.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csFF5D0528">The Importance Of The Teaching Ministry</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The teaching ministry can be likened to the foundation of a building. Without it, the local Body would be very unstable, never able to come to maturity. The lack of a sound teaching ministry leaves the flock an unstable, emotional entity who live solely for an emotional &ldquo;fix&rdquo; from service to service. A Body that is solely emotional has no concrete material with which to build a sound spiritual structure. Every church must have a balance of all of the five-fold ministries.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Matthew 28:19,20 instructs those who are called into the teaching ministry to:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	&ldquo;Go ye therefore and TEACH all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 	Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: TEACHING &nbsp;them to observe all 	things, whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even 	unto the end of the world, Amen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The word &ldquo;teach&rdquo; refers to the winning of the lost, it literally means to &ldquo;MAKE DISCIPLES&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; refers to the training of those disciples once they have been won to Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	God has given us the authority to speak his word in his name to bring about the desired results of growth and maturity within the Body of Christ. He has invested in us the ability and the authority to speak a &ldquo;thus saith the Lord&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Teaching, as Christ&rsquo;s example demonstrates, was and is his method of extending his kingdom. however, just how does teaching fit into the overall ministry of the Church? &nbsp;Just how does it relate to the ministry of the Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist and Pastor? There is truth in the statement that we cannot qualify nor effectively function within any one of these ministries unless we are a teacher. One of the major differences in the qualifications of the Elders and Deacons, listed in Titus 1:9, is that the Elder must be one who has been taught the faithful Word. Paul also writes to Timothy that an Elder or Bishop must be able to teach (I Timothy 3:2). Whatever your calling into the fivefold ministry, you must be able to teach. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Deacons are not required to teach but it would be a plus in his favor for further ministry. This has been portrayed in the lives of at least two of the original seven deacons chosen in Acts 6:5. Goth Stephen and Philip went into ministry, beyond the call of duty, as able Preachers and Teachers of the Word.</span><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftn_GoBack11"><span class="csA7555675"><sup>[12]</sup></span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Some men active in these ministries will function to a greater degree in the teaching aspect of their ministry than others will. This is not because of their particaular calling as an Apostle, or Prophet, or Evangelist, or Pastor but depends on the gift of the Holy Ghost which equips the individual to minister to the needs of the flock he is minding. God equips the servant to meet the need.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	In order to teach, we must not only have the knowledge but also the ability to present the knowledge effectively--so that others may learn and retain it. TEACHING has not begun unless LEARNING has taken place.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Although all of the fivefold ministries require some teaching, there is a ministry that is solely devoted to teaching. This ministry may be seen int the &ldquo;Traveling Teacher&rdquo; who will also function as an Apostle, Prophet or Evangelist. There is a necessity, however, for Elders who are called to the teaching ministry within the Local Assembly (Galatians 6:6).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	There may be novices on the local level who may not yet qualify as Elders yet who show promise in the Teaching Ministry. They may be deacons or they may not have progressed to that level yet. Although these men may be used to a degree in teaching, they must always function under the supervision of established leaders within the local Body. Their God-given ministries may be used in such areas as youth or children&rsquo;s ministries, ladies ministries or, possibly, in home meetings. As they grow and develop, their ministry may well develop to the capacity of local leadership as Deacon or Elder. While any individual is functioning as a teacher, they must continue in submission to those over them, seek to develop their ministry through intensive study and prayer, and earnestly strive to qualify scripturally for the office of Elder (as seen in I Timothy 3 and Titus 1).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Next, I will discuss how spiritual teaching operates. There must be a balance between the practical and the theoretical at all times. A man&rsquo;s doctrine and his experience must balance one another. Our knowledge of the &ldquo;written Word&rdquo; must equal our relationship with the &ldquo;living Word&rdquo;. We should teach first by example and then by word.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Our everyday life must always speak of a life that is hid with Christ in God. This same lesson was taught by our Lord in the Sermon on the Mount.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	&ldquo;But whosoever shall &ldquo;do&rdquo; and &ldquo;teach&rdquo; them, the same shall be called great in the Kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; (Matthew 5:19)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Demonstration and example have always been the best teaching methods. It is not the only way to teach but it is the best way to produce a Body Ministry within the Local Assembly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Christ, as always, is our supreme example as the greatest teacher. He demonstrated the Sermon on the Mount by his personality and his practical dealings with people in the every day affairs of life. He demonstrated that the Gospel of the Kingdom had come by his healing of the sick. He demonstrated his power over creation by calming the waves. Isn&rsquo;t this &ldquo;DOING&rdquo; and &ldquo;TEACHING&rdquo;? One who is not doing should not be teaching. It is imperative that a teacher do and then teach. If you desire to bring the flock to spiritual maturity, you must both instruct them and demonstrate what you teach. The Body must see it done to truly learn the lesson.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Doing is only one aspect of an effective teaching ministry. It is also essential that the Holy Ghost be able to &ldquo;ILLUMINATE&rdquo; our minds as to Divine Truths if we are to be able to effectively teach these truths. Even an unregenerate mind can have an academic knowledge of the Bible. Some of the most reprobate individuals have what is sometimes called a working knowledge of the Bible--often just enough to create a stumbling block to finding eternal life. For the Word of God to bring life, either to the teacher or the student, it must be coupled with the activity and ministry of the Holy Ghost as seen in I Corinthians 2:14. Verses 6-14 could be titled &ldquo;the Principle of Spiritual Revelation&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	There is no way possible that we can know God by MIND alone. Spiritual knowledge does not come by human deduction or reason. God is clearly portrayed as a reasonable being in Isaiah 1:18 when he says: &ldquo;Come now, and let us reason together.&rdquo; There is room for reason in the work of God as is shown in the Apostle&rsquo;s decision to choose the fist Deacons in Acts 6:2, &ldquo;It is not reason that we should leave the Word of God, and serve tables.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	A teacher in the Body of Christ is not only a reasonable and well-informed individual with a &nbsp;vast knowledge, he must also be open to the move of the Holy Ghost. There is nothing wrong with being endued with vast knowledge as long as the principle of revelation is active as well. One aspect of the work of the Spirit is to teach us that which the Lord would have us to know.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	The Holy Ghost has taken the place of Christ as the Divine Teacher during this dispensations of the Church Age (John 14:26). It is the job of the Spirit to teach us and to bring all things to our remembrance. This facet of his ministry is nowhere more crucial than in the ministry of the teacher who must often recall truths on the spur of the moment (Luke21:12-15).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	It is common knowledge that much that was revealed to the Apostle Paul was received by direct revelation from the Lord via the Holy Ghost. Paul was also an avid student and reader. This was revealed as he speaks of having sat at the feet of Gameliel and when he mentions the books and &nbsp;parchments he wanted brought to him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	What I am trying to impress upon you is that we must give ourselves to serious and in-depth study while we remain open to the revelation which comes only from the Spirit of God. However, extended periods of study during times of spiritual dryness are very dangerous because, without the Spirits unction, we may easily regress to pursuing truth purely on a mental basis. As we plunge into a period of study,we must pray and seek the Spirit&rsquo;s quickening on our Body, Soul and Spirit, that our study will be enriched and anointed. Such topics as Hermeneutics, Bible Study Methods, are important, yet they may be religiously used and you might still dry up spiritually. A good practice to employ during your extended periods of study is to take time to worship, praise, and pray and, I could add, to physically relax.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	If you try to treat the Bible as you would any other written book, you will operate solely on the human level. You will never be fit or qualified to step into the ministry of a Bible teacher. We need a sound balance between biblical doctrine and spiritual life to be suited for the task and ministry of a mature, anointed, Bible teacher. An individual who has sound doctrine but is lacking in spiritual life or experience, produces in his Bible teaching a dead, powerless religion.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	On the other end of the spectrum, one who has a powerful experience and a rich spiritual life, yet lacks good sound doctrine produces nothing but emotionalism in his ministry. We need a healthy blend of spiritual life and sounds doctrine and Bible study to produce a truly healthy , mature group of believers. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Most of us have a tendency to lean either toward excessive study or spiritual life in any particular stage of growth in our Christian walk. It is a good sign of maturity when we begin to find a balance. It is the Spirit dwelling within us who is able to bring this balance and give us the mind of Christ (I Corinthians 2:16). It is the in-working of the Holy Ghost that enables us to discern and know spiritual truths far above and beyond the sensual and natural level.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Paul&rsquo;s primary concern was that new converts would enter into the spiritual life. It wasn&rsquo;t the theologians he was encouraging, but rather the common, run-of-the-mill, Christian. He not only offers understanding and knowledge of the things of Christ as seen in Ephesians 1:15-18. He also expresses his desire to see them strengthened, rooted and grounded in Christ, and to be endowed with a comprehension of the deep things of God (Ephesians 3:16-19).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	We can see from these portions of Scripture, as well as from I Corinthians 1:26-31, that spiritual insight and usefulness in the ministry is not dependent upon intellectual ability. In order for a man to fulfill the Biblical Ministry of Teacher, he must be one who is so in-dwelt by the Holy Ghost that he is capable of receiving spiritual truth and is able to impart this firsthand truth to others. He will only be effective in as much as he knows the truth, that he has an experiential knowledge. As the Scripture puts it, the husbandman must be the first partaker of the fruit. Even then, however, he must be able to organize this knowledge in a logical, intelligible manner as God infers:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">	Precept upon precept, Precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little and there a little. (Isaiah 28:10,13) He must be able to think, talk and write with logic and clarity. A good teacher is able to speak in a way that is easily understood and at the same time interesting to listen to.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	I would like to close this chapter by saying that if you feel a definite call into the teaching ministry and have difficulty in presenting good teaching or building good messages, a study in Homiletics could be of help, but above all else don&rsquo;t eliminate the necessity of depending on the Holy Ghost to teach and empower you. </span><span class="cs2C025596">Study Questions Four (Ch. 10-12)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE1B23F0B">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><a name="_Toc306116104"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></a></p><h1 class="csC1DF526">
