The slaying of the Passover lamb was a shadow of the death of Christ, Says Paul, 'fChrist our Passover is sacrificed for us," The sheaf of first fruits, which at the time of the Pas
sover was waved before the Lord, was typical of the resurrection of Christ. Paul says, in speaking of the resurrec\-tion of the Lord, and of all His, people, "Christ the first\-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at His coming,"

The gospel of Christ reflects glory upon the Jewish' age. It sheds light upon the whole Jewish economy, and gives significance to the ceremonial law. The tabernacle, or temple, of God on earth was a pattern of the original in Heaven. All the ceremonies of
 the Jewish law were pro\-phetic, typical of mysteries in the plan of redemption. The rites and ceremonies of the law were given by Christ Him\-
self, who, enshrouded in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, was the leader of the host of Isra
el; and this law should be treated with great respect, for it is sacred. Even after it was no longer to be observed, Paul presented it before the Jews .in its true position and value, showing its place in the plan of redemption and its relation - . to the
