<p>"Antioch is in the extreme north of Pisidia. Here they found a synagogue and many proselytes. They met with great success in preaching the gospel, but the Jews stirred up a violent opposition against them, and they were obliged to leave the place. On his return, Paul again visited Antioch for the purpose of confirming the disciples (Acts14:21). It has been identified with the modern Yalobatch, lying to the east of Ephesus."
