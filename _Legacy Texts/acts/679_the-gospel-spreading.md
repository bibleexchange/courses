<p>Chapters 8-12</p>


<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
<p>A. Saul Persecutes the Church vs. 1-3</p>
<p>Chapter eight begins a new period in Church history. This is the first "Great Persecution" of the Church. Yes, Christ had been mistreated and crucified. Yes, the religious elite fought the Gospel from its beginning, but this period is marked by mass brutality of the saints. This is the most severe persecution the Church experienced up until this time. This was an organized effort to search out and eliminate Christianity.</p>

<p>IV. CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
<p>A. Peter Reports to the Church vs. 1-18</p>
<p>1. Salvation must come first; Religious form, ceremony, rituals, rules, and regulations cannot be placed before the lives and salvation of men.</p>
<p>2. They should have rejoiced for the saved that were brought to the knowledge of Christ. Instead their spirits were full of contention and divisiveness because some religious practices were violated.</p>
<p>3. Prejudice, discrimination, rituals, and rules can blind us to God's purpose to reach out to <em>all</em> men in salvation. All men are to be reached no matter who they are. No church should exclude anyone. The church's mission is to reach both the Jews and the Gentiles, poor and the rich, dirty and the clean, the lower, middle and the upper class.</p>
