<h1>Introduction to Doctrine</h1>
<p>Dictionary Definition of Doctrine â€" The principles, beliefs, or dogma of any church, sect, or party.</p>
<h2>The Meaning of Doctrine</h2>
<pre>The word "doctrine" literally means "teaching" or "instruction" and may be defined as the fundamental truths of the Bible arranged in systematic form. This study is also commonly called theology, which means literally a reasoned discourse about God. Theology or doctrine may be defined as a science which deals with our knowledge of God and His relations with man.</pre>
<h3>Why do we describe theology or doctrine as a "science"?</h3>
<p>Science is the systematic and logical arrangement of certified facts. We describe theology/doctrine as a science because it consists of facts relating to God and Divine things arranged in a systematic and logical order. </p>
<h3>What is the connection between theology and religion?</h3>
<p>Theology is knowledge of God, but religion is the practice of what is known. (John 13:17; James 1:27) You can be a theologian and not at all religious â€" i.e., not having any genuine spiritual experience.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between a doctrine and a dogma?</h3>
<p>Dogma is man's statement of the truth set forth in a creed; while, doctrine is the fundamental truths of the Bible arranged in a systematic form. EXAMPLE: The Roman Catholic Church instructs men to call the pope Holy Father (dogma), whereas the Bible says in Matthew 23:9 "call no man your father". (doctrine). The very context of Christ's command is addressing the pride and arrogance of men that usurp honor and recognition that is not their own to claim. "Our source is not in man, but is in God" is the doctrine Christ is emphasizing. The false doctrine that prefaces this particular dogma is that the pope is literally Christ on the earth. Pope Pius X (1903-1914) is quoted in a sermon on the authority of the pope: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pope is not simply the representative of Jesus Christ. On the contrary, he is Jesus Christ Himself, under the veil of the flesh, and who by means of a being common to humanity continues His ministry amongst men ... Does the Pope speak? It is Jesus Christ Who is speaking. Does he teach? It is Jesus Christ Who teaches. Does he confer grace or pronounce an anathema? It is Jesus Christ Himself Who is pronouncing the anathema and conferring the grace. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dogma of the Roman Catholic church is based on false doctrine and therefore it is false. Doctrine could be understood as "simply what the Bible says" and dogma is man's conclusions drawn from the text of the Scripture. Dogma can be true, but is not necessarily true.

<h2>The Need for Doctrine</h2>
<h3>Doctrinal knowledge supplies the need for an authoritative and systematic statement of truth. John 17:17</h3>
<p>Authoritative statements are so important that we may be able to convince the gainsayers (Titus 1:9). Doctrinal knowledge also helps the Believer understand at least three things: 1) Who we are (sinners/saints/loved/judged, etc.), 2) where we came from (dust, image of God, etc.) and 3) where we are headed (heaven, hell, blessings, curses, etc.).</p>
<h3>Correct doctrinal knowledge is essential to salvation.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I Timothy 4:16â€"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every experience we enjoy with God is dependent on faith. (Faith is not a shot in the dark, but is securely founded on the WORD OF GOD. Romans 10:17) Paul asks a significant question that establishes our point in verse 14 of Romans 10, "how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" CORRECT doctrinal knowledge is essential, because it is not sufficient to just believe in something, but we must possess that which is TRUTH. God does not respond to hope-so's, or I've been told that..., but God does respond to faith in His Word. 
EXAMPLE: Acts 17:22-34. The people of Athens had erected an altar with the inscription "To the Unknown God." Paul declared on Mars Hill that this Unknown God whom they ignorantly worshipped was the God who made Heaven and earth. The people of Athens had not known SALVATION through ignorant worship, but those that came to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and him crucified and resurrected from the dead did absolutely experience salvation! I Timothy 4:16 infers that the if we do not take heed unto the doctrine than we will be lost.</p>
<h3>Doctrinal knowledge is essential to the full development of Christian character, and contributes to our instruction in righteousness. II Tim. 3:16, 17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>II Timothy 3:17â€"That the man of God may be perfect, ...
Perfect, that is, full development. There is progressive development in the spiritual life as there is in the physical life. There are stages of perfection. Is a baby perfect? As a baby, yes! But growth must take place or we would say something is wrong. I Peter 2:2 says, "As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:" 
It is more important to live right than to know doctrine, but you will not live right without right Christian doctrine. Correctness of opinion is second to correctness of living, but correctness of opinion is a necessity to living right. (Gal. 2:17; Titus 1:16; I Peter 1:22; Eph. 2:5,8-10; Phil. 2:12,13; Heb. 12:14; I Peter 1:16)
Can you truly love Jesus without knowledge of God's Word? An understanding of doctrine is essential to growth in Christian character. It has been well said that "Christian character is a fruit that grows only on the tree of Christian doctrine." Correct doctrine is to a Christian what a man's backbone is to his body. He does not wear it on his chest, but without it he would be a hump-backed or jellyfish Christian. A lasting relationship with Christ requires a commitment to truth. We need a strong backboneâ€"Doctrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus is our foremost example and He had Doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 7:28,29â€"...the people were astonished at his doctrine: 29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.(Mark 1:22; Luke 4:32; John 7:16)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Doctrinal knowledge is a safeguard against error.</h3>
<p>(Matt. 22:29; Gal. 1:6-9; II Tim. 4:2-4)</p>
<p>Why is doctrine so important?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eph 4:14â€"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need sound doctrine and conviction for those truths. We need to what we believe and why we believe it. An ignorant Christian does not scare the devil. Many people compromise and fall into error because not only do they lack doctrine, but they lack conviction for the truths they do know. Most Christians are filled with preferences instead of convictions towards doctrinal truth. Preferences can be changed with no apparent loss, but convictions cannot be changed without great loss.</p>
<p>CONVICTION: You SEE it as God's Word, BELIEVE it to be truth, and LIVE by it (and possibly die for it!). UNNEGOTIABLE</p>
<p>PREFERENCE: You've HEARD about it, been TOLD or even TAUGHT, but don't believe in the absoluteness and authority of the doctrine. NEGOTIABLE (Only your opinion.)</p>
<p>Clear cut beliefs make for clear cut convictions.</p>
<p>BEWARE OF FALSE DOCTRINE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I Timothy 4:1â€"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always follow the Word. We need to approach every problem with the question, "What saith the Scripture?" (Romans 4:3). If the whole world would unite in an agreement contrary to the Word of God, then the whole world is absolutely wrong! Keep it simple: Stick to the Word. How do we know that which is truth from that which is false? (John 8:31,32) Continue in His Word. 
Because of the ugly fact that not all preaching is truth (Matthew 16:12), every Christian must thoroughly involve themselves with the Word of God. Truth is greatly needed! (Colossians 2:8; Hebrews 13:9) There is a need to study the Word of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 2:15â€"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible student must be earnest, diligent, and careful. In our study of the Word of God, we compare Scripture with Scripture for no prophecy of the Scripture is of private interpretation (2 Peter 1:20). So much error happens because men grab a Scripture out of context and just run with it. Interpret Scripture by Scripture. 
EXAMPLE: What does being "born-again" mean in John 3:3? Is Jesus meaning to enter the mother's womb a second time? No. The answer is not No just because of logic or reasoning, but because Jesus Himself qualifies the term in verses 6-8â€"born of water and of the Spirit.... See also: John 1:13; James 1:18; I Peter 1:23; Eph. 4:26.
In our study and search for truth it is imperative to remind ourselves to be wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil (Romans 6:19). We do not need a complete knowledge of the wrong, but we do need a complete understanding of that which is right.</p>
<h3>Doctrinal knowledge comes in obedience to the will of God.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>John 7:17â€"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to test the Word of God. Put God to the test and see if He will not be faithful. David said, "O taste and see that the Lord is good." (Psalm 34:8) As we walk in the will of God we will experience and witness the truth and reality of the words Christ spoke. God does not just command us to believe an unopened book, but he opens the pages of Scripture to our understanding and invites us to experience every word. It is in this experience that a deeper knowledge of doctrine comes. Until then, all we have is hear-say.</p>

<h1>Anthropology: The Doctrine of Man</h1>
 <h2>The Creation of Man</h2>
 
 <h3 > Special Creation - “after his kind” Gen. 1:25</h3>
 <p > The term ‘s 
 special  creation’ refers to the doctrine that all living
 organisms were created according definite ‘species’ and that these species
 will produce after their kind. This principle defies the evolutionary hypothesis that
 each species is an evolved form of some earlier species. Biblically put, special
 creation means that all living organisms will produce after
 his kind . "c18">A very simple example of this principle
 is that when you plant an orange seed, it is most definite that an orange tree will
 develop and not any other kind of plant (i.e. apples, watermelons, cucumber,
 etc.). </p>
 
 <h3 > "c18">The Image of God </h3>
 
 <p > Genesis 1:26 says man was created in the image of God. To what
 does this “image” and “likeness” refer? </p>
 <h4 > There may 
   be  reference here to physical likeness. There are
 some who believe that such scriptures as Psalm 17:15 teach that God has a visible
 form and that man in the garden bore that image. See also Isaiah 6:1 and Acts
 7:55,56. </h4>
 
 <p > However, we must be careful to remember that while God is
 capable of assuming human form , the essence of His being is
 Spirit.  (John 4:24) </p>
 <h4 > It has reference particularly to a moral and intellectual likeness. The following passages
 speak of the “image” of God in respect to knowledge and righteousness.
 (Ephesians 4:23; Colossians 3:10; 2 Corinthians 3:18) </h4>
 
 <h3 > Evolution versus Special Creation </h3>
 <p  >Opposed to special creation is the theory of
 evolution, which teaches that all forms of life developed from one form and that higher
 species, developed from a lower.  So that, for example, what was once a snail
 became a fish; what was once a fish became a reptile; what was once a reptile became a
 bird, and what was once an ape became a human being. </p>
 <h4 > What is a species? </h4>
 <h4><a></a> A class of plants or
 animals which have characteristic properties in common and can be indefinitely
 propagated without changing those characteristics. </h4>
 <h4 > What is a test by which the distinction of species is known? </h4>
 
 <p>If living organisms can
 be paired together and so propagate indefinitely a fertile offspring, they are of the
 same species. </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Is evolution a scientifically proven
 fact?  No, it is a 
 theory . </h4>
 
 
 
 
 <h3 > Reasons there is a God and Evolution is a
 Lie </h3>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 >  THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > A plan without a planner? How would there be nothing and then
 suddenly something? The existence, beauty, immensity and order of our universe is
 evidence enough of a Designer at work and not mere coincidence. </p>
 
 <p > SUN — 10% closer earth would sizzle or if the sun was 10%
 farther away the earth would freeze. The sun is so big that it could contain 1,300,000
 earths. </p>
 
 <p > MOON — If it was any closer, huge tidal waves would
 engulf us. </p>
 
 <p > AIR — Just the right amount of oxygen is present in the
 air so that if any was added or taken away, life could not exist on earth. </p>
 
 <p > STARS — Our solar system with its sun, and planets, the
 Milky Way, is composed of 100 billion stars each with their own planet system. The
 universe is considered to be infinitely expanding. </p>
 
 <p > EARTH — Job 12:8 “Speak to the earth, and it shall
 teach thee.” The earth is spinning in four directions at least all at
 once. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > THE WORLD OF NATURE </h4>
 
 
 
 
 <li> "c0">THE ROSE — Color — scent, all packed into
 a tiny seed never gets mixed up. 
 <li> "c0">THE RADISH — Black seed — Green leaves
 — Red coat — White meat. 
 <li> "c0">THE WATERMELON — seed reproduces itself 1
 million times. 
 <li> "c0">THE ACORN — Oak tree — The Poet said,
 “ "c0 c16">Only "c0"> God could make a
 Tree.” 
 
 
 
 
 <h4 > OUR HUMAN BODY </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > The human body is incredibly complex and amazing. It begins
 with the union of two cells and it takes upon itself some 21 trillion other cells (all
 going to the right places). </p>
 
 <p > THE HEART — weighs almost 3 lbs. and pumps enough
 pressure to lift a battleship or push 100 freight cars down a track. </p>
 
 <p > THE BRAIN — greatest computer —Much of our
 brain’s potential goes unused. </p>
 
 <p > THE EAR — sound scale — There are sounds in the air
 that we do not hear, and yet the ear has within it the potential to hear all
 sounds. </p>
 <p>  Example — A dog will react to a whistle that we
 cannot hear. </p>
 <p> </p>
 <p> THE EYE — Transmits sight to the brain which changes
 the images right side up. </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> THE BLOOD — Vessels like an  incredibly complex
 city. Blood cells detect harm and fight off the enemy </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> THE NERVES—There are over one billion nerves (main
 stems, branches and endings) in the human body all managed by one brain. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > THE CREATION OF LIFE </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > How did life begin? Some say a product of evolution.
 Evolutionists seek to link man with brute beasts, but Jesus Christ came into the world
 to link man with God. John 1:12; Ephesians 2:15; II Peter 1:4; I John 3:2 </p>
 <p > Life did not come by human nature evolving into the Divine, but
 by the Divine entering into human nature. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > THE THEORIES OF EVOLUTION </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > There are so many gaps and so much supposition in evolution that
 it cannot be classified as a true science. The gaps in evolution have become known as
 the ‘missing links.’ It is made up of exaggerated speculation and theories
 and not ‘observable facts.’ As a matter of fact, Evolution requires so much
 blind faith of its followers that it is more accurate to describe it as a religion. In
 the United States, it has become the religion of the State under the guise of
 “Separation of Church and State.” </p>
 <p > Let’s take a look at some of the Darwinian
 ‘scientific method’ at work! Consider if you could recognize any of your
 deceased relatives if you were give as scant evidence as we see below. THE MISSING
 LINKS: </p>
 
 <h5> Hesperopithecus  — Harold Cocki
 — Nebraska Man — This model was constructed from one tooth that was
 discovered which eventually proved to be from a pig. </h5>
 <h5></h5>
 <h5> Homo neanderthalensis  —
 Neanderthal Man — Germany — Constructed from 
 part  of a skull, thighbone, one rib 
 fragment .  Scientists could not agree on the findings if they
 were even from the same body. </h5>
 <h5></h5>
 <h5> Pithecanthropus erectus  —
 “The ape man who walked erect” Known as the Java Man — The entire
 model was constructed from only a piece of skull, two teeth, and one thighbone. 10
 scientists said they were the bones of an ape; 7 said they were the bones of a man. 7
 others said they were a “missing link” in the chain of
 evolution! </h5>
 <h5></h5>
 <h5> Eoathropus dawsoni  — Piltdown
 Man — From one piece of jaw, one piece of skull, one canine tooth, two molar
 teeth, and one nasal bone.  Applying the chemical dying process proved the jawbone
 does not belong to this skull at all. </h5>
 <h5></h5>
 <h5> Homo erectus  — Heidelberg Man
 — Again, an entire  diagram of a
 complex creature of hundreds of moving parts totally reconstructed from the exhaustive
 resource of one  jawbone found in the sands
 of Germany. </h5>
 
 
 
 <h2 ><a></a>  The
 Original Condition of Man </h2>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h3 ><a></a> Man was
 created a perfect being. </h3>
 
 
 
 <p > The record of Scripture plainly describes that man was not
 created a simple cell that evolved or any other such theory, but was created perfectly
 complete and mature. There were no flaws in God’s design. </p>
 
 
 
 <h3 > Man was created a free moral agent. </h3>
 
 
 
 <p > The sin in the garden was volitional on the part of man. It was
 completely voluntary for they had the freedom
 of choice. </p>
 
 
 
 <h3 ><a></a> Man was
 created with an inherent religious instinct, which made him conscious of moral
 responsibility to God, and capable of communion with God. </h3>
 
 
 
 
 
 <h3 > Original man was created sinless (Genesis 1:31)
 and innocent of evil. (Genesis 2:17; 3:5-7) </h3>
 
 
 <h3></h3>
 <p> Genesis 1:31: </p>
 
 <li > very –  mead (Hebrew)
 superlative; exceeding; very 
 <li > good –  towb (Hebrew)
 good; best; beautiful 
 
 <h2 ></h2>
 
 
 
 <h3 > The original man was endued with lofty
 intellectual faculties. Genesis 2:19, 20; Hebrews 2:6-9 </h3>
 
 
 
 <p > Man was created with enough intellectual capacity to give names
 to all living creatures, and to have dominion over them.  The modern theories of
 evolution, which try to explain the development of man from a lower order of beings,
 are monstrous products of unbridled imaginations. </p>
 
 <p ><a></a> Genesis 3:7 does not
 suggest that Adam and Eve were created intellectually ignorant. The fact they could be
 naked and not know  it would seem to suggest
 a lack of intelligence. The answer to this puzzle is that they were created in 
 innocence and not 
 ignorance . It is hard for us to comprehend a world full of innocence
 and void of evil. But this is exactly the atmosphere of Eden that Adam and Eve enjoyed.
 There were no impure thoughts or motives, no 
 sewer-thinking , or any such thing. Until the fall there was no
 precedent for sin . They enjoyed the glory and
 beauty of the purity of God in a pristine form—untouched by the filth of
 sin. </p>

 <p > In the midst of the garden was placed two trees of destiny. The
 first was a tree of life, but the second was the forbidden tree of knowledge of good
 and evil. Why did God place such a horrid tree in the midst of Eden’s blissful
 paradise? It was a test for man. </p>
 
 
 
 <h3 > The Tempter </h3>
 
 
 
 <p > In his temptation of the Crown of
 God’s Creation , satan employed the agent of a serpent. The
 outstanding characteristic of this serpent was that it was 
  more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had
 made . The serpent, satan, was that eternally damned and rebellious angel
 of God. Why would he be allowed to put one foot into the garden, or be allowed to
 operate in that blessed place? It was a test for man. </p>
 
 
 
 <h3 > The Test </h3>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p > The preceding answer leads us to one ultimate question of
 purpose—Why was it necessary for man to be tested? </p>
 <p > First, God’s desire is to fellowship with a people
 that chooses  to love Him. He is not content
 to have the admiration of mindless robots. Second, in order for there to be a
 ‘choice’ there must be at least two options or there is really no
 ‘choosing.’ Therefore, the Tree of Knowledge was placed in the garden to
 test man’s devotion to God. </p>
 <p > Let us consider two other relevant questions: </p>
 <p > 1) Did man’s failure reflect at all on God? No. God is
 infallible. God created and designed man, but He also gave man the freedom of choice.
 Man’s fall does not expose some flaw in God’s design, but emphasizes the
 wonderfulness of God’s design. God designed it so that man could choose God, but
 he also had the liberty to not choose God and His ways. </p>
 <p > 2) Did Adam HAVE to sin? No. If Adam HAD to sin, there would
 still have existed no true ‘choice’ for Adam simply would have had
 ‘no choice’ but to sin. With every test from God comes also the grace to
 overcome! We can pass the test by the grace of God. There existed for Adam and still
 exists for us the potential of not falling. </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> Jude 1:24— Now unto him that is
 able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his
 glory with exceeding joy, </p>
 
 
 <h2 ><a></a> The Fact of
 the Fall </h2>
 
 
 
 <p > The most tragic event connected with man is his fall into sin.
 Genesis 3:1-6 reveals that the first man fell. The steps in the fall were: </p>
 
 
 <li>
 <h3 >  Listening  to
 slanders about God. vs. 1 </h3>
 
 
 <p> Hath God said…? </p>
 
 
 
 <h3 >  Doubting  God’s
 Word and His love. vs. 4,5 </h3>
 
 
 <p> “God is keeping something wonderful from
 you!” </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h3 >  Looking  at what God
 has forbidden. </h3>
 
 
 <p> And when the woman saw…the
 tree  v. 6 (Compare with Joshua 7:21.) </p>
 
 <p> Note the steps of sin: </p>
 <p>
                         “I
 saw” </p>
 <h3> “I coveted” </h3>
 <p>
                                                 “I
 took” </p>
 <h4> “I hid” </h4>
 
 
 
 <h3 >  Lusting  for what God
 has prohibited. v.6 </h3>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p > Here we have the “Lust of the flesh”, “Lust of
 the eyes” and the “Pride of life” spoken of in 1 John 2:16. (Compare
 with Luke 4:1-15.) </p>
 <h2><a></a></h2>
 
 
 <h2 ><a></a> The Results
 of the Fall </h2>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h3 > Upon Man’s Physical Nature </h3>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > The ground was cursed, so that henceforth it would
 not yield good alone. Gen. 3:17 </h4>
 
 
 
 <p> “How often are all the fruits of man's toll destroyed by
 blasting, by mildew, by insects, wet weather, land floods, etc.!  Anxiety and
 carefulness are the labouring man's portion.”—Adam Clarke </p>
 <h4></h4>
 
 
 <h4 > Multiplied sorrow and pain to the woman in
 childbearing and labor, and subjection of the woman to her husband. Genesis
 3:16 </h4>
 
 
 <h4></h4>
 <p > …I will multiply… could
 also be rendered “in multiplying, I will multiply” as it is rendered in
 Genesis 22:17. Here is a figure of speech expressing a multiplication ontop of a
 multiplication. What pain the woman experiences in childbirth since the fall is in the
 very least much greater than was ever intended. </p>
 <p > …and he shall rule over thee . In
 the beginning a great responsibility was given to Adam to care for, have dommionion
 over and protect God’s creation. God looked down on Adam’s solitude and
 said it was not good for man to be alone. This is why God created Eve. She was to be a
 ‘ help  meet” to Adam in his great
 charge. At her creation, the woman had probably as much right to rule as the man, but
 subjection to the will of her husband is one part of her curse. </p>
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Exhausting physical labor in order to subsist.
  Genesis 3:19 </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > This hard labor should serve as a reminder to man of his sin.
 Sin is a hard master and the labor of sin is difficult. In years gone by, hard labor
 was a more common part of a criminal’s sentence. The hardness of the labor,
 combined with the amount of time served, proved to be an effective deterrent to crime.
 If we choose to do things our way in rebellion to God’s will, we are destined to
 great toil. God’s way and method is ALWAYS best. (There remains a 
 rest  to the people of God! Hebrews 4:9) </p>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Physical and spiritual death. Genesis 3:19; 3:2;
 5:5; Romans 5:12 </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p > Of course, with all this came also a fear of God, a shame of
 sin, a hiding from God’s presence, and finally, an expulsion from the garden.
 Genesis 3:8-11,22-24 </p>
 <p> Adam and Eve suffered from a guilty conscience. The
 evidences of their guilty consciences were they 
 ran , hid , and tried to 
 cover  themselves. There is shame, as well as death,
 in sin. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > The Fall Perverted Man’s 
 Instincts          [see
 ILL #1 p.58] </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > The works of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21) are a perversion of
 man’s instincts . </p>

 <li>
 <h4 > All men, without respect of condition or class,
 are sinners before God. Romans 3:9,22,23; Psalm 14; Isaiah 53:6 </h4>
 
 
 
 <p> There may be differences in the 
 degrees  of sin among people, but never in the 
 fact  of sin— ALL have
 sinned. </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > The whole world sits under condemnation, wrath,
 and a curse. </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> Rom. 3:19— That 
 every  mouth may be stopped
 and all the world  may become
 guilty before God . </p>
 <p></p>
 <p > God’s law demands perfect obedience, but no sinner can
 yield such obedience; hence, the curse of a broken law rests upon those breaking it.
 John 3:36; Gal. 3:10; Eph. 2:3 </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > Unregenerate men are regarded as children of the
 devil and not sons of God. </h4>
 
 
 <h4> 1 John 3:8-10; John 8:44 “Ye are of your father the
 devil.” </h4>

 sin and satan. </h4>

 all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the
 desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as
 others. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > The 
 entire  nature of man—mentally, spiritually, morally,
 and physically—is sadly affected by sin. </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>

 <h5 > The understanding is darkened. Eph. 4:18; 1 Cor.
 2:14 </h5>
 
 
 
 <h5> Ephesians 4:18— Having the
 understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that
 is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: </h5>
 
 <p> I Corinthians 2:14— But the
 natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness
 unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. </p>

 <p><a></a> "c39">The Doctrine
 of Salvation </p>
 <h1> Soteriology </h1>
 
 
 <h2><a></a> INTRODUCTION TO
 SOTERIOLGY </h2>
 
 <p> Five Cardinal Doctrines: </p>
 
 <li> 
 Salvation                 -
 Matt. 10:22; Mark 10:26; Acts 2:21; 16:30; Eph. 2:8 
 <li> 
 Healing                 -
 Matt. 4:23; Matt. 9:35; Luke 9:11; Acts 4:22; 10:38 
 <li> 
 Baptism                 -
 Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3; Acts 1:22; Rom. 6:4; Eph. 4:5 
 <li> 
 Sanctification                 -
 John 17:17; I Cor. 1:30; I Thess. 4:3,4; 2 Thess. 2:13 
 <li> Second 
 Coming         - Matt.
 26:64; Mark 13:32; 14:62; Luke 21:27;  Acts 1:11 
 
 
 <p > We use the term ‘cardinal doctrines’ to refer
 to preeminent  and 
 fundamental  doctrines. Generally speaking, Cardinal Doctrines
 are a common bond to the majority of Believers regardless of Denomination. Most other
 doctrines can be logically sub-categorized under one of these five, as well. </p>
 
 <p> Salvation is an all-inclusive word. The term 
 Salvation  expresses Deliverance – Safety
 – Preservation – Soundness – Restoration – Healing. </p>
 
 <p > Salvation  in New Testament
 Greek: </p>
 <p> Nouns – soteria ; 
 soterion  [4991,4992 <a>[1]</a> ] Luke 1:69;
 2:30; Acts 4:12 </p>
 <p> Verb – sozo  [4982]
 Matt. 1:21; John 10:9; Acts 15:11 </p>
 
 <p > The concept and state of salvation is viewed in the past (Rom.
 8: 24), present (I Cor. 15: 2), and future (Rom. 13: 11) tenses in the
 Scriptures. </p>
 
 <p> To be saved is to be freed: </p>
 
 <li> From the curse of the law – Galatians 3:13 
 <li> From wrath – 1 Thessalonians 5:9 
 <li> From death – 2 Corinthians 7:10 
 <li> From destruction – 2 Thessalonians 1:9 
 
 
 <p> We were lost, but we are now found (saved); </p>
 <p>         We were bound, but
 we are now free; </p>
 <p>
                 We
 were blind, but we now can see. </p>
 <p> "c0 c16">We were condemned, but we are now free from
 condemnation. (Romans 8:1) </p>

 <h2 ><a></a> The Nature
 of Salvation </h2>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h3 > Three Aspects of Salvation </h3>
 
 
 <p> 
 "c35 c22">                        Justification
 – Regeneration – Sanctification </p>
 <p></p>
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Justification – </h4>
 
 
 <p> "c0 c22">A judicial term bringing into our minds a
 courtroom scene </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Regeneration – </h4>
 
 
 <p> "c0 c22">Born into the family, bringing to our minds
 a household scene </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Sanctification </h4>
 
 
 <p> "c0 c22">Connected with worship, bringing to our
 minds a temple scene </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">A saved man is one who has been set right
 with God [JUSTIFICATION] and born into the family of God [REGENERATION] and is now
 dedicated to the service of God [SANCTIFICATION]. </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> "c62 c22"> "c0 c22">Being
 justified, he is made righteous. </p>
 <p> "c62 c22"> "c0 c22">Being
 regenerated, he is a child of God. </p>
 <p> "c22 c62"> "c0 c22">Being
 sanctified, he is a “saint.” </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">Do these blessings follow one another or are
 do they take place simultaneously? </p>
 <p> "c0 c22">We do see a logical order: </p>
 
 <li> "c0 c22">Set right in relation to God’s
 law. – Romans 3:24 [JUSTIFIED] 
 <li> "c0 c22">A new nature is imparted. –
 John 3:6 [REGENERATED] 
 <li> "c0 c22">Separated unto a new life and
 service. – Ephesians 2:10 [SANCTIFIED] 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c16">Yet "c0 c22">, the three
 experiences are simultaneous, and are separated only for the purpose of understanding
 and study. By one application of the precious blood of Jesus are all three experiences
 received. In an instant, we are justified, regenerated, and sanctified. </p>
 <p> "c0 c22">Although sanctification is a definite work
 accomplished at salvation, sanctification is also an on-going process. The ultimate
 condition of complete sanctification is perfection. (We will look closer at
 sanctification in a later study.) </p>
 <p> "c0 c22">All three blessings were procured by the
 atoning death of Christ.  Also, all three blessings flow from our union with
 Christ. </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">2 Corinthians 5:21— 
 "c0 c22 c17">For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
 made the righteousness of God in him. </p>
 
 <p> "c0 c22">Ephesians 1:7— 
 "c35 c16"> "c0 c22 c17">In whom we have redemption through his
 blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; </p>
 
 <p> "c0 c22">2 Corinthians 5:17— 
 "c35 c16"> "c0 c22 c17">Therefore if any man be in Christ, he
 is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
 new. </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h3 > Salvation is Two-fold: OUTWARD &
 INWARD </h3>
 
 
 <p></p>
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Justification — </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 
 <li> "c0 c22">A change in position: WAS in sin, NOW
 “In Christ” 2 Cor. 5:17 
 <li> "c0 c22">A change in condition: sinful to
 righteous. Psalm 51:5; I Cor. 6:11 
 <li> "c0 c22">It means to be set in right
 relationship with God. When we are justified, we are made righteous. It is
 ‘Just-as-if-I’d’ never sinned. 
 
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Regeneration — </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 
 <li> "c0 c22">A change in nature — “new
 creature” 
 <li> "c0 c22">WAS a Child of the Devil, NOW a Child of
 God (Divine nature) 
 
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Sanctification — </h4>
 
 
 <h4></h4>
 
 <li> "c0 c22">A change in character —
 “old things passed away, all things new” 
 <li> "c0 c22">Having the Fruit of the Spirit and
 putting on Christ. Gal. 5:22-24 
 <li> "c0 c22">Outward separation and inward
 purification from sin. 2 Cor. 7:1 
 
<h3 > The Conditions of Salvation </h3>
 
 
 <p></p>
 
 <li>
 <h4 > What is meant by 
 conditions  of salvation? </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">God’s requirements in the man whom He
 accepts for Christ’s sake and on whom He freely bestows the blessings of the
 gospel of grace. Under what conditions does God bestow the free gift of salvation?
 Simply, there must be life! (Rom. 8:16) </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > What are the conditions of salvation? </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">The Scriptures set forth:  Repentance
 — Faith — Confession. </p>
 <p> "c0 c22">Mark 1:15; Acts 22:16; 16:31; Romans 10:9,10;
 Hebrews 11:6; Acts 8: 13,21 </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Is intellectual faith sufficient? </h4>
 
 
 
 <p> "c0 c22"> James 2:19— 
 "c0 c22 c17">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also
 believe, and tremble. </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">No. We must have more than what the devils
 have! They believe and tremble and still work against the will of God. D.L. Moody said,
 “Doubt your doubts and believe God.” </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">Acts 8: 13,21— 
 "c0 c22 c17">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued
 with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were
 done. "c35 c16"> "c0 c22">21 
 "c0 c22 c17">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for 
 "c0 c16 c17">thy heart is not right "c0 c22 c17"> in
 the sight of God. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > What is the difference between faith and
 belief? </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">Faith is a Divine activity. (Eph. 6:17; John
 6:44; Rom. 10:17) Believing is a human action. God expects us to respond to the faith
 he has placed in us and He commands us to believe. (Mark 5:36) When God draws men, he
 is looking for something in him for we cannot respond properly to God unless we have
 faith. Hebrews 12:2— "c0 c22 c17">Jesus the author and finisher
 of our faith "c0 c22">. He helps us to believe. </p>

 <h4 > What is God’s command to all
 men? </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">Every individual is required to repent
 (including those in the Church). Acts 17:30; Rev. 2:5,16,21; 3:3,19 </p>
 <p> "c0 c22">To repent is to 
 "c0 c16">stop "c0 c22"> doing whatever it is you are doing. Some
 denominations suggest you repent of all sins at salvation—past, present 
 "c0 c16">and "c0 c22"> 
 "c0 c19 c22">future "c0 c22">. How can you repent of (stop doing)
 something you haven’t done? We can only repent of sins past and
 present. </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Can there be faith without repentance? </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">No. No one can receive the promises of God
 without repentance. Mark 1:15; Jonah 3:5-10 </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Can there be godly repentance without faith?
 No. </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0 c22">We need God at every step in our Christian

 God and God only responds to faith. Hebrews 11:6; 2 Timothy 2:25 </p>

 <h4 > Justification is a state of acceptance in which
 the believer stands. (Rom. 5:2) </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Justification is a complete and secure position in
 relation to God.  “Justified” is God’s verdict. (REMEMBER:
 Justification is a judicial term.) (Rom. 8:33,34) </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Justification is an act of God’s free grace
 wherein He pardons all our sins and accepts us as righteous. (The pardon must be
 accepted.) </h4>
 
 
 
 
 
 <h4 > Justification places the offender in the position
 of a righteous man.  God justifies the ungodly.  No earthly judge can do
 this. (Rom. 4:5) </h4>

 <p > A train is a means to an end. “Christ is the end of the

 <h3 > The Source of Justification —
 Grace </h3>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > The Operation of Grace Understood </h4>

 <h5 > Grace primarily means 
  favor , or the kindly disposition in God’s
 mind. </h5>
 
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p > Grace has been called “pure unrecompensed kindness and
 favor” or  “Unmerited
 favor.” Grace cannot incur debt. What God bestows, He bestows as a gift; we
 cannot pay for it.  (Rom. 6:23) Christian service is not the payment for
 God’s grace; service is the Christians way to express devotion and love to God.
 “We love Him because He first loved us.” (I John 4:19) </p>
 
 
 
 <h5 > Grace is God’s dealing with the sinner
 absolutely  apart from  the question
 of  merit  or 
  demerit.  Grace is neither treating a person as he deserves,
 nor treating him better than he deserves. </h5>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <h5 > Grace is infinite love expressing itself in
 infinite  goodness . </h5>
 
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p > A misunderstanding should be avoided. Grace does not mean that
 sin is forgiven because God is big-hearted enough to remit the penalty. Redemption is
 through the blood. (Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:6-7) Pardoning sin is based on 
  strict justice . In pardoning sin “He is faithful
 and just” ( I John 1:9) We are justified only because Christ PAID the
 debt. </p>
 
 
 
 <h5 > Grace is independent of man’s works or
 activity. Gal. 5:4 </h5>
 
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p > When a person is under the Law, he cannot be under Grace. When
 he is under Grace, he is not under Law. </p>

 <h4 > The Operation of Grace Classified </h4>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h5 > Prevenient Grace </h5>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h6 > Drawing Men to God </h6>
 
 
 
 <p > Prevenient (literally: going
 before ) grace is the Divine influence 
 preceding  a person’s conversion, exciting his efforts to
 return to God. It is the effect of God’s favor in drawing men. If God in His
 grace did not make the first move toward man, man would never move toward God. Man is
 too blinded by his sin, but the Spirit of God is at work in the world today drawing the
 wandering sheep to the fold of God. </p>
 
 <p> John 6:44— No man can come to me,
 except the Father which hath sent me 
 draw  him: and I will raise him up at the last
 day . </p>
 
 
 
 <h6 > Striving with the
 Disobedient </h6>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> Acts 7:52— Which of the prophets
 have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which 
 shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom
 ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: </p>
 
 <p > Even in the lives of the wicked that have desires only for evil
 does the grace of God work. One example of God striving with the disobedient in his
 grace is found in the life of the prophet Ezekiel. </p>
 
 <p> Ezekiel 2:1,2 — And he said unto
 me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. 2 And the spirit
 entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that
 spake unto me. </p>
 
 <p > God has a plan and is looking to share His plan with faithful
 servants.  This revelation is through His Spirit and by his grace. Organizations
 and churches may recognize the ministries of men, but it is only the Holy Ghost of God
 that can call people. Let us enter in to this experience where not only does the
 prophet hear the words of the Spirit, but the Spirit enters into him and 
 set him on his feet . “This is no time for sitting
 son; I have a work for you to do.” We must never take the Word of God lying down.
 Let us stand ready as ministers of the grace of God. </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> Ezekiel 2:3-5 —And he said unto
 me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a 
 rebellious nation  that hath rebelled against
 me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very
 day… I do send thee unto them 
 ; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
 GOD .  5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they
 will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) 
 "c16 c19 c17"> yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among
 them . </p>
 
 <p > God’s 
 prevenient grace  is here at work. Whether Israel
 was going to hear or not, God was still sending his messenger to them. God is 
 married  to the backslider. Jer. 3:14 </p>
 
 
 <h5 > Effectual Grace </h5>
 
 
 <p > </p>
 <p> Ephesians 3:7— Whereof I was made
 a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the 
 effectual working of his power 
 . </p>
 <p > Grace is effectual in producing conversion, if not resisted by
 the person. John 5:40; Acts 13:46 “Effectual Grace” is not equal to
 irresistible grace. </p>
 <p > The fourth point of Calvinism is “irresistible
 grace.’ This view on grace suggests that no one can resist the grace of God, but
 that every one God ‘chooses’ to save will be saved without any resistance.
 This concept contradicts the biblical teaching of free-will and choice, and negates any
 need for the sinner to cooperate in any way with God’s dealing. </p>
 <p > Biblical ‘effectual grace’ emphasizes the
 sufficiency of God’s grace to convert any and every soul that chooses to respond
 to God’s dealing. God’s grace is 
 irresistible  only in the sense that it trumps the power of sin
 and hell and there is no problem that the grace of God cannot overcome. God’s
 grace is resistible  in the sense that the
 Lord has set before us an open door and will not force any to walk through it that have
 not made that choice of their own free will. </p>
 
 <p> John 12:32— And I, if I be lifted
 up from the earth, will draw all men 
  unto me. </p>
 <p > If God’s grace was ‘irresistible’ the entire
 world will be saved, but we know from Scripture that is not the case. </p>
 
 <p >  Let us look at a few Biblical examples of how God deals
 with men. Note that God makes the first move and then requires some kind of action from
 man before He makes the next: </p>
 <p> Romans 10:13— For
 whosoever  shall call 
  upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. </p>
 <p> Matthew 4:19— And he saith unto
 them, Follow me , and I will make
 you fishers of men. </p>
 <p> Mark 10:51 —And Jesus
 answered…, ‘ What wilt thou 
  that I should do unto thee?’ </p>
 <p> Hebrews 10:29— Of how much sorer
 punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath 
 trodden under foot  the Son of God, and hath
 counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and
 hath done despite unto the Spirit of
 grace ? </p>
 <p></p>
 <p > Effectual Grace is not an assurance to the wayward that confirms
 the lie, “If God wants me to be saved, He’ll save me.” Effectual
 Grace is an assurance to the repentant that confirms the truth, “If I truly want
 to be saved, God can and will save me!” </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 
 
 <h5 > Actual Grace </h5>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p > Grace enables men to live rightly, to resist temptation and do
 their duty. Thus we speak of praying for grace to perform a difficult task.  II
 Cor. 12:9 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 
 
 <h5 > Habitual grace </h5>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p > Grace is the effect of the indwelling of the Spirit, resulting
 in a life characterized by the fruit of the Spirit. Gal. 5:22,23 </p>

 <h3 > The Grounds of Justification –
 Christ’s Righteousness </h3>
 
 
 <p>
 <img
 /> </p>
 <p>
                                 How
 can God treat a sinner as a righteous person? </p>
 <p>  God provides the repentant sinner with
 righteousness. </p>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > The Provision of Righteousness </h4>
 
 
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0">Is it just to give the title of
 “good” and “righteous” to one who has not earned it? The Lord
 Jesus Christ has earned it for and on behalf of the sinner, who is declared righteous
 “through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,” Rom. 3:24 </p>
 <p>
 <img
 /> </p>
 <p> What does redemption mean? </p>
 <p> 
 "c0"> 
 "c0 c19">Redemption means complete deliverance by a price paid. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > The Price of Righteousness </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > Christ earned or paid for this righteousness for us and the
 price is His atoning death.  Romans 3:25 says: <img
 /> </p>
 
 <p > Propitiation is that which secures God’s favor for the
 undeserving. Christ died in order to save us from God’s righteous wrath and to
 secure His favor to us. Propitiation means mercy
 seat . (Ex. 26:34; Heb. 9:5; I John 2:2; 4:10) </p>
 
 
 
 <h5 > The Need of Righteousness </h5>
 
 
 
 <p > As the body needs clothing, so the soul needs character.
  As one must appear before the world clothed in proper garments, so must man
 appear before God and heaven clothed in the garment of a perfectly righteous character.
  Rev. 3:4, 7:13, 14; 19:8 </p>
 <p > The sinner’s garment is defiled and tattered. Zech. 3:1-4
 And were he to clothe himself in his own goodness and merits and plead his own good
 deeds, they would be considered as “filthy rags”. Isa. 64:6; James 5:2;
 Jude 23 </p>
 <p > We need to guard against defiling our garments.  Rev. 3:4;
 16:15 </p>
 
 
 
 <h5 > The Provision of Righteousness </h5>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h6 > Righteousness was purchased by Christ’s
 substitutionary death. </h6>
 
 
 
 <p > God has provided a garment. Isa. 61:10; Isa. 53:5,11; Rom.
 4:6;5:18,19; II Cor. 5:21 His death was a perfect act of righteousness because it
 satisfied the law of God; it was also a perfect act of obedience.  And all this
 was done on our behalf and placed to our credit.  The act by which God charges or
 reckons this righteousness to our account is called 
 imputation . </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <h6 > Righteousness is imputed to our
 account. </h6>
 
 
 
 <p > Imputation is the reckoning to a person the consequences of
 another’s act.  For example, the consequences of Adam’s sin are
 reckoned to his descendants.  The consequences of man’s sin were reckoned to
 Christ, and the consequences of Christ’s obedience are reckoned to the believer.
  He wore our garment of righteousness.  He “is made unto us
 righteousness,” I Cor. 1:30.  He becomes “the Lord our
 righteousness,” Jer. 23:6. </p>
 <p > Christ expiated our guilt, satisfied the law, both by obedience
 and suffering, and became our substitute, so that being united with Him by faith, His
 death becomes our death, His righteousness our righteousness, His obedience our
 obedience.  God then accepts us not for anything in us, not for works—Rom.
 3:28; Gal. 2:16—or merit, but for the perfect all-sufficient righteousness of
 Christ set to our account.  For Christ’s sake, God treats the guilty man,
 when penitent and believing, as if he were righteous. </p>
 
 
 
 <h6 > Righteousness is imparted to our life. </h6>
 
 
 
 
 <li> "c0">Justification that saves is something
 external, and concerns the sinner’s 
 "c0 c16">position "c0">, but is there no change in 
 "c0 c16">condition "c0">? <img
 /> 
 <li> "c0">It affects his 
 "c0 c16">standing "c0">, but what of his 
 "c0 c16">conduct "c0">? 
 <li> "c0">Righteousness is 
 "c0 c16">imputed "c0"> but is it also 
 "c0 c16">imparted "c0">? 
 <li> "c0">In justification Christ is 
 "c0 c16">for "c0"> us, but is He also 
 "c0 c16">in "c0"> us? 
 
 <p></p>
 <p > In other words, it seems that imputation would dishonor the law
 if it were not bound up with security of future righteousness. </p>
 <p > The answer is that justifying faith is the initial act of
 Christian life and this initial act, when the faith is living, is followed by an
 inward, spiritual change known as regeneration. </p>
 <p > Righteousness is imputed in justification and imparted in
 regeneration.  The Christ who is for us becomes the Christ in us.
  “Christ liveth in me,” Gal. 2:20. </p>
 
 <p> "c0">The change of position - Being in
 Christ </p>
 <p> "c0">Rom. 8:1; II Cor. 5:17 I John 2:5-6 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p> "c0">The change of conduct – Christ in
 You </p>
 
 <p > Christ being in you Col. 1:27; Eph. 3:17; Gal. 4:19; Eph.
 4:13 </p>
 <p > Being in Christ and Christ in us actually go together John 15:4
  John 14:23I John 3:24; 4:13 Real salvation calls for a life of practical
 holiness.  They who wear His righteousness will be careful to purify themselves.
  I John 3:3 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <h3 > The Means of Justification –
 Faith </h3>
 
 
 
 <p > Justification is by faith. Since the law cannot justify,
 man’s only hope is for a “righteousness without the law” (Rom. 3:21).
  This is not an unlawful unrighteousness, or a religion that permits us to sin,
 but is justification that changes our position with God based on the merits of Christ.
  This is the “righteousness of God” (a righteousness which God
 imparts), and it is a gift because man lacks the power to develop it or work it out.
  (Eph. 2:8-10) The three operations of faith are as follows: </p>
 <p></p>
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Faith Appropriates </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > A gift must be accepted. How then is the gift of righteousness
 accepted?  What is the instrument which appropriates the righteousness of Christ?
  It is the faith. </p>
 
 <p> Galatians 2:16— Knowing that a
 man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we
 have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by 
 the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the
 law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
 justified. </p>
 
 <p > Faith is the hand, so to speak, which takes what God offers.
  Faith is the instrumental cause of justification. Rom.  3:22; 4:11; 9:30;
 Heb. 11:7; Phil. 3:9 Faith lays hold of God’s promise and appropriates
 salvation. </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Faith Applies </h4>
 
 
 
 <p> "c0">Psalm 51:7— 
 "c0 c17">Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter
 than snow. </p>
 
 <p> "c0">Faith not only 
 "c0 c16">takes "c0"> all that God has to offer, but it 
 "c0 c16">applies "c0"> it to the soul. </p>
 <p></p>
 
 
 <h4 > Faith activates </h4>
 
 
 
 <p> "c0">Faith not only passively 
 "c0 c16">receives "c0">, but also actively 
 "c0 c16">uses "c0"> what God bestows. Faith is also an affair of
 the heart. (See Rom. 10:9,10; Compare Matt. 15:19 with Prov. 4:23.) </p>
 <h4 > Faith involves works. The Scripture speaks of a “work of
 faith.” </h4>
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Gal. 5:6— Faith
 which worketh </h4>
 
 <li>
 <h4 > I Thess. 1:3— Work
 of faith </h4>
 
 
 
 <p> Faith produces works—James 2:26 </p>
 <p> Faith proved by works—James 2:18 </p>
 <p> Faith protected by works—James 2:22 </p>
 
 <p > That is, faith is an energetic principle; as well as, a
 receptive attitude.  Faith is therefore a powerful motive to obedience and to
 every good work. Faith involves the will and is connected with all good choices and
 actions.  (Rom. 14:23) Faith includes the choice and pursuit of the truth.
  (II Thess. 2:12) Faith implies subjection to the righteousness of God. (Rom.
 10:3) </p>

 <h2 > Regeneration </h2>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h3 > The Nature of Regeneration </h3>
 
 
 <h3></h3>
 <h3 > Regeneration is the Divine act which imparts to the penitent
 believer the new and higher life in personal union with Christ. The N.T. describes
 regeneration as: </h3>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > A Birth </h4>
 
 
 <h4 > Regeneration is a Birth (not baptism - not church attendance -
 not reformation). God the Father is He “that begat” and the believer is
 “begotten” of God (I John 5:1), “born of the Spirit” (John 3:8)
 and “born from above” (literal translation of John 3:7). These terms refer
 to the act of creative grace which makes the believer a child of God. </h4>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > A Cleansing </h4>
 
 
 <h4 > God saved us by the “washing (literally, laver or bath)
 of regeneration”.  (Titus 3:5) The soul was completely bathed from the
 defilements of the old life and made to live in newness of life - an experience
 pictured by water baptism.  (Acts 22:16) </h4>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > A
 Quickening </h4>
 
 
 <h4 > We were saved not only by the “washing of
 regeneration” but also by the renewing of the Holy Ghost.”  Titus 3:5
 Compare Psa. 57:10; Rom 12:2; Eph. 4:23; Col. 3:10 </h4>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > A Creation </h4>
 
 
 <h4 > He who created man in the beginning and breathed into his
 nostrils the breath of life, recreates him by the operation of His Holy Spirit.
  II Cor. 5:17  Eph. 2:10  Gal. 6:15  Eph. 4:24 Compare Gen. 2:7
  The practical result is a radical change in the individual’s nature,
 character, desires, and purposes. </h4>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > A Resurrection </h4>
 
 
 <h4 > As God quickened the lifeless clay and made it alive to the
 world, so He quickens a soul dead in sins and makes it alive to the realities of the
 spiritual world.  This act of resurrection from spiritual death is symbolized in
 water baptism.  Wesley said, Regeneration is “that great change which God
 works in the soul when He brings it into life; when He raises it from the death of sin
 to the life of righteousness.” </h4>
 
 <p > These terms are simply variants of one great basic thought of
 regeneration, namely, the Divine impartation of a new life to the soul of man.
  And three scientific facts true of natural life also apply to spiritual life, it
 comes suddenly, appears mysteriously, and develops progressively. </p>
 
 <p> Rom. 6:4,5; Col. 2:13; 3:1; Eph. 2:5,6 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <h3 > The Need for Regeneration </h3>
 
 
 
 <p> John 3:7— Marvel not that I said unto
 thee, Ye must be born
 again . </p>
 <p>         In John 3, Jesus
 answered the need of the heart rather than the words that Nicodemus spoke. </p>
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Lack of
 Life                “these
 miracles” </h4>
 
 
 
 <p > Nicodemus was spiritually dead. Nicodemus’ opening words
 reveal a number of emotions struggling in his heart. … 
 these miracles … He lacked a spiritual experience. He might
 have said, “I am tired of the lifeless services of the synagogue the glory has
 departed from Israel. There is no vision and the people perish.  My soul is hungry
 for reality. My soul is empty!  Your miracles convince me that you are a God sent
 teacher.” </p>
 
 <p> Ephesians 2:1— And you hath he
 quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > Lack of
 Conviction “a
 teacher” </h4>
 
 
 
 <p>         Nicodemus feels his
 need, for a teacher rather than a Saviour. “Thou art a teacher” He must
 realize that he is a sinner. Before he NEEDS to be taught, he NEEDS to be
 saved. </p>
 
 
 
 <h4 > Lack of Knowledge
          “how” </h4>
 
 
 
 <p> John 3:9 —How can these things
 be ? </p>
 <p> John 3:10— Art thou a master of
 Israel, "c17 c65"> and knowest not
 these things ? </p>
 <p > Jesus pointed out the deepest and universal need of men: a
 change of the whole nature and character.  Man’s entire nature has been
 warped by sin. Man cannot change himself; therefore, the change must come from
 above. </p>
 <p > Jesus did not attempt to explain the “how” of the
 new birth, but He did explain the why of the matter: the flesh and spirit belong to
 different realms. </p>
 
 
 
 <h3 > The Means of Regeneration </h3>
 
 
 
 
 <li>
 <h4 > Divine Agency. The Holy Spirit is the special
 agent in regeneration, who so acts upon a person as to produce the change.
  John 3:6; Titus 3:5 </h4>

 <h3 > Not to be Worshipped </h3>
 
 

 

 <p > Although God&rsquo;s are holy creatures, they are not to be
 worshipped. Satan tried to get Jesus to worship him, but Jesus flatly told him only God
 is to be worshipped. Angels are meant to worship God and in no case are they to be
 worshipped. </p>

 

 <p class="c11 c4"> Luke 4:8&mdash; &hellip; Thou shalt
 worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. </p>

 <p class="c11 c4"> Hebrews 1:6&mdash;&hellip; And let all
 the angels of God worship him [Jesus] . </p>

 <p class="c11 c4"> Colossians 2:18&mdash; Let no man
 beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding
 into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly
 mind, </p>

 <p class="c11 c4"> Romans 1:25&mdash; &hellip;worshipped
 and served the creature more than the Creator&hellip; </p>

 <p class="c1 c11"></p>

 <p > We are not to worship any created being, even angels. All
 worship is to be directed to the Creator. It is dangerous folly for many to put
 unhealthy emphasis on angels. Only three names are given in Scripture out of the
 innumerable number that makes up the Heavenly Host; this should be an indication to us
 not to give undue attention and focus to angels. Our focus should be on Christ and
 being led by the Holy Ghost. </p>

 <p class="c1 c11"></p>

 <p class="c11 c4"> Luke 2:13&mdash; And suddenly there was
 with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, </p>

 <ol start="44">
 
 <h3 > The Angel of the Lord </h3>
 
 

 

 <p > There are four angels named or titled in the Bible. The first
 mention of angels in the Bible is Genesis 16:7. The &lsquo;angel of the Lord&rsquo;
 told Hagar to return to Sarai. </p>

 <p class="c1 c11"></p>

 <p class="c11 c4"> Genesis 16:7&mdash; And the angel of
 the LORD found her [Hagar] by a fountain of
 water&hellip; </p>

 <p class="c4"> This is the first of many times &lsquo;The Angel of the Lord&rsquo;
 delivered messages: </p>

 
 <li class="c20 c23 c4"> "c0">Spoke to Moses out of a burning bush. Ex.
 3:2 

 <li class="c20 c23 c4"> "c0">Spoke to Manoah and his wife about Samson.
 Judges 13:2 

 <li class="c20 c23 c4"> "c0">Prevented Balaam. Numbers 22:22 

 <li class="c20 c23 c4"> "c0">Appeared unto Gideon. Judges 6:12 
 

 <p class="c20 c1 c30"></p>
 

 

 
 
 <h3 > Lucifer </h3>
 
 

 

 <p > Lucifer means &nbsp;daystar, shining, or
 bright one. &nbsp;In his rebellion against God, Lucifer fell into the
 condemnation of the devil becoming the chief of the fallen angels and adversary of God.
 Lucifer&rsquo;s fall is described in Isaiah 14:12-14 and Ezekiel 28:12-15. Before his
 fall, Lucifer was a magnificent angel who in pride tried to exalt himself above the
 other angels as God&rsquo;s equal. He was created into a lofty position, but fell far
 from it. </p>

 

 <p class="c11 c4"> John 8:44 &hellip;. [the devil] 
 &nbsp;abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
 &hellip; </p>

 <p class="c11 c4"> I Timothy 3:6&mdash; &hellip;being
 lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. </p>

 

 <p > In his fall, Lucifer drew one-third of the angels of heaven with
 him. In a great war in Heaven, satan and his followers were cast out of heaven.
 (Revelation 12:4) </p>

 

 
 
 <h3 > Michael </h3>
 
 

 

 <p > Michael is the only angel referred to as an archangel. His chief
 responsibility seems to be a militant protection of God&rsquo;s people. </p>

 

 <p class="c11 c4"> Daniel 12:1&mdash; And at that time
 shall Michael stand up, the great
 prince &nbsp;which standeth for the children of thy people: and
 there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to
 that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be
 found written in the book. </p>

 

 <p > The word prince in this verse means ruler, commander, chief, or
 leader. Jude 9 describes a confrontation between Michael and satan. Michael is
 presented as an angel of battle and war. </p>

 

 <p class="c11 c4"> Revelation 12:7&mdash; And there was
 war in heaven: Michael and his angels 
 &nbsp;fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, </p>

 

 
 
 <h3 > Gabriel </h3>
 
 

 

 <p > Gabriel is a messenger in the four times he is mentioned in the
 Bible. (Daniel 8:16; 9:21; Luke 1:19, 26) Some have speculated that Gabriel is an
 archangel, but there is no verse of Scripture to confirm this. </p>

 (MORMONS) </p>

 <p class="c20 c4 c2"> "c0 c18">The LDS church teaches a unique belief that
 answers this poignant question &mdash; are all children of a Heavenly Father who loves
 us. Our Father in Heaven created our spirits, and we lived with him in a premortal
 world. Our existence on this world was not an accident or improvisation. He created the
 Earth specifically for us. We chose to be sent here, to receive our physical bodies,
 and to be tested preparatory for us receiving all that God has planned for us according
 to our faithfulness. </p>

 <p class="c20 c4 c2"> "c0 c18">While we are all the spirit offspring of God
 the Father, and therefore the spiritual brothers and sisters to Jesus Christ (who was
 chosen from before the foundation of the world to be our Savior), Jesus Christ is the
 Only Begotten, Flesh and Bone Son of God. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, who
 set the way for us to return to the presence of Our Father in Heaven. Only a family
 member would love us enough to offer himself as a sacrifice for justice and
 mercy. </p>

 <p class="c20 c4 c2"> "c0 c18 c17">The Bible&rsquo;s purpose is to teach us
 about Man and God, and in so doing, to provide us with a moral and legislative code
 with which to guide our lives, in both a universal and particularistic way. &nbsp;The
 family of Man is enjoined to live their lives in a certain manner, while the children
 of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are called upon to conduct their lives according to a
 highly-structured format, serving as teachers and role models for their fellow human
 beings "c0 c18">. </p>

 self proclaimed "c0 c18 c17">Sola Scriptura 
 "c0 c18">, Non-Denominational, evangelical Protestant asked me: "Do you think
 non-Christians are children of God?" Well, having gone to parochial school for nine
 years, "c0 c16 c18">I was taught that God is our Father and that we
 (mankind) are God's children "c0 c18">&hellip; </p>

 <p class="c4 c2 c20"> "c0 c18">Is my friend correct? Is there anything in
 Sacred Scripture that implies that all men are children of God? Does the Church teach
 we are all God's children? "c0 c18 c19">It's really hard discussing
 Christianity with Christians who believe that the Holy Bible is the sole and ultimate
 basis of teaching. "c0 c18">&nbsp;Thank and God Bless. In His Most
