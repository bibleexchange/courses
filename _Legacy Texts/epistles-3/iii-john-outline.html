<h2>Introduction 1:1-4</h2> <p>John does not name himself in this letter, but begins this letter by simply introducing himself as &quot;the elder&quot;. John probably didn&apos;t need to identify himself or to establish his authority because he was well known to the people of the local churches and his brief letter was carried to Gaius by the teachers whom he sent. John expresses a love for Gaius &quot;in the truth&quot; and a desire that he might prosper and be in health. He rejoices that he is walking in the truth.</p> 


<h2>Encouragement for Gaius 5-8</h2> <p>John commends Gaius for his hospitality to the traveling workers. He speaks of Gaius&apos; faithfulness and love for the brethren.</p> <p>John said that the teachers he had sent went &quot;taking nothing of the Gentiles&quot;. Apparently they took no provisions with them so they were dependant on the hospitality of the believers and the believers should receive them so that they might be &quot;fellowhelpers to the truth&quot;.</p> 


<h2>Do not follow that which is evil, but that which is good 9-12</h2>
<h3>John tells them of the self-exalting and domineering Diotrephes – an evil example v. 9-10</h3> <p>In verse 11, John says, &quot;He that doeth good is of God by faith: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.&quot; It is impossible for an unregenerate sinner to &quot;do good,&quot; to walk in obedience to the Word of God. Only a born again believer can do the will of God and then only as he is empowered by the Spirit of God. The sinner does not have God&apos;s love working in his heart that he might love God or his brother as God requires in His Word. Nor does he have the grace of God to enable him to &quot;do good&quot; so his works show that he is not of God.</p>
<h3>John also mentions the well-reported Demetrius – a good example v. 12</h3> <p>It is not certain who this Demetrius was, but the context lends to the belief that he was one of the teachers whom John had sent, possibly the one carrying the letter.</p> 


<h2>Conclusion 13-14</h2> <p>John had many things to write to them, but chose not to as he believed he would see them shortly at which time he would communicate these things to them in person.</p>
