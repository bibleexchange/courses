		<p class="cs61DA5B56"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Gospel of John was written between A.D. 85 and 90 by John the Beloved, the disciple of Jesus. He was born in Bethsaida of Galilee to Zebedee, a fisherman, and Salome, whom some believe to be the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus. He had at least one brother, James, and they both joined their father in his trade of fishing. It was while they were working with their father that they answered the call of Jesus to be fishers of men and be His disciples (Matthew 4:18-22). This John is not to be confused with John the Baptist. John does not use his own name when writing this gospel; instead he refers to himself as &ldquo;the other disciple&rdquo; or &ldquo;the disciple whom Jesus loved.&rdquo; There is internal evidence that shows that John was the author as we can see from John 21:24, 25.</span></p><p class="cs287CD588"><span class="csCF6BBF71">According to Irenaeus, the pupil of Polycarp, who was a friend and pupil of John, John orally shared the Gospel for sixty years after the Acension. At some time, John was exiled by Domitian, the Roman emperor, to the Island of Patmos as an act of religious persecution. It was there that John received the visions included in the book of Revelation.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Irenaeus also said that after the death of Domitian in A.D. 96 that John returned from exile and settled in Ephesus. It is believed that it was there that the encouragement of friends and the direction of the Holy Spirit induced him to write this Gospel that he had so long been preaching. Nearly a generation after the other Gospels had been written, this Gospel was prepared, which shows that the life and labors of Christ were at this time well known to Christians. In the meantime, the apostles had preached the Gospel, Paul and Peter had suffered martyrdom, and all the apostles had passed to their reward, and Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans. Clement of Alexandria (c.150 - c. 215) says, &ldquo;Last of all, John, observing that in the other Gospels those things were related that concerned the body of Christ, and being persuaded by his friends, also moved by the Spirit of God, wrote a spiritual Gospel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Irenaeus accepted this Gospel and it is quite certain that Justin Martyr used it too. It was combined with the other books of the New Testament in the Diatessaron of Tatian about 170 A.D.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7DD44DC6"><span class="csB0E2188C">The Purpose of the Gospel</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs99173981"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The purpose of John is stated internally in the Gospel; John 20:30,31 explains that the Gospel is an account of signs that proved that Jesus was the Messiah. The goal of John was that men might believe upon reading the accounts given within its pages.</span></p><p class="cs82932370"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Throughout the book we find the three key thoughts given here in John 20:30,31; those thoughts are signs, believing, and life. We see many signs in the book of John that</span></p><p class="cs65FDA708"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">4</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD9B7E46A"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csD67A27D4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">prove that Jesus was the Son of God, these signs produced faith (believing) in Him and His work, and the result was that those that believed received eternal life.</span></p><p class="cs849300F2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A. The Gospel was written that men might see signs</span></p><p class="cs8DA414D3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Throughout the book of John we see many different supernatural occurrences that are given as evidence for men to believe in Jesus and His work. Jesus said in Mark 16:17, &ldquo;Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe&rdquo; and so He gives many signs to encourage men to believe. While it is possible for men to believe without seeing (John 20:29), the fact remains true that most men will not believe without seeing first. When a man sees these signs a action is demanded--either he must accept it and believe or else he must reject it and doubt.</span></p><p class="cs8D8737CF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are nine distinct signs in John that proved Jesus to be Master of things that we face every day. In these signs appear the revelation of God and they are clustered with teaching that interprets spiritual truth. These signs prove Him to be Master of:</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs3C9AD79E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Believing is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">to trust and a personally commit yourself to Christ; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">or </span><span class="csC382D2BB">relying on Christ with conviction</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The words that involve believing (i.e. faith and believe) are used 98 times in John.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The outcome of destiny is determined by belief and unbelief. The scriptures never demand belief without providing adequate reason for commitment. John 11:40 says, &ldquo;If thou wouldest believe thou wouldest see the glory of God.&rdquo; Jesus gave Martha and all the disciples many reasons to believe, though demonstrating who He is by many signs. The Master of every situation demonstrated fully His adequacy for all human emergencies. The Resurrection was the crowning sign of all since it proved that Jesus not only had the power to raise other men from the dead, but He was also able to revive Himself.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Gospel was written that men might have life</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csEE94A662"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When men see the signs and believe in them, then life is given. This life is more than natural life, but it is spiritual life--the life of Christ. This life is a restored fellowship between God and man (17:3), which was lost when Adam disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit. There are many references to this spiritual life in the Gospel of John, including 3:16; 3:36; 4:14; 5:24; 6:47; 8:12; 10:10; 11:25 and 12:25.</span></p><p class="csA99EC765"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">5</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs2442517E"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.The Style of the Gospel</span></p><p class="cs61DBBDB1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The style of this Gospel is simple, but the thought is profound. Its great design is to set forth the divinity of our Lord as the basis of faith, and to meet the spiritual needs, not of a particular class (i.e. Jew, Roman, or Greek), but of all men and hence it is called &ldquo;the spiritual Gospel,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Gospel for the Church.&rdquo; Gregory Nazianzen (c. 329 &ndash; c.390) says, &ldquo;Matthew wrote the wonderful works of Christ for the Jew, Mark for the Roman, Luke for the Greeks, John, a herald, who reaches the very heavens for all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We have already noted the purpose (But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through His name) and this purpose shapes the style of the Gospel. It&rsquo;s focus on producing faith in the heart of men is why John does not record many details of Christ&rsquo;s life, but rather focuses on salvation. For example, he does not mention the facts concerning the birth and early life of Jesus or a genealogy of His family, but instead declares, &ldquo;in the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; This is also why instead of parabolic teaching, this Gospel contains the great spiritual discourses that do not appear in the Synoptic Gospels.</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">IV.A Summary of the Gospel</span></p><p class="csFB15F1A7"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This Gospel presents a series of pictures, in each of which Christ is the Central Figure.

While the Nativity accounts in Matthew and Luke deal with it from earth looking up to Heaven, the account here in John deals with it from Heaven looking down to earth; Matthew and Luke look at it more from a natural perspective while John looks at it entirely spiritual and does not mention His mother, the journey to Bethlehem, or the swaddling clothes. John does not focus on how He became incarnate, but rather on why He became incarnate&mdash;to dwell among men and reveal to them the glory and power of God.</span></p><p class="cs47EBEFB4"><span class="cs91EF8B52">B.

		<p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The ministry of John the Baptist was not a quiet, uncontroversial one and so it attracted the attention of the Jews when he rebuked the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 3:7), publicans (Luke 3:12), and even Roman soldiers (Luke 3:14). The religious leaders were amazed at his boldness and sent messengers to find out who in the world he was and why he felt he had the authority to say such things.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; they asked John, but he would not directly answer their question, but rather told them who he was not. He was not concerned what they thought about him, but all his answers pointed to Christ. When he finally did tell them who he was, it was still in relation to Christ&mdash;he was a voice sent to prepare the way of the Lord. It can be said this way, John had this testimony that not even the Priests and Levites knew who John was, but God did &ndash; a man sent from God to bear witness.</span></p><p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When they realized who he was (or more, who he wasn&rsquo;t) they asked him why he then felt he had the right to baptize people (the Jews asked the question concerning baptism, because Jewish people often often emphasized ceremonial methods). John once again bypassed their real question and gave them an answer that related to Christ&mdash;he was doing a small thing (baptizing with water) compared to what Jesus would do (baptize with fire&mdash;see Matt. 3:11).</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Either three days after Jesus talked to Nathanael or three days after Jesus had entered Galilee He and His disciples were invited to a wedding feast in Cana. Cana (modern Kefr Kenna) was a small town about six miles northeast of Nazareth in the tribe of Asher (Josh. 19:28). The description &ldquo;of Galilee&rdquo; was used to distinguish it from another Cana, which was in the tribe of Ephraim, in the Samaritan country (Josh. 16:8; 17:9).</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Along with Jesus and His disciples, there was present Mary, the mother of Jesus. It is quite probable that one of the married couple was closely related to Jesus and His mother and that is why they were both present at the feast.</span></p><p class="csABC3FDBA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A problem arose at this feast&mdash;they ran out of wine, either because of a lack of planning or because more guests had arrived than had been expected. Now the bridegroom was in danger of displeasing his newly acquired father-in-law (the ruler of the feast) by this lack of planning on his part and the mother of Jesus sought to help the situation.</span></p><p class="csABC3FDBA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;They have no wine,&rdquo; she said to her Son. Before this time she had never seen Him perform a miracle and so it was evident that she firmly believed that He was not a normal man and that He had supernatural power even though He had not revealed it yet.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.&rdquo; Jesus was not being impudent or disrespectful; He was simply showing her and those around Him that although He was the Son of God, it was not His time to be glorified. He did not come to earth for this purpose of meeting man&rsquo;s physical need, but His &ldquo;hour&rdquo; would come when He would meet man&rsquo;s spiritual need on the cross (John 17:1). Even though it was not His purpose to physically help man and neither did He owe it to the bridegroom or any of the others present to assist in the situation, we see His humanity as He shows compassion for this bridegroom and respect to the request of His mother and He proceeds to perform a miracle.</span></p><p class="cs6454D2A0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mary shows confidence in her Son by encouraging the servants to do whatsoever He may command.

		<span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus told them to fill the six stone pots with water. These pots were used for the purification of the Jews, which is referring to their complex custom of washing their hands before eating (Mark 7:1-5), which is known as </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Netilat yadayim. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Using the left hand water would be taken out of the pot with a smaller vessel and poured over the right hand first (because the right hand has precedence in the Jewish religion) then they would take the vessel in the right hand and clean the left hand. It is noteworthy that modern Jews wash their hands before performing Netilat yadayim because the purpose is not to wash the hands, but rather to purify them. These pots that had been at least partially if not entirely empty from religious rituals were now they were being refilled to fulfill obedience of the divine will.</span></p><p class="cs4C70DF78"><span class="cs91EF8B52">C.

		<p class="cs99173981"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After the pots were filled, Jesus then told the servants to &ldquo;Draw out now, and bare unto the governor of the feast.&rdquo; There is no indication in the Scripture that anything special had happened to the water as of yet, so as these servants moved in obedience to take the water to the new father-in-law they were also taking a big step of faith. Telling men to act before results are seen is not a strange thing for God, for we see Him tell Joshua to have the priests step into the Jordan River before it dried up (Josh. 3:8, 13) and Jesus told the ten lepers to go tell the priest that they had been cleansed while they still possessed the plague (Luke 17:14). In both situations it was not until the action of obedience had take place that the miracles occurred; the same is true here in John two, for it is not certain exactly when the miracle took place, but it is certain that when the ruler drank what the servants brought him that he tasted fresh grapes and not plain water. There has been added to the water that which was not there before; the same power that said, &ldquo;Let there be light&rdquo; called these elements and additional compounds together in a twinkling of an eye and performed the miracle of once water, but now is good wine.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Jesus did not come to the wedding to be romantic, put on a show, do magic, deceive, entertain, or excite the people present, but the object of Jesus being there was to convey to His disciples a little something of His vast power which He has for meeting any emergency that arises in their experiences ahead. They were admitted to great superhuman power. Because of the miracle His disciples believed on Him; they had already believed He was the One that they should follow, but now they believed that He had unlimited resources at His disposal&mdash;they realized a little more that He was the Son of God.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is no record that anyone else besides the disciples believed on Jesus because of the miracle. We know for certain that the ruler of the feast didn&rsquo;t know where the wine had come from and it is very possible that the bridegroom didn&rsquo;t know either, so neither one of them would have believed on Jesus because of the miracle.

The Cleansing of the Temple 2:12-17</span></p><p class="cs61DA5B56"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Moving on from Cana of Galilee we see Jesus make His first recorded appearance in Jerusalem since He confounded the doctors as a boy (Luke 2:41-51). The occasion for His presence was the Passover, which was celebrated for seven days once every year from the 15th to the 21st of the month Abib (which corresponds to our April) and represents the first Exodus of the Israelites as they were delivered from Egypt. As the Son of Man, Jesus&rsquo; participation in this event was not a strange thing for according to the Law every male among the Jews was required to appear at this feast (Deut. 16:6).</span></p><p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Upon entering the temple, Jesus sees men trying to make money by exploiting people&rsquo;s halfhearted desire for religion. Some men were selling sheep and cattle that were required by every man to offer as a sacrifice, while other men were taking foreign money from pilgrims that had traveled from all over the world and exchanged it for a half-shekel of silver (the shekel of the sanctuary) that was offered to the priest (Ex. 30:13); no doubt these merchants charged a fee for the exchange. Josephus recorded that 256,500 animals were offered yearly and there was probably close to the same amount of shekels given&mdash;that would have been a large profit for these men.</span></p><p class="cs9BDD75F3"><div style="width:265.3pt;height:197.7pt;">

As the disciples remembered the words of Psalm 69:9, they realized that this power came from Heaven and not any earthly throne.</span></p></div>
		<span class="csCF6BBF71">These practices of</span></p><p class="cs4CBB8D0E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">accommodating travelers from afar off were not altogether wrong, but what was wrong was that they were using God&rsquo;s Holy House as a common marketplace.

Make not my Father&rsquo;s house a house of merchandise!&rdquo; There is little doubt that Jesus here expressed the human emotion of anger, which is not a sin in itself as long as it is not coupled with other sins (Eph. 4:26). Jesus did not sin in what He did, but rather He was in essence refuting sin as He moved to cleanse the temple that day.</span></p><p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God had always judged sin, but until this point we had seen it executed from the realms of heaven as in such circumstances as the fire on Sodom and Gomorrah and the plagues on Egypt.

Jesus gave them a sign, but He gave it in a parable, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; Jesus was referring to His body as the temple and was referring to the crucifixion and resurrection. The Jews did not understand this and thought he was speaking of the physical temple, which they denied could be rebuilt in three days since it had taken forty-six years to erect originally. Their unbelief in His sign did not make it any less real, for after He had arose the disciples remembered it and realized what He had been talking about.</span></p><p class="csF5D3C62E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This sign was different then the divine signs that the Hebrews had received in the past for it was not given by a prophet, angel, or other oracle of God, but now that the Son of Man had come, God spoke in the first person and He Himself gave the sign. There was no middle man needed, but God spoke with man face to face.</span></p><p class="cs7203ECA0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">16</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csB0F53F14"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 3: He is the Divine Teacher</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Throughout the stages of time the Jewish people had been accustomed to the scholastic way as a part of life. According to </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Baker&rsquo;s Evangelical Dictionary</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, in Jewish culture around the time of Christ &ldquo;male children between the ages of five and twenty usually attended synagogue schools and were trained in the Torah, the Mishnah, and the Talmud.&rdquo; In this atmosphere of strong emphasis on education, it is only natural that there should also be strong emphasis on educators--as can be seen because the Talmud (Avot) repeatedly reinstates the importance of the teacher in this learning process. We see from Luke 20:46 that these religious teachers were quite respected by the average person (Scribes are specifically mentioned in the passage, but without doubt the Rabbis shared in at least some of this respect). Though man had been accustomed to the natural teachers, they had not yet encountered the divine teacher--Jesus Christ. His knowledge was not acquired by lectures and book learning, but it was ingrained in Him for He was the omniscient Son of God. It was this supreme knowledge that made Him the greatest teacher ever.</span></p><p class="cs494860B1"><span class="csB0E2188C">I. Interview with Nicodemus 3:1-21</span></p><p class="csCB2C55F7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A. Jesus &amp; Nicodemus&mdash;Face to Face 3:1-3</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is no record of Jesus publicly teaching before John chapter three, but it can be assumed that He did for He had gained a reputation of being &ldquo;a teacher sent from God&rdquo; and it was this reputation that one night drew a man named Nicodemus to ask Him questions. Nicodemus was a man of position in his community&mdash;he was referred to as a man of the Pharisees, a ruler of the Jews (John 3:1) and a master (or teacher; instructor) of Israel (John 3:10). We see him fulfill the role as a religious leader in John chapter seven where he participates in a council meeting of the Pharisees (John 7:45-52).</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Most believe that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night because he was afraid of persecution from his fellow religious leaders (this coincides with the fact that in both John 7:50-51 and 19:39 that while it is clear that he believed in Jesus, he still did not make a clear public confession), though others argue that it was full moon at the time that he came to Jesus and thus he was not really hidden by the dark and was not concerned with whether people saw him with Jesus or not but that he only came at that time because he had opportunity while the crowds were away sleeping. All three times when Nicodemus is mentioned in Scripture this fact that he came by night to Jesus is mentioned; this added emphasis to this fact gives support to the theory that he did it out of fear of being seen rather than convenience, though the other theory is still possible.</span></p><p class="csC5356BBE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Nicodemus may have come in fear, but however he came this fact is true--he did come; this reveals his desire to know Jesus. He addressed Him with respect by calling Him Rabbi, which means </span><span class="csC382D2BB">my master </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">and is used as title of honor. He continued on and said, &ldquo;We know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him&rdquo; (John 3:2). The fact that he said &ldquo;we&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I&rdquo; indicates that at least one other person had confided with Nicodemus that they also believed that Jesus was a teacher from God (John Wesley believed that it might have even been other leaders and</span></p><p class="cs4D31D65C"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">17</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csC528AEF8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Pharisees). Although it is not explained in the Scripture, it is possible that these other people may have even elected Nicodemus to be the spokes person to find out if Jesus was real.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Nicodemus knew that Jesus had performed miracles&mdash;this is interesting because until this time there is only record of one miracle that Jesus performed. It is possible that Nicodemus had heard exaggerated rumors of what Jesus had done or else he attributed Jesus&rsquo; glorious baptism and triumphant cleansing of the temple as miracles performed by Him. These miracles were enough proof for him to acknowledge that Jesus was sent by God. The fact that Nicodemus believed that Jesus was a teacher sent by God does not mean that he realized that Jesus was actually the Son of God; he was more or less only comparing Jesus to a prophet or other oracle of God. His mind had not yet been opened up to the spiritual realm and was thus trying to figure out who Jesus was according to what he understood in the natural realm. Jesus&rsquo; response to Nicodemus&rsquo; statement was, &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Jesus knew of Nicodemus&rsquo; blindness to the spiritual world and told him of the one and only remedy&mdash;spiritual birth.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7C2E7274" value="2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Jesus &amp; Nicodemus&mdash;Mind to Mind 3:4-12</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Nicodemus was puzzled by this response; he thought that Jesus wanted him to crawl inside of his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born again naturally. He was right that the physical man could not be born again, but what he did not realize was that the spiritual man can be born again&mdash;he can be completely regenerated. This regeneration only takes place by the water (the Word of God&mdash;Psalm 119:9; Eph. 5:26) and the Spirit. You must understand &ldquo;that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;&rdquo; That is, there is a significant difference between what we see in the physical world and that that is in the spiritual world.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now we see Jesus give Nicodemus a beautiful illustration in verse eight&mdash;You cannot understand the blowing of the wind, but you obey the law and gain its force; so it is with the Spirit. Do not postpone the new birth experience because of intellectual struggle. Obey the law of the wind, and the wind obeys you. Obey the law of the Spirit, and you will know the new birth. To this illustration Nicodemus again displayed unbelief as he said, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo; He was a man that had been taught all the ways of religion, knew of all the commandments of the law and prophets, heard all the promises of God, and was well versed in all of these things enough to be a teacher of them and yet he still did not know the true meaning of it all. As Jesus said, he &ldquo;receive[d] not our witness&rdquo; (3:11). This is pure evidence that religion alone is not enough to save a man. Jesus used the natural illustration of wind to explain the life in the Spirit and Nicodemus did not understand; Jesus knew that if He outright told Him of heavenly things then he definitely would not understand.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs71012330"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A good teacher will try to help His pupil to understand what he is saying even though it may take some extra effort. Jesus knew that Nicodemus could not fully understand the secrets of heaven, and yet out of love He continued to explain to him the plan of salvation hoping that Nicodemus would realize that the One that could open up his understanding was the same One to whom he was speaking.</span></p><p class="cs11D57D0A"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">18</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csEBB0DF5E"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs9ED7DAD8"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs3755C01E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus explains how salvation comes to a man--it is not by works or religion, but it came down from heaven.</span></p><p class="csF7938820"><span class="csCF6BBF71">From this passage we do not see what Nicodemus&rsquo; final response was to Jesus&rsquo; exhortation on salvation, but from the afore mentioned passages of John 7:50-51 and 19:39 that it is quite obvious that Nicodemus at least partially grasped that Jesus was the Son of God&mdash;the Divine Teacher who alone knows the Words of eternal life.</span></p><p class="csB6AE1601"><span class="csB0E2188C">II. Endorsement from John 3:22-36</span></p><p class="cs2C0DED57"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After Jesus&rsquo; conversation with Nicodemus He left the city of Jerusalem in Judea and went with His disciples into wilderness outside of the city where He baptized people (though it was actually His disciples that did the baptizing upon His command and authority and not He Himself&mdash;John 4:2); at this same time, John the Baptist was baptizing in Aenon. John&rsquo;s disciples (men that knew John, believed in his ministry, and had been influenced by his ministry) came to John and asked him about Jesus. They knew that John bare witness of Christ and proclaimed Him to be the Lamb of God, and yet they were bothered that Jesus was moving into John&rsquo;s ministry of baptism.</span></p><p class="cs8FCDBBB3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John reassured them that if Jesus had not received the power and authority to baptize from heaven, then He would not have it at all. He them reminded them that he had already told them (probably on numerous occasions and not just in John 1:20) that he was not the Christ but was only a forerunner of Him. John was not upset because Christ had come and was replacing John&rsquo;s ministry with His own, but he was rather glad for it. He expressed it with an illustration of how the best man in a wedding is glad when the bridegroom comes for the bride&mdash;he is not upset that the focus and attention is not on him, but is rejoicing for the great blessing that has befallen the couple. John&rsquo;s joy was fulfilled now that Christ had come; He was the One for whom John had spent his whole life looking and proclaiming and now he had come.</span></p><p class="csC7F84274"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John realized that he himself was a teacher who spoke about God, and that Christ was a teacher who was God. John knew his ministry of teaching had to decrease as the ministry of Christ came to fullness. Jesus deserved this place of epitome in ministry for He was the highest One&mdash;the One that came down from heaven. Jesus was the greatest teacher for He spoke the Words of God in first person. He was not teaching history of what had happened nor did He pronounce philosophy of what might happen, but He proclaimed the pure unadulterated Word of God&mdash;that which was at that very moment happening. He had &ldquo;all things&rdquo; given into His hands to give unto men, and if any man would hear and believe His teaching, they would receive eternal life.</span></p><p class="csF8ABC136"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">19</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csA6108540"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 4: He is the Soul Winner</span></p><p class="cs18547526"><span class="csB0E2188C">I.

The only practical path to take on this journey northward was to go through the country of Samaria. The Samaritans were decedents of people that were placed in this land by Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria during the Assyrian captivity of the Jews. These people intermarried with the Jews that had been left behind to care for the land. This union created the Samaritan people&mdash;a people that were half-Jew and half-Gentile. Matthew Henry refers to them as &ldquo;mongrel Jews...both in blood and religion&rdquo; because while they abandoned their old idolatry after they entered the land, they only partly adopted the Jewish religion. It was no doubt a hard thing for the Jews to have to make the journey through this country of their enemies and it is possible that some made the option instead to go the long way around the country rather than go through it. Jesus did not only go through this country because it was the most convenient path, but He knew that there were souls that He could help in this foreign country.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

The woman thought He was talking about natural water, but she did not know that Jesus was speaking about spiritual water (7:37-39).

		<p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus wanted the woman to know that the spiritual water that He had to offer was much better than the physical water that she could get from the well. If we only seek after the natural things of this world than we will never be satisfied even though we may have great possessions, but if we receive of the things of the Spirit, then they will satisfy our soul and teach us to be content with the things that we have in the natural (Phil. 4:11; Heb. 13:5). When God fills us, He does not just give us just a few drops, but He gives us rivers of living waters flowing from our soul (7:37; Is. 58:11).</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs73D5218C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The woman was still thinking in the natural and she thought that Jesus hag some kind</span></p><p class="csE34ACDD8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">of magical water that would make her so she never got thirsty again.

The woman told Jesus that she had no husband. Jesus told the woman that she was correct in saying that she had no husband at that time, but in the past she had fives husbands and now she was living with a man to whom she was not married.</span></p><p class="csABC3FDBA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Jesus asked the woman to bring her husband He knew all these things about her. He was not trying to find out information about her life, but He was looking for a confession of her sin--she had to admit that she was living in adultery. Before God can help us with our sin we must first confess it (Pro. 28:13; I John 1:9).</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When the woman heard Jesus tell her all about her life, then she proclaimed that He was a prophet. Revelation is sometimes a progressive work. God may show you part of a thing at one time and then later He will reveal to you the other pieces. This woman understood that Jesus was a prophet, which is true, for Jesus was the Prophet (Acts 3:19-24), but she did not yet realize that He was the Messiah.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Though the woman realized that Jesus was the Prophet, she was trying in her mind to figure out how this Jew could be a messenger of God. The Samaritans used Mt. Gerizim as a place of worship, while the Jews worshipped at Jerusalem. There were certainly other religious differences between the Jews and the Samaritans, and this woman was wondering how God could use a person that believed so differently from what she thought was right.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus helped the woman to understand that it did not matter </span><span class="csC382D2BB">where </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">a person worshipped, but </span><span class="csC382D2BB">how </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">a person worshipped--a person must worship God in spirit and in truth. A person must worship God from his heart and not only from his head and they must worship God according to the truth found in the Word of God.</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The woman did not really know what to believe about the things that Jesus said those things to her, and she tried to put off dealing with those ideas until a later date. She thought that someday in the far off future that the Messiah would come and He would make known the truth about all things, including the right way to worship. Many people do not want to search out the Scriptures and pray for revelation so that they can understand the truth about certain doctrines of the Bible. They feel that some things are too complicated for us to understand and that we will only know the truth when we get to heaven and speak to God face to face, but we do not have to wait to learn truth for the Divine Teacher can reveal to us all truths is we would only be diligent to listen to His voice.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus proclaimed to the woman that He was this Messiah of whom she spoke. This woman did not only hear the vibrations in her ears when Jesus spoke, but something resonated in her heart that told her that this proclamation was true. Just like when Andrew and Phillip were saved, when this woman encountered Christ, the first thing that she did was run out and tell others about it.</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">II.

When the woman left, the disciples encouraged Jesus to eat the food that they brought. Jesus told them that He had meat to eat that they knew not of. He was not speaking about physical food, but He was saying that His satisfaction was doing the will of the Father.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It was possibly when Jesus looked up and saw the many Samaritans coming to meet Him that He told the disciples, &ldquo;Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already unto harvest.&rdquo; Jesus did not want His disciples to wait until some far off date before they reached out to the lost, but there were many souls ready to receive the Gospel right then. Jesus knew that there were more souls than could be reached by these twelve men and He told them in Matthew 9:38 to pray that God would send more laborers into the harvest field. Jesus did not tell then to complain because others were not helping, but rather to pray that God would work in their hearts and give them the desire to go out and help work in the fields.</span></p><p class="cs42285B72"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.Jesus Won the Souls of Sycar 4:39-42</span></p><p class="csE0451D5E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There were many people that came to Jesus from the city when they heard the testimony of the woman. When they herd Jesus Himself speak they too believed His words. The testimony of the women led many people to Christ, but it was not her words that changed their lives. Her words only led them to Christ, and He is the only One who can transform a man (4:42).</span></p><p class="cs42285B72"><span class="csB0E2188C">IV.Jesus Won the Soul of the Nobleman 4:43-54</span></p><p class="csD9772EEF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After His two day detour in Samaria, Jesus finally reached His destination of Cana of Galilee.

		<p class="cs99173981"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John chapter five opens up with Jesus returning to Jerusalem to attend &ldquo;a feast of the Jews.&rdquo; It is thought by many that this &ldquo;feast&rdquo; was the Passover, but there is no evidence to either concretely prove or disprove that theory. It was during this trip to the Holy City that Jesus visited the pool named Bethesda, which is by the sheep gate (it is translated </span><span class="csC382D2BB">sheep market </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">in the KJV, but it almost certainly referring to the gate built by Eliashib and his family when Jerusalem was rebuilt as told in Nehemiah 3:1). This pool had a legend behind it that at a certain time in the year an angel would come down from heaven and stir the water; once the water was troubled the first person that got into the water was healed of any diseases they possessed. This occurrence was not simply a fairy tale or hoax, but the divinely inspired writer of the Scripture wrote it as a fact, and it is possible that he had known someone personally that had been healed in years past by making it first into the pool. The name Bethesda means &ldquo;house [or place] of mercy&rdquo; and is likely named so because of all the miraculous cures wrought there by the mercy of God.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Underneath the five porches that surrounded this pool there gathered a multitude of people vexed with every disease imaginable. These people all wanted to be healed and at the time of troubling of the water they certainly all selfishly pushed and fought to try to capture the coveted prize of rejuvenation. It was in the midst of this crowd of impotent folk that there lay a certain man that had been sick for thirty-eight years. We do not know what disease he had or for how long the disease had rendered him bedridden, but we do know that when Jesus came to the pool that he was unable to move about without the help of another man.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs99173981"><span class="csCF6BBF71">With the vast amount of people waiting to be healed, it is hard with the natural mind to figure out why Jesus singled out this man instead of healing the whole crowd. It is quite possible that Jesus knew that the others would not respond to a simple command of faith and that they were too wrapped up in the wonder of this sensational yearly miracle to be bothered with anything else. Many people are still this way; they look forward to special meetings and conventions when there is great moving of the spirit and yet they do not realize that they can receive help at any time if they would only respond to the Word of God.</span></p><p class="cs2E128B14"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because He is the omniscient Son of God, Jesus did not have to interrogate the man to find out his history, but He already knew all about him and the fact of how that he had been sick for thirty-eight years. Upon seeing the man, Jesus asked him, &ldquo;Wilt thou be made whole?&rdquo; This might have seemed like a strange question, for why else would the man lie there year after year if he did not desire to be healed? The man responded with the best answer he could give from his carnal mind, &ldquo;Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs576ADF98"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">23</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csD5FB2E09"><div style="width:261pt;height:207.65pt;">

		<span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus gave him a promise that surpassed all attempts of human reasoning; that was &ldquo;Rise.&rdquo; He was telling him that he now could do the thing he couldn&rsquo;t do before--and it was all because Jesus had spoken the word. The same voice that was able to create the world out of nothing now spoke to recreate the parts of this man&rsquo;s body that had been destroyed.</span></p><p class="csE62B180A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus proceeded, &ldquo;Take up thy bed and walk.&rdquo; This was a challenge to the man&rsquo;s will to arise to action. He had to personally respond to what Jesus said. He had to walk for himself; he was to no longer expect another man to carry him around.

		<p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Jews were very upset because Jesus healed this man on the Sabbath day, because according to the Law, no work at all was to be done on the Sabbath (Ex. 20:8-11). The punishment for breaking this law was death (Ex. 31:14-17) and the Jews wanted to execute this judgment (4:16).</span></p><p class="cs8931017"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What the Jews did not understand was that the Sabbath was given as a part of the ceremonial law, which was fulfilled in Christ (Col. 2:16, 17). Jesus </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the Sabbath for our souls (Heb. 4:9-11) and the principle behind the Sabbath was for men to cease from their own labor and rest in the provision of God.</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

When God helps us and works on our behalf, we need to give Him thanks.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus found the man in the temple and said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, thou art made whole: Sin no more Lest a worse thing come unto thee.&rdquo; God can help us and drive back the power of the devil from our life, but if we sin, there is no guarantee that that power of darkness will not return to our lives if we go back and sin. When God saves us, He frees us from the power of sin, but we still retain our free will and if we desire to go back to the bondage of sin God will not stop us.</span></p><p class="cs8C476DDD"><span class="csB0E2188C">II.

Repeatedly in the Pentateuch there are types that point to Jesus (i.e. the ram caught in the thicket, the brazen serpent, the tabernacle, and many more) and if they sought to understand these things with a pure heart, God would have opened their understanding so that without a doubt they would know that Jesus was real.</span></p><p class="cs842F13A3"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">25</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csBD702A04"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csB0F53F14"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 6: He is the Bread of Life</span></p><p class="cs1A4FC4DC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After healing the crippled man by the pool of Bethesda, Jesus took a ship over the Sea of Galilee (Matt. 13:14), which is also called </span><span class="csC382D2BB">lake of Gennesaret </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Luke 5:1) and here in John, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the sea of Tiberias </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Tiberias was a port city on the Sea of Galilee that Herod had renovated and enlarged and then renamed it such in honor of the Roman Emperor, who bore the same name)</span><span class="csC382D2BB">. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">In Galilee they had been so busy that they did not even have time to eat, and so Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while&rdquo; (Mark 6:31).

		<span class="csCF6BBF71">multitude was possibly somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000 , for there were 5,000 men plus an unnumbered amount of woman and children.</span></p><p class="cs9AAA9065"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Jesus saw these people coming to Him, He had compassion on them, &ldquo;and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing&rdquo; (Luke 9:11). This time of ministering brought them to dusk, and the disciples asked Jesus to</span></p><p class="cs588DD7AA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">have Him dismiss the crowd so that they could go into the town and buy food to eat. Jesus responded, &ldquo;They need not depart; give ye them to eat&rdquo; (Matthew 14:16); He knew that they did not need to go out to the world to get their needs met, but He knew that He could meet all their needs. He asked Philip, &ldquo;Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?&rdquo; (John 6:5).</span></p><p class="cs801F24A1"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs32E2DBB8"><span class="csE613E19A">26</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs191B5024"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus already knew how He Himself would provide the food for these people, but He wanted to reveal what Philip would say, which was, &ldquo;Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs36C3CE4B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peter then entered the conversation by telling Jesus about a boy that was in the crowd that had five barely loaves and two small fish. The boy had probably overheard Jesus&rsquo; conversation and wanted to do what he could to help. Peter did not have the faith of the boy and added, &ldquo;what are they among so many?&rdquo; Jesus had the disciples tell the people to sit down on the grass to prepare to eat. Jesus then took the food that the boy had sacrificed, and when He had blessed it, He broke the bread and gave it to His disciples to distribute to the people. A miracle occurred, for the disciples were able to keep giving the multitude food until all were fed; there was even enough left over to fill twelve baskets full!</span></p><p class="cs28ECDBF8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This was the first event that was recorded by all four gospel writers (Matt. 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-13). It was a miracle that proved that we do not need to be searching in the world to find the things that we need, but if we partake of the Bread of Life and rely upon Him, then in all things we can be content and satisfied.</span></p><p class="cs849300F2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">B. Revealed by walking on water 6:14-21</span></p><p class="cs98B8D3E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After this phenomenon of feeding the multitude, there were some that realized that Jesus was the Prophet that was spoken of in Deuteronomy 18:15 that would be the Messiah. Their revelation was weak, and they did not comprehend that Jesus came to set up a spiritual kingdom and not an earthly one. They possibly felt that if He had power to multiply bread, then He certainly had power to conquer nations. These men conspired to take Jesus by force and make Him a king over them that could lead in a revolt against the Roman Empire. Jesus knew their hearts and He would have no part of it. He took a time of solitude from all men, including His disciples, and departed to a mountain to pray (Matt. 14:23). This departing of Jesus reveals to us His humility and self denial. There is little doubt that during this time of prayer that Jesus was petitioning the Father for strength to conquer the temptations of pride and self-glorification that He knew could destroy Him as well as the plan of salvation.</span></p><p class="csDE140939"><div style="width:258.6pt;height:225.55pt;">

		<span class="csCF6BBF71">While Jesus was on the mountain praying, the disciples took a ship west across the sea to head to Capernaum at the request of Jesus (Matt. 14:22). While they were crossing he sea, a terrible storm came upon them and tossed the small ship in the waves. They toiled hard rowing, trying to get the ship to shore, but they were without success. Then suddenly they saw a figure walking in their direction on top of the water. They thought it was a ghost and cried out from fear. The figure then revealed Himself to be Jesus as He said, &ldquo;It is I; be not afraid.&rdquo; Matthew records how that after the salutation of Jesus that Peter also walked on the water after Jesus bade him to come to Him but then</span></p><p class="csB69F9A90"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">27</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD9B7E46A"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csCFBF73FE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">ended up sinking when he saw the raging waves (Matt. 14:28-31).

When they found Jesus, they inquired of when He had gone over, for they did not see Him enter a ship. In His usual manner, Jesus looked past their question and answered their actual need by revealing that they were not interested in the One that performed the miracles, but they just wanted more food to fill their stomachs. He then advised them to &ldquo;Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you.&rdquo; You could eat all the bread in the world, and yet it would never produce eternal life in your soul. Jesus wanted them to look past the natural and realize that there was life in the Spirit that they had not yet experienced. This life can only come from partaking of the Bread of Life.</span></p><p class="cs98B8D3E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;For Him hath God the Father sealed.&rdquo; According James M.

If the animal was free from all blemishes, then &ldquo;the priest bound a label to his horns, applied wax to the label, and sealed it with his ring. This set it apart for sacrifice, and no animal could be offered unless it bore this seal.&rdquo; This scripture is then speaking of how God the Father had set His seal upon the Son as His approval for Him to be the sacrifice of the sins of all humanity.</span></p><p class="cs98B8D3E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The people asked Jesus what they would have to do so that they could perform such works of God as Jesus performed. Jesus told them that the work of God was to believe on Him. If we are ever to do anything for the Kingdom of Heaven, it will be by faith. As we believe in God and hear and obey His voice, then He will lead us to do great and mighty acts in His name. None of these miracles are possible unless we believe first (Mark 16:17).</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs98B8D3E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Even after Jesus told them to labour for the everlasting bread, the people still wanted to justify their carnal hunger. They asked Jesus to give them a sign, and as an example, they reminded Him of how the Israelites received manna from heaven while they wandered through the wilderness (it seems that their bellies were hungry and they were hoping that Jesus would do the same thing). They were dis-acknowledging that Jesus had already given them a sign the day before, as well as the many other miracles that they had either witnessed personally or at least heard about that drew them to Jesus in the first place.</span></p><p class="csF724760F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus explained to them that it was not Moses that gave them the manna, but it was God the Father.

		<p class="cs4F7B3CC0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The crowd responded to Jesus with a request for a constant flow of the bread that came down from heaven; it is quite possible that they were still hoping for something to feed their physical bodies even after all Jesus had said to tell them that they needed more than that. Jesus stopped all confusion of to what He was referring as He declared, &ldquo;I am the Bread of Life&rdquo; (John 6:35). He had the ability to satisfy the soul of every man. The will of the Father was for Him to bestow eternal life on all that believed on Him and to help them through their pilgrimage on earth so that they could make it to heaven &ldquo;at that last day.&rdquo; There is no greater source than Jesus for help in our every need, in fact, there is no other source at all.</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs8EAFC508"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The crowd was angered when Jesus titled Himself as the Bread of Life because they believed Joseph and Mary to be the parents of Jesus and so He had no claims to have come from heaven. What they did not know was that although Mary may have been Jesus&rsquo; mother, Joseph was not Jesus&rsquo; father--God alone had right to that title.</span></p><p class="cs4F7B3CC0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus silenced their murmuring, and explained to them that the manna in the wilderness was not enough for their fathers, for they ate it and yet they still died.

Many of them thought that the things that Jesus were deep and impossible for men to hear and obey. We must note that these people were not novices that had never heard Jesus speak before, but they were considered &ldquo;His disciples&rdquo; (though it is not then referring to the twelve). Jesus explained to them that if they were thin enough to be offended by Him saying that He was of heavenly origin, then they certainly would be offended if they saw Him ascend to heaven.</span></p><p class="csEBD7150"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because of the things that Jesus said that day, many of those disciples (which was probably a large portion of the 5,000 men that He had fed the previous day) ceased from</span></p><p class="cs49E6371C"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs32E2DBB8"><span class="csE613E19A">29</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs82FE280B"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csDD4B3B4B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">following Jesus.

After the crowd forsook Jesus, He turn t the twelve and asked them if they too would desert Him. Peter, being the spokesperson, answered boldly, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; Their understanding may not have then been complete, but they did believe that Jesus was the Son of God, and that faith compelled them to follow this Messiah even if the world forsook Him.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Since Jesus had performed great miracles and said wonderful things, many of these people believed Jesus was at least a prophet from God if not the Messiah Himself; at the same time, since Jesus also disrupted the Jewish religious system that had become insipid and corrupted, there was much confrontation and division over this Son of the carpenter.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The problem was this, with his carnal mind man cannot understand the things of God (Romans 8:7; I Cor. 2:11). Whenever man tries in his own intellect to make sense of the things of heaven, he only results in causing confusion rather than clarity. Those that were tender to the Spirit and had a heart after God received revelation from above and they knew exactly who Jesus was.</span></p><p class="cs1958B5D5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The seventh chapter of John reveals two things: what the people thought abut Jesus and what Jesus proclaimed Himself to be (the water of life).</span></p><p class="csB02A2F13"><span class="csB0E2188C">I.

Jesus was not afraid of dying, for He knew that at one time He would submit to their persecution and execution, but this was not the &ldquo;time&rdquo; (John 7:6). Also, it must be noted that the Scripture says &ldquo;would not&rdquo; and not &ldquo;could not.&rdquo; Jesus had the power from God to hold back or defeat His enemies, so He could have entered Jerusalem without any problem, but because He did not manifest that type of power then, it was out of prudence that He did not spend much time in the Holy City.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because of this prudence, Jesus chose not to openly attend the Feast of the Tabernacles even though His brothers chided Him to go. These &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; were in truth His half-brothers, since they may have shared Mary as a mother but Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit while the others were born of Joseph. These brothers were at least two if not all four of the names listed in Matthew 13:55 (James, Joses, Simon, and Judas).</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Although these men grew up with Jesus, heard Him speak, and were exposed to the Spirit He bore, they did not believe the He was the person that He claimed to be, the Son of God. Now, in form of jest, they wanted Him to go to Jerusalem for the feast and openly proclaim His deity. Jesus did not give in to this peer-pressure and firmly told them that it was not His time to be revealed and then He encouraged them to go to the ceremony without Him.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Some were insistent that He was a good man. They had seen Him do good works of healing and feed the multitude with the few small fish and loaves of bread; they also heard His powerful, yet compassionate teaching, and they were convinced that such things could only come from a godly person. Though they were convinced of His human virtue, they did not comprehend His divine identity.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There were others that thought that Jesus was only deceiving the people. They might have thought that His miracles were only illusions and that He had people pretend to be sick so that it would appear that He healed them. Neither group was comfortable voicing their opinions in public for they were afraid of what the Jewish religious leaders would have said or done to them.</span></p><p class="csB02A2F13"><span class="csB0E2188C">II.

		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">During the middle of the feast (probably the fourth or fifth day of the eight day ceremony) Jesus made Himself known to be present at the feast when He went to the temple and started teaching the people. As always, Jesus&rsquo; words were full of wisdom and power. This fact caused the people to question Him and His teaching for they thought Him to be the son of a simple carpenter that had never had a proper schooling, and yet He taught such great words.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus answered them and explained that His doctrine was not learned from man, but from God. There was no doubt that many of the Jews present had a great head-knowledge of the Scriptures, yet they had little heart-knowledge of God&rsquo;s will and desire. If they had possessed this, then they would have known who Jesus was.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs8FF75DF8"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Questioned because of His precision of knowledge 7:19-24</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It would be thought that when a man says what you know deep down inside is right, then you would proclaim him to be a great man of truth indeed. Too often though, as it is the nature of man, we are offended when someone tells us that we are doing wrong and we proclaim him instead to be a liar even though we know that he is speaking the truth. This is reaction the people gave when Jesus revealed that they were seeking to kill Him because He healed the man on the Sabbath day. They went far enough to even say that Jesus was possessed with a demon.</span></p><p class="cs66B89D0F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Rather than refuting their accusation of being bedeviled, Jesus explained why it was right to do good on the Sabbath. If it was right for Moses to command the child to be circumcised on the eighth day even if it was the day of rest, then it was equally right for Jesus to heal the man under the same circumstances.</span></p><p class="csC944A788"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">32</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6334B4AB"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs9ED7DAD8"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs614A5D65"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.Jesus&rsquo; Office Questioned 7:25-36</span></p><p class="cs831344E7"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The people were amazed at the boldness of Jesus to proclaim Himself to be the Son of God, but they were also amazed that the religious leaders said nothing openly as Jesus made these bold statements; this brought them to wonder if their silence was their approval that Jesus was really the Christ. Even if they thought that the rulers believed that Jesus was the Christ, some of the people did not believe that He was, for they knew the history and lineage of Jesus and they felt that the Messiah would have no such traceable records. Jesus refuted this argument by again saying if they had really known God, then there would be no doubt to as whom He was--the Son of God.</span></p><p class="cs831344E7"><span class="csCF6BBF71">While there were some that did not believe that Jesus was the Christ, there were many that believed that He was, and this dedication of the multitude to Jesus caused the religious leaders to fear the loss of their position as spiritual guides. Rather than refuting the doctrines of Jesus orally to the people, they chose instead to try to have Jesus taken by force and then judge Him before their council. They sent guards out to bring Jesus to them and later we read that these men came back empty handed because they so awed by the manner and authority in which Jesus spake, that they could not continue to arrest Him.</span></p><p class="cs1D8FE463"><span class="csB0E2188C">IV.Jesus&rsquo; Circumstances Questioned 7:37-53</span></p><p class="cs831344E7"><span class="csCF6BBF71">On the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus stood (some believe on the steps of the temple) and made a loud proclamation of who He was. As we have seen, up to this point there were many man made ideas of who He was, but now Jesus wanted them to know without a doubt that He was the water of life as He cried, &ldquo;If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink&rdquo; (John 7:37). Jesus knew that many people would still not believe in the reality of His person, but at least they had the chance to believe on Him and receive the Spirit of God.</span></p><p class="csCE25BFA3"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Despite this bold proclamation, there were still many doubts as why Jesus could not be the Messiah; this time the people questioned His circumstances that surrounded His place of birth and home town. The people knew from Micah 5:2 that the Christ would come from Bethlehem, but as far as they knew Jesus was born and raised in Galilee. They did not know that His mother brought Him forth in a lowly stable in the royal city of David.</span></p><p class="cs32F24983"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs32E2DBB8"><span class="csE613E19A">33</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csA6108540"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 8: He is the Defender of the Weak</span></p><p class="cs867048F"><span class="csB0E2188C">I.

While He was teaching, the Pharisees brought to Him a woman that had been caught in the act of adultery.

If He said to let her go free, then they would say that He had no regard to the law of Moses. While they may have thought they had Jesus in a &ldquo;catch-22,&rdquo; they did not realize that Jesus knew their hearts and minds and was well aware of their trap.</span></p><p class="csE90E62B0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">C.

Here in the ninth chapter we see Jesus give an illustration to prove that He could illuminate mankind by opening the eyes of a man that had been born blind.</span></p><p class="cs494860B1"><span class="csB0E2188C">I. The Blind Man Healed 9:1-7</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">On a Sabbath day while Jesus was still in Jerusalem after the Feast of Tabernacles, He passed by this blind man as he sat, likely begging for alms just so that he could survive. When the disciples saw him, they asked Jesus, &ldquo;Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?&rdquo; Many times when something bad happens in a person&rsquo;s life, people are quick to assume that it is the judgment of God on that individual for something that they did wrong. Many feel that if a person is poor and afflicted, then they are a sinner, and at the same time, we often equate prosperity and health with the blessing of God. This is how Job&rsquo;s &ldquo;comforters&rdquo; felt in their hearts and expressed to Job; surely if Job were righteous then no evil would befall him (Job 4:7; 8:20). It is true that God does at times use physical judgment upon men (i.e. Elymas the sorcerer, who became blind because of his sin, see Acts 13:8-11) and He also blesses some men, such as Abraham, with physical goods as a reward for being obedient. We must realize though that all men that are being afflicted are not necessarily being punished by God, nor are all prosperous men being blessed by Him. We have seen both rich and healthy men that are wicked and poor and sickly men that are righteous&mdash;physical condition is no indicator of inward condition. The disciples were wrong to assume that it was because of any man&rsquo;s sins that this man was born without the ability to see.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus clarified that it was neither because of his sins, nor the sins of his parents that he was born blind, but he was in that condition that &ldquo;the works of God should be made manifest in him.&rdquo; Jesus further explained that then was the time for Him to perform these works, for the night was coming when &ldquo;no man can work.&rdquo; He knew that soon He would no longer be physically on the earth and so He had to be quick to obey the Father and do what He wanted Him to do.</span></p><p class="csABC3FDBA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus then made the statement, &ldquo;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo; Jesus will always be the only true light of the world, but now that He is now longer physically walking among men, it is the Christians&rsquo; duty to bear record of the light and thus be lights ourselves to manifest the glory of God (John 1:8; Matt. 5:14).</span></p><p class="cs762DC2E0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After He had spoken, Jesus again set forth to reveal that He had to power to illuminate mankind. He spat on the ground and made clay, which He put on the idle eyes of the man and then commanded him to go to the pool of Siloam and wash the clay of from his eyes. At this time Jesus had not promised the man sight, yet the man went forth in obedience and did as Jesus commanded. When the clay was removed, it was one of the most eventful moments for that man&mdash;for he could now see! It was not the clay that healed the man&rsquo;s eyes, and neither was it the water of the pool, but it was the man&rsquo;s faith in Jesus&rsquo; word that made him</span></p><p class="cs453CC29C"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">37</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csC443CB27"><span class="csCF6BBF71">physically whole.</span></p><p class="csB02A2F13"><span class="csB0E2188C">II. The Blind Man Questioned 9:8-23</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The healing of the blind man caused much commotion around Jerusalem. The neighbors that lived around him and the travelers that passed by him all wondered if this really was the same invalid to whom they were so accustomed. Their curiosity got the best of them and they outright asked the man how he had been healed. When the man recounted his healing, the people asked where Jesus was; perhaps there were others that wanted to be healed, or likely it was just the curiosity of humans to want to know all they can about unusual events. The man was not able to answer their questions, since he could not see when he encountered Jesus and thus did not know which direction He was heading and nor could he even give them a description of Him.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Since it was the Sabbath day when the man got healed, some of the people thought that the religious leaders should know about the offense and thus brought the man to the Pharisees, who also asked the man how he was healed. The Pharisees were angered when they heard what Jesus had done and they declared that He could not be a man of God since He did not observe the holy day of rest. There were others that disagreed with this ruling, for they felt that no man could perform such miracles unless He was a man of God.</span></p><p class="csABC3FDBA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now that all parties understood how the man had been healed, the Pharisees wanted to know about the man that healed the blind man, to which the blind man asserted the Jesus was a prophet. The Jews did not believe his proclamation about Jesus, nor did they really believe that this man had really been blind, so they called for his parents to come for interrogation. They wanted to know if this was really their son, if he had really been blind, and if he was blind, how he received his sight.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We have before mentioned that there was fear amongst the Hebrew people around Jerusalem about speaking about Jesus and especially about testifying that He was the Christ because of what the religious leaders would say or do to them. It was because of this fear that the parents vaguely answered the questions, and while they confirmed that this was truly their son, they did not give any information of how he was healed. They asserted that since he was a full-grown man, he was then able to testify for himself.</span></p><p class="csB02A2F13"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.The Blind Man Accused 9:24-34</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The second time that the Pharisees spoke with the former-blind man they did not ask him what he personally thought of Jesus, but rather they commanded him to &ldquo;Give God praise&rdquo; and confess that Jesus was a sinner since He healed on the Sabbath day. The man would not conform to their wishes, and, while he admitted that he did not know the condition of Jesus&rsquo; soul, he also confessed that he knew one thing&mdash;namely, he was bind, but now he could see.</span></p><p class="csD449161"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Pharisees again asked him how he was healed and the men responded with more vigor this time as he said, &ldquo;I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?&rdquo; The Pharisees were ignited by the thought of even considering becoming a disciple of Jesus and they haughtily retorted that the man may become a follower of this Galilean, yet they would never be anyone&rsquo;s disciple besides Moses.</span></p><p class="cs2EB45780"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">38</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD9B7E46A"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csAAAC28D7"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They knew from the Scriptures that Moses heard from God, but they said that they did not know where Jesus even came from (even though He repeatedly told them that He was not of this world).</span></p><p class="cs324478FD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The blind man argued that it should not matter that they did not know the history or genealogy of Jesus, but the fact that He healed Him should prove that He is of God. He knew that the Pharisees believed that God would not hear the prayer of a sinful man, why then would they not believe in this miracle worker that was obviously blessed by God? He ended his defense by declaring that, &ldquo;If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.&rdquo; The Pharisees were angered by this confession, proclaimed the man to be a sinner, and excommunicated him from the synagogue.</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">IV.The Blind Man Enlightened 9:35-41</span></p><p class="cs916B0E8A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The man may have been an outcast among men, but that does not mean that God gave up on him. Jesus found him and asked him a heart-searching question, &ldquo;Dost thou believe on the Son of God?&rdquo; The man implied by his response that he did not even know who the Son of God was, but if he did know, then he would believe. Jesus told him that He was the One that was standing before him and talking with him. The man responded in faith and said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe!&rdquo; and he began to worship Christ.</span></p><p class="csAC742158"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He had received his physical sight earlier when he washed at the pool of Siloam, but now he received his spiritual sight. That is the reason that Jesus came into the world&mdash;to open the eyes of a man&rsquo;s soul that had been blinded by sin. A man can enter the gates of heaven with a physical defect, but if there is any blemish on his soul then he will never tread the golden streets.</span></p><p class="csC9BE9308"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">39</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csB0F53F14"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 10: He is the Good Shepherd</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In this chapter Jesus reveals to the people the concept that He is the leader of the flock of Israel, and then He goes on to explain more details of the idea and even shows how that they are not following their true leader. The idea of God being the shepherd of men is not an idea that is solely found in the tenth chapter of John, but it is a doctrine found in several other verses, including the very famous 23rd Psalm.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This chapter starts with Jesus telling the people a parable that illustrates that He is the Good Shepherd. The illustration points out the difference between the thief and the shepherd--the thief will sneak in by climbing over the wall to try to steal the sheep, while the shepherd can openly and honestly enter the sheepfold and retrieve his possessions. The sheep will hear the voice of the shepherd and know to follow him. In these ancient days of the Middle East, shepherds did not drive sheep as many people do with cattle, but he spent time with the sheep and they learned the sound of his voice, knew that it was safe to obey his commands, and they followed him as he lead them. On the other hand, if the sheep were not familiar with the voice that was commanding them, then you would not see them follow after the stranger. No thief could pretend to be the shepherd and try to lead them away, for they would become afraid and try to run away.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csCB2C55F7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A. The Sheep-door 10:7-9</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is said that in ancient times that the sheepfold was a stone wall with a single door, to which several shepherds would bring their flocks for the night. One of the shepherds or another hired man would act as a guard and porter to make sure that no one entered the sheep fold that did not belong there. It is even said that one of the shepherds would sleep in front of the door, that way if anyone tried to enter, they would have to step over him and risk waking him up from sleep.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus said He is that door of the sheepfold and He made this point very clear. He is the only true passage to having the salvation of God (John 14:6). There were many other men that arose before Jesus that proclaimed to be a Messiah or to know a new way to God, but Jesus said all these men were &ldquo;thieves and robbers.&rdquo; If a man was truly following God, then they were not deceived by such false prophets. Even today there are many men that proclaim to know the way to God as they introduce some new doctrine or idea, but we need to have a close relationship with God so that we are not lead astray by these false men of God.</span></p><p class="cs213F011E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we enter into the flock of God through the straight and narrow way of the salvation of Jesus Christ, then we can know that we are truly saved. It is in this place of abiding in Him that we find pasture. Like David says in the 23rd Psalm, that the Shepherd will cause us to not have want of anything because He supplies all of our needs as He makes us &ldquo;to lie down in green pastures&rdquo; (Psalm 23:2).</span></p><p class="csCE9DD8D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">40</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs425D9C07"><span class="cs91EF8B52">B.

There have been many so called &ldquo;men of God&rdquo; that have entered the ministry for the perk benefits. These men only care about the sheep for personal gain such as offerings and paid-parsonages. God speaks against these false shepherds in Ezekiel 34:2&ndash;3, where it says, &ldquo;...Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.&rdquo; These men have no real backbone, and when the trial comes, then they run away to save their own lives.</span></li></ul>

It is now the feast of dedication, or more commonly to us today, Hanukkah. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The New Manners and Customs of the Bible </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">by J. M. Freeman and J. H. Chadwick explains to us a little about the feast and its origin:</span></p><p class="cs6BDC9864"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">41</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs1C946AE9"><span class="cs1DA2E76">This was a feast instituted in honor of the restoration of divine worship in the temple, and its formal rededication to sacred uses after it had been defiled by the heathen under Antiochus Epiphanes. This dedication took place in 164 b.c., and an account of it is given in the apocryphal book 1 Maccabees 4:52&ndash;59. The feast lasted two days, and could be celebrated not only in Jerusalem, but elsewhere.</span></p><p class="cs3043FCD8"><span class="cs1DA2E76">In later times it was known by the name of the &ldquo;Feast of Lamps,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Feast of Lights,&rdquo; because of the custom of illuminating the houses while celebrating it. The Jewish rabbis have a tradition that, when the Jews under Judas Maccabeus drove the heathen out of the temple and cleansed it from its pollution, they found a solitary bottle of sacred oil that had escaped the profane search of the heathen. This was all they had for lighting the sacred lamps, but by a miracle this was made to last eight days, and so this became the duration of the feast. This is the holiday referred to now as Hanukkah, an eight-day festival beginning on the twenty-fifth day of Kislev.</span></p><p class="cs884E75A9"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It was during this feast that the Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus while He walked on Solomon&rsquo;s Porch in the temple and asked Him this question, &ldquo;How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly&rdquo; (John 10:24). Jesus reminded them that He already told them (John 5:36) that His works proved who He was.</span></p><p class="csD6084A70"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus said the reason that they did not believe was because they were not His sheep. Jesus said that His sheep would hear His voice and by so saying, He also inferred that those that were not His sheep would not here His voice. Now we see the words of Jesus fulfilled-later we see them fulfilled even more as He lays down His life for the sheep (John 10:15).</span></p><p class="csF87C15A1"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">42</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs156D5569"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 11: He is the Resurrection and the</span></p><p class="csA301ED2C"><span class="cs133F5153">Life</span></p><p class="csC285CC9"><span class="csB0E2188C">I.

			<li class="cs86C7E65A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The sisters&rsquo; request that Jesus come to pray for Lazarus 11:1-6</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There was a family in the town of Bethany that had grown quite close to Jesus. This family consisted of three siblings: Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus to hear what he had to say (Luke 10:39) and later poured precious ointment on the feet of Jesus and then cleaned his feet with her hair (12:3), Martha, who was older than Mary and scolded her when she sat and listened to Jesus instead of helping her serve (Luke 10:40), and Lazarus, who was known of as the friend of Jesus (11:11).</span></p><p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At the beginning of this chapter, we see Lazarus fall ill with a deadly disease and his sisters send a request to Jesus in Bethabara that He would come help him before he died. When Jesus received the message He said, &ldquo;This sickness is not unto death...&rdquo; Jesus knew that Lazarus would die, but He also knew that that would not be the end of His friend.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus also said that the disease was &ldquo;for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.&rdquo; The miracles that Jesus performed were so that men would glorify God and believe in Him (5:23) and this miracle was more than others that Jesus performed because Lazarus would be dead for four days, then there would be no doubt that his resurrection was by the power of God. Jesus did not immediately respond to the message, nor did He hurry to travel to Bethany, but He tarried where He was for two more days.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The disciples&rsquo; request that Jesus stay away from Jerusalem 11:7-16</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After the two days, Jesus encouraged His disciples to make the journey with Him west to where Lazarus was. The disciples tried to convince Jesus not to go near Judea since the rulers of the Jews wanted to kill Him (10:31, 39). They were probably not only afraid that something would happen to Jesus, but they were also fearful that they too would suffer persecution for being associated with him.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus responded by giving them an illustration of how the limitation the twelve hours or the day restrict when a man can work. When those twelve hours are over, then darkness is come and no one can work. He was trying to help them understand that He was given a certain ammount of time from the Father to complete His work on earth. Jesus knew that He was in His eleventh hour and could not cease to do the work of God because of fear or discourageent.</span></p><p class="csABC3FDBA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He then told them another reason for wanting to go, Lazarus was sleeping and He wanted to go and wake him up. He was not talking about actual sleep, but the deep sleep of death. The discilples thought it was a good thing if he was sleeping; he should be left alone so that he might get rest and recover. Jesus then told them plainly that, &ldquo;Lazarus is dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csC18D10FA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The next words of Jesus come as a surprise to us as He says, &ldquo;And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there...&rdquo; At first glance it sound as if Jesus is happy that Lazarus is dead, but the next statement explains the motive of Jesus as He says, &ldquo;to the intent ye may</span></p><p class="cs64237C69"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">43</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csCD5CB2AF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">believe.&rdquo; Jesus knew that Lazarus could be healed whether He went right away or four days after he was already dead, but He also knew that it would be a greater testimony to the disciples if Lazarus was not merely healed from sickness but rather raised from the dead. Doctors could perform cures on people, but only One anointed by God could raise the dead.</span></p><p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thomas, who is known as </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the doubter </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">because he later refused to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead, makes one of the few statements that we have recorded of him saying. He told the disciples, &ldquo;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&rdquo; Though we see some doubt in his statement because he thought that Jesus would then be put to death, we also see some faith--he was willing to die with Christ. He knew that it was better to die with Him than to live without Him.</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">II. The Reasoning of the Sisters 11:17-32</span></p><p class="cs339A21DF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As we stated when we studied chapter seven, the natural mind cannot understand the things of God and many times God will do things in a way that is contrary to how we would do it. We see Martha and Mary try to explain to Jesus how they thought things would have been better if He had only done things the way they wanted.</span></p><p class="cs849300F2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A. The reasoning of Martha 11:17-27</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs11624E61"><span class="csCF6BBF71">She thought Jesus was too late 11:17-22</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Martha heard that Jesus had come to town, she went out to meet Him. The first thing that she said was that if Jesus had only come sooner then her brother would not have died. They called for Him to come in time enough and save their brother, but Jesus failed (at least they thought) to come and help. Many times we out a time restriction on God and He does not work within our expectations we think He has forgotten us or does not care about us. We must understand that God&rsquo;s ways are not our ways and we must believe in Him for the promise even if every natural element says that it is impossible.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs11624E61"><span class="csCF6BBF71">She thought the resurrection was far away 11:23, 24</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus then told Martha that her brother would live again and she responded that she knew at the end of time there would be a resurrection and he would arise. She did believe in resurrection, but she did not believe it was for her time. Many people believe in the promises of God, but they do not believe that they will see them fulfilled in their life time.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs11624E61"><span class="csCF6BBF71">She believed Jesus was the Messiah 11:25-27</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus told her that He was that resurrection of which she spoke. If any man believes in Him than they can have everlasting life, which means they would never die. This is spiritual life that He is speaking about, and not just natural life. If we believe in Him then our inner man can lives for ages after our bodies are laid in the ground. By giving physical life to a body He proved that He could also give spiritual life to a soul.</span></p><p class="csAC1AA708"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus asked Martha if she believed the things that He said, and she responded that she did believe that He was the Messiah and the Son of God. This is her faith taking hold and gaining victory over her natural mind. Her mind told her that there was no hope for her brother, but her soul was able to depend on the Christ to make her brother alive agin.</span></p><p class="csBEE1593"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">44</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs56844"><span class="cs91EF8B52">B. The reasoning of Mary 11:28-32</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When word came that Jesus arrived in town, Mary stayed in the house with the mourners while Martha went out to meet Him. This is possibly because she felt hurt because Jesus did not make haste to come heal her brother. After talking with Jesus, Martha returned home to tell her sister that the Master had come and that He wanted to see her. When Mary heard that Jesus was specifically calling for her, she got up and immediately went to see him.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mary&rsquo;s initial complaint to Jesus was the same as Martha&rsquo;s and she said while weeping, &ldquo;If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.&rdquo; She too felt that God could only work during certain times and it seemed that Jesus did not care enough to help her brother.</span></p><p class="cs494860B1"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.The Resurrection of Lazarus 11:33-44</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Jesus wept 11:33-37</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It moved Jesus when He saw this woman weeping for her late brother and &ldquo;He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.&rdquo; He then asked to be brought to the tomb and when He saw it, He wept. Some people believe that Jesus wept because He was sad that Lazarus had died, and this is what those that were watching that day thought. This argument is not very valid for we know that Jesus knew that Lazarus would soon be raised to life and thus He had no need to lament for him. Another time when Jesus wept, He was interceding because man was not believing in God (Luke 19:41-44) and that is the reason here. There were men there that day doubting and asking why Jesus could not have saved Lazarus when He was able to help other people. Jesus was not weeping for Lazarus, but because the people, including Martha and Mary, did not have the faith to see Lazarus return to the living.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Jesus commanded the stone be removed 11:38-42</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus told the people to remove the stone away that sealed the grave. He wanted them to remove every hinderance and stumbling block of their faith that hindered them from believing for the resurrection of Lazarus. They had put the stone in the way and were thus surrendering Lazarus to death, and before they could see Him come alive they had to remove the obstacle they placed in the way. Before God can work miracles in our lives we must get rid of carnal thoughts that hinder Him from moving.</span></p><p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Martha quickly objected to the stone being removed and reminded Him that Lazarus had been dead for four days and that the tomb was sure to reek with the stench of his decaying body. Jesus rebuked her for her doubt and reminded her that He told her that she would see the glory of God if she would believe.</span></p><p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When the stone was removed, Jesus lifted up His eyes to heaven and prayed to the Father. He knew that God always heard and honored His prayers, so He was not looking for something to increase His own faith, but He wanted the people to see a sign that proved that He was the Resurrection and the Life.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Jesus called Lazarus out of the grave 11:43-44</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csC5356BBE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After He prayed, Jesus cried for Lazarus to come forth. Death had no other choice but to loosen its hold on Lazarus when Jesus spoke and we see that he comes stumbling out of the grave still bound in the grave clothes.</span></p><p class="cs4D31D65C"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">45</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs6336E856"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus then commanded the people to remove the grave clothes from off of him. This was something the people had to do and not Jesus--since it was them that bound him they had to be the ones to unbind him. Their doubt left him in the grave and now they must take action and believe to see him walk among the living again.</span></p><p class="cs494860B1"><span class="csB0E2188C">IV.The Retribution of the Jews 11:45-57</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because of this miracle, many that were present now believed on Jesus, but there were others that did not believe and they ran to tell the Pharisees what happened so that they might quence it. The Pharisees told the priests, whom assembled together to discuss what they should do about Jesus. They were afraid that if they let Jesus alone to keep preaching, teaching, and healing people, then many more people would believe and the Romans would surely hear about it. The Romans would undoubtedly consider it a zealote revolt against the Roman Emporor and come in and press more restrictions on the people. The priests and other religious leaders would lose their positions and the whole nation might face expulsion or even slaughter.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Caiaphas, the high priest for the year, made a speech and He said that it important that One Man die instead of the whole nation. Whether he knew it or not, he was not speaking out of his own understanding, but he was prophecying the words of God. It was necessary that Jesus die so that the whole world and not just Judea should be free from death. The Jews might have been the tool that God used to put Jesus on the cross but the idea did not initiate from them themselves. God had a plan formed from before the foundation of the world that Jesus would die for humanity (Rev. 13:8).</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because of what they already said and because of Caiaphas&rsquo; prophecy, the preists decided that the only thing option they had was to put Jesus to death. The Passover was approaching and they knew from the past that Jesus always attended the Jewish feasts, so they prepared to catch Him during this time when He would be in Jerusalem. They gave a commandment and spread the message that if anyone should see Jesus, then they must report Him to the religious leaders.</span></p><p class="cs86D38176"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus knew that His time to die was approahing, but it was not quite time yet. Because of this, Jesus did not openly walk among the Jews, but He went into the city of Ephraim. Jesus did everything for a reason and He had a purpose for going to this city. He was doing more than just seeking rest from persecution, but He was doing the will of the Father and protecting the disciples and preparing them for what was to come ahead. This place was not too far from where He had been tempted of the devil, and perhaps He was trying to get His disciples ready to face the hard temptations that would come as they see their Master arrested, falsely accused, and hung on the cross. It was also nearby where Joshua fought his first hard battle in the Promised Land and Jesus might have wanted the twelve to be ready to fight the hardest battle that they ever would fight.</span></p><p class="csFFC27643"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">46</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs69AFFD74"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 12: He is the King</span></p><p class="csD4746A32"><span class="csB0E2188C">I.

We see from Matt. 26:6 and Mark 14:3 that the diner was at Simon the leper&rsquo;s house. Lazarus and Martha were also at this feast, and it seems that Martha was helping serve the food. It was during this feast that Mary brought an offering to give to her Master.</span></p><p class="cs927D4F50"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A. The method of her offering</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mary entered the house and went to where Jesus was sitting, and poured a box of precious ointment on His feet and then dried them with her hair. This is the second time that Jesus was anointed; the first time is a very similar account that is recorded in Luke 7:36-50 in which an unnamed woman entered the house where Jesus was eating and washed he feet of Jesus with her tears, dried them with her hair, and then anointed them with an ointment that she had carried in an alabaster box. This first time, Jesus was anointed to be prepared for service even as David was anointed before he became king. The second time of anointing was to prepare Jesus for burial (Matt. 26:12).</span></p><p class="csCB2C55F7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">B.

This does not mean that He is a cruel and un-compassionate ruler that is unconcerned with the lives of His subjects. In this chapter we see the King step off His lofty throne and minister to the humble needs of His followers to teach us a lesson in humility by washing their feet.</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">I. Jesus Washes the Disciples&rsquo; Feet 13:1-17</span></p><p class="cs61DA5B56"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Four days after Jesus made His triumphant entry into Jerusalem, it was time to prepare for the Passover. This was a Thursday, and the feast would begin at sundown being that Jewish days began when the sun had set. Jesus had His disciples prepare a room for them to eat the Passover meal (Mark 14:12-16) and now they were settled and ready to eat the meal.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Jesus&rsquo; reason for washing their feet 13:1-5</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus knew that before the sun rose again that the shadow of death would separate Him from His disciples and He wanted them to know of His great love for them once again. He even reached out in love to Judas whom He knew had made a plan to betray Him. This is the same love that He shows to us. Jesus did not first show us love when we were righteous and walking with God, but He revealed His love long before we ever knelt at an altar when we were wretched, miserable sinners (Rom. 5:8).</span></p><p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To show them His love, He humbled Himself to the level of a servant and started to wash the feet of His disciples, which were dusty and tired after traveling many miles in pursuit of their beloved Master. Jesus will not make us toil for His kingdom without rewarding us. There may be times when we labor tremendously for the Gospel and almost faint from exhaustion, but He will not leave us defenseless, but He will lead us to a place of rest and restore our souls (Ps. 23:2, 3). Jesus knew that His disciples had been through hard times and wanted to give them an opportunity to rest and prepare for the greater trials that they would face later that night.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Peter&rsquo;s objection to Jesus washing his feet 13:6-11</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When it came time for Jesus to wash Peter&rsquo;s feet, Peter greatly rejected. He had such a great respect for Jesus that he could not bring himself to let this great Man perform such a lowly task for him. Jesus told him that he might not yet understand why He was washing their feet, but there would come a time when he would know and understand the reason. Perter still would not bend and said that Jesus would never wash his feet.</span></p><p class="csC18D10FA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus said that if Peter would not let Him wash his feet then he would never have any part with Him. If we are to be joined with Christ, then we must first be cleansed by Him. There are many people that want to be know as Christians, yet they are unwilling to let God remove the filth of sin from their lives. Peter responded and told Jesus then to wash not only his feet, but also his head and hands too. Jesus told Him that washing his feet was enough to make him clean.</span></p><p class="cs64237C69"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">50</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csF49B188C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus then told the twelve that they all were not clean. He knew that Judas was in the process of betraying Him and that his soul had been tarnished by greed and selfishness. Jesus could have openly condemned Judas and expelled him from the group, but He wanted Judas to have every possible opportunity to repent of his sin. This is why He continued to warn Judas through careful speeches and did not openly rebuke him.</span></p><p class="cs47EBEFB4"><span class="cs91EF8B52">C. Jesus&rsquo; explanation of washing their feet 13:12-17</span></p><p class="cs76DD70E2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Jesus was done washing their feet, they set down to eat the Passover meal. Through the remainder of this chapter and the entirety of chapter fourteen we see Jesus explain some last words to His disciples as they sit around this table.</span></p><p class="cs287CD588"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He began by explaining the reason He washed their feet. It was to show them His humility. He was their leader and the greatest among them, and yet He was willing to perform the lowest responsibility possible. He did this for their example, for if He, the greatest, was willing to be so humble, then we too should be willing to be humble. Most times when a person gets elevated to a high position, they will not do the work of someone that they feel is less important than them. We must show humility and do the work of God even if it is not glorious at times and even if we feel that we are too important to do such work.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Happiness comes from humility. Jesus told them that if they were to obey this principle of humility then they would be truly happy. People that are always looking for other people to get the work done are never happy and content, but people that see the need and are willing to work to see it fulfilled no matter how hard or dirty it may get are the people that are most successful in life.</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">II. Jesus Foretells Judas&rsquo; Betrayal 13:18-30</span></p><p class="cs3C9AD79E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus already mentioned in verse eleven that He knew that there was a traitor among them and we know that He knew it was Judas. He again reaches out to Judas and quotes Psalm 41:9, which says, &ldquo;Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.&rdquo; Jesus warned the disciples that He was not speaking about all of them, but He also wanted Judas to know that He knew what He had done and was giving him the opportunity to confess. In verse twenty-one He clearly tells them that He knows one of them will betray Him.</span></p><p class="cs287CD588"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This alarmed the disciples. From what Jesus said they knew that not all of them would betray Him, but who was that one that would do such a despicable thing? They all began to look around at each other wondering whom the guilty one was. Peter was tired of wondering and wanted a direct answer, so he beckoned to John, who was leaning on Jesus. Peter told him to ask Jesus who it was and John obeyed and asked Jesus.</span></p><p class="csFEA28E24"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus answered that it would be the one to whom He gave the piece of bread after He dipped it in the wine. He then dipped the bread and handed it to Judas along with the command, &ldquo;That thou doest, do quickly.&rdquo; Judas here was faced with a final opportunity-either he could ask Jesus for forgiveness or he could follow the lust of his flesh. Judas chose to obey his baser desires and gave in to his greed. This greed was an open door for the devil to come into his life and take over, which he did. We cannot continually reject the love of</span></p><p class="csABF17997"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">51</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csEB2D0584"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus and follow our own will forever without serious consequences. There will come a time <br/>when any small sin can lead to a possession of the devil. Judas immediately got up and left <br/>the table after he took the bread from Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs494860B1"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.Jesus Foretells Peter&rsquo;s Denial 13:31-38</span></p><p class="cs552E4761"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Judas left, Jesus told the others that now was the time for Him to be glorified. The disciples did not understand what this meant. Some of them might have thought that this was to be the time that Jesus would set Himself up as a ruler over an earthly kingdom and deliver the Jews from the Romans. They did not understand that He was talking about how that He would die, even though He told them before that would.He told them the same thing that He told the Jews, He was going away and they would not be able to follow Him where he was going (heaven). Peter asked Jesus where He was going, but Jesus only told him that he would not be able to follow Him there now and there would come a time when he could follow Him.</span></p><p class="csF6139053"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peter objected and insisted that he could and would follow Jesus where ever He went. Peter said that he would even die for Jesus if he had to. Jesus knew that Peter would not keep this promise and He told Peter that before the rooster crowed three times the next morning that he would deny Him three times. As we later read, Jesus&rsquo; words proved to be true and we see Peter cursing and swearing to deny that he ever even knew Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs137C70"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peter wanted to do right and follow Jesus, but he could not in his own strength even as Paul said in Romans 7:15 that he could not do what he wanted to do and did that he did not want to do. There is power in God to overcome every temptation, but it cannot be found apart from regeneration and dependance upon God. Peter&rsquo;s problem was that he did not know his own weakness and his need for help from God. When we think we can make it in our own strength we are sure to fail, but if we know that we cannot do it by ourselves then we can see God work miraculously as we believe Him.</span></p><p class="cs3351311A"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">52</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csEBB0DF5E"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs83C4F069"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs90BC8676"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 14: He is the Consoler</span></p><p class="csD307D28F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This chapter is a continuation of the conversation that began in chapter thirteen between Christ and His disciples as they ate the Last Supper. In the end of chapter thirteen Jesus told His disciples that He would be leaving them and that they could not immediately come with Him, though they would be permitted later on to follow Him (John 13:36). This chapter is an encouragement to the disciples to keep the faith in the face of Jesus physically leaving them.</span></p><p class="csB6AE1601"><span class="csB0E2188C">I. Jesus Assured Them that There Would be a Place of Rest 14:1-4</span></p><p class="cs889FFDC5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As we see Jesus preparing to leave His disciples, we constantly see His compassion towards them. He has a desire that they would continue in His doctrine even though they would no longer be able to behold Him with the carnal eye. Jesus could have spent time railing on them for their faults and eminent failures, but instead He offered great words of consolation, &ldquo;Let not your heart be troubled&rdquo; (John 14:1). If they would only believe in Him, then they should have no fear of falling.</span></p><p class="csA92A45B8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In verse two Jesus promises the twelve that in His Father&rsquo;s house (heaven) there are many mansions and He was going there to prepare a place for those that would follow Him to that celestial destination. He had spent time preparing His disciples and now He was going to prepare a place for them.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csA92A45B8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When this life is over we will leave this world of troubles and trials and we will forever be in safety and solitude within the gates of heaven. No longer will we have to wrestle with the flesh, conquer the old nature, or dart the attacks of the devil, but we will forever be in true fellowship with our Lord and Savior in a place that is realer than the earth on which we dwell. Revelation twenty-one gives us a description of the New Jerusalem with all of its splendor that is to be the home of those that have been washed in the blood and have held true to the commandments of God. II Corinthians 5:1 says, &ldquo;For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csFF0C0F55"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As followers of Christ, we not only can look forward to a place of rest off in the future, but we can start to experience that rest now. While our body still face troubles and afflictions, our soul can be in a place of comfort in the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs1CAC4C0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">53</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs2442517E"><span class="csB0E2188C">II. Jesus Announced to Them the Way to this Rest 14:5-14</span></p><p class="csE0451D5E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After being told that they would soon be given a mansion and a life of rest, the disciples wanted to know how they should get to that location and Thomas said, &ldquo;Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?&rdquo; (John 14:5). Jesus explained that He was the way to God. There is no other way for a man to find access to the peace of God but through Christ Himself.</span></p><p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus then told them of the relation between Him and the Father and how they are united in one. If they knew and saw Jesus, then they knew and saw the Father because they were one in purpose and nature. Jesus is the express image of the Father (Heb. 1:3; Matt. 11:27), which means that the Father never physically reveals Himself to man, but when God does appear to man, He does it through the person of the Son. Jesus did not say or do anything unless the Father told Him to say or do it (John 5:19; John 8:28).</span></p><p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He then told them that they should believe Him because of this unity with the Father, since if a man truly knew the Father, then he would also know the Son. If they would not believe Him because of that principle, then they should at least believe Him because of the works that He has done. This is similar to the discourse that He told the Pharisees in John 5:36.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He then told them that if they would believe then they would do greater miracles than even He Himself had done. Jesus told them that if they would only ask, then He would give them what ever they requested. If we would ask and believe, then we can see many mighty things accomplished.</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.Jesus Affirmed to Them the Giver of this Rest 14:15-31</span></p><p class="cs8366BAC0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Though Jesus was physically leaving the earth He was not leaving His disciples all alone, for He would send to them the Comforter, which is, the Holy Spirit.</span></p><p class="csCB2C55F7"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A.

The Vine (Christ) 15:1-6</span></p><p class="cs3C9AD79E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus declares in the opening of this allegory by stating that He is the true vine and that the Father is the Husbandman. The Father is the One that created the plan of salvation-the One that planted the Vine here in this earth so there would be an option for men to be attached to Him. The work of God made provision for all men to be united with the Godhead in one heart and one mind. Christ did not create this work Himself, but He acted in complete obedience to the will of the Husbandman (John 5:36; 17:4).</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus then explains to His disciples two types of branches that correspond to two types of people: the unproductive branches, which are sinners, and the productive branches, which are saints. The unproductive branches are altogether cut off from the vine, while the productive branches are pruned so that they will bring forth more fruit. God will purify your life of things that are hindering you from producing results. Sin in our lives will hinder our ability to witness to the lost, so we must allow God to convict us and then respond to that conviction by repenting. If we continue to be pliable in the hands of the Creator, we will continue to grow stronger and our light will grow brighter.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These productive branches did not produce the fruit out of any ability of their own, but they produced fruit because they were connected to the vine. A branch that is disconnected from a natural plant will never bring forth any results, the same is true in the spiritual, for we can never, ever, expect to be truly productive in this life unless we are united with Christ. We must constantly keep our hearts and motives in check so that we never grow confident in our abilities and to ensure that we are depending on God in every thing that we do.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we do remain in Him, then we can expect to bring forth fruit. Men will see our good works and glorify God (Matthew 5:16). If our lives are truly exalting Jesus, then men will be drawn unto salvation in Christ (John 12:32). Souls getting saved by our witness is better than any physical reward that we could gain. Money and other physical goods will soon rot and rust, but the souls of the men that we lead to Christ will live forever and will be an eternal memorial to our faithfulness.</span></p><p class="cs814FB66C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Those unproductive branches that have been cut off of the vine are soon withered are eventually cast into the fire to be destroyed. Men cannot live apart from Christ for too long until it will be quite noticeable that they have no real life. They will wither up, that is, the joy and peace will depart from their life and they will be known to be miserable. Many people may try to put on a facade of happiness, but deep down inside they know that there are</span></p><p class="cs453CC29C"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">55</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD9B7E46A"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csA74DE984"><span class="csCF6BBF71">unhappy. The eventual end of these sous are that they are to be cast forever into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:15).</span></p><p class="cs2AE1CB42"><span class="csB0E2188C">II. The Productive Branches (The Saints) 15:7-17</span></p><p class="csD1F8C304"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now that Jesus briefly covered the ideas of the True Vine and the productive and unproductive branches, He then goes on by explaining the people represented by both types of branches, beginning with the fruitful boughs.</span></p><p class="cs15C3D333"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As already mentioned earlier, the productive branches are only so because they are connected to Christ. We must fully depend upon Him if there is to be any value in our lives. We are hopeless without Him for in Him we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28). Even as a child must depend upon its mother for everything it needs, even so must we depend upon God; to neglect to do this will certainly result in absolute disaster. Deuteronomy 30:20 and John 14:6 explain that God will not only help us in life, but that He </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">our life.</span></p><p class="cs91035E1B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He is our source:</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs4C3187B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A part of abiding in Christ is for His words to abide in us. Many people proclaim to follow Jesus, and yet they hardly know any of His words, let alone obey them. Jesus was saying that if we are to be united with Him, the His Word had to be an integrated part of our lives. We are commanded to study the Word (II Tim. 2:15), mediate upon it (Josh. 1:8), and remember it (Proverbs 2:1, 5; Psalm 119:11). We are to do this so that it will be more than dead letters but life unto us (John 6:63, 68). It is not enough for us to just have an understanding of these words or even to speak them, but we must obey them.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1FECB182"><span class="cs91EF8B52">We must abide in His love 15:9-17</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs59816DB2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Although it is essential to bearing spiritual fruit, obedience to the laws of God is not enough in itself; obedience must be coupled with love. True obedience and true love are a garment with no seem--the two cannot be absolutely distinguished from each other. If you love God, then you will keep His commandments (John 14:15). Romans 13:8-10 explains that love is the fulfilling of the law because if you have love towards someone, then you will not want to hurt them in any way; Jesus said practically the same thing when He said that on love &ldquo;hang[s] all the law and the prophets&rdquo; (Matthew 22:37-40).</span></p><p class="cs162CA990"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">56</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs6EBA74DD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Without the love of God, all of our good works are in vain (I Cor. 13:1-3). You may obey all the commands of God to the letter, yet if your heart and motives are not right then you will never bring forth any fruit.</span></p><p class="csAAC20644"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.The Unproductive Branches (The Sinners) 15:18-27</span></p><p class="csC9C00EA1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We are not saved by good works (Eph. 2:8, 9), but once we are saved, we must maintain our salvation by good works. A man that cares not to pull others out of the same pit that he was once in, will soon find himself back in the pit. Those that have become a part of the vine of Christ will soon find themselves severed unless they bring forth fruit.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are many men that proclaim to be a part of the body of Christ, yet they have long been disunited from Him because of their sin and selfishness that they let slip in. Others have never truly been engrafted into Christ and yet they speak as if they have. Both of these types of men will act as if they know God and will go to church and even preach, but though they may have deceived men and even themselves to believe that this is true, God is not deceived. In the Judgment Day He will separate the wheat from the chaff and will cast the false into eternal judgment. Other unconnected branches have never pledged to be a part of Christ and they will meet the same ending as the hypocrite.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">They will hate us as they hated Jesus 15:18-20</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus warned that these unprofitable branches will hate us--His reason for saying so? Because if they hated Him, then they will surely hate anyone that is truly following Him. In Luke 6:26 Jesus proclaimed that it would not be a good thing if all men spoke well of you for that means that there is nothing in you that is convicting them of their sin and compelling them to turn to God.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csC045A27C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They did not think that they hated the Father, but though their mouths drew nigh to God, their hearts were far from Him (Isaiah 29:13).

It is never promised that we will not have problems, rather we have been warned that those problems will certainly come; what is promised is that we will be delivered out of those trials and afflictions (Psalm 34:19). We may have to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but He is walking with us all the way and will bring us out to the other side.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.&rdquo; It is a sad time that we live in, but there are many people that think they are helping God out by telling true Christians that they think they are wrong. The majority of &ldquo;churches&rdquo; this day will stand up for sin and defend the unrighteous while at the same time they condemn the preacher of holiness for not having any love. They call evil good and good evil (Isaiah 5:20).</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus offered them consolation by promising the advent of the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit (John 14:26; Acts 9:31).

That did not mean that they would never be able to comprehend these hidden things, for Jesus promised a time when the Holy Spirit reveal to them these things. When we study the Word of God, we cannot approach the task with mere intellectual ability, but we need to seek the revelation of the Spirit to make the Word alive to us. There are many things that cannot be understood by natural senses, but the Sprit can show them to us (I Corinthians 2:9, 10; Ephesians 3:1-6).</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">II.

The crucifixion surely would seem horrifying to the disciples as it occurred, but afterwards they would be able to look back at it and proclaim that it was a great joy for it brought them salvation. Both Peter (I Peter</span><span class="cs19780493"> 1:10, 11)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and John (I John 1:7; 3:16) later give witness that this brutal crucifixion that they witnessed proved to be for the betterment of humanity.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus then told His disciples about a joy that would come to them because of how the Father would hear and answer their prayers. He told them that a time would come when He would not have to be an agent between them and the Father for special requests, but they themselves would be able to petition God in the name of Jesus and He would answer their prayers. If they loved Jesus then God would love them and answer their prayers. Because of the work of Jesus on the cross we have the privilege to go boldly to the throne of God and make requests of Him (Heb. 4:14-16).</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus also said that when that time came, He would no longer speak to them in proverbs and parables, but He would openly declare to them the Word of the Father. The Old Testament is filled with types and symbols, and while Jesus was on the earth, most of His teaching was done through parables. Now, as we mentioned above, Jesus has sent the Spirit of Truth and if a man is truly seeking to know the things of God&rsquo;s Word, then He will make them plainly known to him.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The disciples told Jesus that even now they understood what He was saying and believed that He was the Son of God. Jesus asked them if they really believed as He warned them of the coming tribulation. He knew that later that night He would be betrayed and executed. If they truly believed, then they would stay with Him even though it might mean being persecuted with Him. The disciples believed in their head, but their hearts had not yet received this same revelation. There are some men that study history and believe that Jesus was a great man, but they never really come to a salvation experience. Our religion needs to be more than one of the intellect, but it must be from the innermost soul.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus knew that they would all forsake Him and flee, but He also knew that He would not be alone for the Father would be with Him. We can rest assure that even if all mankind turns against us, then God will still be with us.</span></p><p class="cs39DE1BDF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He concluded the chapter by telling them that He spoke these things consisting of chapter thirteen and fourteen to let them know that they could find peace in Him even in the midst of tribulation. Jesus assured them that this tribulation would come, but they should not let it destroy them for He has overcome the whole world. God never said that things would be easy for us, but He did say that He would help us through every trial.</span></p><p class="cs50ABEA4D"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">59</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csB0F53F14"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 17: He is The Great Intercessor</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This chapter is commonly referred to as &ldquo;The High Priestly Prayer&rdquo; of Christ because in it, Christ intercedes between God and man even as the Levitical priests in the Old Testament did.

		<p class="cs9B53F5F4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus was not any less God than the Father was, but He aways has and always will operate in submission to Him.

		<p class="cs4DFBF9BE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus always operated according to the timeframe of God. We see from several verses in the book of John that the timing of the crucifixion was not haphazard but it was planned by God and known by Christ (John 2:4; 4:21; 7:30; 8:20; 13:1).</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Knowing Jesus is not merely a part of life, but it is life (John 14:6; Phil. 1:21; I John 5:12). So often we allow God to move from the focus of our hearts and He is crowded out by religion and formality, but we need to keep the flame of His life burning in us everyday (II Cor. 4:16).</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This term &ldquo;the glory&rdquo; is one that has been very familiar to us as we have studied the book of John. It was used in the prologue when it says that, &ldquo;We beheld His glory, the glory as the only begotten of the Father&rdquo; (John 1:14). The word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">glory </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">is used 12 times in John and variations of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">glorify </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">are used 21 times.</span></p><p class="csD60A6E82"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To us, to glorify generally means to make great, but to Jesus it meant to reveal to humanity His greatness. Generally it speaks to us the manifestation of the divinity and power of Christ and it specifically speaks to us of the crucifixion. Christ always looked upon the cross as a means of glorifying God (John 12:23). Paul also saw glory in the cross (Gal. 6:14).</span></p><p class="cs6209A753"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">60</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="cs2442517E"><span class="csB0E2188C">II.

We see that the majority of His prayer is for others. We can learn from His example and instead of always seeking for help for our own needs we should spend much of our prayer time interceding for the needs of others. Job found relief to his tribulation only when he prayed for his friends (Job 42:10).</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is not the only record we have of Jesus interceding for His disciples, for we see Him tell Peter in Luke 22:32 that He prayed for him.

There would be many other Jews that would see Him as the true Messiah. Moreover, soon many would realize that salvation was to the Gentile and not only the Jew and many would join the body of Christ.

As He closed His prayer, Jesus asked that our whole lives would be found in Him. We must remember that as we go through life that it is not our own ability and might that brings us victory, but it is the intercessory prayer and sacrificial death of Christ that keeps us spiritually well.</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus not only prayed that we would be united with Him and the Father, but that we would be united with each other.

Betrayal by Judas 18:1-11</span></p><p class="csC3D4EB5C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After Jesus finished praying, He led His disciples over the brook Cedron into the Garden of Gethsemane. This was not an unusual thing for Jesus to retreat here to pray with His disciples and this fact teaches us that we cannot just wait for the hard times to come before we pray, but we aways need to be praying (I Thess. 5:17).</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because it was so predictable to find Jesus here that it was no problem for Judas to be able to lead the Jewish religious leaders to capture Him. There is no record in John of Judas conspiring with the Jews to betray Jesus, but we only see him leave the Last Supper when Jesus told him, &ldquo;That thou doest, do quickly&rdquo; (John 13:27) and now we see him come to betray his master.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John does not give any indication of how many men came with Judas, but we can see from Matthew 26:47 that it was a great multitude. It is strange that so many well armed soldiers came to attack a man that had been known for His peace; perhaps they were afraid that Jesus would escape from the midst of them as He did before (Luke 4:28-30; John 8:59) and they wanted to ensure the capture of their &ldquo;foe.&rdquo; We know that it was not their numbers or their weapons that enabled them to capture Jesus that day, but it was simply in the plan of God for it to happen, and so it did.</span></p><p class="cs8C2FA2A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">John gives an exclusive account of how that Jesus asked His attackers, &ldquo;Whom seek ye?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; When Jesus told them that He was the one they were seeking, then these men were knocked backward to the ground by the power of God. Probably out of amazement at the power manifested, they did not immediately approached Jesus to seize Him and so Jesus again asked them whom they sought. When they responded in the same manner as the first, Jesus reminded them that He clearly told them who He was and that they were planning to capture Him, then they should do so and let His disciples go free. Jesus always had the desire that His disciples should be kept in the midst of this trial as well as any other trial that they would fast later and that is why He prayed in John 17:11, 12 that the Father would keep them through His name.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At seeing this attack, Peter acted in impertinence and either somehow thought that he could take on this whole group of soldiers by himself or he figured that he would not go down without fighting and he took out his sword and cut off the ear of Malcus, who was a servant of the high priest.</span></p><p class="csBAD3251D"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus clearly disapproved of this action and told Peter to put up his sword, and we see from Luke that Jesus healed the ear of this servant (Luke 22:51). Jesus told Peter that He needed to drink the cup that His Father had prepared for Him; He submissively drank the cup of woe pressed to His lips by the Father&rsquo;s hand. Hebrews 5:8 &ldquo;Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs1C8354B1"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs32E2DBB8"><span class="csE613E19A">63</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD9B7E46A"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csCBE59BA4"><span class="csB0E2188C">II. Trial by the Jews 18:12-14, 19-24</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the other three Gospels, we only have record of Jesus&rsquo; appearance before Caiaphas, but here in the book of John we have the singular account of Him appearing before Annas, who was the father in law of Caiaphas and who had previously been high priest. Besides these two Jewish hearings, we also know that Jesus was tried by Herod once and Pilate twice. Jesus was tossed about by the world. This is a tactic of men seeking help from others to disprove Jesus. Jesus&rsquo; life, doctrine and claims were cast back and forth in the minds of men who were seeking proof that He was not the Son of God.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is some debate about whom the high priest is that is confronting Jesus in verses 19-23. If the translation of verse 24 is taken to be correct, then it is assumed that this conversation is with Caiaphas after, &ldquo;Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.&rdquo; If this is taken as true, then we have no details of what happened when Jesus was before Annas. Some believe that Annas did not even want to have a hearing with Jesus and immediately sent Him to his son in law. There are others that say the verse should have been more accurately translated, &ldquo;Now Annas sent him...&rdquo; and that this conversation was actually before Jesus went to Caiaphas. Since the content of these verses is unique to the book of John, then it is possible for it to be attributed to the man, Annas, who is also unique to the book. Either case is possible and who asked these questions to Jesus is not as important as what Jesus&rsquo; answers were.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">From the other Gospels we see that Jesus was not alone before Caiaphas, but the Sanhedrin was also present (Matt. 26:57; Mark 14:53; Luke 22:66) and that they tried in vain to find two witnesses to agree against Him (Matthew 26:59-61; Mark 14:55-59). Though no two witnesses could agree, Caiaphas asked Jesus what He had to say about all the accusations, but Jesus did not give him an answer. Caiaphas then asked Him directly if He was the Son of God and Jesus told him that he spoke correctly and that He was the Son of God. Caiaphas was enraged at this and rent his garment. This was a part of the Jewish act of repentance (II Sam. 13:31; Ezra 9:5). He declared that because Jesus Himself proclaimed that He was the Son of God, which they thought to be an act of blasphemy, then they did not need any more witnesses. He then sent Jesus to Pilate to be judged by Roman law.</span></p><p class="csD939E0EF"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.Denial by Peter 18:15-18, 25-27</span></p><p class="cs61DA5B56"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peter was so confident at the Last Supper that he would never deny Jesus and that he would even die following Him if that would be what it would take (John 14:36), but we see Peter so afraid that he would loose his life by being associated with Jesus that he was fearful of a little servant girl and he denied Jesus three times. The problem is that Peter was relying on his flesh and his own ability, which will always fail in the face of sever persecution (Job 8:13, 14). We can always be in the place of victory and success if we depend on the power of God (II Cor. 2:14).</span></p><p class="cs927D4F50"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A.

		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Matthew and Mark record that the next accusation against Peter was made by a woman, but Luke states that it was a man. This is likely because it was a group conversation among those around the fire and there were several people that made questions to Peter. John agrees with this theory by stating &ldquo;they&rdquo; instead of either a man or woman.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peter could not cover his secret by his simple denials, for his accent was certainly that of a Galilaean. There was also a man present that was a relative of Malchus, whose ear Peter had cut off in the garden. Peter got angry because of all these people that recognized that he was one of the twelve. He was probably afraid that Caiaphas would hear of it and that he too would be tried and die along with Jesus. He was so angry that he began to curse and swear that he never even knew Jesus.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As soon as these curses had flown from Peter&rsquo;s mouth, a sound was heard in the distance--it was the sound of the rooster crowing. Peter remembered the words that Jesus told him and how He prophesied that it would happen exactly like this. The thoughts were too much for him to bear and he ran out weeping bitterly (Luke 22:62). This was the same as the actions of Judas when he realized what he had done (Matt. 27:3, 4), but they went in separate directions after this initial weeping. Judas went out and hung himself (Matt. 27:5) but Peter went out and truly repented. There may be times when we make mistakes and fail God, but we should not give up for God has the power to restore us and help us get up again (Prov. 24:16).</span></p><p class="cs867EB69B"><span class="csB0E2188C">IV.Trial by Pilate 18:28-40</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

The whip was made of leather straps, at least two pieces made of rough lead, sharp bones or spikes, so that they would cut deeply into the flesh. Jesus&#39; hands were tied to a post above His head as He was scourged. It was the Roman custom for the prisoner to be lashed by the presiding centurion until He was near death (Jewish trials allowed only forty lashes). Jesus&#39; back was, of course, nothing more than an unrecognizable mass of torn flesh.</span></p><p class="csAC4E8519"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Roman soldiers heard that Jesus was supposedly King of the Jews and they wanted to make some sport out of the claim. They made a crown out of braided thorns and put on Him a purple robe, which is the color of royalty.

This frightened Pilate, for up to this point he thought that Jesus only proclaimed to be King of the Jews--it was a much different thing to proclaim yourself to be the Son of God. He brought Jesus back into the judgment hall and asked Him if the accusations of the Jews was true, but Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate tried to threaten Jesus into speaking by reminding Him that He had the power to chose to crucify or release Him. Jesus answered and told him that he had no power to do anything unless it was given him by God. We must remember that all the events that happened that night were of the will of God. Jesus was going to die on the cross not because man chose to put Him there, but it happened because it was God&rsquo;s divine plan for Jesus to die for the sins of man.</span></p><p class="cs1A68A304"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Pilate brought Jesus before the Jews one more time to try to get them to convince them of His innocence, but the Jews insisted that Pilate would not be in good standing with Caesar if he let Jesus go, for Jesus committed insurrection by making Himself a king.

Pilate was surly afraid that he would be accused of trying to overthrow the Roman authority in the land if he tried to help Jesus any more, so he sent Him away to be crucified. Pilate believed in Jesus to an extent otherwise he would not have fought for Him at all, but it was not a true faith, for if it was, he would have been willing to sacrifice not only his position as governor, but also his life.</span></p><p class="cs494860B1"><span class="csB0E2188C">II.

The Jews were bothered by this sign and they went to Pilate and insisted that it should read something to the effect of, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, who called himself King of the Jews&rdquo; since they did not believe that He was their king. Pilate refused to make the change and told them that what he wrote would remain there. This was probably because of the slight belief that he had in Jesus.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After the soldiers stripped Jesus and hung Him on the cross, they took his clothes as a spoil.

Though he believed in Jesus and disagreed with the Jews,</span></p><p class="cs513A5799"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs32E2DBB8"><span class="csE613E19A">67</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csED9E72B1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">he did not openly confess this faith in the Son of God because he feared losing his reputation and being persecuted by the Jews. Joseph had tried to be a secret disciple, but now came a time when he realized that he had to make an open declaration of allegiance to Christ. He did it in the most conspicuous way as he went to the governor and asked for the body of Jesus. If we are going to serve Christ, we are going to have to do it openly and with full confidence no matter what others may do to us or think about us. If we are ashamed of Him, then He will be ashamed of us (Mark 8:38).</span></p><p class="csC7A1BE1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Nicodemus (the same as in chapters three and seven) is another one that up to this point had not made an outright declaration to serve Jesus, and yet now we see him join in with Joseph in the preparation of the body for burial. He brought the spices needed to prepare the body and, with Joseph, he laid the body in the tomb. The tomb was a cave hewn out of a wall of rock that had a large round stone that would be rolled in front of the opening to prevent people from tampering with the body. This was Joseph&rsquo;s own tomb that he had recently prepared for the day that he himself would die, but now he gave it to the One whom he believed (Matt. 27:60).</span></p><p class="cs369DC8DD"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">68</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE9705B90"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="cs6B82A499"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csB0F53F14"><span class="cs133F5153">Chapter 20: He is the Victory over Death</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The capstone of the Gospel of John is authenticated in this twentieth chapter as we see proof of the deity of JESUS CHRIST our LORD, as the Risen Savior. It was one thing for a man to raise someone else from the dead, but it is an even greater thing to raise yourself out of a tomb after three days.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csC9C00EA1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As stated in the last chapter, the body of Jesus had been prepared for burial by Joseph and Nicodemus and laid in a tomb. A careful consideration of the method of burial in those rock-hewn tombs shows that the wrappings of the head were not a part of the wrappings on the body, but was separate. The body was carried, and laid with the feet toward the opening, and the head further in. The body was placed on a stone ledge where there was a slightly elevated place for the head.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some woman had seen the place where Joseph and Nicodemus had laid the body of Jesus, and they went home to prepare spices and ointments to prepare His body for burial. They did not return that day to apply the spices to the body, for it was Friday and at sundown the Sabbath would begin and according to Jewish Law they were not supposed to labor (Luke 23:54-56).</span></p><p class="cs10315C4F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">On Sunday morning, these woman, amongst whom was Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and a woman named Joanna, returned to the tomb to prepare the body (Luke 24:1, 10). As they came to the tomb, there was a great earth quake as an angel came down from heaven and rolled away the stone that covered the door of the tomb. The Roman guards that were in charge of watching the tomb were so frightened that they fainted at the sight of this heavenly visitor (Matt. 28:1-4). The women looked inside the tomb to find that the body of Jesus was already gone and two angels sat where it had been. These angels reminded the women of Jesus&rsquo; prophecy of His rising after three days and told them to go tell the disciples that Jesus was risen (Luke 24:1-8; Mark 16:6-8).</span></p><p class="cs1958B5D5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The women ran to tell the good news to the disciples. Nine of the eleven believed their words to be just idle tales (Luke 24:9-12), but Peter and John immediately headed for the tomb with Mary Magdalene following after them. John, being much younger than Peter, reached the tomb first and looked inside, but he did not enter the tomb. When Peter reached the tomb, he went right in and John went in after him. They saw the grave clothes lying where the body had been, but they did not see that angels that the woman had talked about. They returned home, but Mary Magdalene stood outside of the tomb weeping.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF12A9714"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After some time of standing there weeping, Mary stooped down and looked into the tomb probably to get a last look at the place where her beloved Master had lain. As far as she knew, someone had stolen the body and she might never know where they had taken it. When she looked in she saw the two angels sitting where Jesus had lain. One of the angels asked her why she was crying and Mary responded that it was because she did not know where</span></p><p class="csCD9F9AFF"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs32E2DBB8"><span class="csE613E19A">69</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD3ED548F"><span class="cs9F84D8E5">Deliverance Bible Institute</span></p><p class="csF84C3E78"><span class="csA67FEFA">Gospel of John</span></p><p class="csCF066AD0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus&rsquo; body was.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mary then turned away, possibly because she could not bare to look at the sight any longer and saw a man standing in the garden. Possibly because her eyes were blurry because of her tears or because she did not want to look the man in the face, she did not realize that this man was Jesus, but she thought that He was the man in charge of the garden. Jesus asked Mary why she was crying and what she was looking for in the garden. Mary thought that possibly this &ldquo;gardener&rdquo; took away the body of Jesus or at least saw who had taken Him and asked Him to tell her so that she could properly take care of the body.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus responded by simply saying her name, and He did so in such a way as that now she realized who He was. She cried out, &ldquo;Rabboni&rdquo; and ran to hug Him, but Jesus stopped her by telling her that He had not yet ascended to the Father. He told her to return to the disciples and tell them that she saw Jesus and that He was soon to ascend to heaven.</span></p><p class="cs2D8B7FD0"><span class="csB0E2188C">III.Jesus&rsquo; Appearance to the Disciples 20:19-29</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs287CD588"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The disciples did not know what had happened to the body of Jesus, but they knew that it was nowhere to be found. The Jews had suspicions before this day that the disciples would try to steal the body to make it look like Jesus rose from the dead, and that was why they had Pilate heavily guard the tomb. The disciples thought that the Jews would blame them for the disappearance of the body and they would try to persecute them because of it. All of them except for Thomas secretly gathered themselves in a room and locked all the doors and closed the windows to try to hide from the Jews.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The disciples might have been able to conceal their location from the Jews, but Jesus knew exactly where they were. That very same Sunday evening He appeared in the midst of them even though the doors had been locked. He showed them His hands which had been scared by the nails and His side that had been pierced by the soldiers spear. These things proved that He was genuine and the disciples rejoiced at His presence. Jesus spoke to them words of consolation as well as gave them promises of power.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csED7B39B2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Second Appearance 18:26-29</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After Jesus left the disciples, they went and found Thomas to tell him what had happened. Thomas refused to believe and said that the only way he would was if he saw the wounds himself. Eight days after this, the disciples were once again gathered and Thomas got his wish. Jesus appeared to them again and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; He then told Thomas to feel His hands and side and to believe and not doubt. At this, Thomas replied in faith and said, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Don&rsquo;t wait to see before you believe! Anyone can believe a thing once they have seen it for themselves, but it takes real faith to believe the Word of God when you have not even had as much as a glimpse of its fulfillment.</span></p><p class="csE1548B9D"><span class="csB0E2188C">IV.Purpose of John&rsquo;s Gospel 20:30, 31</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

This can result only when the risen Lord reveals Himself to His own. The proofs of the resurrection had already been given. Notice how chapter twenty-one is introduced, &ldquo;After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the Disciples.&rdquo; The term, &ldquo;Showed Himself&rdquo; can be understood to mean &ldquo;manifested Himself.&rdquo; In the Greek, manifested means to shine forth. When Jesus appeared to the disciples the third time, He showed forth His power and glory one more time to them.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csD9772EEF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Those that were present at this third appearance of Christ to His disciples were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathaniel of Cana in Galilee, and two of the other disciples who are not named.</span></p><p class="csE634825A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peter remarked that he was going fishing, and the other disciples agreed with him and came along. This was more than a fishing trip, but it was a return to the old life of self-service before they yielded to Christ&rsquo;s call to leave their nets. They were called to be fishers of men and yet they returned to the meager trade of catching fish. Peter had a negative influence on the disciples; instead of leading them in the faith of Christ, he was leading them in the doubts of the carnal mind.</span></p><p class="cs1D6E4112"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;That night they caught nothing.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s influence was not spiritually motivated-when they tried fishing in their own strength they accomplished nothing, yet when they were directed by Jesus they had great results. There will certainly be times when we must partake in natural duties to maintain a living, but if we are to do so we must be directed to do so by God.</span></p><p class="csC1D2E611"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The disciples return to land and they saw a fire with coals and fish on the fire. This was a revelation of the all-sufficiency of the Risen Lord and it shows Peter and the disciples their inadequacy and self-shame as they tried to go their way without Him.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

He also notes that he knows that it is not an exhaustive account of Jesus&rsquo; life and ministry. He supposes that it would be an impossible task to compile such a work, for if everything that Jesus did was written down, then the world could not contain all the books it would take.</span></p><p class="cs62B67132"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A Christian should never stop his quest in seeking to know Jesus. That is why Paul, even though he was a great preacher and wrote much of the New Testament, said in Philippians 3:10, &ldquo;That I may know Him.&rdquo; He was not content with his knowledge of the Christ, but he knew that there were depths that he had not yet discovered. He longed to be closer to Him and have a greater relationship with Him. We may have finished this specific study on the Gospel of John, but let it not be the end of your studies of Jesus. There could never be too much knowledge gathered about that Man.</span></p><p class="csA592F7B3"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3723EF3C"><span class="csAEEDF97E">73</span></p></body>
