<h1>Chapter 14: He is the Consoler</h1>
<p>This chapter is a continuation of the conversation that began in chapter thirteen between Christ and His disciples as they ate the Last Supper. In the end of chapter thirteen Jesus told His disciples that He would be leaving them and that they could not immediately come with Him, though they would be permitted later on to follow Him (John 13:36). This chapter is an encouragement to the disciples to keep the faith in the face of Jesus physically leaving them.</p>
<h2>Jesus Assured Them that There Would be a Place of Rest 14:1-4</h2>
<p>As we see Jesus preparing to leave His disciples, we constantly see His compassion towards them. He has a desire that they would continue in His doctrine even though they would no longer be able to behold Him with the carnal eye. Jesus could have spent time railing on them for their faults and eminent failures, but instead He offered great words of consolation, “Let not your heart be troubled” (John 14:1). If they would only believe in Him, then they should have no fear of falling.</p>
<p>In verse two Jesus promises the twelve that in His Father’s house (heaven) there are many mansions and He was going there to prepare a place for those that would follow Him to that celestial destination. He had spent time preparing His disciples and now He was going to prepare a place for them.</p>
<h3>A physical place of rest</h3>
<p>When this life is over we will leave this world of troubles and trials and we will forever be in safety and solitude within the gates of heaven. No longer will we have to wrestle with the flesh, conquer the old nature, or dart the attacks of the devil, but we will forever be in true fellowship with our Lord and Savior in a place that is realer than the earth on which we dwell. Revelation twenty-one gives us a description of the New Jerusalem with all of its splendor that is to be the home of those that have been washed in the blood and have held true to the commandments of God. II Corinthians 5:1 says, “For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.”</p>
<h3>A spiritual place of rest</h3>
<p>As followers of Christ, we not only can look forward to a place of rest off in the future, but we can start to experience that rest now. While our body still face troubles and afflictions, our soul can be in a place of comfort in the Lord.</p>
<h2>Jesus Announced to Them the Way to this Rest 14:5-14</h2>
<p>After being told that they would soon be given a mansion and a life of rest, the disciples wanted to know how they should get to that location and Thomas said, “Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?” (John 14:5). Jesus explained that He was the way to God. There is no other way for a man to find access to the peace of God but through Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Jesus then told them of the relation between Him and the Father and how they are united in one. If they knew and saw Jesus, then they knew and saw the Father because they were one in purpose and nature. Jesus is the express image of the Father (Heb. 1:3; Matt. 11:27), which means that the Father never physically reveals Himself to man, but when God does appear to man, He does it through the person of the Son. Jesus did not say or do anything unless the Father told Him to say or do it (John 5:19; John 8:28).</p>
<p>He then told them that they should believe Him because of this unity with the Father, since if a man truly knew the Father, then he would also know the Son. If they would not believe Him because of that principle, then they should at least believe Him because of the works that He has done. This is similar to the discourse that He told the Pharisees in John 5:36.</p>
<p>He then told them that if they would believe then they would do greater miracles than even He Himself had done. Jesus told them that if they would only ask, then He would give them what ever they requested. If we would ask and believe, then we can see many mighty things accomplished.</p>
<h2>Jesus Affirmed to Them the Giver of this Rest 14:15-31</h2>
<p>Though Jesus was physically leaving the earth He was not leaving His disciples all alone, for He would send to them the Comforter, which is, the Holy Spirit.</p>
