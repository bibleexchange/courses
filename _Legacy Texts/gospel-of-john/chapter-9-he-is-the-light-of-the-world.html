<h1>Chapter 9: He is the Light of the World</h1>

<p>During the introduction of the Gospel of John in chapter one, we see that the world before Christ was alluded to as being in great spiritual darkness (John 1:5) and that Jesus was the light that came to bring a new day to mankind (1:4,9). Here in the ninth chapter we see Jesus give an illustration to prove that He could illuminate mankind by opening the eyes of a man that had been born blind.</p>

<h2>The Blind Man Healed 9:1-7</h2>

<div class="highlights left">
	<h1>#7 Master of Misfortune</h1>

	<p>It is not because the blind man sinned nor that his parents were specially sinful, but his misfortune was merely because there was sin in the world. When life doesn't make sense, Jesus is the Master of our misfortunes! He can take a bad situation and turn it around.</p>
</div>

<p>On a Sabbath day while Jesus was still in Jerusalem after the Feast of Tabernacles, He passed by this blind man as he sat, likely begging for alms just so that he could survive. When the disciples saw him, they asked Jesus, “Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?” Many times when something bad happens in a person’s life, people are quick to assume that it is the judgment of God on that individual for something that they did wrong. Many feel that if a person is poor and afflicted, then they are a sinner, and at the same time, we often equate prosperity and health with the blessing of God. This is how Job’s “comforters” felt in their hearts and expressed to Job; surely if Job were righteous then no evil would befall him (Job 4:7; 8:20). It is true that God does at times use physical judgment upon men (i.e. Elymas the sorcerer, who became blind because of his sin, see Acts 13:8-11) and He also blesses some men, such as Abraham, with physical goods as a reward for being obedient. We must realize though that all men that are being afflicted are not necessarily being punished by God, nor are all prosperous men being blessed by Him. We have seen both rich and healthy men that are wicked and poor and sickly men that are righteous—physical condition is no indicator of inward condition. The disciples were wrong to assume that it was because of any man’s sins that this man was born without the ability to see.</p>
<p>Jesus clarified that it was neither because of his sins, nor the sins of his parents that he was born blind, but he was in that condition that “the works of God should be made manifest in him.” Jesus further explained that then was the time for Him to perform these works, for the night was coming when “no man can work.” He knew that soon He would no longer be physically on the earth and so He had to be quick to obey the Father and do what He wanted Him to do.</p>
<p>Jesus then made the statement, “As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” Jesus will always be the only true light of the world, but now that He is now longer physically walking among men, it is the Christians’ duty to bear record of the light and thus be lights ourselves to manifest the glory of God (John 1:8; Matt. 5:14).</p>
<p>After He had spoken, Jesus again set forth to reveal that He had to power to illuminate mankind. He spat on the ground and made clay, which He put on the idle eyes of the man and then commanded him to go to the pool of Siloam and wash the clay of from his eyes. At this time Jesus had not promised the man sight, yet the man went forth in obedience and did as Jesus commanded. When the clay was removed, it was one of the most eventful moments for that man—for he could now see! It was not the clay that healed the man’s eyes, and neither was it the water of the pool, but it was the man’s faith in Jesus’ word that made him physically whole.</p>
<h2>The Blind Man Questioned 9:8-23</h2>
<p>The healing of the blind man caused much commotion around Jerusalem. The neighbors that lived around him and the travelers that passed by him all wondered if this really was the same invalid to whom they were so accustomed. Their curiosity got the best of them and they outright asked the man how he had been healed. When the man recounted his healing, the people asked where Jesus was; perhaps there were others that wanted to be healed, or likely it was just the curiosity of humans to want to know all they can about unusual events. The man was not able to answer their questions, since he could not see when he encountered Jesus and thus did not know which direction He was heading and nor could he even give them a description of Him.</p>
<p>Since it was the Sabbath day when the man got healed, some of the people thought that the religious leaders should know about the offense and thus brought the man to the Pharisees, who also asked the man how he was healed. The Pharisees were angered when they heard what Jesus had done and they declared that He could not be a man of God since He did not observe the holy day of rest. There were others that disagreed with this ruling, for they felt that no man could perform such miracles unless He was a man of God.</p>
<p>Now that all parties understood how the man had been healed, the Pharisees wanted to know about the man that healed the blind man, to which the blind man asserted the Jesus was a prophet. The Jews did not believe his proclamation about Jesus, nor did they really believe that this man had really been blind, so they called for his parents to come for interrogation. They wanted to know if this was really their son, if he had really been blind, and if he was blind, how he received his sight.</p>
<p>We have before mentioned that there was fear amongst the Hebrew people around Jerusalem about speaking about Jesus and especially about testifying that He was the Christ because of what the religious leaders would say or do to them. It was because of this fear that the parents vaguely answered the questions, and while they confirmed that this was truly their son, they did not give any information of how he was healed. They asserted that since he was a full-grown man, he was then able to testify for himself.</p>
<h2>The Blind Man Accused 9:24-34</h2>
<p>The second time that the Pharisees spoke with the former-blind man they did not ask him what he personally thought of Jesus, but rather they commanded him to “Give God praise” and confess that Jesus was a sinner since He healed on the Sabbath day. The man would not conform to their wishes, and, while he admitted that he did not know the condition of Jesus’ soul, he also confessed that he knew one thing—namely, he was bind, but now he could see.</p>
<p>The Pharisees again asked him how he was healed and the men responded with more vigor this time as he said, “I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?” The Pharisees were ignited by the thought of even considering becoming a disciple of Jesus and they haughtily retorted that the man may become a follower of this Galilean, yet they would never be anyone’s disciple besides Moses.</p>
<p>They knew from the Scriptures that Moses heard from God, but they said that they did not know where Jesus even came from (even though He repeatedly told them that He was not of this world).</p>
<p>The blind man argued that it should not matter that they did not know the history or genealogy of Jesus, but the fact that He healed Him should prove that He is of God. He knew that the Pharisees believed that God would not hear the prayer of a sinful man, why then would they not believe in this miracle worker that was obviously blessed by God? He ended his defense by declaring that, “If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.” The Pharisees were angered by this confession, proclaimed the man to be a sinner, and excommunicated him from the synagogue.</p>
<h2>The Blind Man Enlightened 9:35-41</h2>
<p>The man may have been an outcast among men, but that does not mean that God gave up on him. Jesus found him and asked him a heart-searching question, “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?” The man implied by his response that he did not even know who the Son of God was, but if he did know, then he would believe. Jesus told him that He was the One that was standing before him and talking with him. The man responded in faith and said, “Lord, I believe!” and he began to worship Christ.</p>
<p>He had received his physical sight earlier when he washed at the pool of Siloam, but now he received his spiritual sight. That is the reason that Jesus came into the world—to open the eyes of a man’s soul that had been blinded by sin. A man can enter the gates of heaven with a physical defect, but if there is any blemish on his soul then he will never tread the golden streets.</p>
