<p><span lang="en">The study of the Holy Ghost is referred to as pneumatology. &quot;Pneuma&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;-ology&quot; is the study of a particular subject. The English words &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;ghost&quot; are renderings of the Greek word &quot;pneuma&quot;. The King James translators used both of these words to translate the one Greek word &quot;pneuma&quot; which literally means wind or breath. The gifts of the Spirit have already been covered in Doctrine 2 so they will not be discussed again in this course.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
