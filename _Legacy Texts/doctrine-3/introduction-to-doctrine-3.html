<h3><span lang="en">Personal</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>

<h3><span lang="en">True</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en">Truth is absolute, but our understanding of Truth grows clearer the more we lend our heart and mind to the Holy Ghost and His Word. This course is written knowing that ongoing study with its additions&#44; revisions&#44; enlargements&#44; and modifications is necessary.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en">Unifying</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en">It is important that our study be motivated by a passion for the Scriptures and our Lord. Any other motive will cause our learning only to be divisive and destructive. Any truth learned and applied is an awesome blessing and no cause for boasting. Remember that because our knowledge and understanding is fluid we must use much grace when Christian's disagree on doctrinal points. No person or church has a monopoly on God and it is dangerous to study and present the Scriptures as if you are the only one who is right.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Ephesians 4:3,13 -- Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
