##0001###The Non-Moral Attributes of God
##0002###Explanation of "Non-Moral Attributes"
##0003###Attributes
##0004###The qualities that belong to the substance and constitute a description of it. A description of the nature or qualities of a person
##0005###"For example, God says of  Himself, 'I am holy'; therefore we can say, God is holy. Holiness, then is an attribute of God, because holiness is a quality that we may attribute or apply to Him. -- Doctrine Book "
##0006###Non-moral
##0007###Non-moral attributes are those truths of the Divine essence that do not involve moral qualities. It is an inherent quality without regard to right or wrong. Non-moral is not the same as "un-moral" or "immoral".
##0008###Omnipresence
##0009###The Divine presence in relation to His creatures (Jer. 23:23-24; Acts 17:27-28)
##0010###Psalm 139:7-12 -- Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. 9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.  11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.  12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
