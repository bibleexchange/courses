<h1><span lang="en">THE PRE INCARNATE CHRIST</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h1>
<p><span lang="en">The incarnation refers to Christ taking on the form of a man. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Philippians 2:7 -8 -- But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h2><span lang="en">Christ existed before He became flesh.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h2>
<h3><span lang="en">Christ was not known by the name Jesus until His birth in Bethlehem.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matthew 1:21 -- And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h3><span lang="en">In the beginning was the Word. The Word of God reveals to us that Christ always was and existed in the beginning with God. -- John 1:1</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<h3><span lang="en">Jesus had glory with the Father before the world was created.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 17:5 -- And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">John 8:58 -- Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h2><span lang="en">Old Testament appearances of Christ.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h2>
<blockquote><span lang="en">John 1:18 -- No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">According to the context of this Scripture no man hath seen God the Father at any time. This would include the time period of the Old Testament. The Father reveals Himself to humanity through the Son in both Old Testament and New Testament times. Even though in the Old Testament Christ had not yet been manifested in the flesh, He still existed with the Father and appears in the Old Testament to humanity as God. And since we know from Scripture that no man hath seen God the Father at any time these Old Testament appearances of God could only have been Christ who is the eternal declaration of the Father.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en">Captain of the host of the LORD.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Joshua 5: 14-15  And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">This was Holy ground because the Christ who is God was standing on it. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en">The Angel of the Lord.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en">Throughout the Old Testament the Angel of the Lord is ascribed the attributes of Deity.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>

<p><span lang="en">Jehovah God appears to Abraham as described in this passage of Scripture. We understand from John 1:18 that Abraham could not have seen God the Father. The only logical conclusion is that Abraham met with the Christ who is man's declaration of God in both the Old and New Testaments.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
