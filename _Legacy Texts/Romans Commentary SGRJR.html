		<p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The playwright once asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; In the first verse of Romans chapter one the author is identified with the name &ldquo;Paul.&rdquo; In this name is a wonderful testimony of the matchless and powerful name of Jesus. The author was once known as &ldquo;Saul of Tarsus&rdquo; who was a man of great education and emotion. Saul was on his way to Damascus with papers authorizing him to imprison and harm Christians, but on that road a light shined bright from Heaven and Jesus revealed himself to Saul and shortly after that Saul&rsquo;s name was changed to Paul. Paul means: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">(&quot;pause&quot;); to stop (transitively or intransitively), i.e. restrain, quit, desist, come to an end:--cease, leave, refrain.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Saul was headed 180 degrees full speed in the wrong direction and Jesus brought his threatenings and hatred against the people of God to an abrupt pause and in that moment Paul yielded to the Lord and was never the same again: in name and nature. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A servant Of Jesus Christ</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1BE4A2E0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The word servant in this verse is the Greek word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">doulos</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> meaning:</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> bondservant (one bound by honorable ties), a servant of choice,a slave by reason of &nbsp;love</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The writers of the New Testament used the title &ldquo;servant&rdquo; often as a name by which they expected to be known. Christ commanded His disciples in Mark 10:44, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&ldquo;And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Paul&rsquo;s writing of Romans was with great authority not because of his credentials, but because of His Master Whose ambassador he was. Paul made his plea known based on Christ&rsquo;s Lordship and the blessing of the Believer&rsquo;s voluntary service to Him. Paul&rsquo;s heart and spirit rang in trueness with John the Baptist&rsquo;s declaration and was a world apart from the theologians and &ldquo;Doctors of Divinity&rdquo; who strive for masteries. John the Baptist declared speaking of Christ in John 3:30, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The heart of a true servant exalts its Lord and not itself.</span></p><p class="cs1BE4A2E0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Called to be an apostle</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">My pastor has often declared that as a man called to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to be elected President of the United States would be a demotion and disappointment. An apostle is a messenger and an ambassador of God Almighty.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs18E70CFE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Separated Unto the Gospel of God</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Absolute consecration is spoken of in these words. Paul was set apart to preach one message only one message. Paul did not declare a message that exalted himself nor did he do a work to further his position in the eyes of men. Paul declares the he as a believer and therefore so should we be only for the Lord&rsquo;s use and not for our own petty causes. </span></p><p class="cs7A4E1108"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs7A4E1108"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="csC1DF526">

God has given us a promise by His prophets. This promise has been recorded in the Holy Scriptures. This promise which is the Gospel is concerning God&rsquo;s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. The Gospel or </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Good News</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is in its entirety a message concerned with Christ.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul declares three things concerning this Christ of the Gospel:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

John 1:17 echo&rsquo;s part of the fact, &ldquo;For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. </span><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="cs2AC6949F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The purpose of these gifts is not for the exalting of the flesh, but for the exalting of God&rsquo;s name: &ldquo;for obedience to the faith among all nations, for His name.&rdquo; God has bestowed grace and called us that many more might come to Christ and glorify God.</span></li><li class="cs2AC6949F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In verse six, Paul reaffirms two facts: We are AMONG all nations and we also as Paul declared he was, the CALLED of Jesus Christ.

		<p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Verses 10-13 Paul speaks of his request to God. Paul&rsquo;s desire in visiting them is for the purpose of imparting unto them spiritual gifts that they may be ESTABLISHED. Paul did not push others down to exalt himself a little higher, but he sought and worked for there to be MUTUAL faith, equal experience, in and with God for Paul knew it was not a one man show. If they were to excel they could be a great comfort to him and to others in the faith as workers together. Many times Paul planned on visiting Rome, but each time he was prevented. Though hindered over and over, Paul&rsquo;s desire was that he might have fruit among his brethren according to the flesh as he had among the Gentiles.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Verses 14,15 Paul acknowledges the divisions in the hearts of the people of his day with the terms &lsquo;You AND the Gentiles,&rsquo; yet, he makes no distinction when it comes to for whom the Gospel is determined and to whom he must preach the glad tidings. He says it matters not Greek, Jew, Barbarian, wise, or even unwise, but that he, Paul, is ready to preach to them. Paul was indebted to Greek and Jew, there was no difference because the Gospel makes no difference, but is for both the Greek and the Jew.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In Verses 16,17,18, Paul addresses:</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csD71C56D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul is ready to preach to whosoever unashamed because he knows beyond all doubt that the GOSPEL OF CHRIST is the POWER of God unto salvation to the Jew first and also to the Greek. There is salvation by no other, but in that holy name, Jesus. (Acts 4:12)</span></p><p class="csD71C56D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csA80AA199"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Righteousness of God v.17</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csD71C56D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In that Gospel is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is written the just shall live by faith. The revelation of God&rsquo;s character and nature is not something apart and separate from the Gospel, but is bound up in the Gospel that we as hearers may LIVE. This life and righteousness is not received all at once, but is revealed to us from faith to faith. As we obey and do as we have received, God gives us more and this continual progression in righteousness is the path of life of the JUST. The key to maintaining our experience with God is progression. Paul declares in Hebrews 6:1, &ldquo;Let us go on.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csD71C56D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csD71C56D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The revelation of God&rsquo;s wrath is upon those that </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">hold the truth in unrighteousness.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The conclusion of this chapter continues on describing this people who are guilty and worthy of the wrath of God. They are without excuse because 1) God has manifested Himself to them (v.19), 2) Creation itself clearly declares the things of God (v.20), and 3) they once knew God but did not glorify Him as God (v.21). The great good they once had is now turned to great corruption. Their corruption and guilt is clear and the judgment is set. &ldquo;&hellip;They which commit such things are worthy of death...&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs950B3624">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs950B3624">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs950B3624">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs950B3624">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs338C08B3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csF09445ED">Chapter Two</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs950B3624">&nbsp;&ldquo;Knowledge of the Law&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The man that condemns another for breaking the law while at the same time he as well breaks the law is without a defense. This man condemns himself with the words he intends to condemn another. We see here the inconsistency of human judgment and man&rsquo;s biased decision-making, but in verse two it is declared that God&rsquo;s judgment is according to truth against not just this group or that group, but against those that commit &ldquo;such things.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s judgment is according to truth, unbiased, and absolute. A man may feel self-confident and sure of his own place at the time he judges another, but without a doubt he is without a defense--inexcusable--when the judgment of God comes.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Men too often respond so vainfully to the mercy of God. When God does not bring instantaneous judgment men often imagine they have escaped and have &ldquo;gotten away&rdquo; with it, but in so doing they despise God&rsquo;s goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering patience. They are without a flicker of understanding that the reprieve they enjoy is the goodness of God to lead them to and provide space for REPENTANCE. God is not interested in simply destroying men in anger, but His desire is that men would be saved and that could mean for some by as it were fire. </span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul clearly explains that while the hard and impenitent heart imagines vainly that he has escaped instead of taking advantage of the mercy and goodness of God he to the opposite effect stores up, treasures up, against himself the wrath of God. In a time when pardon is provided, the hard hearted and impenitent store up only more wrath and condemnation. They heap up treasures of destruction over a promise of treasures of righteousness. For God is not blind and neither has He gone soft. God is longsuffering, but He also will judge righteously EVERY man according to HIS DEEDS.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The righteous judgment of God will reward the obedient with eternal life, but will judge the disobedient with tribulation and anguish. Again, we see here were Paul emphasises that there is no difference between Jew or Greek in regards to God. God will not judge the Jew one way and the Greek another, but will judge every MAN (Jew or Gentile) ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS for &ldquo;there is no respect of persons with God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Paul presents a truth in verse twelve that he later explains in his letter. Those that have not the law will die without the law, but the law will judge those that have sinned in the law. It is not enough to know about the law, but you must DO it. Does this mean that a Gentile cannot be justified because he has not been given the law that he may obey it as the Jews have? Absolutely not. The Gentile may do by nature the things contained in the law without ever having it because God has placed in every man a conscience whereas long as men guard it and keep it are a law unto themselves in the proper and true sense of the phrase. This law is written in their HEARTS and their conscience bears witness to it.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Jew that boasts in the law because he knows so much and is confident as a guide for the blind is blind himself. That is, he believes he knows the way, and no one else does. He stands in this place of great self-confidence because he KNOWS the law, but THERE IS NO RIGHTEOUSNESS IN KNOWING THE LAW. Paul speaks directly to emphasize his point, &ldquo;Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?&rdquo; Paul is clearly presenting that just as the Gentile is guilty because he DOES NOT the law and not that because he has not the law as the Jews do, so also are the Jews not pardoned from their guilt because they have and know the law, but they as well are judged for not DOING the law. Their self-confidence is fool hearty for they are as the blind leading the blind. They who are known in the world abroad as God&rsquo;s chosen people bring their God dishonor and the Gentiles blaspheme God through them. Their testimony is evil for they boast in KNOWING the law, but dishonor God in BREAKING the law. The issue for justification is not over if a man was born Jew or Gentile, whether he has been circumcised or not, or if he has the law or not, but has his HEART been circumcised? Has the hardness, impenitence, and sin been cut out of his heart? </span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In conclusion, the Jew that boasts in the Law and condemns the Gentile is without a defense for he has broken the law himself. For he is not a Jew which &nbsp;is one OUTWARDLY (born of the seed and line of Abraham), but he is a Jew which is one INWARDLY whose circumcision is that of the heart and whose praise is not of men, but of God. Here we can see how that a Gentile may be grafted in, not as an earthly Jew, but as a spiritual Jew who is a DOER and not a hearer only. We as well see how that a Jew&rsquo;s justification rests not in his bloodline or knowledge of the law, but he as well must be a DOER of the law. Every Jew needs to add to his physical circumcision a circumcision of the heart through repentance and a changed life. </span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csF09445ED">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csF09445ED">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csF09445ED">Chapter Three</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csF09445ED">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="cs950B3624">&ldquo;The Law Explained&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I.

Now, a person hearing this might begin to question, &ldquo;Then is there no advantage to being a Jew or of circumcision?&rdquo; The Jews advantage is this: unto them were committed the oracles (or, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">utterance</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) of God. God&rsquo;s revealed and written will was given to Israel by God through His prophets. This awesome privilege is their advantage.

All men are guilty and under the law. The law silences any defense for all men are guilty before God and under the law. The law rules and speaks UNBENDING as an iron rod declaring man&rsquo;s guilt.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">IV. The Apex of the Law vv. 20-30</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We see in these verses the true purpose and effect of the Law and the excelling of another law&mdash;faith. The Law reaches its maximum potential and capacity in its judgment on sin. It is unable to justify or to make righteous, but is limited to the effect of bringing the KNOWLEDGE OF SIN.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The righteousness of God is manifested without the law by a law that excels the old law. The righteousness of God is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all them that believe. This law makes no difference between the Jew and Gentile. As under the law ALL are guilty, so by grace through faith ALL may be made righteous. This provision is not cheap or simply a &ldquo;free love&rdquo;, but was purchased, REDEEMED, by the shed blood and laid down life of Christ. God set Christ in our place to die and we by faith receive the righteousness of God and the remission of sins that are past. As God is righteous in taking vengeance upon those under the law, He is equally righteous in &nbsp;justifying those that believe in Jesus for Jesus took their place, become their &lsquo;propitiation&rsquo; (the price of atonement.) All men, Jews and Gentiles, Circumcision and Uncircumcision are justified through faith and not by the deeds of the law. There is ONE God Who justifies only ONE way&mdash;by faith.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">V.

Faith is not a removing or destroying of the law, but is truly a work that excels the law, a great pillar built upon the law. The law brings the knowledge of sin to a man, and that man who has recognized his condition may be justified by faith. Without the law that man would have no knowledge of sin, and therefore would see no need for justification, redemption, or atonement. The law which was once broken is established through faith in the substitutionary work of Christ for it has been SATISFIED.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csF09445ED">Chapter Four</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="cs950B3624">&ldquo;The Righteousness of Faith&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csBAF33195">Question:</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? v.1</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csBAF33195">Answer:</span></p><p class="cs13FB790C"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. v.13</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Verse two is in response to the question found in chapter 3 verse 27, &ldquo;Where is boasting then?&rdquo; If Abraham was justified by works, his keeping of the law, then he would have grounds to boast.

Did Abraham have grounds to boast in himself of his salvation? </span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;What saith the Scripture?&rdquo; (Also used in Galatians 4:30.) This is not merely a question, but is and should be the answer to all questions individuals might have. Truth is not open to debate, or to be compromised to meet the fancy of some group, but is absolute and permanent in its independence of man&rsquo;s preferences. Simply, Truth is &ldquo;stand alone.&rdquo; Truth belongs to no particular denomination, club, or assembly. Truth is fixed and the precious treasure for which we sell all to possess. Man affixes himself to truth, and does not mold truth to him. Also, the Word of God is that by which all will be judged (Deut. 31:26; Rev. 20:15).

We cannot come to God because we are born in sin, but through faith in Jesus Christ we gain access into His grace.

These are sources of sustenance, and a dead man has no life to sustain. The living man eats with the purpose of maintaining life.

A man may live a full life filled with drunkenness and all kinds of selfishness and sin, but when he dies, his spirit leaves his body and that body no longer contains life. There rests the same hands that raised the bottle, the same feet that ran quickly to mischief, but now being dead and the spirit gone it is emptied of all evidence of life good or bad. The Believer&rsquo;s situation is similar, but not exact. The Believer&rsquo;s situation is similar in that in being crucified with Christ, he no longer contains that old life (2 Cor. 4:7). All things have become new, as an infant child just born, perfect. The Believer&rsquo;s situation extends beyond the condition of natural death in that he is dead to sin, but alive to righteousness. This is a dual condition where an individual&rsquo;s flesh is crucified and his spirit is made alive to walk in newness of life. If we are dead to sin and alive to Christ then our life now has no properties similar to our old life. A magnet cannot attract aluminum because their properties are such there is no possible way for the two to interact.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075" style="tab-stops:center 216pt right 432pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075" style="tab-stops:center 216pt right 432pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Vs. 12-20</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075" style="tab-stops:center 216pt right 432pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Old habits die hard,&rdquo; or so the saying goes.

Death looses a man or wife from their spouse and so death of the flesh looses an individual from the law of sin. We cannot serve God while in the flesh for we are bound by the law of nature to sin. The flesh is the enemy of God and cannot be made subservient to Him. The only freedom from sin is to be found in death of the carnal man.

Not everyone that is born a part of the nationality of Israel are a part of that spiritual Israel. The children of the Israel are only children of the flesh, but the children of the promise are the children of God.

While the boys were in the womb, before they did any good or any evil, the prophecy was given that the elder would serve the younger. This was to the purpose that the election of God might stand by God&rsquo;s calling and not by works of men. Predestination is not an unrighteous act for God may justify whom He may and condemn whom he desires. All the good works of men cannot make them children of the promise, but that condition is dependent upon God showing mercy. It is important to make remark concerning how predestination works. Predestination and election is based upon God&rsquo;s foreknowledge. He knows the end from the beginning He knows who will receive and who will reject before they are even born. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Romans 8:29.

Branham, observing no change in the man, asked one final question. &ldquo;Do you any intention that at any time in the future you may serve God?&rdquo; The man arrogantly sounded a resounding, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Branham told him that he saw no reason for him to continue living then, and snapped his fingers and the man died instantly in the driver&rsquo;s seat. Some are given 100 years and others only a few.

Paul intercedes for the salvation of Israel. Paul is not spending his prayer time trying to heap up treasures for himself, but he is a man with a burden for others and especially here for Israel. There is a great need in our day for people to recognize the serious and destitute condition of others and do their part to reach them for Christ. When Jerusalem would be besieged each family was being responsible to defend a portion of the wall. As casualties occurred, throughout the course of the battle, some sections would be seriously depleted of defense or even completely removed of it. It is in this setting that Ezekiel 22:30 makes its plea for people to recognize the need and step in where others have fallen and make up the gap in the walll. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The Lord found none in Ezekiel&rsquo;s day. Will he find one in ours? There is a great price to pay. This kind of life is a crucified life and not governed by the self-will, but the very heartbeat must be the heartbeat of God. The heartbeat of God is for the salvation of the lost. Let us stand in the gap and intercede for our people and then for all people. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&hellip;Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Acts 1:8. The progression from Jerusalem to ultimately the uttermost part of the earth is very key.

			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Hath God cast away His people? v. 1</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Absolutely not is the answer. Paul points to the fact that he has communion with God and is of Israel a Benjamite. Israel whom God foreknow is not cast way and utterly forsaken by Him. She has turned her back on Him.</span></p><p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Wot ye not what the Scripture saith of Elias? v. 2</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Elijah makes a different kind of intercession from Paul&rsquo;s in Romans ten. In I Kings 19:10, Elijah testifies against Israel saying that they all were evil and none righteous remained but himself. Even God&rsquo;s prophet didn&rsquo;t see any hope of revival and was ready to cast them off.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">But What saith the answer of God unto him? v. 4</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The answer is that Elijah was not alone. GOD ALWAYS HAS HIS REMNANT. Paul parallels that with his day saying that there was yet a remnant according to the election of grace. There are those Jews whom the Lord in His foreknowledge knows have not yet returned, but they will in due time. God knowing some will answer the call, for the sake of that some, God has not forsaken His people.</span></p><p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">What then? v. 7</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If it were by works then Israel should be forsaken by God, but this election is by grace. Therefore, Israel has not obtained what they look for, but the election hath obtained it. This evidences the fact that God is still dealing with His people even though Israel as a whole is blinded.</span></p><p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Have they stumbled that they should fall? v.11</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;The failure of the Jews has led to the opening of the door to the Gentiles.&rdquo;&mdash;James Thompson. The salvation of Gentiles in return is a spur to the Jews to get it right. Though they have failed, Israel may return and is not without hope. (They must come by the way of grace, and not the law.)</span></p><p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? v.12</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Gentiles should glory in that they have been engrafted, but not in the fact that Israel has fallen. As the Gentiles have benefited from their fall, they would much more benefit now by their repentance and return to God.</span></p><p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="7" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? v.15</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Jewish people are the greatest testimony of the reality of the Gospel. They are living evidence of the accuracy of Scripture.</span></p><ol start="8" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB6186E4C"><span class="csE2DF19C1">How much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree? v. 24 &nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is not impossible for Israel to be graffed in again for God is able to restore Israel which is cut off from the branch if He has graffed in a foreign branch to the olive tree&mdash;the Gentiles.</span></p><p class="cs1487A128"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="9" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
