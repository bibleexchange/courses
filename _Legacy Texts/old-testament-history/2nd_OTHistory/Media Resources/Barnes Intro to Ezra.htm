			<td><font SIZE="3"><font color="#800000">Though the Books of Ezra 
			and Nehemiah were undoubtedly regarded as one book in two parts, 
			both by the Jewish Church and by the early Christian Fathers, yet 
			the judgment of modern criticism that Ezra and Nehemiah were 
			originally two distinct works, seems to be, on the whole, deserving 
			of acceptance.</font><p><font color="#800000">The object of the 
			writer of Ezra is to give an account of the return from the 
			captivity, and of the subsequent fortunes of the Palestinian Jews 
			until the eighth year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, 457 B.C. - The 
			matters to which he directs attention are only three:</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">(1) The number, family, and (to some 
			extent) the names of those who returned from Babylonia with Ezra and 
			with Zerubbabel Ezra 2; 8:1-20;</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">(2) The rebuilding of the temple and the 
			circumstances connected with it </font></font>
			<font SIZE="3" COLOR="#800000">Ezr 1:1-11</font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#800000">; 
			Ezra 3–7; and</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">(3) The misconduct of the returned Jews 
			with respect to mixed marriages, and the steps taken by Ezra in 
			consequence Ezra 9–10.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">The Book of Ezra is made up of two 
			completely distinct sections:</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">(a) In Ezra 1–6, the writer treats of the 
			return from the captivity and of the events following (538-516 
			B.C.), or a period of 23 years. It belongs to the time when 
			Zerubbabel was governor of Judaea, Jeshua was high priest, and 
			Zechariah and Haggai were prophets.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">(b) Ezra 7–10. This relates the commission 
			given to Ezra by Artaxerxes in the seventh year of his reign (458 
			B.C.), the journey of Ezra to Jerusalem, and his proceedings there 
			(April 458 B.C. - April 457 B.C.). There is thus a gap of 57 years 
			between the first section of the book and the second; from which it 
			appears that the writer of the second portion cannot well have been 
			a witness of the events recorded in the first.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">Jewish tradition ascribes the authorship of 
			the whole book to Ezra. Modern critics generally admit that Ezra was 
			the original and sole author of the entire second section Ezra 7–10, 
			but consider him the compiler of the first Ezra 1–6 from state 
			documents, national records, and lists. It is probable that the Book 
			of Ezra was composed soon after the arrangements with respect to the 
			mixed marriages had been completed; i. e. in 457 or 456 B.C..</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">In character the Book of Ezra is 
			historical, and like Chronicles, it lays great stress on the 
			externals of religion; it gives special prominence to the Levites, 
			and exhibits a genealogical bias; it lays down very distinctly the 
			general principle of a special Providence </font></font>
			<font SIZE="3" COLOR="#800000">Ezr 8:22</font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#800000">; 
			and it applies this principle to particular points of the history 
			not unfrequently.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">In style, Ezra more resembles Daniel than 
			any other book of Scripture, always excepting Chronicles. This may 
			be accounted for by these two writers being both Babylonian Jews. 
			The work contains also a considerable number of proper names and 
			words which are either known or suspected to be Persian, and 
			altogether, the language is such as might have been looked for under 
			the circumstances of the time, when the contact into which the Jews 
			had been brought with the Babylonians and the Persians had naturally 
			introduced among them a good many foreign words and modes of speech.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#800000">The text of Ezra is not in a good 
			condition. The general bearing of the narrative is, however, 
			untouched by slight blemishes which affect chiefly such minute 
			points as the names and numbers of those who returned from the 
			captivity, the weight and number of the sacrificial vessels, and the 
			like.</font></font></td>
