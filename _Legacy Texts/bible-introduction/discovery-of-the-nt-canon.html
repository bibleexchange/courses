	<h2>There is some historical account as to the acceptance of the New Testament Canon.</h2> 
<h3>The first New Testament books to be assembled together were the Epistles of Paul. A collection of Paul's Epistles was in circulation at the beginning of the second century. Ignatius a leader in the second century referred toPaul's epistles as Scripture. A collection of the Pauline epistles existed atthe time Polycarp wrote to the Philippians and when Ignatius wrote his seven letters to the churches of Asia Minor about AD 115.</h3> 
<h3>The four Gospels were collected together in a compiled format sometime in the earlier part of the second century. The exact date when the Four Gospels were collected together is unknown. It is generally agreed that they must have been collected together and accepted before AD 170,because the four canonical Gospels are used by Tatian, a church leader, in his harmony of the Gospels written in AD 170. IrenÃ¦us , in his work "Against Heresies" (A. 182-88),names the four Gospels of the New Testament and refers to them as Scripture.</h3> 

<h3>The four Gospels referred to as The Gospel and the Pauline Epistles referred to as the Apostle were in circulation as separate collections in the early years of the second century. These two parts were to be connected by the Book of Acts which brought the two collections together into one collection of books. This was the beginning stages of the collecting of the New Testament books into one complete Canon.</h3> 
<h3>Before AD 200 the Epistles of Paul, theGospels, Acts, I Peter and I John were recognized as Scripture by the Christian church. The writings of Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian indicate the acceptance of these books as inspired and Canonical and accorded an authority equal to that of the Old Testament Scriptures.</h3> 
<h3>The seven remaining books, 2 and 3 John, 2Peter, Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation, were accepted as Scripture aroundAD 300.</h3> 

<h2>A testimony within the New Testament itself.</h2> 

<h3>The Apostle Peter, shortly before he died, referred to Paul's Epistles as Scripture, and also makes mention of the rest of Scripture indicating thathe esteemed the other completed inspired books as Scripture. â€“ II Peter3:15-16.</h3> 
<h3>Revelation refers to itself as a book of prophecy. â€“ Rev. 1:3, 22:18,19.</h3> 

<h2>There is historical evidence of the use of the N. books by the early church leaders.</h2> 

<p>Clement of Rome (97-140) wrote much from and about the New Testament. Clement of Rome in AD 95 wrote a letter inthe name of the Christians of Rome to those in Corinth. In this letter he uses material found in Matthew and Luke.</p> 
<p>Ignatius (AD35-116) refers to large portions of the New Testament. The Epistles of Ignatius (AD115) uses language from nearly all of the Pauline epistles. The Epistle to Polycarp mentions portions of Philipians and cites nine of the other Pauline epistles. Ignatius quotes from Matthew and also from I Peter and I John.</p> 
<p>Polycarp (AD 69- 155) refers much to the writings of the New Testament.</p> 

<h2>Thereis historical testimony of the acceptance of the Canon by church leaders.</h2> 

<p>Theophilus (AD 115-188}, Bishop of Antioch AD 168, refers to the evangelists and the Holy Scriptures of the New Testament.</p> 
<p>Clement of Alexandria (AD115-188) in the latter part of the second century refers to the collection of the fourGospels as being recognized as Scripture.</p> 
<h3>Irenaeus (AD 130-200) refers to the New Testament writings as the Holy Scriptures. He quotes from every N. book except Philemon and IIIJohn. The New Testament Canon recognized by Irenaeus was very close to what we hold today.</h3> 
<h3>Tertullian (AD 160-221) uses for the first time the termNew Testament, and calls the whole Bible the whole instrument of both Testaments.</h3> 
<h3>Eusebius (AD 260-340) in approximately AD 330 divides all the 27 books of the New Testament into the disputed and non disputed categories.</h3> 
<h3>Athanius (AD298-373), Bishop of Alexandria, in his Easter letter of AD 367 lists the 27 books of the New Testament and he used the phrase being canonized in regards to them.</h3> 

<h2>Tests of New Testament Canonicity</h2> 

<p>There were tests that were used by the early church to judge the Canonicity of a book. There were many church leaders involved at different times who judged which books were inspired and which books were not. The following four guidelines was used by these leaders in their discovery of the New TestamentCanon.</p> 
<h3> Was the book written by an Apostle?</h3> 
<p>We understand that God is the author of the New Testament. The Apostles were some of the Holy men of God that The Divine Author spoke through. If a book could be proven to have been written by one of the original Apostles of Jesus it was considered to be of Divine origin. Much weight was put on the teaching and instruction of the original Apostles. The writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities.</p> 
<h3> Was the book approved by an apostle?</h3> 
<p> It was believed that the original Apostles would know which books were inspired and which books were not. A book not written by an Apostle that had Apostolic approval was considered to be of Divine origin.</p> 
<h3> Was the book universally accepted by the early church by the end of the fourth century?</h3> 
<p>There were certain books that were accepted almost immediately by the early church as being Divine Scripture. These books were readily included in the Canon. There were other books that took time to be accepted by the church as being Canon.</p> 
<h3> Was the book read publicly when the early church gathered for theLord's Supper?</h3> 
<p>We have historical records from the early church leaders that indicate which books were read at church gatherings. These books were used by the church because they were considered to be inspired.</p> 
<h3> Was the book consistent with the rest of accepted Scripture?</h3> 
<p>As has been stated in regards to the acceptance of Old Testament Scripture that a book must be in perfect harmony with the rest of the accepted Canon. Even so the New Testament books that were received must also be in harmony with both the Old Testament Canon and the New Testament Canon of Scripture.</p>
