<h1>Homologoumena, Antilegomena and Apocryphal</h1> 
<h2>Homologoumena means acknowledged and refers to the readily accepted books of the New Testament.</h2> 
<p>Twenty out of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament were readily and universally accepted as genuine, and called the Homologoumena. These twenty books were the fourGospels, the Acts, the epistles of Paul (except Hebrews), and the first epistles of John and Peter.</p> 
<h2>Antilegomena means disputed and refers to the books that were not readily accepted by the church leaders and took more time to be accepted into the Canon of Scripture.</h2> 
<p>The seven books were Hebrews, II and III John, II Peter, Jude, James, Revelation. These were disputed for a time and called the Antilegomena</p> 
<p>There were various questions with regard to the books called Antilegomena. One question was that of whether they were really written by the men who were called their authors. Hebrews bore no name of its author, and differed in style from the acknowledgedPauline epistles; II Peter differed in style from I Peter; James and Jude called themselves servants; and not apostles; the writer of II and III John called himself an elder and not an apostle. Apostolic authorship was considered an important factor in recognizing the Canonicity of a book. There were many forgeries claiming apostolic authority, therefore these books were scrutinized more carefully before they were admitted into the Canon.</p> 
<p>Another question was that Jude recorded accounts not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture and makes mention of Enoch which was thought to be associated with the Apocrypha. The book of Revelation was not understood by many of the church leaders and therefore was questionable in their minds. These books were not at once accepted into their place in the Canon. After a deliberate examination,however, they were at last received as genuine, the very delay proving the close scrutiny which was involved in the process of Canonization. At the beginning of the fourth century they were received by most of the churches, andat the end of the fourth century they were received by all.</p> 

	<h2><span lang="en">Apocryphal Books</span></h2>
	<p>The Apocrypha generally refers to the books placed between the Old and New Testaments and included as an addendum to some Canons.</p> 
<p>These books derive their name from a Greek word, apokruphos ,which means hidden. They are called this because they are hidden and of unknownauthority.</p> 
<p>The Roman Catholic Church accepts the Apocrypha as part of their Canon of Scripture.</p> 
<p> The Jews regarded them as being a valuable history of their nation.</p> 
<p>These books did not meet the basic tests of Canonicity. They were not recognized as inspired books by the Jews. They were given a place by themselvesin the sacred volume, but with the distinct statement that they were not to be regarded as of equal authority with the books of the Canon.</p> 
<p>Some of the Church leaders also used this term to refer to any non-canonical book.</p> 
<h2>ThePseudepigraphical Writings</h2> 
<p>This is a term applied to books deemed non canonical but claiming some kind of religious authenticity or value.</p> 
<p>Some of the books in this category were deemed forgeries claimingApostolic origin such as the Gospel according to Thomas.</p> 
<p>There were many books written that were not inspired, yet claimed some kind of Divine approval. The books in this category are termedPseudepigraphical Writings. This is a term that is used in many commentaries and research materials. The serious student of the Bible should at least havea basic understanding of what is meant by this term.</p>
