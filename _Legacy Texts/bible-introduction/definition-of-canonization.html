<h1><span lang="en">Definition of Canonization</span></h1>
	<p>The process of the Bible books being gathered together into their current form is what is meant by: Canonization of the Bible. This process did not happen overnight. Remember that each individual book had to be laboriously copied by hand. The books were used and distributed by the religious leaders of the day. There were also other books written that claimed inspiration that were not included as part of our Bible. There were religious and historical books that were also in distribution at the time of this process of judging which books should be included into the Canon. This process of recognizing which books were inspired and which books were not is what we will study in this section. We will try to answer the question: How did the Bible come into its present form?</p> 

<h2>The word Canon comes from the root word reed .</h2> 
<p>The reed was used as a measuring device. The English word is cane and the Greek word is kanon . The word canon means a rod, rule or measuring device. 3rd century church leader Origen used the word canon to refer to the rule of faith.</p> 
<h2>The word Canon refers to the books that were judged to be of Divine origin.</h2> 
<h3>The Biblical canon is the inspired books that have been collected together in the Holy Bible. Remember the word Bible means books and the Holy Bible is a collection of Holy books. The word Canon is simply the word that is used to refer to this collection of Holy books that we call the Bible which is the inspired Word of God.</h3> 
<h3>The Old Testament Canon refers to the Old Testament books that were judged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we call the Old Testament.</h3> 
<h3>The New Testament Canon refers to the New Testament books that were judged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we call the New Testament.</h3> 
<h2>Canonization is the process of placing writings in the Biblical canon.</h2> 
<h3>The Divine Author gave the Scriptures to Holy men of God.</h3> 
<h3>The manuscripts were carefully copied by hand.</h3> 
<h3>The books were not collected together in their current form immediately.</h3> 
<h3>The Jewish scribes and religious leaders gathered the books together that were judged to be of Divine origin into the Old Testament Canon.</h3> 
<h3>The early church leaders gathered the books together that were judged to be of Divine origin into the New Testament Canon.</h3> 
<h2> Canonicity refers to the fact that a book has been judged to be of Divine origin and has been included in the Canon.</h2> 
<h3>Example: The Canonicity of the Book of Isaiah was recognized because it was deemed to be inspired by God.</h3> 
<h3>Canonization in this context should not be confused with the Roman Catholic usage referring to the process of making dead people saints.</h3>
