<text class='h1'>   	Inspiration of the Bible</text>   	
<text class='h2'>   	I.  	Definition of Biblical Inspiration</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	A.  	Whatis meant by the term inspiration?</text>   	
<text class='h2'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	Webster’s dictionary defines inspiration as: The act of breathing intoanything.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	The word inspiration is derived from the Latin   	<i>   	in spiro   	</i>   	meaningto ‘breathe in’.       </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	The word inspiration literally means   	<i>   	God breathed  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>2 Timothy 3:16—  	<i>   	"Allscripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, forreproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>The phrase given by inspiration ofGod is translated from the one Greek word:   	<i>   	"theopneustos, "  	</i>   	which isderived from   	<i>   	Theos  	</i>   	  - God and   	<i>   	pneuma  	</i>   	 – The Holy Ghost.    	<i>   	Pneuma  	</i>   	is derived from a word that means breath.  The literal translation of thisphrase (given by inspiration of God) is: <b>GOD BREATHED.</b> </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	Theword inspiration is used in reference to the Divine origin of the Scriptures.The Bible was not just written by the mind and hand of man.  The Holy Ghostbreathed the Word into the men who were the human tools of the Divine Author.</text>   	
<text class='p'>II Peter 1:21  	<i>   	—Forthe prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spakeas they were moved by the Holy Ghost  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>The prophecy in this context refersback to verse 20 which says:   	<i>   	"Knowing this first, that no"  	</i>   	<i>   	prophecy ofthe scripture is of any private interpretation.    	</i>   	These verses refer to theprophecy contained in the Scripture. The Scripture did not come to us by man. The men were moved upon by the Holy Ghost.  This Divine action of God movingupon man to give them the Word is what is meant by inspiration.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>"Do we have an inspired Word of God?Yes, we do!  But, simply answering yes to this question is certainly notenough.  Every Believer must know beyond all doubt that their Bible is noneother than the breath of the Almighty God. (2 Samuel 23:2; Acts 1:16; Mark12:36)"</text>   	
<text class='p'>"All Scripture is excellent inspirit, beautiful in language and grand in prophetic imagery, but itssuperiority is not in natural talents nor is Scripture words of mere humaninvention, but its excellence lies in the fact its "  	<b><u>   	words are breathed byGod.  	</u> </b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>"(Heb. 3:7,8,15; John 13:18,21; Hab. 3:2,16; Isa. 51:16;59:21; Jer. 1:9; 5:14; 20:9; 23:18-19,22,29)"</text>   	
<text class='h2'>   	II.  	Deceptive Views of Biblical Inspiration</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	A.  	TheBible was produced by natural inspiration.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"This false view holds that theBible is the product of genius of a high order, but not supernatural, orDivine.  This is the type of inspiration that Milton, Shakespeare, or Confuciusshow in their writings.  No man of intelligence, however, can go from readingShakespeare to reading the Bible without feeling that the difference betweenthe two is more than just by degree.  A book can be inspiring without beinginspired. The Bible far supersedes the books of men. "</text>   	
<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	Godused levels of inspiration to give us the Bible.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"      This false view claims thatGod used different levels of control at different times in the process ofinspiration.  This view advocates that sometimes God used Divine inspirationand at other times, God only offered suggestions or promptings of instruction."</text>   	
<text class='p'>This is totally contrary to true Biblical inspiration.</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	C.  	Godonly gave the concepts or thoughts to the men who wrote the Bible. </text>   	
<text class='p'>Those who promote this false viewadvocate that only concepts or thoughts were given by inspiration.  Thisposition leaves the wording of the text to the minds of men.  This again iscontrary to the correct meaning of true Biblical inspiration.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	D.  	Onlyportions of the Bible are inspired.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"This is a dangerous false doctrinereferred to as partial inspiration. This position states that the Biblecontains the Word of God, but is not all of Scripture is inspired.  Who thendecides what is and what is not inspired?  Such a theory leaves man in awfuland fatal uncertainty. "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	E.  	Whatis the correct understanding of the inspiration of the Bible? </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	“Verbal and plenary inspiration”is the correct view. (Will be explained in greater detail next)</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h2'>   	III.Declarations of Biblical Inspiration</text>   	
<text class='h3'> </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	A.  	Theentire Bible is inspired of God.</text>   	
<text class='p'>II Timothy3:16—  	<i>   	<u>   	All scripture  	</u>   	 is given by inspiration of God…  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'><b>The view that the Bible in itsentirety is inspired of God is called   	<i>   	plenary   	</i>   	inspiration. </b>   	Plenarymeans full or complete. The Complete Bible from Genesis to Revelation is theinspired Word of God. All Scripture is equally inspired.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"Because it is inspired of God,the Bible is "  	<i>   	infallible  	</i>   	. Infallible means   	<i>   	to be totally exempt fromthe possibility of mistake  	</i>   	".  This word is applied to God who is not capableof error or mistake.  Used in reference to the Bible, infallible refers to theDivine Authorship of Scripture.  The Divine Author is infallible and thereforeHis Word is infallible."</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	TheOld Testament is inspired by God.</text>   	
<text class='p'>Over and over again we can find thefollowing phrases in the Old Testament:</text>   	
<text class='p'>“Word of the Lord”                                                           </text>   	
<text class='p'>“God said/spake”               </text>   	
<text class='p'>“God commanded”            </text>   	
<text class='p'> “God appeared”                </text>   	
<text class='p'>“the Lord said/spake”                                           </text>   	
<text class='p'>“thus saith the Lord”</text>   	
<text class='p'>"These phrases affirm theinspiration of the Old Testament.  The validity of these claims of inspirationis evident from the minuteness and detail as to names, times, and places whichcharacterized their messages, and from the exact literal fulfillment of theirprophecies. "</text>   	
<text class='p'>Acts 28:25—  	<i>   	"Andwhen they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul hadspoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto ourfathers,"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>2 Peter 1:21—  	<i>   	Forthe prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spakeas they were moved by the Holy Ghost  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>Hebrews 1:1—  	<i>   	"God,who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathersby the prophets,"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>Dt.18:18-22—  	<i>   	v.22 <b>"When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not,nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but theprophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him."</b>   	</i> </text>   	
<text class='h3'> </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	C.  	TheNew Testament is inspired by God</text>   	
<text class='p'>The writers of the NT claiminspiration for OT writers as well as for themselves:</text>   	
<text class='p'>Acts 1:16—  	<i>   	"…this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, whichwas guide to them that took Jesus..,"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='h3'> </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	D.  	TheMen were Inspired</text>   	
<text class='p'>The Scripture declares that Holy men of Godspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. – 2 Peter 1:21 God breathed His Wordthrough the men that were the human instruments to write the Bible.  Theprophet’s spoken words from God were used by God to communicate with Hispeople. The Lord instructed many of these men to write down His Words. The menwere inspired and instructed by God to give His Word to the people.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1Thessalonians2:13  	<i>   	;   	</i>   	John 6:63  	<i>   	;   	</i>   	Eph. 3:8-9</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	E.  	TheWords were Inspired</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	"Not only were the men inspired byGod, but the very choice of words came straight from the throne of God. Godinspired the choice of the words of Scripture."  	<b> This is referred to as verbalinspiration.</b>   	 The writers were not left absolutely to themselves in thechoice of words that they should use.  God guided the very wording of theBible.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>Jude 17—  	<i>   	"But,beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of ourLord Jesus Christ;"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>2 Peter 3:2—  	<i>   	"Thatye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>John 12:48—  	<i>   	"Hethat rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: theword that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	F.  	TheLetters were Inspired</text>   	
<text class='p'>"The very letters of the words ofthe Bible are Divinely inspired. For example, let us look at the doctrine of“one seed and not many” through Christ which is established by the use of asingle letter: ‘s.’"</text>   	
<text class='p'>Galatians 3:16—  	<i>   	"Nowto Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, asof many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."  	</i>   	 (comp. Gen.22:16-18)</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"The ‘s’ in this verse makes ALL thedifference. The ‘s’ makes the difference between singularity and plurality andmost important the difference of stating that there is one mediator or statingthere are many mediators. Had God said ‘seeds’ instead of ‘seed’ the promisescould have come through Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, the Pope or anyone elsethat chose this claim of fame. By definite use of singularity, God closes thedoor on false messengers and exalts Christ as the ONLY way to God. The promisedseed could only be Christ and not Christ and Buddha or Christ and Mohammed.Jesus Christ alone was and is the promised seed."</text>

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	A.  	ItsUnbroken and Perfect Unity</text>   	
<text class='p'>"TheBible contains 66 books written by approximately 40 different men in fourlanguages spanning a period of 1600 years, by men living as far as 1500 milesapart.  The men used were from all walks of life; they were kings, doctors,prophets, shepherds, servants, fisherman, and even a tax collector.  Yet thereis unbroken and perfect unity throughout the entire Bible.  This could only bethe work of God.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'>   </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	ItsFearless Foretelling</text>   	
<text class='p'>" The Bible foretells events many years and even centuries before theytook place.  The timing of the writing of the Old Testament prophecies can behistorically documented because an accurate record of the history between theTestaments has survived.  This historical record confirms the date of theending of the Old Testament placing a four hundred year biblical silencebetween the last of O.T. prophecy and the start of N.T. fulfillments.  Thedates when the Bible books were written can be historically documented. TheSeptuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Old Testament, can beaccurately placed at least two-hundred and fifty years before the birth ofChrist.  Since the Greek Septuagint was translated from the Hebrew text therehad to have been the Hebrew Old Testament in existence at least two-hundred andfifty years before the New Testament.  This is historical proof that theseprophecies were written hundreds of years in advance of their detailedfulfillment in the New Testament. There is no possible way that man could havemade such accurate predictions.  This is a definite and inarguable proof of theInspiration of Scripture. "</text>

<text class='h1'>   	Canonization of the Bible</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>The process of the Bible books being gathered together into their current form is what is meant by:   	<i>Canonization of theBible</i>   	. This process did not happen overnight.  Remember that eachindividual book had to be laboriously copied by hand.  The books were used anddistributed by the religious leaders of the day.  There were also other bookswritten that claimed inspiration that were not included as part of our Bible.There were religious and historical books that were also in distribution at thetime of this process of judging which books should be included into the Canon. This process of recognizing which books were inspired and which books were notis what we will study in this section.  We will try to answer the question: Howdid the Bible come into its present form? </text>   	
<text class='h2'>   	I.  	Definition of Canonization</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	A.  	Theword Canon comes from the root word   	<i>   	reed  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	The reed was used as a measuringdevice.  The English word is   	<i>   	cane  	</i>   	 and the Greek word is   	<i>   	kanon  	</i>   	".The word canon means a rod, rule or measuring device. 3"  	rd  	 century churchleader Origen used the word   	<i>   	canon  	</i>   	 to refer to   	<i>   	the rule of faith.  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	Theword Canon refers to the books that were judged to be of Divine origin.  </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	The Biblical canon is the inspired books that have been collectedtogether in the Holy Bible. Remember the word Bible means books and the HolyBible is a collection of Holy books.  The word Canon is simply the word that isused to refer to this collection of Holy books that we call the Bible which isthe inspired Word of God.     </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	The Old Testament Canon refers to the Old Testament books that werejudged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we callthe Old Testament.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	The New Testament Canon refers to the New Testament books that werejudged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we callthe New Testament.</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	C.  	Canonizationis the process of placing writings in the Biblical canon. </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	The Divine Author gave the Scriptures to Holy men of God.  </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	The manuscripts were carefully copied by hand.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	The books were not collected together in their current form immediately.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	4  	The Jewish scribes and religious leaders gathered the books togetherthat were judged to be of Divine origin into the Old Testament Canon.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	5  	The early church leaders gathered the books together that were judged tobe of Divine origin into the New Testament Canon.</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	D.  	<i>   	Canonicity  	</i>   	refers to the fact that a book has been judged to be of Divine origin and hasbeen included in the Canon. </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	Example: The Canonicity of the Book of Isaiah was recognized because itwas deemed to be inspired by God.   </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	Canonization in this context should not be confused with the Romancatholic usage referring to the process of making dead people saints.</text>   	
<text class='h2'>   	II.  	Determinationof Canonicity</text>   	
<text class='p'>What determined which books would be included inthe Bible and which books would not be included in the Canon of Scripture? This is an important question which must be able to be answered by the seriousstudent of the Bible.  You must know beyond doubt that the Bible in its currentform is THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD.</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	A.  	IncorrectViews on the Determination of Canonicity</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	The religious leaders determined Canonicity.</text>   	
<text class='p'>Religious councils did not determineCanonicity.  The councils of man can not make a book Scripture which in its ownnature is not Scripture.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	Criticswill assert man had to decide which books to include in the Canon</text>   	
<text class='p'>therefore placing doubt on the reliability of the Bible.  </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	Ithas been argued that men chose only books that were in agreement with theirreligious views to be in the Canon.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>This is therefore said to be the only reason forthe unity and harmony of the Scriptures.  The argument is that men excludedbooks that did not agree with their views and included only books that didagree with their views.  This false view places man as the determiner of theCanon.</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	CorrectViews on the Determination of Canonicity</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	God determined Canonicity.        </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>God gave to man the books that Hewanted to be included in the Bible.  God protected and preserved the books thatHe inspired and safeguarded their collection into the Canon.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	TheDivine Inspiration of a book determined Canonicity.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>A book was included in the Canonbecause it was recognized to be the Divine Inspired Word of God.  A book thatwas not deemed to be of Divine authority was not included as part of the Canonof Scripture.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h2'>   	III.Description of the Old Testament Canon</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	A.  	TheOld Testament Canon was divided into three categories.</text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	The Law – the writings of Moses.</text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	The Prophets – the writings of men who held the office of a prophet.</text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	The Writings – with the exception of Ruth and Lamentations the writingsof men who did not hold the office of a prophet.  This section is also referredto as the Hagiographa in many of the Jewish texts.  </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	TheMasoretic Text (MT)</text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	The word   	<i>   	masoretic  	</i>   	 means   	<i>   	traditional  	</i>   	<i>   	Masoretic Text  	</i>   	refers to the traditionally accepted Hebrew Scriptures. The Masoretic Textswere originally controlled by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes.</text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	The MT is the authoritative text of the 24 books of the Jewish canon (  	<i>   	Tanakh  	</i>   	or   	<i>   	Hebrew Bible  	</i>   	") complete with explanatory, grammar, pronunciation andspelling notations and signifiicant textual details. (i.e., the total number ofletters on a given page could be found noted in the margin of a MasoreticText.)"</text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	"The goal of the Masoretes was to wholly preserve the very form, wordsand meaning of the Scriptures. Any loss or change at all was inexcusable."</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	C.  	TheHebrew Scriptures were preserved by the priests.</text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	It was a priestly duty to preserve the written revelation of theScriptures. The priests were the divinely appointed guardians and teachers ofthe Law. </text>   	
<text class='p'>       </text>   	
<text class='p'>Deuteronomy31:24-26—  	<i>   	"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing thewords of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded theLevites… Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of thecovenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee."  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>The law was placed in the charge ofthe priests to be kept by them alongside the Ark of the Covenant.  The priestswere also commanded to read the law every seven years. </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	The priests oversaw the task of making correct copies of the law for theuse of kings and rulers. </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	D.  	Greatcare was taken to protect and preserve the inspired manuscripts.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	Christ was faithful to His promise that the OT Scriptures would notperish.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>Matthew 5:18—  	<i>   	"Forverily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shallin no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. "  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	The scribes used various techniques to insure the accuracy of the copiedmanuscripts of the Hebrew text.  They used tests such as counting vowelpatterns and checking for the placement of certain words within the text whenchecking the accuracy of a newly completed copy.  The entire manuscript wouldbe discarded if it was found to contain an error.  </text>   	
<text class='h4'> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	"From the end of the first century until the Protestant Reformation, theHebrew Old Testament was preserved by the Jews."</text>   	
<text class='p'>"Jewish scribes carefully copied and preservedthe manuscripts of the Old Testament.  Augustine said, the Jewish scribes werethe librarians of the Christian Church. The earliest of these scribes werecalled Tannaim (teachers). They copied the text of the OT with great accuracy.The Tannaim were followed by a group of scribes called Amoraim (Expositors).These were scholars who worked not only as copyists, but also produced TheTalmud which is a book of exposition on the laws and traditions of the Jews."</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	4  	The traditional (Masoretic) text was printed at the end of the medievalperiod. The Psalms were printed in 1477. And in 1488 the entire Hebrew Biblewas printed for the first time.</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	E.  	Theburial of the Hebrew manuscripts.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"The Jewish Rabbis held the copies of the HolyScriptures in great esteem.  When a manuscript was too old and worn to be ofany further use, they were reverently retired. It was believed to be better togive them an honorable burial than to allow the risk of them to be improperlyused or profaned.  This is the reason that there are only so many surviving copiesof Old Testament manuscripts.  "</text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	F.  	Thedivision of the Hebrew text into chapters and verses.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	The division of the Scripture into verses is quite an early practice andwere fixed by the Masoretic family of ben Asher about AD 900. </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	"This system divides the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament (as wereckon them in our English Bible) into 23,100 verses. The Hebrew text is alsodivided into paragraphs. "</text>

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	B.  	 Testsof Old Testament Canonicity</text>   	
<text class='p'>There were tests used by the Jewish leaders tojudge the canonicity of a book.  These principals have been determined from thewriters of Biblical and Church history.  There was a systematic approach to therecognition of the Canonicity of a book. This section makes mention of theBiblical <b><i>   	writers  	</i> </b>   	 of the canonical books. These references areonly in respect to the fact that they were the human tools of the <b><i>   	DivineAuthor  	</i> </b> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	<b>Was it written by Moses?  </b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>Mosaic authorship of a book was considered avalid test of Inspiration by the Jews from time immemorial.  Moses isreverenced as the great prophet of the Jews. The books that were written byMoses were considered to be of Divine origin from the earliest of the Jewishhistorical record.  The evidence of archaeology in Palestine strongly supportsthis traditional view.  Jesus confirmed that Moses was the human vessel whoreceived the Law.  Did not Moses give you the Law – John 7:19.   As was alreadystated the Biblical account records the immediate acceptance of the books ofthe law as being given by God.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	<b>Was it written by a known prophet of God?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>If the book was written by a known prophet ofGod who was considered to be an oracle of God; then the book was believed to bethe Word of God. </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	<b>Was its writer confirmed by acts of God?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>The writer was considered to be a man of God ifhe had the witness of the power of God in his life.  If the writer wasconsidered to be a man of God then his writings were also considered to be fromGod. The sons of the prophets recognized the authority of Elisha when they sawhim take up the mantle of Elijah and part the Jordan River. – II Kings 2:15.</text> <b></b>   	
<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	4  	<b>Is it in agreement with the rest of Canonical Scripture?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>"There must be perfect unity of Scripture. Doctrine in one part of Scripture must agree with the truths contained in otherparts of Scripture.  As has already been stated some will argue that books wereonly chosen that agreed with the views of the leaders who chose them.  Yet, abook could not be considered as Canonical if it was not in agreement with therest of the received Scripture.  A book was recognized as being Canonicalbecause it was inspired.  This as we can see was not the only test of theCanonicity of a book.  And obviously a book of Divine origin would notcontradict another book of Divine origin."</text>   	
<text class='p'>   </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	5  	<b>Does it tell the truth about God?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>The book must be accurate in its description ofGod and the things of God.  The book would be rejected as being divinelyinspired if it contained error concerning theology.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	6  	<b>Was it accepted by the Jewish leaders as being authoritativeScripture?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>Some books were accepted by the Jewish leadersas being Canonical while others were not.  This is a testimony that the Jewishleaders recognized the books that were included in their Canon to be authoritativeScripture.</text>

<text class='h3'>   	E.  	Testsof New Testament Canonicity</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>Therewere tests that were used by the early church to judge the Canonicity of abook. There were many church leaders involved at different times who judgedwhich books were inspired and which books were not.  The following fourguidelines was used by these leaders in their discovery of the New TestamentCanon.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	1  	<b>Was the book written by an Apostle?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>Weunderstand that God is the author of the New Testament.  The Apostles were someof the Holy men of God that The Divine Author spoke through.  If a book couldbe proven to have been written by one of the original Apostles of Jesus it wasconsidered to be of Divine origin  	<b></b>   	Much weight was put on theteaching and instruction of the original Apostles. The writings attributed tothe apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities.</text>   	
<text class='h3'> <b></b> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	<b>Was the book approved by an apostle?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'> It was believed that the originalApostles would know which books were inspired and which books were not.  A booknot written by an Apostle that had Apostolic approval was considered to be ofDivine origin.  </text>   	
<text class='h3'> <b></b> </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	3  	<b>Was the book universally accepted bythe early church by the end of the fourth century?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>There were certain books that wereaccepted almost immediately by the early church as being Divine Scripture. These books were readily included in the Canon.  There were other books thattook time to be accepted by the church as being Canon. </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	4  	<b>Was the book read publicly when the early church gathered for theLord’s Supper?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>We have historical records from theearly church leaders that indicate which books were read at church gatherings. These books were used by the church because they were considered to beinspired.</text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	5  	<b>Was the book consistent with the rest of accepted Scripture?</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>As has been stated in regards tothe acceptance of Old Testament Scripture that a book must be in perfectharmony with the rest of the accepted Canon.  Even so the New Testament booksthat were received must also be in harmony with both the Old Testament Canonand the New Testament Canon of Scripture.      .       </text>   	
<text class='h3'>   	F.  	Thebooks called Homologoumena and Antilegomena.        </text>

<text class='h4'>   	1  	Homologoumena means   	<i>   	acknowledged  	</i>   	 and refers to the readilyaccepted books of the New Testament.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"Twenty out of thetwenty-seven books  of the New Testament were readily and universally acceptedas genuine, and called the Homologoumena.  These twenty books were the fourGospels, the Acts, the epistles of Paul (except Hebrews), and the firstepistles of John and Peter. "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	2  	Antilegomena means   	<i>   	disputed  	</i>   	 and refers to the books that were notreadily accepted by the church leaders and took more time to be accepted intothe Canon of Scripture.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"The seven bookswere Hebrews, II and III John, II Peter, Jude, James, Revelation.  These weredisputed for a time and called the Antilegomena  "</text>   	
<text class='p'>"There were variousquestions with regard to the books called Antilegomena.  One question was thatof whether they were really written by the men who were called their authors. Hebrews bore no name of its author, and differed in style from the acknowledgedPauline epistles; II Peter differed in style from I Peter; James and Judecalled themselves servants; and not apostles; the writer of II and III Johncalled himself an elder and not an apostle.  Apostolic authorship wasconsidered an important factor in recognizing the Canonicity of a book.  Therewere many forgeries claiming apostolic authority, therefore these books werescrutinized more carefully before they were admitted into the Canon.   "</text>   	
<text class='p'>"Another questionwas that Jude recorded accounts not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture andmakes mention of Enoch which was thought to be associated with the Apocrypha. The book of Revelation was not understood by many of the church leaders andtherefore was questionable in their minds.  These books were not at onceaccepted into their place in the Canon. After a deliberate examination,however, they were at last received as genuine, the very delay proving theclose scrutiny which was involved in the process of Canonization. At thebeginning of the fourth century they were received by most of the churches, andat the end of the fourth century they were received by all. "</text>

<text class='h4'>   	3  	The Roman Catholic Church accepts the Apocrypha as part of their Canonof Scripture. </text>   	
<text class='h4'>   	4  	 The Jews regarded them as being a valuable history of their nation. </text>

<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>This section will deal with the translation ofthe Bible into the English language.  The King James Version which is alsocalled the Authorized Version is the Word of God preserved and translated intoEnglish.  This section will look into the history of the King James Version andthe early English Bibles.   </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'><b>I.          THE PRESERVATION OF GOD’S WORD INTO ENGLISH</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'><i>   	"The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried ina furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thoushalt preserve them from this generation for ever. -  Ps 12:6-7"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>A.        God promised to preserveHis Word for ever.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'><i>   	"Heavenand earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away"  	</i>   	. – Mt. 24:35</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.          Godhas kept His promise and preserved His Word in the English language.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>God who gave us His Word also preserved it to be passed downin different languages throughout the ages.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Notevery modern English version is the pure Word of God.  The modern Englishversions come to us from corrupted texts and do not agree with the KJV which aswe will see is God’s Word preserved in English.  We will look later at themodern English versions and prove that they are corrupt and not the pure Wordof God.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        God guarded thetranslation of His Word into English.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Theword translation means that which is produced by turning words and phrases fromone language into another language.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         God isable to keep His Word pure and complete even through the process oftranslation.  God would not allow His Word to be lost or altered in thetranslation process into English.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         Godused devout Christian men to preserve the Word of God in the English language. Many of these men paid the price with their very lives to preserve and pass onthe Scriptures.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        The KJV is the pure Wordof God in the English language.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         Thereis a pure stream of transmission from the Hebrew MASORETIC TEXT, the Greek "  	<i>   	"RECEIVEDTEXT, "  	</i>   	and the early English Bibles  	<i>   	</i>   	to the KJV.  Remember thatErasmus did not create the   	<i>   	"TEXTUS RECEPTUS,"  	</i>   	 but merely compiled andedited what had already been received by the church when he published the firstprinted Greek New Testament text in 1516.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Thereis a clear traceable path of the process of the translation of God’s Word intoEnglish.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         The KJVdoes not merely contain God’s Word; it is God’s Word.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'><b>II.        THE BIBLE EXISTED IN THE LANGUAGES THAT WOULDLATER DEVELOP INTO ENGLISH</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>A.        The Gothic language wasan early predecessor of the English language.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Thisancient Germanic language would later develop into many other languages withEnglish being one of these offshoots of Gothic.  	<i>   	</i>   	The Gothic languageoften sounded like English and even looked like it in some instances.  Accordingto Riplinger’s book: In Awe of thy Word -   	<i>   	A scientific study of Englishbegins with a study of Gothic.    	</i>   	  </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Ulfilasalso called Wulfila the Apostle translated the Bible into Gothic in AD 350. Paul traveled to within 200 miles of the land of the Goths.  Ulfilas would havehad access to the early Greek manuscripts.  The Byzantine Greek text is evidentin this Gothic Bible.</text>   	
<text class='p'>It is a mid fourth century Greek text and differs verylittle from the   	<i>   	RECEIVED TEXT  	</i>   	 of the later period.  It is essentiallyidentical to the   	<i>   	TEXTUS RECEPTUS   	</i>   	as we know it today.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         Thereis no trace of Arianism to be found in the translation of Ulphilas.  Arianismis the false teaching that reduces Jesus to a created being and inferior to Godthe Father.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"We mention this fact because many historians claim thatUlphilas was a follower of Arius.  If he leaned toward Arianism , he did notaltar the text to support that false doctrine. Ulphilas did not deviate fromthe literal meaning of the Greek text.           "</text>   	
<text class='p'>4.         Westart with this primitive root of the English language to show the clear streamof English Bible translation from the Hebrew Masoretic text and the Greek   	<i>   	TEXTUSRECEPTUS.    	</i>   	The Gothic Bible is in perfect harmony with the KJV and the   	<i>   	RECEIVEDTEXT.    	</i>   	"The KJV would not be translated for centuries later, yet it is inperfect agreement with this Gothic Bible.  That is because all puretranslations from the original languages must agree with each other, becauseGod only wrote one Bible."  	<i>   	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        Anglo –Saxon is the rootof the English language.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Anglo – Saxon texts refer tothe language as Engle or Englisc.  This language is also referred to as OldEnglish. </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Thereis much historical evidence to show the use of Anglo-Saxon Bibles as early asthe 6th century.  Portions of these texts still remain today.  There is nocomplete Anglo-Saxon Bible still in existence today.  There is historicaltestimony that mentions a complete Anglo-Saxon Bible. We do have manuscriptevidence to support that there were at least large portions of the Bible inAnglo-Saxon.</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         TheWycliffe Bible states in the preface that this Bible had been translated intoSaxon by Bede a seventh century theologian thus adding more historical supportfor the existence of at least portions of the Bible in Anglo-Saxon.    	<i>   	"Bedetranslated the bible in Saxon, that was English, either comoun language of thislond, in his tyme – "  	</i>   	Wycliffe in the preface to his English Bible.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"4.         Theexisting Anglo-Saxon manuscripts indicate that they were translated from theOld Latin version.  Bosworth , a 20th century linguistics expert, states thatthey were taken from the "  	<i>   	Vetus Italica   	</i>   	"which is the Old Latin version inexistence before Jerome’s corrupt Latin Vulgate.  ( Jerome’s Latin vulgate, aswe will study later, is the basis for false Catholic Douay version and themodern perversions of the Bible.)  The existing Anglo-Saxon manuscripts are infull agreement with the "  	<i>   	Textus Receptus   	</i>   	and the KJV.  This again showsus the clear stream of English Bible transmission.   </text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        Middle English developed fromOld English during the 12th through the 14th centuries.   </text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Thispre-Wycliffe Bible English is another step in the development of the modernEnglish language. </text>   	
<text class='p'>" The purpose of this class is not to study the developmentof the English language, but to trace the development of the English Bible inthese older English predecessors of the KJV."</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Thereis archeological evidence to support the existence of at least part of theEnglish Bible before the Wycliffe Bible of 1389.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>The Worcester Fragment an existing manuscript dated 1200mentions the Pentateuch taught in English.  John Foxe the author of his famousBook of Martyrs records what he called an old treatise that mentions an EnglishBible predating the Wycliffe Bible.  There are manuscript portions of manyparts of the Bible still available today of various pre-Wycliffe old EnglishBibles.</text>   	
<text class='p'>There is also historical testimony that refers to a completepre-Wycliffe Bible.</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         Wycliffein his preface mentions that he had gathered many older English Bibles.  Thisstatement by Wycliffe himself is a personal testimony to the existence ofpre-Wycliffe Bibles.    </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'><b>III.       A BRIEF ENGLISH HISTORY AS RELATED TO THEENGLISH BIBLE</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>A.        Christianity existed inEngland from as early as the first century.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         It isrecorded that Joseph of Arimethea went to the land that is now England as amissionary in the year AD 63. </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Thereis much historical evidence to support the existence of Christianity in Englandfrom the first century on to the present time.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        There was much oppositionto translating the Bible into the English language.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1  	The RomanCatholic Church was against any Bible in the languages of the common people.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>The light of God’s Word was a threat to the false darknessof Rome.  People that could read the Bible for themselves would see the lightof truth and realize the lies and darkness of the Roman Catholic church.  TheRoman Church promoted the corrupt Latin Vulgate of Jerome which could not beunderstood by a majority of the population.  This deliberately alteredcorruption which does not agree with the   	<i>   	Textus Recptus   	</i>   	and the KJV isthe basis for the modern corrupt versions of the Bible.  As we have alreadydiscussed the Old Latin Version was in existence before Jerome’s Latin Vulgateand it was this   	<i>   	Vetus Italica   	</i>   	and not the Latin Vulgate which was usedas a reference for some of the English Bibles.  It is important to note thatthe Old Latin Version is in complete harmony with the RECEIVED TEXT and theKJV.  This again shows that there are clearly two streams of Bibletransmission; the true stream of the RECEIVED TEXT and the corrupted stream ofmodern perversions.   </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Englanditself fought the translation of the Bible into the English language.</text>   	
<text class='p'>" The Church of England continued to persecute theProtestants even after England broke from Roman Catholicism in the 1500’s. TheChurch of England continued to persecute Protestants throughout the 1600’s. Oneexample of this is John Bunyon, author of Pilgrim’s Progress who was put inprison for over 16 years for preaching the Gospel without state sanction. "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        The Monarchs of England</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>An understanding of the Kings of England and their role inthe process of God’s Word into English is helpful to gain a betterunderstanding of the political climate and the dangers incurred by thetranslators themselves.  It also reveals the Divine providence of God to insurea true translation of the Bible into the English Language.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Henry VIII who reigned from 1509 - 1547 brokeaway from the Roman Catholic Church to form the Church of England.  In 1539 hecommissioned a Bible to be translated into English called the Great Bible.  Hismain reason for having the Bible translated was to go against the Pope who wasagainst putting the Bible in the language of the people.  For a short time he allowedthe Bible to be used openly.  He then showed his true color by having theChristian leader Thomas Cromwell executed in 1540.  He set forth a proclamationin 1546 that all Bibles should be burned and it was forbidden to own aBible.        </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Edward VI who reigned from 1547-1553 brought sixyears of peace and allowed the printing of Bibles once again in England.  Heencouraged the reading of Scripture in the common language of the people.     </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         Queen Mary I who reigned from 1553-1558  wasreferred to as bloody Mary because she executed so many people.  She was aRoman Catholic and tried to turn England back to Catholicism.  In 1555 she hadBible translator John Rogers and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer burned at he stake. Cranmer is the one who hired Coverdale to publish the Great Bible.  Manyreformers were killed just because they were Protestants. It was during thistime that many exiles fled to Geneva and would later produce the GenevaBible.     </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>4.         Queen Elizabeth I who reigned from 1558- 1603 wasfavorable to the Bible</text>   	
<text class='p'>and Bible translation.  The Bishop’s Bible was printedduring her reign.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>5.         King James reigned in England from 1603- 1625 hehad already ruled Scotland for 36 years. He was a Christian King whocommissioned the Bible translation that bears his name:  the King JamesVersion.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'><b>IV.       PROGRESSION OF ENGLISH BIBLES</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>English Bibles have been in agreement with each other andthe RECEIVED TEXT from the Gothic to the KJV.  The KJV is not the first EnglishBible. The following is a list of English Bibles that predate the KJV.  Theyare very similar in wording and are in agreement with the RECEIVED TEXT and theKJV. The KJV was a refinement of these earlier English Bibles.  The KJV hasspecial Bible only vocabulary to set it apart from all other books includingthese early English Bibles.  The KJV is God’s Word preserved to us in theEnglish language.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>A.        The Wycliffe Bible.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         We have already discussed the history of thepre-Wycliffe Bibles in English.  We will begin our list with the oldest Englishcomplete Bible still in existence today: the Wycliffe Bible.   </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         John Wycliffe translated a hand written copy ofthe complete Bible.  This project took several years to complete which wasfinished approximately in 1380. The Wycliffe Bible pre-dated the printing pressbut was circulated very widely in manuscript form.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>The Wycliffe Bible was banned in 1409 and was forbidden bylaw to be copied.  The Bibles copied were often inscribed with a date earlierthan 1409 to avoid the legal ban.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>3.          The Wycliffe Bible predates Erasmus Greek NT sohe could not have had access to it. Yet the Wycliffe Bible is in perfectharmony with Erasmus’ Greek NT indicating that the then common received Greektext available to Wycliffe was the same commonly received text which was thebasis for Erasmus’ Greek NT.     </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>4.         The Wycliffe Bible is very similar to theavailable preceding English Bibles.  Wycliffe states in the preface that he hadhelpers gather many older Bibles. (  	<i>   	"and helperis, to gedere manie eldebibles)  "  	</i>   	This middle English quote shows the progression of the Englishlanguage.  It would be difficult for us today to read the older English of theWycliffe Bible.  This Bible not only agrees with the available earlier EnglishBibles it also agrees with the RECEIVED TEXT and the KJV.  We stress again thisshows a clear stream of Bible transmission into English.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>5.         Wycliffe also used the original languagemanuscripts of Hebrew and Greek.  It has been falsely stated by KJV criticsthat Wycliffe did not have access to the original language manuscripts. Wycliffe himself said that he had access to the Hebrew manuscripts: </text>   	
<text class='p'><i>   	The Jews were dispersed among the nations taking withthem their Hebrew manuscripts.  Now this happened that we might have recourseto their manuscripts as witnesses to the fact that there is no difference inthe sense found in our Latin books and those Hebrew ones.   	</i>   	"– Wycliffe pg.788 In Awe of Thy Word. (This quote was rendered into modern English by theauthor Gail Ripplinger.)  The Latin books mentioned in this quote could nothave been Jerome’s Vulgate since Wycliffe himself mentions the work of Jerometo be in error.  Wycliffe also mentions correcting manuscripts according to theGreek exemplar.  The manuscript he was correcting was Jerome’s corrupt LatinVulgate. He had access to the Greek received text which he used to compare andcheck the Latin versions which he translated from.  In essence the WycliffeBible is a translation not only from the old vulgar Latin, but from the HebrewMasoretic text and the Greek received text which he referred to during thetranslation process and the use of older English Bibles which he said that heused in the preface.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>6.         Wycliffe did not use the corrupt Latin Vulgate asthe basis for his translation.  It has been falsely stated in many referencesources that Wycliffe   	"translated out of the LatinVulgate, claiming it was the only source text available to him.  An 1850printed edition of the Wycliffe Bible contained the statement on the fronticepage : "  	<i>   	made from the Latin Vulgate.   	</i>   	This statement was not in any of theearlier editions and certainly not in the first edition translated by Wycliffehimself.  The devil and his minions continued to attack the reliability of thetrue stream of the KJV.  Wycliffe   	records in his preface that hetranslated from the vulgar Latin:   	<i>   	"translated into English from the vulgarLatin, by John Wycliffe, D.D. Rector of Lutterworth 1380.  "  	</i>   	(Quote from InAwe of Thy Word  pg. 790)  	<i>   	</i>   	 There is a big difference in the wording ofvulgar Latin and Latin Vulgate.  The vulgar Latin were older Latin manuscriptsin the vulgar or common tongue of the people. It was this   	<i>   	Vetus Italica   	</i>   	(OldLatin Manuscripts)  	<i>   	</i>   	and not the Latin Vulgate which was used as areference for the Wycliffe Bible. There are over 100 Old Latin manuscripts inexistence today that agree with the   	<i>   	TEXTUS RECEPTUS   	</i>   	and predate Jerome’scorrupt Latin Vulgate.   Jerome’s Latin Vulgate could not possibly have beenthe basis for Wycliffe’s translation because the Wycliffe Bible does not agreewith the corrupt Latin Vulgate and is in perfect harmony with the   	<i>   	TEXTUSRECEPTUS  	</i>   	 and the KJV.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>"If he used Jerome as his source it would stand to reasonthat the Bibles would agree with each other which they do not.  The originalprologue to the Wycliffe Bible warns of corrupt Latin Bibles and even mentionsthat Jerome is in error and links him to the corrupt Roman Catholic Church. This may seem like a lot of  information about the corrupt Latin Vulgate, butwe need to be able to document the truth concerning this great English Bibletranslator.  "  	We spend the time to refute this falseaccusation to give you a sure foundation for the surety of the KJV. </text>   	
<text class='p'>"7.           TheCatholic Church tried many times unsuccessfully to stop the work of Wycliffe.God intervened to protect him from the wrath of Rome. The Pope was so upsetabout the Wycliffe Bible and his teachings that 44 years after Wycliffe haddied, he ordered his bones to be dug-up, burned, and scattered in the river!"</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        The Tyndale New Testament</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Tyndale began to translate the Bible into Englishfrom Erarmus’ Greek NT in the early 1520’s.   Tyndale also followed thePre-Wycliffe and Wycliffe Bibles closley. He would have had access to theseearly English Bibles and  used them in the translation proccess.  The Wordingof theTyndale NT (and later the Coverdale Bible which is Tyndale’s workcompleted after his death) is similar to that of the Wycliffe Bible. This isone of the main reasons the Catholics and the KJV critics have attacked theWycliffe Bible. These pure English Bibles are the stepping stones to the KJV;that is why the devil has attacked them so strongly.  </text>

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"4.         A law punishable bydeath was enacted in 1530 that forbid owning or selling an English Bible.  TheNT would continue to be smuggled into the country despite the threat of beingburned at the stake for owning an English Bible.  Many were burned at the stakefor simply possessing a copy of the English Bible.  Foxe describes person afterperson, burned at the stake for owning the Scriptures in English.  In 1543 anact of Parliament forbid the use of any Bible except for the Great Bible; itspecifically named Tyndale and outlawed all of his works."</text>   	
<text class='p'>5.          While in prisonTyndale corrected minor mistakes in his translation and printed a secondrefined edition in 1534.  The corrections are a move towards the KJV.  Criticscite the uncorrected mistakes of the first edition without mentioning thatTyndale himself corrected these errors in his second edition.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>6.         He also completed muchof the translation of the OT into English.  He again followed very closely thePre-Wycliffe and Wycliffe Bibles. The OT translation was finished by MilesCoverdale after his death.  Tyndale was burned at the stake in October of 1536.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>7.           Tyndale’s finalprayer before he was burned at the stake was:   	<i>   	"O Lord, open the King ofEngland’s eyes.  "  	</i>   	"This prayer would be answered just three yearslater in 1539, when King Henry VIII finally allowed, and even funded, theprinting of an English Bible known as the Great Bible."</text>

<text class='p'>C.          	The CoverdaleBible</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.           MylesCoverdale had worked with Tyndale on the OT Translation into English. Coverdale finished translating the OT and in 1535 he printed the first completeBible in the English language.  This was the first complete Bible to be printedin English.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.           TheCoverdale Bible consisted of Tyndale’s NT and the portions of the OT that werecompleted by Tyndale.  It was the work of Tyndale with Coverdale finishing theuncompleted portions of the OT.</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.           Coverdalewho worked with Tyndale also used the Pre-Wycliffe and Wycliffe Bibles.  TheCoverdale Bible is in agreement with earlier English Bibles and the KJV.   </text>

<text class='p'>D.        The Great Bible</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         This was the first English Bible authorized forpublic use.  Coverdale was hired by Cranmmer the Archbishop of Canterbury atthe request of Henry VIII to publish a Bible.  Henry VIII funded the printingof the scriptures in English to defy the Pope and the Roman Church. Henry brokeaway from the Roman Catholic Church to form the Anglican Church because he didnot want the Pope to tell him what to do.      </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         It was called the Great Bible due to its size. It was a pulpit version measuring over 14 inches tall.  It was published in1539.</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         It was not just a reprint of the CoverdaleBible.  Coverdale polished and refined the Tyndale Bible.  The Great Bible wasanother step to the KJV.</text>   	
<text class='p'>E.         The Geneva Bible </text>   	
<text class='p'>1.           	The Geneva Bibleis so named because it was produced in Geneva by the exiles from England.   Itwas published in 1560.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         It was based onTyndale’s Bible and is almost identical to the KJV.           </text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         The Geneva Bible wasthe first Bible taken to America.  It was the Bible of the Puritans and Pilgrims.It is truly the Bible of the Protestant Reformation.</text>   	
<text class='p'>4.         It was the first Bible to add numbered verses tothe chapters for easy referencing of passages. </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>5.           The flaw of the Geneva Bible was the marginalnotes were written by John Calvin and his assistants.  The notes are strongCalvinistic and promote the false doctrines of eternal security and thepredestination of a limited few for salvation.</text>   	
<text class='p'>F.          The Bishops’ Bible</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Archbishop Parker alongwith other bishops produced in 1568 what is referred to as the Bishops’ Bible. It is so called because it was produced by the Bishops of the Church of England. </text>   	
<text class='p'>"2.         The Bishops’ Bible was produced to conform to thestructure of the Church of England, and to stand against the false notes ofCalvanisim contained in the Geneva Bible.  Calvanisim was against the structureof the Church of England. God would not allow the notes of the false doctrineof eternal security to remain as part of the infallible Bible in English."</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         It followed the commonEnglish translation.  Most of the text is Tyndale’s and it is also very similarto the KJV.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"4.         The Bishops’ Bibleimproved on the word order of earlier versions.  The words were the same, butsyntax was improved for clarity.  This Bible was one of the main sources of theKJV."</text>

<text class='p'>"4.         It wasnot the text that was corrupt, but the mariginal notes added by men to supporttheir views.   The notes of some of the earlier translations especially theGeneva, which contained notes by Calvin, (who taught only predestined peoplecould be saved)  did not agree with the structure of the Church of England. Therefore the Church leaders especially opposed those Bibles which contained noteswhich did not agree with their church hierarchy.  "</text>

<text class='p'><b>VI.       THE TRANSLATORS </b> </text>   	
<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>A.          	The next step was theactual selection of the men who were to perform the work. </text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         In July of 1604, KingJames wrote to Bishop Bancroft that he had "  	<i>   	"appointed certain learned men, tothe number of four and fifty, for the translating of the Bible"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>Although fifty- four men were tobe appointed only forty-seven actually took part in the translation.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         King James sought outthe best qualified men. These men were the best Biblical scholars and languageexperts of their day.  Many of them spoke several languages fluently.</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         Thebishops were also assigned by the King the task of seeking out men of learningwithin their diocese and setting up correspondence so they could send in theirsuggestions and recommendations concerning the translation work.  The Kingremarked concerning this measure:   	<i>   	our said intended translation mayhave the help and furtherance of all our principal learned men within this ourkingdom.  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        The translators wereorganized into groups which convened at three different locations.  Eachlocation was divided into two companies which made a total of six companies inall. </text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Seventeen met atWestminister.</text>   	
<text class='p'>a.         Tenwere assigned Genesis through 2 Kings.</text>

<text class='p'>a.         Seven were assignedIsaiah through Malachi.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"b.         Eight were assigned theGospels, Acts, and Revelation.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        King James issued 15rules to guide the translators.  These rules are listed in their originalwording in the God’s Word into English handout. Below is a summary of theserules.  	<br>   	<br> </text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         The first rule statedthe Bishops’ Bible would be the primary guide for the translators, and to alteras little of the text as the truth will permit.  This was the starting point ofthe translation process.  The translators were also allowed to consult a pre-approved list of English Bibles to attain the best possible translation.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'><i>   	"These translations to be usedwhen they agree better with the Text than the Bishops Bible: Tyndale's,Matthew's, Coverdale's, Whitchurch's [Great Bible], Geneva. "  	<br>   	<br>   	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         When a word has morethan one meaning they were to use the common translation accepted by the churchleaders.  They were also instructed to consider context and to compare themeaning with other accepted rules of the faith.             	<br>   	<br>   	3.         There were to be no marginal notes except for any requiredexplanation of Hebrew or Greek words.  And the chapter divisions were to bekept the same as much as possible.  	<br>   	<br>   	4.         There was also instruction given as to the process of translationwhich will be discussed in the next section.  	<br>   	<br>   	5.         There was also a provision to seek the help of any learned man inthe land to aid in the translation of difficult passages.  The bishops werealso asked to obtain the help of the clergy and anyone who was skilled inlanguages.  In effect the call was put out to every learned man in the kingdomto add their input to the translation.  	<br>   	<br> </text>   	
<text class='p'><b>VIII.    THE PROCESS OFTRANSLATING THE KJV</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>"The translators stated in the preface that thisBible was translated out of the original tongues with the former translationsdiligently compared.  The Bishops’ Bible may have been the starting sourcetext, but the original languages of Hebrew and Greek were very much a part ofthe translation process.  They also referred to earlier English Bibles.  It hasalready been determined that these English Bibles were pure Bibles that are inperfect agreement with the "  	<i>   	RECEIVED TEXT   	</i>   	and the KJV. They also referredto many different language Bibles that were considered to be pure translationsand were in agreement with the   	<i>   	RECEIVED TEXT.    	</i>   	  The KJV translatorsused every source available to them.  The work was also made available to manyscholars of the land who could add their comments and recommendations. </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>A.          	The work began in 1604and progressed steadily. </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Forty large unbound Bishops’ Bibles were preparedfor the translators to mark.</text>   	
<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Each individual translator worked on his owntranslation of the books assigned to his company.  The group met once a week toconfer and show their work.  One common translation was produced by the companyby combining the individual efforts into one.</text>   	
<text class='p'>(This process was described in rule 8 to the translators.)     </text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         Then the completed sections of the companies werereviewed by each of the other companies as described in rule 9.  Anysuggestions or changes were then sent back to the original group thattranslated the section so they could consider the suggestions.  Any changeswhich could not be agreed upon were to be settled by the final committee.  Thisprocess enabled each word to be reviewed fourteen times.</text>   	
<text class='p'>4  	.         Four years were spenton the preliminary translation by the six groups.</text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        A committee of men from each of the companies thenmet to fine tune the work and reach and agreement regarding any earlierdiscrepancies.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         One -Two men from each company met at Stationers’Hall in London.  (There are varied opinions as to the number of men on thisfinal committee.  The important fact is there were representatives from each ofthe original companies.)</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         They convened in 1610 for nine months to reviewand revise the work.</text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        Thomas Bilson and Dr. Miles Smith were given thetask of one more examination of the work.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         They did some final editing and prepared the KJVfor the printers.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The preface was supplied by Smith.  (Which isincluded in the handout)</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         The KJV was printed in 1611 in Oxford.  It wasoriginally entitled The Holy Bible.  </text>

<text class='p'><b></b>   	"Some misinformed extremists claim therehave been several revisions to the original 1611 KJV and therefore if you ownone of the newer printings you do not have the pure Word of God.  As we willsee these editions were only to change the font, correct typographical errors,and adapt standardized spelling of words.  These editions were not as somefalsely claim a revision of the original text to correct inaccuracies. "</text>   	
<text class='p'>A.        The second printing took place in 1612.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         This was simply to change the font from theGerman Gothic style to Roman type.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The Gothic font was hard to read.  This was onlyan upgrade to make the print easier to read.</text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        The next two printings were in 1629 and 1638.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Translators John Bois and Samuel Ward correctedtypographical errors </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The printing presses at this time were all set byhand one letter at a time.  It is easy to understand that there would betypographical errors in the text.</text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        The final printings were in 1762 and 1769.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         These were done to standardize the spelling.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"2.         The English spelling wasn’t standardized untilthe late 1700’s, these printings were simply to adapt the English standardspelling of words.  For example, the old spelling of sonne was changed to thenew standard son."</text>

<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>A.        There are only two historical streams of BibleManuscripts.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         The manuscripts that came out of Antioch whichare the source of pure Bibles and the KJV.  There is sufficient historicalevidence to show the majority of texts that agree with the pure Bibles came outof Antioch.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The manuscripts that came out of Alexandria whichare the source of corrupted Bibles and the new modern versions such as theNIV.    	There is also sufficient historical evidence toshow the minority of texts that agree with the corrupted Bibles originated inEgypt.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>"3.         There are over 5,300 pieces of manuscriptevidence still available today. Ninety-five percent of the existing manuscriptevidence can be traced to the pure texts from Antioch and is in agreement withthe KJV.  The remaining five percent of the existing manuscript evidence can betraced to the corrupted texts of Alexandria and is in agreement with the modernperversions such as the NIV.          "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        The pure stream ofAntioch.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         Antioch which waslocated in Syria is the first place the saints were referred to as Christians. Antioch was a center for Christianity and the spread of the Gospel.  Ignatius,who had been taught by the Apostle John, was the bishop of Antioch.  Johntaught the early church which manuscripts were the Divine Word of God. Ignatiuswould have had teaching from John concerning the correct inspired texts. Thisshows us the succession of Apostolic authority concerning this pure stream ofBibles that came from Antioch.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The texts from Antiochare known as the Syrian or Byzantine text.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"Remember it was this Byzantinetext which was the basis for the Gothic Bible.  These Byzantine texts were alsothe source of the old Latin texts that were used by Wycliffe, Tyndale, andErasmus. These pure texts from Antioch agree with the received text and theKJV."</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         These manuscripts fromAntioch are those that were received by the majority of the Christian churchand referred to as the received text.  Remember that Erasmus did not create thereceived text.    	"Erasmus was the first to print the Greek NT in 1516.Erasmus Greek New Testament was based on the handwritten received text that wascommonly received by the church before the invention of the printing press.  Ashas already been stated  he used every source of manuscripts available to him,and compared them with great care to insure a correct Greek New Testament wouldbe printed and circulated for the first time.  Erasmus’ Greek New Testamentclearly flows from the pure stream of Antioch that would continue to flow on tothe KJV.  These true manuscripts represent at least ninety-five percent of theavailable manuscriipt evidence."</text>

<text class='p'>C.        The polluted stream ofAlexandria.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         Alexandria is locatedin Egypt.  It was a seat of false worship and pagan philosophy.  It is referredto as a place of those that opposed Stephen the man of God.</text>

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The texts fromAlexandria are known as the Egyptian or Hesycnian type text.   </text>   	
<text class='p'>These Alexandrian texts were thesource of Wescott and Hort’s corrupt Greek New Testament.  These polluted textsof Alexandria agree with Jerome’s corrupt Latin Vulgate and the modern versionssuch as the NIV.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"3.         The manuscripts fromAlexandria were produced by Origen, Clement of Alexandria and other infidelswho did not believe in the Divine inspiration of Scripture."</text>   	
<text class='p'>"Origen was the chief proponent ofthese corrupted manuscripts; he was a Gnostic and did not believe in the deityof Christ. (Does this sound like a man we can trust with the true preservationof the Scriptures?)  These manuscripts do not agree with the received text andwere deliberately altered to promote the philosophy of Egypt and the falseteaching of Origen.  Erasmus in his preface to the Greek NT refers to corruptGreek manuscripts which he attributed to Origen.  This is solid historicalevidence by a Godly man who was fluent in Greek, Latin, and several otherlanguages that Origen corrupted the Alexandrian manuscripts. The falseteachings of these corrupt manuscripts are evident in the modern versions thattake out the blood of Jesus and attack the deity of Christ.  These corruptmanuscripts represent only five percent of the available manuscript evidence.  "</text>

These were intentional omissions because the manuscript was foundwritten on vellum (durable parchment made from calves skin) in excellentcondition with no pieces missing.  In the Gospels it leaves out 237 words, 452clauses, and 748 whole sentences.  The pure manuscripts of Antioch containthese omitted verses of Scripture.      "</text>

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         The Sinaiticus is falsely claimed to be an olderand more accurate translation than the received text of the KJV. Remember that95% of the available manuscripts agree with the received text, while only 5%agree with the Alexandrian texts.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"2.         Even though the Sinaiticus contains many erasuresand changes to its original form it is still a sister text to the Vaticanuswhich was available to the King James translators.  Both of these Bibles wouldhave been produced at the same time, the fact that one was discovered beforethe other does not make it older. The Sinaiticus and Vaticanus are copies ofthe same corrupted text of Alexandria. "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         The KJV translators had access to the Vaticanusand rejected it as being flawed and corrupt.  Had the Sinaiticus been availableit would have also been rejected since they are both copies of the sameEusebian Bible.  This is just another lie to try to give credibility to the newcorrupt false versions.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>

<text class='p'>2.         Wescott and Hort also highly esteemed theVaticanus and the Sinaiticus.  These two Catholic men chose to use the corruptminority Alexandrian text that agrees with Jerome’s Catholic Latin Vulgate. There is a strong connection between the false Bibles and the Roman CatholicChurch.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         These manuscripts can clearly be traced to thepolluted stream of Alexandria.  As has already been stated the Vaticanus andthe Sinaiticus are two of the remaining Bibles of Eusebius.  Eusebius used theOrigen text of Alexandria to create the 50 Bibles of Constantine among whichare the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus.  </text>

<text class='p'>"2.         There are many Syriac and Latin translations from as far back asthe second century that agree with the received text of the KJV. For instance,the Pashitta  - AD 145, and the Old Syriac – AD 400  both support the receivedtext. "</text>   	
<text class='p'>"There are about fifty copies of the Old Latin from about AD 157.  Rememberit was this Old Latin that was used for the Wycliffe Bible which is in perfectharmony with the KJV and the received text.  These Old Latin manuscriptspredate Jerome by over two hundred years.  The Gothic Bible of Ulfilas wastranslated in A.D. 350. The Armenian Bible, which agrees with the KJV, has over1,200 existing copies and was translated around the year AD 400. Sinaiticus andVaticanus are clearly NOT the oldest and best manuscripts.

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.          This is a Bible produced by the Roman CatholicChurch.  There should be need of no further discussion as to the reliability ofanything that came from the pagan church of Rome.  Jerome’s Vulgate is thesource of the corrupt Catholic Douay version of the Bible produced in 1609.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"3.         The Latin Vulgate is not to be confused with theterm: vulgar Latin.  As has already been discussed, the Vulgar Latin refers tothe old Latin manuscripts of the Bible in the common or vulgar tongue, and doesnot refer to Jerome’s corrupt Latin vulgate."</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        The Pure Bibles do not come from Jerome’s LatinVulgate.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         Wycliffe did not use the corrupt Latin Vulgate. (See notes: God’s Word into English.)  The preface of the Wycliffe Bible warnsagainst Jerome and the corrupt Latin Vulgate.  Wycliffe himself mentions thework of Jerome to be in error.  The new version talebearers continue to falselyclaim that Wycliffe used Jerome’s Vulgate, which even according to Wycliffehimself is just not true."</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Erasmus rejected Jerome’s Latin Vulgate.  Erasmuswrote in his preface that he consulted the Old Italian Latin Bibles and not theLatin Vulgate.  Erasmus Greek New Testament does not agree with the corruptLatin Vulgate of Jerome.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>

<text class='p'><b></b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>"4.         Modern Bible history charts wrongly placeJerome’s Latin Vulgate as a source for the KJV.  The KJV translators had accessto Jerome’s Latin Vulgate, BUT THEY REJECTED IT AS FALSE!  Many proponents ofthe modern versions make statements that are not true and have no historicaldocumentation.  The devil is a liar and the advocates of the modern versionsare liars like their father the devil.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"5.         The Latin Vulgate does not agree with thereceived text.  If the Latin Vulgate had been used by the pure Bibletranslators then there would be unity of the texts, which there is not.  TheKJV does not agree with this corrupted text! "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        Jerome used the Alexandrian Manuscripts for theLatin Vulgate.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1  	His Latin Vulgate agrees with the Alexandrian texts which came out ofEgypt.  It is evident in the text that Jerome’s alterations were influenced bythe polluted manuscripts of Alexandria.  The Vulgate agrees with the existingmanuscripts Vaticanus and Sinaiticus which are two of the Bibles ofConstantine.  There is a connection between the corruption of Jerome’s paganCatholic Bible and the pagan Alexandrian texts from Egypt.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The corrupt Catholic Latin Vulgate agrees withthe perverted modern versions of the Bible like the NIV.  Jerome’s Vulgatebecame the basis for many of the new modern Bible versions.  The Latin Vulgateis part of the polluted stream of modern Bible perversions.     </text>   	
<text class='p'>   </text>   	
<text class='p'>"3.         Jerome altered his text to conform to thepaganism of the Roman Church.  As we studied in Church History, the falseworship of the Roman Catholic Church had its roots in the false worship of thesun god baal. The Egyptians also worshipped the sun god baal under the name ofHorus.  The pagan baal worship of ancient Egypt and the pagan baal worship ofthe Roman Catholic Church are one and the same.  The Alexandrian texts of Egyptwere the basis of the corruption of this Catholic Bible."</text>

They even supported prayers for the dead in purgatory. These werenot men to be trusted to give us a pure Bible."</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         They followed the pagan minority manuscripts ofAlexandria that agreed with their pagan philosophy.  These men were RomanCatholic and chose the texts that supported their false religion.     </text>

<text class='h2'>   	1.         Againthere is a subtle tie to the language used by the KJV translators who used thephrase:   	<i>   	with  	</i>   	<i>   	</i>   	<i>   	theformer Translations diligently compared and revised.  	</i>   	<i>   	    	</i> </text>

The KJV used thereceived text of Antioch and the ERV used the minority text of Alexandria. Wescott and Hort in fact rejected the most ancient authority of the receivedtext of Antioch and chose to use instead the minority text of Alexandria.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'><b>VII.     THE LIE OF NEW;  MORE ACCURATE MANUSCRIPTS</b> </text>

<text class='p'>3.         The Sinaiticus has been described as the great lost text that wasnot available to the KJV translators of 1611.  As has already been discussedthe translators rejected the corrupt Vaticanus which was a sister text to theSinaiticus.  The Sinaiticus was not a new reading only a copy of what had beenavailable in 1611.  Even though the Sinaiticus was discovered in 1844 itscorrupt readings were known to the KJV translators.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        The discovered manuscripts support the received text and the KJV.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         The recently discovered manuscriptssupport the accuracy of the received text and the KJV.   The newly discoveredmanuscripts add to the volume of the majority received texts of Alexandria.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.          There are no readings available todaywhich were not already in the hands of the King James translators. An honestscholar will admit that these newly discovered manuscripts agree with thereceived text of the KJV.</text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        The truth about the Dead Sea Scrolls.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         The Dead Sea scrollswere found in the Qumran caves near Jericho in 1947.  KJV critics claim thesewere older manuscripts not available in 1611 to the KJV translators.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The fact is thesemanuscripts are in total agreement with the received text and the KJV.   Thesescrolls actually support the KJV and the received text of Antioch.</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         The Isaiah Scroll dated at 100 BC is thenow oldest available manuscript and is in perfect harmony with the book ofIsaiah in the KJV.  So the truth of the matter is the oldest manuscriptssupport the KJV.</text>   	
<text class='p'><b>VIII.    A NEW HEBREW TEXT</b> </text>

<text class='p'>1.         This text is referred toas   	<i>   	Biblia Hebraica  	</i>   	 which is Latin for Hebrew Bible. The very use of aLatin word to name the text is an attempt of the devil to make this work appearto be scholarly and valid. This text differed from the traditionally acceptedHebrew Masoretic text used by the KJV translators.  Any text that deviates fromthe pure Word of God is never valid.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The devil was again atwork to change and alter the Word of God.  Wescott and Hort had alreadyproduced a New Greek New Testament text that deviated from the received text. And now Kittel would change and twist the Hebrew text of the pure Bibles.  Thedevil was setting his plan for another attack on the KJV.  The devil put inplace a false Hebrew Old Testament text to go along with the false Greek NewTestament text of Wescott and Hort.  </text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         This is a corruptversion of the Hebrew text.  The   	<i>   	<u>   	Biblia Hebracia  	</u>   	</i>   	 does not agreewith the pure received text of the KJV.    </text>   	
<text class='p'>B.        Rudolph Kittel was a German who was anti-Semiticand involved in the Nazi party. </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         He was a leader in“Forschungsabteilung Judenfrage” from 1933-1944 which was a Nazi organizationunder Adolph Hitler.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         Kittel was a Nazi! Would any sane scholar really think a Nazi is going to produce a puretranslation of the Jewish text?  Kittel was anti-Semitic and fought against theJews. His aim was to discredit and correct the Hebrew Old Testament.</text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         There was no need for aNew Hebrew text.  The Masoretic text was the preserved Word of God in theHebrew language.  The devil wanted to alter the truth of the Bible by creatinga new perverted Hebrew text.</text>   	
<text class='p'>     </text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        This false Hebrew text was used as a source forthe new modern Bibles.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         The NIV lists Kittel asone of the sources for its Bible version.  The NIV editors rejected thetraditional Hebrew text of the KJV Old Testament and chose rather to use theHebrew text of a Nazi.</text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The New King JamesVersion primarily uses the 1967/ 1977 Stuttgart edition of   	<i>   	"Biblia Hebraica, "  	</i>   	whichwas another publication of Kittel’s distorted Hebrew text.  The NKJV has verysubtle changes that differ from the pure text of the KJV.  </text>

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1  	The NIV is based on the Sinaiticus and the Vaticanus and also onKittel’s corrupt Hebrew text.  It is a subtle perversion of the Word of God. This was another major attack by the devil on the pure KJV of the Bible.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2  	One of the NIV committee members was a homosexual!  And has already beenstated the Hebrew text which was one of the NIV sources was produced by aNazi.  If people think the NIV is God’s Word they are just plain ignorant.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         TheNIV has been endorsed by the Catholics and is promoted as an acceptedtranslation for Roman Catholics to use.  The Roman Catholic Church neverendorsed the pure KJV.  This should be proof enough that the NIV is not thepure Word of God.  The NIV stems from the corrupt Catholic manuscripts ofAlexandria.           </text>

<text class='p'>This is just an attempt to document the false.  All of thesemanuscripts disagree with the received text.  There is no mention by Earle ofthe older second century Latin manuscripts of the received text which do notagree with this third century papyri or with either of these Alexandrianmanuscripts.  The NIV translators distorted the truth to promote a lie.  </text>

<text class='p'>4.         Earle thanks God formaking these early manuscripts available to us as the basis for an up to datetranslation of an ancient text.  He refers to these corrupt Alexandrian textsas great uncials.  This is a lie from the pit of hell. God had nothing to dowith these corrupt Catholic manuscripts.  He touts the idea of a contemporary translationfrom an ancient text.  Again falsely trying to claim this is an ancienttranslation put into modern English.   </text>   	
<text class='p'><br>   	<i>   	"In the Preface to the NIV, the Committee on Bible Translation states thatsometimes it was necessary to modify sentence structure and to move away from aword-for-word translation in order to be faithful to the thought of thebiblical writers and to produce a truly accurate translation. Since itspublication, however, a number of observers have criticized the less literalapproach of the NIV and have pointed to &quot;interpretational intrusions&quot;foisted on the text. While it may be that at times the NIV translators havebeen guilty of reading something into the text, I would contend that overallthis version has achieved a high level of accuracy by its philosophy oftranslation. By occasionally moving away from a literal translation, they haveproduced a more accurate translation that captures the meaning of the originallanguages with greater precision."  	</i> </text>

<text class='p'>C.        The NIV adds and takesaway from the Word of God.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         God gives warning tothose who take away the word of God.  It is just as important for people not toread a perversion like the NIV that takes away the Word of God.</text>   	
<text class='p'><i>   	</i> </text>

<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.           	"The NIVcompletely takes away 17 key verses and removes 64,576 words."</text>   	
<text class='p'>That is approximately 8% of God’s Word that is taken away. These are key Bible verses that are taken away.  It also adds words and changesthe meaning of important Bible truths.  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>3.         There are many charts and reference materials availablethat show these multiple mutilations of the NIV. We will list just a few ofthese blatant attacks against the Word of God.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>&gt; Attacks the Deity of Christ. </text>   	
<text class='p'>Philippians 2:6  	<b>:</b>   	 The KJV:    	<i>   	"Who, being in the form ofGod, "  	<b>thought it not robbery to be equal with God</b>   	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>The NIV:   	<i>   	"Who, being in very nature God,"  	<b>" Did not considerequality with God something to be grasped,"</b>   	</i>   	 - the NIV totally distortsthe fact that Jesus is God.</text>   	
<text class='p'>&gt; Takes out the Blood of Jesus.</text>   	
<text class='p'>Colossians 1:14 KJV:   	<i>   	In whom we have redemption  	<b> THROUGHHIS BLOOD</b>   	", even the forgiveness of sins:"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'><i>   	</i>   	The NIV:   	<i>   	"In whom we have redemption, the forgivenessof sins. "  	</i>   	"The NIV completely removes the blood of Jesus.  The devil hatesthe Blood of Jesus.  Does this look like an accurate translation of an ancientmanuscript, or a deliberate attack on the pure Word of God? "</text>   	
<text class='p'>&gt; Denies the Trinity</text>   	
<text class='p'>I John 5:7 KJV:   	<i>   	"For there are three that bear record inheaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one"  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>The NIV:   	<i>   	"For there are three that testify: the Spirit, thewater and the blood; and the three are in agreement. "  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>The NIV takes out the Father and Jesus the Word and substitutes water andblood. </text>   	
<text class='p'>&gt; Takes out the anointing.</text>   	
<text class='p'>Isaiah 10:27 KJV:   	<i>   	"And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burdenshall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, andthe yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing."  	</i>   	  </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>NIV:  	<i>   	the yoke broken because you have grown fat.  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'><i>   	:  	</i> </text>   	
<text class='p'>"There is absolutely noconnection between these two renderings of the same verse.  The devil hates theanointing and has taken it out of this verse.  The NIV removes key verses thatdeal with the Saints power over the devil.  That is why the references tofasting are also taken out.  The devil does not want the saints to fast andpray, for that will give them power over the forces of darkness. "</text>   	
<text class='p'><b>X.        </b>   	<i>   	</i> <b>THE MODERN VERSIONS ARE LINKED TO THECHARASMATICS</b> </text>   	
<text class='p'>A.        The false Charismatic Church came out of the RomanCatholic Church. </text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         The Charismatic movement started in the CatholicChurch under the name of Charismatic renewal.  There were actual meetings inCatholic Churches that used the term Charismatic renewal, so this is a factthat can be easily documented.  Evangelical leaders arose with close ties tothe Catholic Church.  There was a new cry for churches to unite and cast asidetheir doctrinal differences.  The NIV was one of the tools used to unitechurches.  This was portrayed as an International version that would bringunity to the Churches.  Even today many evangelical leaders are using the term "  	<i>   	"Catholicbrothers, "  	</i>   	"indicating that Roman Catholics are Christian brothers.  We donot hate the Catholics, but they can not pray to Mary and be true Christians."</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>2.         The Charismatic churches use the modern versionslike the NIV.  The Catholic Church has accepted the NIV and its use among RomanCatholics.  The lack of Scripture on purity in the modern versions has endorsedthe worldliness of the Charismatic church.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"3.         There is a clear tie of evil between the modernversions and the false Charismatic Church.  The new versions that distort thetruth, lay the foundation for the false teaching of the Charismatic Church. "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>B.         The new versions can be traced to the RomanCatholic Church.</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"1.         As we studied in Church History, RomanCatholicism had its roots in baal worship.  The Egyptians also worshiped baalthe sun god.  The modern versions stem from the Alexandrian manuscripts ofEgypt."</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"2.         The first pope Constantine, who introduced thepaganisim of the Roman Catholic Church, is the one responsible for the 50Bibles of Eusebius.  The Vaticanus and Sinaiticus are two of these Bibles ofConstantine.  There is a tie between these Catholic Bibles of Constantine andthe new versions which are based on them."</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>"3.         Jerome produced the Catholic Latin Vulgate in AD382.  He followed the corruption of the Alexandrian manuscripts. The RomanChurch has always stood against the Truth of God’s Word.  They did not want atrue Bible that would expose the darkness of Roman Catholicism.  The Popewanted a Bible that would agree with the paganisim of the Roman Church. Jerome’s Latin Vulgate is one of the sources for the New Bibles.  As has beenmentioned, the corrupt Vulgate of Jerome was not a source for the KJV.  Westress this again because many Bible charts wrongly place the Vulgate as asource for the KJV.  "</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>C.        The Charismatic leaders are promoting the newmodern versions.</text>   	
<text class='p'>1.         The Charismatic leaders are promoting the newBibles of Egypt.</text>   	
<text class='p'>"2.         Catholic promoter Billy Graham endorsed Good Newsfor Modern Man, the Good News Bible, and the Living Bible.  The Good News Bibleis a paraphrase and one of the worst among the new versions, yet it has beenpromoted by many so called evangelical leaders."</text>   	
<text class='p'>IN CONCLUSCION:</text>   	
<text class='p'></text>   	
<text class='p'>We did not take the time to look at every modernversion or look into the numerous distortions of the text.  The new versionsfollow the same line of corruption of the Alexandrian texts. There are manysources available that contain numerous verse comparison charts which comparemodern versions to the KJV. Such as a tract by Gail Riplinger on New AgeVersions which is recommended as a good source to see the omissions in themodern versions.    	"The KJV exalts the Lord JesusChrist. The true scriptures should testify of Jesus Christ.  The new versionsattack the Deity of Christ, the Blood Atonement, the Resurrection, salvation bygrace through faith, and the Second Coming.  Unlike the modern versions the KJVtestifies of Jesus Christ."</text>
