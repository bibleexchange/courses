<h2>Introduction - 1:1,2</h2>
<p>Comfort in true gospel ministry is gained in trusting God while suffering tribulation. II Cor. 1:3-7; Acts 14:22; II Cor. 7:4; I Thess. 3:1-4; Acts 9:15,16</p>
<h3>We are comforted to comfort. 1:4</h3>
<h3>We are challenged to suffer for His Name's sake. 1:6,7; 11:23</h3>
<h2>ITrust in God that raiseth the dead. - 1:8-11; Gen. 22:1-18; Heb. 11:17-19</h2>
<h3>Deliverance is progressive. 1:10</h3>
<h4>"Who delivered us from so great a death"</h4>
<p>Justification and Sanctification</p>
<p>(a separation from the world, sin and death)</p>
<p>Justification without sanctification is false doctrine and a false hope.</p>
<h4>"Doth deliver"</h4>
<p>Sanctification-- Sanctification is a work of God's grace that continues to progress unto perfection by obeying the truth. John 17:17"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth" You cannot continue in your sin and still be saved.</p>
<p>Sanctification begins at Salvation not something that starts later.</p>
<p>You don't gradually become saved.</p>
<h4>"He will yet deliver us"</h4>
<p>Glorify Himself in us--II Thess. 1:12—That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<blockquote>II Cor. 3:18 -But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</blockquote>
<blockquote>John 12:26—If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</blockquote>
<h3>Prayer is necessary to help. 1:11</h3>
<h4>Prayer is the key that unlocks the door.</h4>
<h4>1Prayer is a priceless treasure.</h4>
<h4>1Prayer changes things.</h4>
<h4>1Prayer has eternal benefits.</h4>
<h4>1Consistent prayer is the hardest work you will ever do.</h4>
<blockquote>II Cor. 5:20—Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>21—For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</blockquote>
<h3>A good conscience with no hidden motives is expressed. 1:12-24; 2:1-5</h3>
<h2>The trustworthiness of the messenger affects the trustworthiness of the message. 1:15-20</h2>
<h3>The power to be established even through adversity is of the Holy Ghost. 1:22, 23</h3>

<h4>Anointed 1:21</h4>
<h4>Sealed 1:22</h4>
