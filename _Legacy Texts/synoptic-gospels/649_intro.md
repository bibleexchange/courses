#Introduction to Synoptic Gospels
##Definitions
###Synoptic
a term for the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke which present a synopsis of the same series of events, whereas in John&#8217;s gospel the narrative and discourses are different.
###Synopsis
A summary or brief statement giving a general view of some subject, as by means of short paragraphs. Together, a collective view.
###Gospel
From two Anglo-Saxon words: &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;news&#8221; or &#8220;tidings.&#8221;
The first three gospels give a synopsis of Christ&#8217;s life. The Synoptic Gospels are Mathew, Mark and Luke. The Gospels tell us of Jesus&#8212;His birth, life and death. Jesus is the Word and in studying His Word, we study Him. We can discover more about Him so we can love Him more and let Him love us more.
##GOD&#8217;S REVELATION (Four Key Words)
We find in the Gospels, &#8220;Him of whom Moses in the law, and prophets, did write, Jesus.&#8221; (John 1:45), but we can find Him infinitely more beautiful in person than any prophet&#8217;s vision of Him. We must know Him for ourselves.&#9;
The Gospels are a center point of the Bible &#8211; the prophets have said things that lead us to our Lord&#8217;s time on earth looking to the cross. The Epistles that follow proceed from it, looking back. Notice where the four Gospels are placed. They stand at the close of the Old Testament and at the opening of the New Testament, before the Epistles
###Preparation
&#9;The OT making ready for the coming of the Messiah.
###Manifestation
&#9;The four Gospels of Christ; enters into the world, ministers to the world, dies
&#9;for the world, and rises out of the world.
###Appropriation
&#9;In the Acts and Epistles we see how the Lord Jesus was received, appropriated and applied in individual lives.
###Consummation
&#9;In Revelation, the outcome of it all - It is finished.
##WHY FOUR? (Four reasons)
###One or two would not have given us a proper portrayal of the life of Christ.
###There are four distinct offices of Christ and Ezekiel 1:10 parallels the portrayals of Christ in the Gospels. (King /Lion, Servant/Ox, Son of Man/Man, Son of God/Eagle.)
###Each Theme of the Gospels Reveals Christ in another light.
###Each Gospel has much in common with the others, but there are important differences. Each writer is presenting a different perspective of our one Lord. Each writer has recorded that which is relevant and pertinent to his particular theme. He was a KING but He was the perfect SERVANT. He was the SON OF MAN but we must not forget His is the Son of GOD.
###Four = the World (North &#8211; South &#8211; East &#8211; West)
###There are Four corners of the earth. We are to preach the Gospel to every creature. Four Gospels depict the earthly ministry of the Heavenly One.
##JESUS IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (The Four Offices)
KING&#9;Matthew presents Jesus as King. Written for the Jews. He is the Son of David. His royal genealogy is in Matthew 1. Some Laws of His kingdom are in Matthew 5-7.
SERVANT&#9; Mark depicts Jesus as Servant. Written to the Romans. There is no genealogy. Men are not interested in the genealogy of a servant. More miracles are found here than in any other Gospel. It is a gospel of ACTION.
MAN&#9;Luke sets forth Jesus as the perfect man. Written to the Greeks. His genealogy goes back to Adam, the first man instead of Abraham. As a perfect man, He is seen in much prayer and with angels ministering to Him.
GOD &#9;John portrays Jesus as the Son of God. John is written to all who will believe, with the purpose of leading men to Christ. John 20:31 Everything in this Gospel illustrates and demonstrates His divinity. The opening verse carries us back to &#8220;the beginning.&#8221;
Matthew is concerned with the coming of a Promised Savior.
Mark is concerned with the life of a Powerful Savior.
Luke is concerned with the grace of a Perfect Savior.
John is concerned with the possession of a Personal Savior.
All the Gospels are bound up with the Promises of the Messiah. We can see these in the Old Testament -
&#9; King - Psa. 72; Isa. 9:6,7, 32:1; Jer. 23:5; Zec. 9:9, 14:9
&#9; Servant - (Of Jehovah) Isa. 42:1-7, 52:13-15
&#9; Man - (The Son of Man) Gen. 22:18; Isa. 7:14,15, 9:6
&#9; God - (The Son of God) Isa. 7:14,15, 9:6, 40:3-5, 47:4
##Types of Men Now and Then
###The Jew -
Had special training. Steeped in the OT scriptures and the prophets. Matthew writes especially for them. If the Jew was to be impressed, it would have to be by one of his own race His teacher must be a man versed in the OT and in the customs of the Jews. They must know that this Jesus came to fulfill the prophecies of the OT. Over and over we read in Matthew - &#8220;That it might be fulfilled...as was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet.&#8221; We see the same type of person today. They dwell in prophecies fulfilled and unfulfilled. They seek to know what the prophets have spoken and how it came to pass.
###The Roman -&#9;
The master of the world at this time. Mark writes for them. Romans knew nothing about Old Testament Scripture. They were not interested in prophecy being fulfilled. Vitally concerned over a remarkable leader who had appeared in Palestine. They wanted to know if he really possessed extraordinary powers. Likes the straightforward message of Mark. 1,375 times &#8220;and&#8221; is used. Mark is filled with deeds not with words. Clearly it is the Gospel of the Ministry of Christ. The Romans in Jesus&#8217; day were as average business men of today. He was not concerned at first about the genealogy of a king, but with a God &#8220;who is able&#8221;, a God who can meet man&#8217;s every need. Mark is the business man&#8217;s Gospel.
###The Greek - &#9;
Luke wrote to the Greeks. The Greeks loved They were lovers of beauty poetry, and culture. They lived in a world of large ideas. Their tastes were fastidious (hard to please; dainty in taste; easily disgusted). Luke tells of the birth of Jesus and His childhood. The Greek is the type of the student and of the idealist today who is seeking after truth for he believes that is the secret of happiness.
###All Men &#8211;
John is writing to all men that they might believe that Jesus is the Christ. Christ is portrayed as the Son of God This Gospel is filled with extraordinary claims that attest His divine character and mission The &#8220;all men&#8221; represent the masses today that need Christ. His call goes out &#8211; &#8220;whosoever will.&#8221;
##Keys to the Gospels
###Matthew&#9;
Right at the entrance - The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham. (Matt. 1:1) This shows His covenant position as Son of Abraham, and His royal position as Son of David. (Psa. 132:11) Matthew is presenting Christ as King He gives the royal genealogy in the first 17 verses. A king is not chosen by popular ballot, but by birth.
King of Kings (28:18-20) The king commanding and commissioning His disciples. The Messiah is still on the earth. &#8220;All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations...to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.&#8221; (28:18-20)
###Mark&#9;
No genealogy. Jesus is portrayed as a servant. No one is interest in the pedigree of a servant.
Significant and appropriate. &#8220;And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them.&#8221; (16:20) Jesus, the servant is pictured as still laboring with His disciples.
###Luke&#9;
Genealogy begins in Luke 3:23. Matthew traces Christ&#8217;s line back to Abraham and David to show He was a Jew and of the royal line. Luke traces His line back to Adam. Christ is presented as the perfect man. He was of the line of Adam. Adam was created perfect
Different - Jesus, the perfect man, is ascending to the Father. &#8220;He was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.&#8221; (24:51) Carried - we will be carried by His power in power. The perfect man is our goal, busy for the Lord, caught up to the Father.
###John&#9;&#9;
No earthly genealogy, but a heavenly one. &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; (John 1:1,2) Christ is portrayed as the Son of God in John. (The four genealogies - Matthew 1:1-17; Mark; Luke 3:23-38; John 1:1,2)
###Last verse - &#8220;And there are also many other things...&#8221; (21:25) Truly, never a man spake like this man (7:46), for He is the very son of God.&#8221; Shows Christ&#8217;s eternal nature, no beginning - no ending; He is the Son of God.
