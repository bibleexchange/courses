#Divine Guidance
text: Psalms 25; Proverbs 25

##Introduction

The best guidance is when God speaks to me.

- Proverbs 25:1 
There was none wiser than Solomon and there was no better king than Hezekiah. There was still a work to be finished after Hezekiah.

- Psalm 25

Psalm 25 comes in a time when David was under threat from his enemies 

Stay in the battle and in the work of God. Knowing there will be fierce enemies we can yet remain where God puts us.

>I Corinthians 10:13 -- God is faithful and will nt...

If we want God to Guide us, pray for it. DIVINE GUIDANCE. It is not just going to happen, but we must seek Him that He will Guide us.

##David Finds Himself Under Attack

>Ps 25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.

##Under attack the soul gets cast down needs to be lifted up (Psalm 25:1)

Lift up your hands with your soul! We find a breaking in our spirit often when we lift up holy hands and bend yielded knees. (Job 11:13; Ps 86:4; Ps 88:9; 143:6; La 3:41)

To what do I lift up my soul? Unto vanity? Unto God? Turn your heart to full surrender with uplifted hands.

##Crying to MY God (Psalm 25:2)

David is drawing near to God and drawing away from his enemies. 

>Ps 25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.

>Ps 25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.

Let the assurance of his promise have preeminence - "I trust in Thee". Hold on and don't let go. Pray that God will help us to praise Him and overcome ALL our enemies.
That he may prevail over his enemies. let not my enemies triumph over me.

His chief concern is of being put to shame, not a fear for his own reputation, but concern that the whole foundation of his reign and the nation's godly basis would be overthrown. For it had come to a contest between God and evil (exposed in the immorality in his own family) and between God and idols.

What enemies do i face? lying, pride, idolatry, bitterness

##Paying the Price in Prayer (Psalm 25:3)

Prayer is talking to God, but it is also hearing from God. As We put our trust in God, we can expect an answer to prayer (v. 3). Because our hope fear and trust is in the Lord, we will not be put to shame. It is the treacherous without excuse – those who have turned against God 

##Paying the Price in the Word (Psalm 25:4,5)
That God will guide him in (God's) ways... paths 

>Ps 25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

He wants to act according to God's will, in accordance with the truth. 
he has no Plan B. God is our Saviour and our hope is in him all the day long, there is no other to turn to at any time.

##God Has Not Forgotten You (Psalm 25:6) 

>Ps 25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.

Never write your self off or anyone else. God's ways are higher than our ways, we need His instruction!

##God will Forgive Our Sins (Psalm 25:7) 
>7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 

Pray not just for since committed, but that God would give us the necessary grace to no longer continue in our sin.

David had committed graves sins in his youth (namely adultery and murder). God had warned him that he would reap what he had sown. (2 Samuel 12:10-12; Ga 6:7,8; Ho 8:7; 10:12-13)

There are consequences to our sin. One thing is though God forgets, You may not and the devil certainly will remember it. David remembers his sin here. "I just want to live like it never happened!" But that isn't how it works.

God can get you above the sins of your past. This is only the beginning of the harvest. We have to ask God to guide us with mercy and love. This we can ask with great confidence, since God covenanted his love... from of old. He is only asking for what God has promised and what is in his character.

##Teach Sinners (Psalm 25:8)

>8 ¶ Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.

David lets the assurance of God settle in here in verse 8. Praying withe more fervency "I'm going to trust God." I have a responsibility to trust God above my fears.

God has given David the assurance he needs of forgiveness, guidance and ultimate victory. He now turns this into a proclamation of the ways of the Lord 

	8 Good and upright is the LORD:
9 The meek will he guide in judgment:
10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.

11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.

iniquity... is great (adultery, lies and murder).
Ps 25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.  
18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

Having received this assurance, he can now share it with others 
Ps 25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
 13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. 
 14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant. 
 15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. 

Whoever is of his mind (chooses God’s Will God’s Way– the man who fears the Lord – can be sure he will be well instructed in the way (v. 12). 

He can count on receiving the blessings of God and on passing them on to his descendants (v. 13). But there is more! He will be admitted to God's 'wonderful counsel' – “The secret of the LORD” (v. 14), which is the heart of His covenant 

There were those who only knew the Sinai covenant, which granted ownership of the land to those who kept its laws, there were also those who knew the covenant of grace, the intimate knowledge of him who was their God  

Jer 31:31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
 32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 
 33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
 34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

Ro 2:28 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
 29 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
Paul draws this distinction 
Ro 9:6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:
Joh 15:15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
Ps 25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. {pluck: Heb. bring forth}

This inspires him to even greater loyalty my eyes are ever on the LORD (15) which expresses both concentration and expectation. His present troubles are like a snare, causing both pain and hindrance; but he will release my feet – only he.

David prays more earnestly

Ps 25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
 17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
 18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
 19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. 
 20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
 21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
 22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

Has he lost the assurance of verses 8-15 and become disheartened. No. 
•	Assurance is not in himself. 
•	Assurance looks the situation full in the face. 
o	David is facing facts, not giving way to despair. 
o	He is alone alot and afflicted (v. 16), 
o	many in his family and nation do not share his godly desire. 
	he takes this seriously, the troubles of (his) heart (are) multiplied (v. 17), and he is in anguish... affliction and... distress (v. 18). 
	He accepts his part of the blame because of his sins. His enemies have increased and their hatred has become more fierce (v. 19).
But he is not lying down under all this; he is falling on his knees in prayer: 

Ps 25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me 

O bring thou me out of my distresses.
 18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed;
21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

turn to me and be gracious to me... free me... look upon (me)... see. 

To bring your troubles to God is not to give way to despair, it is to exercise faith and hope. It shows not lack of assurance but expectation of great changes. 
Prayer is not the whineing Post of a wimp the grumbling corner of the distressed
Prayer changes things –There is Power in Prayer

So, having asked the Lord to take note of his affairs, he now petitions him, as he did at the beginning: 'Guard and Guide my life' from the enemy, 'rescue me', let me not be put to shame by allowing ungodliness to triumph. That David's faith is as strong as when he wrote verses 8-15 

“I wait on thee”  - find deliverance, take refuge in the Lord 

A Expression of Assured Faith

20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed;
21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.



(1)	How can complete forgiveness of sin be consistent with the idea that it still has consequences? 

Ga 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
 8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
 
Ps 25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.

God works with the choices we make but there is always consequences when we choose other than His Word, His Will, His Way.

Pr 25:1 ¶ These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.

No greater king than Hezekiah occupied the throne of David under the Old Covenant. 
Hezekiah was a wise leader.
Hezekiah's father Ahaz weak ruler and his son Manasseh a wicked ruler. 
The great prophet Isaiah was Hezekiah's friend, counselor, guide, and (some think) father-in-law. A tremendous religious revival took place during Hezekiah's reign and, under his guidance, temple worship was restored and a great Passover was kept. Hezekiah outlawed the idolatries of former kings and stood firm when the northern kingdom of Israel fell in ruins before the Assyrians and its people were marched away into captivity. 
Hezekiah was to face the enemy or cry out to God, He chose to cry out to God.
A glorious deliverance came, not by sword or bow, but by prayer and prophecy, and by the hand of an angel.
2Ki 19:1 ¶ And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
The Assyrian tide of came to Judah but Hezekiah saw God work a mighty miracle of deliverance (2 Kings 19).
2Ki 19:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.                                     7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.         
14 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.                                                            16 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.                                                                                                                     17 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
2Ki 19:31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.                    32 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. 33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.                                                                             34 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
2Ki 19:35 ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
Hezekiah's noblest work, was with the holy Scriptures. He not only edited some of Solomon's previously unpublished proverbs and added them to the sacred text; he also added a number of Psalms—The fifteen "songs of degrees" (Psalms 120-134). The number fifteen corresponds with the number of years that were added to Hezekiah's life. He seems to have written ten of the fifteen himself. The number ten corresponds with the number of degrees that the shadow of the sun went backward on the sundial of Ahaz (2 Kings 20:1-11). 

Ps 25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.






Pr 25:2 ¶ It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.
A wise king encourages learning, explores, helps finance research, and supports scientific discovery. We live in a complex universe. The more we know, the less we know. The field of medicine provides an example. A doctor who was an expert on diabetes said to a group of medical men he was addressing at a convention some years ago, that in spite of all the research he and others had done, they really knew little about the disease. He confessed to his colleagues, "Every time I get the answer to one question I have about this disease, it only raises another hundred questions to which I do not have the answer." When he sat down, the chairman thanked his learned colleague for "casting so much darkness on the subject." God conceals; man seeks out the answers.
God conceals the secrets of the atom, and man seeks them out.                                      We know that the center of the atom is made up of positively charged protons. Like charges repel.                                                                                            This law can be easily demonstrated by trying to bring together the positive poles of two magnets. Since they always push apart, it seems that the center of the atom should disintegrate—but it doesn't. For many years scientists referred to the force that holds the center of the atom together as unknown and mysterious. 
A greater mystery that God has concealed is the mystery of life itself. In seeking out the answers, man has discovered that each human body contains more than a million million (1,000,000,000,000) cells; that each living cell contains as many as two hundred trillion tiny groups of atoms called molecules; that the nucleus of each cell is less than four-thousandths of an inch in diameter; and that each cell's components are enclosed in a membrane only one-half of a millionth of an inch thick. Man has explored the master plan—that is, the code of life or blueprint carried by DNA. He has probed deeper and discovered chromosomes and genes. He has learned that genes contain instructions for making the particular kinds of protein that are the building blocks of life. He has even learned how to make artificial protein, manage genetic engineering, clone, and mutate life. Man has discovered much, but thousands of questions remain unanswered.                        Greatest of all mysteries God has concealed is the mystery of Spiritual life.
