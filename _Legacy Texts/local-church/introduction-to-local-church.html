<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
<h2>God&apos;s Church and God&apos;s Churches</h2>
<h3>God&apos;s Church</h3>
<p>We must understand the difference between &quot;The Church&quot; and &quot;churches.&quot; &quot;The Church&quot; is mystical, invisible, universal and general. It is also singular, for God has only one &quot;Church.&quot; It is the same &quot;Church in the past, present, and future. </p>
<h3>God&apos;s Churches</h3>
<p>The &quot;churches&quot; (local church) are real, concrete, visible, local, and specific. It is the universal Church as it is taking on local or temporal form. The word church, in the Greek, is ekklesia, which means to &quot;summon forth&quot; or &quot;to call out&quot; the people. The Hebrew word qahal means &quot;assembly&quot; or &quot;congregation. (Ps. 22:22) In our study, the word &quot;Ekklesia&quot; we will be considered in the context of: a local body of Believers gathered together for worship of God and fellowship. (Eph. 4:16)</p>
<h2>God&apos;s Order for this Age is the Local Church</h2>
<p>Today, many do not respect the local church as God&apos;s permanent order for this church age. The structure of the local church may vary with size or locality, but it is still God&apos;s order for this age. The local church is divinely patterned for effective evangelizing of the world and bringing his people to maturity.</p>
<h3>Islands are Rebellious</h3>
<p>We must relate to a local body and not become an island to ourselves. To separate ourselves from the local body is unscriptural. We are all parts of the same body. Not one of us is to be independent of the other. It is God&apos;s plan and purpose that each member of his universal body be joined to a local body of Believers. A man, or woman, who refuses to join themselves to a local body of Believers often feels they are wasting their effort. This type of spirit is a rebellious and independent spirit and is contrary to Scripture. </p>
<p>Within the Old Testament tabernacle, there was a designated place of worship. The Believer was not to remain at home to worship. He was to gather with the local body in a designated place of worship. There is no Scriptural basis for remaining at home to worship while the local body is gathering even if you do enjoy the &quot;Electronic Evangelist&quot; more than the local elders.</p>
<h3>Becoming an Island Alienates You from the Umbrella of Providence</h3>
<p>Church order and leadership were clearly seen in the Old Testament. Aaron and his sons were a type of the N.T. fivefold ministry. (Eph 4:13) The watchmen on the walls of the cities of Israel are a type of the leaders of the N.T. church who are watching for our souls. It is the responsibility of the elders to guard against those with erroneous teachings who would kill and destroy the body. (Heb. 13:17) The shepherds upon the hillside of Judah and Israel were a type of God&apos;s chosen leadership for his church today. They are not only entrusted with the care and guidance of the flock but of feeding the flock of God with nourishing spiritual food. (Acts 20:28)</p>
<h2>God&apos;s Pattern for the Local Church</h2>
<h3>God Has Set His Pattern in Scripture</h3>
<p>In his Word, God offers a pattern for the formation of local churches. First, he directed Believers to assemble together in given locations. (Heb. 10:25) Next he ordains where to establish a local church, often where not to.(Acts 16:6-10) God puts into place the leadership ministries he would have in each local assembly.(Acts 14:23) Though most in the church recognizes that God designates leaders, they do not give much thought about the fact that God also brings in embers. (I Cor. 12:18) We should carefully consider God&apos;s placement in the best church for them, especially in this day of running to and fro by many church members.(Job 1:7) If God sets us in a particular church as members or leaders, we must remain there until God moves us and not before. Never should we move because we have been offended.</p>
<h3>God&apos;s Principles for Church Government</h3>
<p>There are some basic principles of church government, which we must observe if we want to fully follow God&apos;s pattern.</p>
<h4>Sovereignty of the Local Body</h4>
<p>Nowhere in Scripture does God teach a denominational type of church government. Each local church is to be a sovereign body, even though they are to enjoy fellowship with other local assemblies. </p>
<h4>Life in the Local Body</h4>
<p>The church is first to be a spiritual &quot;organism&quot; and then to be an &quot;organization&quot;. Good church government will not produce spirituality. In the church of the living God, there must be life before structure. </p>
<h4>Order in the Local Body</h4>
<p>After there is life, good structure in the form of church government will help to maintain life. As a family requires parents, and as a flock requires a shepherd, so the household of faith requires spiritual leaders. We need the fivefold ministry so that we may come to maturity within the body. (Eph. 4:11-13) Leaders cannot give what they do not possess. They must meet the scriptural qualifications seen in I Timothy 3. A common error today is the belief that we do not need men to lead us, that &quot;we have the Holy Spirit to lead us, don&apos;t we?&quot; The Spirit leads and governs the church through human vessels. (Heb. 13:17) To bypass everyone and seek leading only from God is usually the sign of a rebellious and independent spirit. These people often use a verse of Scripture out of context, such as, I Jn. 2:27 to justify refusing submission to God-anointed and God-called teachers. If we choose to reject the teaching that God has ordained, a strong oversight in the ministry within the Body of Christ, God will permit us to find isolated Scriptures to satisfy our rebellion and independence. God appoints leaders and directs them to set the house in order. (II Thess. 2:10-12)</p>
