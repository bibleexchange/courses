<h1>Chapter 4: The Kingdom</h1>
<p>In this section we will examine the Kingdom. The term itself denotes sovereignty, power, and dominion. As we consider the Kingdom in relation to God and his sovereignty, power and dominion, we will see the many facets of his Kingdom. </p>
<p>God&apos;s sovereignty is in the heavens. Jesus asks that we acknowledge this on a daily basis when he taught us how to pray, &quot;thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.&quot; (Matthew 6:10).</p>
<p>First, let us look at his rule on earth. God only rules where his rule is acknowledged. His earthly rule only exists on two levels. On the first level, he rules in the lives and heart of the individual believer. </p>
<p>Are study is more concerned with the second, the local assembly of believers. </p>
<p>The scriptures reveal several things about the kingdom.</p>
<p>First, the good news of Christ is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew reports, &quot;Jesus went about preaching the gospel of the Kingdom.&quot; (Matthew 4:23). </p>
<p>Second, the kingdom is at hand here and now. John the Baptist commanded us, in Matthew 3:2, to &quot;repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot; </p>
<p>Third, entrance into the kingdom is only through the new birth. Jesus emphasized this in his interview with Nicodemus when he said, &quot;except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God,&quot; (John3:3). </p>
<p>Forth, the kingdom is within the believer. When the Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied that, &quot;behold, the kingdom of God is within you&quot; (Luke 17:21). </p>
<p>Even while on earth, as believers we have a part of the affairs in the kingdom. The scriptures teach us emphatically that we have authority over angels, demon, disease, the world, and sin. (1Corintians 6:2-3, Mark 16:17-18, Romans 6:11-14). This authority should not be mistaken for a guarantee that the believer will not suffer any tribulation. Even though we have the power to work miracles, we must remember that in this present state in the kingdom, there is a degree of tribulation involved. </p>
<p>Paul exhorted the believers of his day who were subjected to much persecution by assuring them &quot;that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God&quot; (Acts 14:22). Jesus also warned, in John 16:33, that &quot;in the world you should have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.&quot;. As we face the trails of life let us ascertain that we are in Christ. It is only as we are in him, that we are found to be overcomers, worthy to be a member in the kingdom at the time of the end when Christ subjecting himself to the father presents the kingdom unto him (1Corinthians 15:24). </p>
<p>There are numerous erroneous views concerning the kingdom. Some see it all Jewish. If this is so, there is not one scripture concerning the kingdom, which could relate to the church. Others see the kingdom as all future. If it were all future, none of the scriptures pertaining to the kingdom could relate to today. Still others see the kingdom as all literal and leave no room for any spiritual application to the scriptures speaking to us of the kingdom. </p>
<p>God fit truth together to fit his eternal plan. Man tends to separate and categorize truth, forgetting that he has a limited vision of god&apos;s eternal plan for the ages. The kingdom is not separate from God&apos;s plan. It blends in with the church of the living God. Which is God&apos;s one new Man, his holy nation and royal priesthood. Christ died for the Church he came to build. His dealings are first with the church, God&apos;s spiritual Israel, and then with the nations. The millennial reign will simply be a continuation of the one great kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In summery, we have briefly studied what the Bible has to say about the kingdom. </p>
<p>We have seen that the kingdom and the church are one. </p>
<p>We must endeavor to see the kingdom in its spiritual form now and not just as a natural reality for the future. As all studies of the Holy Scriptures, we must give the Holy Ghost freedom to apply the scriptures concerning God&apos;s entire kingdom to our lives. It may mean being open to truths contrary to traditional views of the kingdom. Jesus was an example of this when he rebuked the religious people of his day to holding so rigidly to traditions that they couldn&apos;t see the true teachings of the scriptures (Mark 7:5-9). </p>
<p>While studying the kingdom, as with any other doctrine of the scriptures, each and every scripture pertaining to that subject must fit into the doctrinal conclusions you arrive at. If you can&apos;t fit each scripture into your conclusion, it would be best to draw no conclusion at all, until the Holy Ghost is able to open the eyes of your heart to the matter. As Paul writes in Ephesians 1:18, &quot;the eyes of your understanding being enlightened.&quot;</p>
<p>The church is in Christ, unbelieving Israel as a nation is not. Paul explains in <blockquote>Rom. 9:31-33: &quot;but Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness. Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but as it were, by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone. As it is written: &quot;Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense, and whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.&quot; </blockquote></p>
<p>After Paul is saved and filled with the Holy Ghost we begin to hear of churches being established &quot;Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria (Acts 9:31).</p>
<p>Barnabas was to go as far as Antioch (Acts 11:22), and they quickly developed Acts 13:1. they were called the churches of the Gentiles (Rom.16:4).</p>
<p>Holy Ghost Believers are the body and Christ &quot;He is the head of the body, the church, (Col 1:18), Eph. 5:23 Christ is head of the church;&quot; Christ is the head of his body the church, which did not exist until after Christ ascended (Eph. 4:7-11, Eph. 1:22).</p>
<p>Holy Ghost filled Believers become a living temple, each person is united with the others like bricks in a building. in the old Testament Israel had a physical temple, the Holy Spirit did not dwell in every person who had faith.</p>
<p>The church is from &quot;out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation&quot; (Rev. 5:9).</p>
<p>The terms Israel and the church should never be confused.</p>
<p>In the book of Acts, both Israel and the church exist simultaneously.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Eph 2:11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: 13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. 14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new entity the church is made by &quot;the blood of His cross&quot; not the Old Testament sacrifices. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Col 1:20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ&apos;s blood that purchased the church, again distinguishing the sacrifices of the Old covenant that was for Israel.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit&apos;s purpose was to bring a spiritual birth to us individually and bring both Jews and Gentiles that were separated to be together a new entity- called the Church. Jesus sent the one He promised to empower them for the ministry so they would carry the message to the world. Acts 1:5 views Spirit baptism, our entrance into Christ and becoming the church as a future event. The church was birthed by the Spirit at Pentecost, Israel existed for 1500 years prior</p>
<p>After the Holy Spirit gave the church its birth, Acts 2:33 everyone throughout history that believes in the gospel continues to become part of the church by spirit baptism (1 Cor.12:13), by being baptized in the Spirit. You don&apos;t join a church you are baptized into it. The Greek word for church is is ekklesia (used 114 times in the New Testament) it means a called out assembly (Ek = out of Kaleo= to call).</p>
<p>Until the New Testament, the Church was a Mystery</p>
<p>Eph 5:32&mdash;This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The Church of God was known only in types and shadows before Christ came and and before the Holy Ghost was given in Acts chapter two. The Church was and in some ways still is a spiritual mystery. The Church is Spiritual and Consists of Spiritual Things.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Spiritual Love</li>
</ul>
<p>The Church consists of a spiritual love. Paul shows that it is a <i>secret</i> or that it is <i>spiritual</i> and differs greatly from the carnal ability of man. </p>
<ul>
<li>A Spiritual Power</li>
</ul>
<p>The church consists of the power of the Spirit, and not of the flesh, by faith, and not by a natural bond.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Spiritual Mystery</li>
</ul>
<p>The mystery concerns bringing Jews and Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ Jesus</p>
<blockquote>Ro 16:25&mdash;Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, </blockquote>
<blockquote>1Cor. 2:7&mdash;But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: </blockquote>
<p>When we come to the New Testament the church was in prototype before Pentecost as Jesus was training the 12 and the 70 and others. But the church is not in the Old Testament. Why?</p>
<blockquote>Matt 16:18&mdash;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&quot; </blockquote>
<p>Throughout the New Testament the church is liken a house built upon a foundation- which is Jesus and those who confess who He is as Peter did. Since one did not (nor could not) confess this in the Old Testament they cannot accurately say the nation of Israel was the Church. </p>
<p>It is only in this passage and Mt.18 that a church is first mentioned, and the prevailing view would be His instructions for the future.</p>
