<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>This study of the work of God is for the purpose of impressing upon the leaders of his people in every local body, that God&apos;s work is a progressive work. Although God himself has known from the beginning, He has chosen to reveal his work to man From Faith to faith. As we see in Isaiah 28:10:</p>

<blockquote>Precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little...</blockquote>

<p>It is strange indeed how we tend to put the temporal into a permanent perspective. Consider the many groups and individuals who, having received one portion of God&apos;s great revelation for the ages, proceed to expand it so out of proportion as to consider it &quot;the whole of God&apos;s Revelation&quot;, we have ceased to grow and thus have become stagnant and spiritually diseased. Consider Job&apos;s comment to his all-knowing friends in Job 12:2:</p>

<blockquote>No doubt, but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</blockquote>

<p>The only way we may avoid either becoming lukewarm or being contaminated with spiritual anemia is to continue to progress and to flow in the mainstream of the moving of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>All scripture portions and references are taken from the authorized King James Version of the Bible. I will endeavor to show, through the scripture, that God&apos;s work in the Local Assembly is a progressive work, and that the Holy Ghost is restoring the New Testament pattern to evangelize the world and to nurture the Body of believers. I trust that I will be able to identify, using the Holy Scriptures, what the New Testament pattern is and how it may be manifested in the Body of Believers.</p>
