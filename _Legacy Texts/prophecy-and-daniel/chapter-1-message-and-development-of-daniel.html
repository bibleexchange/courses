<h1>Chapter 1: Message and Development of Daniel</h1>
<h2>The Message of Daniel</h2>
<p>Dan. 1:1-3; 2:46-49; 5:1112; 5:29-6:3; 8:27-9:4</p>
<p>1. The Truth of It</p>
<p>Porphyry a Syrian in the third century -Not written by Daniel B.C. 533 - it was a forgery written in the time of the Maccabees about B.C. 168. After Autiochus Epiphanes. It was written before B.C. 175-165 (if not) How did it get into the Septuagint Greek Trans; completed B.C. 285 or over 100 years before it is claimed to be written. </p>
<p>Josephus says - of Alexander the Great who is foretold in Dan. 8:5-8 came to Jerusalem B.C. 332 Juddua the High Priest showed him the reference to himself.</p>
<p>Ezekiel was a contemporary of Daniel - Eze. 14:1420; 28:3. Jesus - Matt 24:15</p>
<p>Ashpenaz - Dan. 1:3 (Rabsaris) has been found upon a brick preserved in the British Museum.</p>
<p>2. The Theme of It</p>
<p>What is it all about? The Universal Sovereignty of God &quot;God is still on the throne.&quot;2:28; 4:25 Notice 1:2; 2:37; 5:18</p>
<p>3. The Time of It</p>
<p>At the beginning of Babylonian conquest.This is how the book opens. &quot;In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim King of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylonunto Jerusalem and besieged it.&quot; Dan. 1:1</p>
<p>Jeremiah 25:1 places this captivity in the fourth year of Jehoiakim Daniel in the third. Is this an error? Is the Bible wrong? The Jews counted every bit of a year as one year. Jeremiah is writing to the Jews. Daniel is writing more for the Gentiles. (9th month of the next year.) Also - The Babylonian conquest was in three stages. The servitude - the captivity - the destruction.</p>
<p>This is at the servitude stage - (3 years 9 months) Nebuchadnezzar demanded submission - Judah lost their independence -Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylon wit choicest treasures.Daniel was taken - at about sixteen years old.</p>
<p>The history of Daniel covers about seventy five years.</p>
<h2>4. The Aim of It -What does it set out to do? (They are in captivity.)</h2>
<p>(1) To encourage the people of God to the sovereignty of God</p>
<p>to see the purpose of God and to put their faith in God.</p>
<p>(2) To give them prophetic truth -</p>
<p>Speaks much of the future end-time Second coming.</p>
<p>(3) It is a missionary account -</p>
<p>To give a missionary vision.</p>
<h2>5. The Form of It - What form does this book take?</h2>
<p>Divided into two equal parts -</p>
<p>First six chapters history -</p>
<p>Second six chapters prophecy -</p>
<p>Ch. 1-6 Daniel revealing God&apos;s secrets to kings</p>
<p>Ch. 7-12 Angels revealing God&apos;s secrets to Daniel</p>
<p>What is history and what is prophecy? What is the difference between them? History is the record of events - present and past. Prophecy is history written in advance.</p>
<p>How did these men write prophetically? II Peter 1:21</p>
<h2>Why is the Book of Daniel different from the other prophetic books?</h2>
<p>God is not speaking to His own people. You don&apos;t find &quot;Thus saith the Lord.&quot; You don&apos;t find &quot;My people&quot; Isaiah - Hosea (Lo-Ammi - not my People.) In the closing chapters God says repeatedly &quot;Thy people&quot;&quot;Jehovah&quot; hardly ever occurs in Daniel -Only in Ch. 9 - Daniel is grieving for his own people.&quot;Jehovah&quot; is the covenant name for God. Not appropriate for Gentile world powers. The most usual name for God is &quot;Adonai-Elohim&quot; The Sovereign Lord God.</p>
<h2>Part of this book is written in Hebrew Ch. 1-2:3 - 8-12. Part in Aramaic - the ancient language of Syria Ch. 2:4 - end of Ch. 7 Why do you suppose it is written in two languages? What concerns the Gentile Empires is written in their language Aramaic and what concerns the Jews is written in Hebrew.</h2>
<p>6. The name of it -</p>
<p>(1) The book is like a diary of Daniel</p>
<p>&quot;I Daniel&quot; - No definite proof who wrote it. 7:15;8:1527;10:2 7</p>
<p>·Isa. 1:1 Written by Isaiah</p>
<p>·Jer. 1:1 Written by Jeremiah</p>
<p>·Eze. 1:3 Written by Ezekiel</p>
<p>(2) Believed to be written by Daniel when in Captivity</p>
<p>606 BC carried into the land of Babylon between 16-20 years old. Daniel was a great man. Became a great statesman of Babylon. Considered as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>(3) It is all about Daniel</p>
<p>How did Daniel get promoted so quickly? &quot;Daniel purposed in his heart&quot; 1:8</p>
<p>(a) Not to defile himself</p>
<p>(b) Not to disobey God</p>
<p>(c) Not to disappoint his people</p>
<p>God exalted him because of his obedience. Daniel is referred to as the revelation of Jesus Christ in the O.T.</p>
