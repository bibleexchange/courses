	<h1>The Son and Humanity 2:5-18</h1>
			<h1>A.    Lowly man regaining his integrity. 2:5-8,13</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">As the contrast continues betweenChrist and the angels (2:5) our attention is focused on the future."The world to come" There has always been the hope for a golden age. CHRIST is the sovereign of the future and He has plenty of power to accomplish His purpose and plenty of time for He is eternal. OUR future well-being depends upon our present well-doing. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 2:8 Man failed and lost his dominion. 2:5 Christ is the ruler of the world to come. The overcomer will reign with Christ. Dan. 7:27; Psa. 37:11; Matt. 5:5; Rom. 4:13; Rev. 2:27; Psa.2:8,9; II Tim. 2:12; Rev. 5:10</p>
			<blockquote>Hebrews 2:6 -- What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?"</blockquote>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">This question arose in Psa. 8:3. It is in contrast with God's great creation of the heavens, man appears to be insignificant. Why should God care about a lowly man? B Three Reasons Why Heb.2:7,8</p>
			<h2>1     God made man. Gen. 1:26,27; 2:7; James 4:14 </h2>
			<h2>(Dust of the ground &amp; Breath of God)</h2>
			<h2>2  God crowned Him with glory and honor.</h2>
			<h2>3  God put all things in subjection under Him.</h2>
			<h2>Heb. 2:8 "But now we see not yet all things under Him"</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Why should an unfailing God seek continuously a failing people? As long as we look to man, the question goes on unanswered. 2:9 "But we see Jesus" When we look to Jesus, the question is answered. (Luke 19:10; John 1:14; Matt. 11:29)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">2:10 "Many sons" Like His only begotten Son. The desire of the ages is only fulfilled in Christ (Eph. 2:7;3:5; 3:21; Col. 1:26). God's Eternal purpose is purposed in Christ Jesus, ourLord (Eph. 3:11).</p>
			<h1>B.     The purpose of the Son of God partaking of the flesh. 2:9-18</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">-1              Christ's purpose in his first coming was to fulfill God's Eternal purpose2:9-10 God made man from dust. Sin is making an attempt to bring all flesh to dust again, separating Man from the breath of God. Man was made a noblecreature with the ability to glorify God and live a life of richness and honor.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">What happened? Sin (Rom. 3:23; Gen. 2:17; Ez. 18:4, 20) Lucifer went outside his limits and fell down. When man stepped outside his limits the world refused to be limited by him.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">John 14:30-31 Christ became man and stayed within the limits of love and obedience to the Father and brought the earth back into subjection to man. He paid the penalty of sin. Jesus destroyedthe works of the devil. (Heb. 2:14; I John 3:8) And put the plan of salvationinto effect.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Jesus was crowned with glory and honor as a man and He was exalted to the Father's right hand in Glory. Heb.1:3-2:9; Col.13:4</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 12:2 Jesus endured the cross"For the joy that was set before Him"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Jesus is the captain of salvation in bringing many sons unto Glory. Heb.2:10 "bringing many son's unto glory." Christ identified Himself with humanity as the son of man .Now He associates humanitywith Himself. He gives the believer the power to become sons of God. John 1:12</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (2) Tomake the sanctifier and the sanctified all of one. (Heb. 2:11-14)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">vs. 11 the union of the Redeemerand the redeemed is set forth</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">In bold print. The sanctifierand the saved are of God and are called brethren.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">vs. 12 - Psa. 22:22; vs. 13 - Isa.8:17-18; vs. 17 - An expression of faith to God</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">vs. 18 - Isaiah associates himselfwith his children as signs given from God to his generation. Isaiah trustedand stood before God with his children as a sign for the future Isa. 9:6-7</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 2:12 - Christ declares theFather's name "unto" His brethren</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 2:13 - Christ puts His trustin the Father and stands with them.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Isa. 12:2 Psa. 18:2 "andagain"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">
				Without the incarnation, thisidentification would be impossible.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 2:14 - Human, flesh and blood</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Jesus took part in the flesh; thelife of the blood was Divine</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The real humanity and the realdeity is stressed in Hebrews</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Only as Jesus, the true Son of God,become the true man</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Could He purchase our redemption?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 2:13 - "And again I will putmy trust in Him."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Man at first only trusted God</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Man was crowned 2:7 The crown isattainable through Christ.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> (3) Toenable the Son to help the tempted 2:16-18</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The glorious purposes ofsalvation are addressed to man NOT to Angels.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">2:16 - "He took not on Himthe nature of angels, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham." Heb. 7:14</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">When His own received Him not,(John 1:11), His message spread to the whole world. John 3:16</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">In order to redeem His brethren, Hewas made like them. 2:17He became the true man. The high priest must be humanand chosen among men. If He is to understand and represent fallen humanitybefore the  Majesty on High, He must know the meaning of temptationand suffering. One of the early heresies in the early Church was Docetism.&nbsp;"They said Jesus seemed to be human but wasn't. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The writer in Hebrews leaves noquestion. To become our High Priest, Jesus had to share humanity to the pointof suffering. The High Priest Ministry </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">2:17 - "In things pertaining toGod, to make reconciliation for the sin of the people. As the High Priestof the O.T. offered sacrifices, Jesus offered Himself to the Father as asacrifice for all mankind. Jesus was merciful. Jesus was personally freefrom sin, but the sufferings of humanity Has Enabled Him to know man's motives,temptations and weaknesses. Isa. 42:1-4 Matt. 12:18-21 Luke4:16-20, 24</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The bruised reed He did not break. EvenJerusalem rejected Him. He still wept over their sins. The penitent sinnerfound forgiveness. The Pharisee was rejected. Jesus was faithful.</p>
