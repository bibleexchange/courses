Compelled to cease from his attempt to destroy the Woman because she has been raptured away out of his reach&#44; the dragon now turns to make war with the remnant of her seed.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">The Remnant of Her Seed</span></h2><p><span lang="en">Defeated beyond remedy in his attack on the Church (theWoman) the dragon changes his focus and enters into a war with the

</u>of the Church&#44; &quot;<i>...the remnant of her seed.</i>&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en"><i>&quot;The remnant of her seed&quot;</i>means the children of the&quot;Woman.&quot; This &quot;<i>remnant</i>&quot; is the born again believers (the family ofGod). The <i>&quot;remnant&quot;</i>is that which remains -- that which is left out of the whole -- that which is left from the Rapture of the Church.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Some believe &quot;<i>the remnant</i>&quot; to be two classes of people -- the Jews and the Gentiles. Remember&#44; the Jews are not the seed of theWoman. In fact&#44; they are very much opposed to the Church and to the NewTestament teaching that Jesus is God manifested in the flesh&#44; and that He is their Jewish Messiah.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Remnant Identified</span></p><p><span lang="en">The &quot;<i>...remnant of her seed...</i>&quot; are the true believers inChrist who are left after the Rapture of the Church. These held fast theconfession of their faith in Christ Jesus and are a separated people from the prevailing abomination of that time. Notice&#44; now there is a definite distinction between the masses who confess Christ and those who <i>&quot;...keep the commandments of God.&quot;</i>(Rev. 12: 17)</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 7: 21--23 &quot;Not every one that saith unto Me&#44; Lord&#44; Lord&#44; shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day&#44; Lord&#44; Lord&#44; have we not prophesied inThy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them&#44; I never knew you: depart from Me&#44; ye that work iniquity.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Remnant Defined</span></p><p><span lang="en">The <i>&quot;...remnant of her seed...&quot;</i>is the saved; it is not the Church (the Woman). The baptism of the Spirit is required to be in theChurch (His Body). The remnant had not been baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ (His Church; the Woman). </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 12: 13 &quot;For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body&#44;whether we be Jews or Gentiles&#44; whether we be bond or free; and have been allmade to drink into one Spirit.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Paul makes it very plain in Eph. 1: 22&#44; 23 that the Church is His body.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;And hath put all things under His feet&#44; and gave Him to be the head overall things to the Church&#44; Which is His body&#44; the fulness of Him that fillethall in all.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Either these were never baptized or they had allowed their experience to go dry. Like the five foolish virgins&#44; they 
<u>were virgins
</u>&#44;but they had allowed the oil to go dry.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 7--10 &quot;Then all those virgins arose&#44; and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise&#44; Give us of your oil; for

</u>. But the wise answered&#44; saying&#44; Not so; lestthere be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell&#44; and buyfor yourselves. And while they went to buy&#44; the Bridegroom came; and they thatwere ready went in with Him to the <b>

This will force many to receive the mark.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 13: 16&#44; 17 &quot;And he causeth all&#44; both small and great&#44; rich and poor&#44;free and bond&#44; to receive a mark in their right hand&#44; or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell&#44; save he that had the mark&#44; or the name of the beast&#44; or the number of his name.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 16: 2 &quot;And the first went&#44; and poured out his vial upon the earth;and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark ofthe beast&#44; and upon them which worshipped his image.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 20 &quot;And the beast was taken&#44; and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him&#44; with which he deceived them that had received themark of the beast&#44; <b>
