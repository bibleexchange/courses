&nbsp;That is, the Faith that had been lost through tradition, opinions and human ideas. &nbsp;Remember: &nbsp;The Bible says, &ldquo;The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: &nbsp;for they are foolishness unto him: &nbsp;neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned&rdquo; &nbsp;(I Cor. 2:14).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">	Again, the Bible says, &ldquo;As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear hear, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. &nbsp;But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: &nbsp;for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God&rdquo;

&nbsp;I was so taken up with trying to understand what God was saying to me by the vision of the train that I really did not grasp what the Spirit was saying. &nbsp;I watched the train as it raced through the night and came into a turn. &nbsp;As it began to make the turn, the trees and grass were lit up along the tracks. &nbsp;The Sprit said again, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;The train made the turn and headed down the track. &nbsp;I could see out into the night. &nbsp;The track was lit up by the light. &nbsp;Again, the Spirit said, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;Suddenly, I saw the train slowing down and coming to a stop. &nbsp;When it stopped, the Spirit said again, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;Still I did not understand what God was trying to tell me. &nbsp;After a moment the train began to move again. &nbsp;As the big wheels on the engine began to move and the train began to move down the track, the Spirit said again, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;This time I was made to understand what the Spirit was saying. &nbsp;As the train moved, the light moved; when the train stopped, the light stopped.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">	We must move in the light that we have for God to give us more. &nbsp;If we stop moving on in the direction of the light (truth), the light will stop.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">	Hebrews 6:1, &ldquo;Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, </span><span class="csCB85FE24">let us go on</span><span class="cs6DA126DA"> unto perfection: &nbsp;not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Ephesians 4:11-14, &ldquo;He gave some, apostles;
