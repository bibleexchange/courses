been said, &ldquo;The book to write is the one that you would like to read and cannot find anywhere.&rdquo; &nbsp;One of the reasons for the writing of this book is the fact that I could not find one that presented these truths in a manner in which truth was not distorted. &nbsp;Many express men&rsquo;s opinions, but it is my intent to express the truth itself. &nbsp;The primary reason for this book is that I believe God spoke to my spirit by His Spirit to &ldquo;</span><span class="csC8468922">write in a book the things, which you have seen and heard.</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">In this book I present to you the Truth as the Spirit of God revealed it to me through visions, revelation, study and information given to me by spirit-filled, God-fearing people. &nbsp;The truth presented in this book is not the popular consensus of fundamental groups, but is the only view that presents the truth in a consistent, logical, honest, intelligent and comprehensible manner.</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Beginning with the Reformation, God began restoring &ldquo;</span><span class="csC8468922">the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&rdquo; &nbsp;That is, the Faith which had been lost through tradition, opinions and human ideas. &nbsp;Remember, the Bible says, &ldquo;</span><span class="csC8468922">The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&rdquo; &nbsp;(I Cor. 2: 14) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Again, the Bible says, &ldquo;As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. &nbsp;But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.&rdquo; &nbsp;(I Cor. 2: 9, 10) &nbsp;This tenth verse in the Amplified NT reads, &ldquo;Yet to us God has unveiled and revealed them by and through His Spirit, for the (Holy) Spirit searches diligently, exploring and examining everything, even soundings the profound and bottomless things of God &ndash; the divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man&rsquo;s scrutiny.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Remember what Jesus said, &ldquo;</span><span class="csC8468922">If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&rdquo; (Jn. 7: 17) &nbsp;There has to be obedience to the truth already revealed to receive more truth.</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Prov. 4: 18 &nbsp;&ldquo;The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Several years ago, while I was praying God gave me a vision. &nbsp;In the vision I saw a train moving rapidly through the night. &nbsp;While I was watching this vision, I was trying to understand what God was saying to me. &nbsp;There was a night scene, a fast moving train and a light shining out into the night. &nbsp;The Spirit spoke to me and said, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;I was so taken up with trying to understand what God was saying to me by the vision of the train, that I really did not grasp what the Spirit was saying. &nbsp;I watched the train as it raced through the night and came into a turn. &nbsp;As it began to make the turn, the trees and grass were lit up along the tracks. &nbsp;The Spirit said again, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;The train made the turn and headed down the track. &nbsp;I could see out into the night. &nbsp;The track was lit up by the light. &nbsp;Again, the Spirit said, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;Suddenly, I saw the train slowing down and coming to a stop. &nbsp;When it stopped, the Spirit said again, &ldquo;Watch the light.&rdquo; &nbsp;Still I did not understand what God

		<p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Another school of thought, and a more prominent teaching today, is the belief that she is literal Israel. &nbsp;Dr. James Gray says, &ldquo;The Woman represents Israel, it is believed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Believed by whom? &nbsp;It is believed by most, if not all Pre-Tribulation rapturists, because their teaching about the </span><span class="cs9B7660D">time</span><span class="cs1DA2E76"> of the rapture requires it. &nbsp;Since their reasoning is that the Church is to be raptured before the Tribulation, she cannot represent the Church, so she must represent Israel.</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Dr. Schofield is of the same opinion &ndash; &ldquo;The Woman: Israel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Many say she must be Israel because of what the prophet Isaiah said:</span></p><h2 class="csCA86F79B">
			<span class="csC8468922">Isa. 66: 7 &nbsp;&ldquo;Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.&rdquo;</span></h2>
		<p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Look very carefully at the two prophecies &ndash; this one in Isaiah is different from the one that is stated in Rev. 12: 2, which states &ldquo;&hellip;</span><span class="csC8468922">travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">&rdquo; &nbsp;The one says a Woman is in pain travailing to bring forth a Man-Child, and the other says that before she travailed she brought forth. &nbsp;Before her pain came, she was delivered. &nbsp;So then, they are not the same experience.</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Israel as a nation was unaware of it producing the Christ, the &ldquo;Man-Child&rdquo; of Isa. 66: 7. &nbsp;The Woman in Revelation cried, travailing in birth and pained to be delivered of a &ldquo;Man-Child.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The first thing to understand concerning the nation of Israel is that Israel was an earthly heritage. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">An earthly people &ndash; an earthly kingdom &ndash; earthly possessions</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">The only mention of Israel and the heavens is Abraham&rsquo;s seed being as the stars of the sky, and then only of those that are spiritual &ndash; believers.</span></p><h2 class="csCA86F79B">
			<span class="csC8468922">Rom. 9: 6&ndash;8 &nbsp;&ldquo;Not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect.

		<p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Also, look at the nation of Israel in her spiritual condition as pictured in the Scripture. &nbsp;Israel as a nation is pictured in the book of Hosea as an unfaithful wife and a harlot on the streets. &nbsp;As you look at Israel today, you can see that this is her condition rather than that of a place of honor.</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs1DA2E76">Here in Revelation a Woman is pictured as &ldquo;</span><span class="csC8468922">clothed with the sun</span><span class="cs1DA2E76">,&rdquo; producing a &ldquo;Man&ndash;Child&rdquo; which was caught up to God and to His throne.</span></p><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
