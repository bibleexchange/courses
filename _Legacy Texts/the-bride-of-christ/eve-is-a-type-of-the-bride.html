<h1><span lang="en">Eve Is A Type of the Bride</span></h1><p><span lang="en"><b>Adam and Eve</b></span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Gen. 2: 21--23 &quot;And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam&#44; andhe slept: and He took one of his ribs&#44; and closed up the flesh insteadthereof; And the rib&#44; which the LORD God had taken from man&#44; made He a woman&#44;and brought her unto the man. And Adam said&#44; This is now bone of my bones&#44; andflesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman&#44; because she was taken out ofman.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Adam is a type of the Mystical Body of Christ&#44; which is theChurch. Eve&#44; taken from Adam&#39;s body is a clear type of the Bride of Christ. There are several points that prove the whole Church is not the Bride ofChrist. It was only a rib that was taken out of the body&#44; which was used toform the Bride.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">  Eve Was Taken out of Adam&#39;s Body While He Slept</span></h2><blockquote><span lang="en">Gen. 2: 21&#44; 22 &quot;And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam&#44;and he slept: and He took one of his ribs&#44; and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib&#44; which the LORD God had taken from man&#44; made He a woman&#44;and brought her unto the man.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">While the Church (the Mystical Body of Christ) sleeps&#44; Godis performing an operation&#44; taking out&#44; as it were&#44; a &quot;Rib&quot; company and forming a Bride. Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 5 &quot;While the bridegroom tarried&#44; they all slumbered and slept.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Rom. 13: 11 &quot;And that&#44; knowing the time&#44; that now it ishigh time to

</u>: for now is our salvation (&quot;soteria&quot; -- deliverance) nearer than when we believed.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">When one sleeps&#44; they are unaware of their condition.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 17 &quot;Because thou sayest&#44; I am rich&#44; and increased with goods&#44; and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched&#44; and miserable&#44;and poor&#44; and blind&#44; and naked:&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">However&#44; God will awaken the Church&#44; after the Bride has been taken out&#44; during the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">Eve Was Taken out of Adam&#39;s Body only 
<u>After</u> He Had Been Completely Formed</span></h2><p><span lang="en">The rib was not taken out of Adam&#39;s body during the processof being formed. Adam&#44; a type of the Body of Christ (the Church)&#44; was completely formed before the &quot;
<u>rib
</u>&quot; was taken and &quot;Eve&quot; was formed. In the fulfillment of this type&#44; the &quot;Bride&quot; will not be taken out of the &quot;Body&quot;(the Church) until the end of the Church Age. We are now living in the lastChurch Age&#44; the Laodicean Age.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">Eve Was Formed from a 
<u>Very Small
</u> Part of Adam&#39;s Body</span></h2><p><span lang="en">&quot;A rib&quot; -- not the whole body</span></p><p><span lang="en">Only a small part of the Body (the Church) will make up &quot;theBride of Christ.&quot; Only those that overcome&#44; as He overcame will be the Bride.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 21 &quot;To Him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in MyThrone&#44; even as I also overcame&#44; and am set down with My Father in His Throne.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Overcomers are those that respond to His call in Rev. 3:20 and invite Him to be Lord. They receive revelations from Him.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 20 &quot;Behold&#44; I stand at the door&#44; and knock: if any man hear My voice&#44; and open the door&#44; I will come in to him&#44; and will sup with him&#44; and he with Me.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">We are living in the evening time. God is revealing truth that had been sealed.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 2: 17 &quot;...To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">God has secrets and revelations that He will share with the&quot;Overcomer.&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 2: 9&#44; 10 &quot;But as it is written&#44; Eye hath not seen&#44; nor ear heard&#44;neither have entered into the heart of man&#44; the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: forthe Spirit searcheth all things&#44; yea&#44; the deep things of God.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">Eve then Existed as an Individual -- Totally Apart from the Rest of Adam&#39;s body</span></h2><p><span lang="en">She was no longer a part of the body. She had been takenout of the body and now became a separate entity. She functioned and performedtotally apart from the rest of the body. She then was &quot;brought&quot; to the man&#44;Adam&#44; and was presented to him as his bride. After the &quot;Bride of Christ&quot; hasbeen taken out of the Body of Christ (the Church) and formed into the &quot;Bride&#44;&quot;she will then be &quot;brought&quot; to Christ.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">  Eve was &quot;Bone of His Bone&quot; but She was not 
<u>All
</u> of His Bones</span></h2><p><span lang="en">All but one of Adam&#39;s bones was still in his body. Only asmall number&#44; in comparison to the rest of the &quot;Church&#44;&quot; will make up the&quot;Bride.&quot;</span></p><h2><span lang="en">Adamwas not Awakened until Eve was Complete</span></h2><p><span lang="en">Adam slept while the rib was taken and made into a completebody by itself&#44; then Adam was awakened. The Church (the Body of Christ) is nowsleeping&#44; while the Bride is being formed and made ready for the Marriage ofthe Lamb.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt 25: 5 &quot;...They all slumbered and slept...&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Both&#44; the wise virgins that had oil (a type of the HolySpirit)&#44; which are symbolic of the Church&#44; and the foolish virgins that had nooil&#44; which are symbolic of the Born Again&#44; all slumbered and slept. The Brideis taken before Tribulation. Afterward&#44; God will awaken the Church during thefirst three-and-a-half years of Tribulation through persecution.</span></p>
