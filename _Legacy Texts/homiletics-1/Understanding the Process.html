&nbsp;Would you believe that a group of twenty people will respond with as many as twelve different answers? &nbsp;Naturally, this leaves a lot of room for misunderstanding and conflict. &nbsp;If a group of people can look at the same thing and arrive at totally different conclusions, imagine the impact this has on team relationships&mdash;especially if they all think they are right. &nbsp;Did you count sixteen? &nbsp;Seventeen? &nbsp;Twenty-one? &nbsp;Twenty- two? &nbsp;Twenty-four? &nbsp;Twenty-five? &nbsp;Twenty-six? &nbsp;Twenty- seven? &nbsp;Twenty-eight? &nbsp;Twenty-nine? &nbsp;These are all common answers. &nbsp;If your answer is any one of them, however, keep looking. &nbsp;The correct answer is thirty (sixteen one- by-ones, nine two-by-twos, four three-by-threes, one four- by-four)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The message in this exercise is twofold. &nbsp;First, people can look at the same thing and see something quite different. &nbsp;Second, people often come up short because they jump to conclusions and don&rsquo;t probe far enough. &nbsp;They become impatient with the process and look instead for a quick solution. &nbsp;When this happens, people tend to form opinions and base decisions on assumption rather than on fact. &nbsp;Both of these tendencies create unnecessary conflict among team members, especially when the problem is complex and people approach it from a &ldquo;me-opic&rdquo; perspective</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Now replace the squares with the subject of teamwork. &nbsp;How do you define teamwork? &nbsp;Do you think that your definition is consistent with your co-workers&rsquo;? &nbsp;What are the implications if it isn&rsquo;t? &nbsp;Could people be thinking they are performing as team players when in fact they are not? &nbsp;Could you be one of them?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Defining Teamwork</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">The first step in cultivating teamwork is defining what teamwork means. &nbsp;Like Leonard, Shirley, and Fred, many people interpret teamwork differently. &nbsp;In other words, they see differing numbers of squares. &nbsp;Without an accurate definition of teamwork, it will be difficult for people like Leonard, Shirley, and Fred to actually achieve it. &nbsp;Here is a simple definition of teamwork: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csD5FB87F7">Teamwork is a cooperative effort in which individual interests are subordinated to the interests and needs of the team</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;Teamwork means &ldquo;giving up some of the me for the we.&rdquo; In other words, teamwork is a process stemming from a &ldquo;we-opic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;we-focused,&rdquo; mindset.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
