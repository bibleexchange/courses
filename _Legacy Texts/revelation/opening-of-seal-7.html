<h1>Opening of The Seventh Seal (8:1)</h1>

<h2>Details of the Silence</h2>

<p>The Lamb is &quot;He&quot; Who breaks or opens the seal. In response to the breaking of the seal there is silence. This silence appears to be a &quot;calm before the storm&quot;.</p>

<p>This silence takes place &quot;In Heaven&quot; and lasts for half an hour (&quot;Hemioron&quot; &quot;Hemi&quot;: Half plus &quot;Hora&quot;: Hour).</P>

<h2>Meaning of the Silence</h2>

<p>This seal and the resulting silence are quite mysterious. We can consider the definitions of the words used, but any other suggestings to their meaning is speculation.</p>

<p>In Revelation 8:1, "Silence" (siqe) means hush, voluntary stillness or refusal to speak. It is a silence of intense interest and awful expectancy with reference to the results of the breaking of the seventh seal.</p>

<p>As the following section of Revelation makes several strong allusions to the different parts of temple worship. For example:</p>
	<ul class='bullets'>
		<li>Altar and incense in 8:3.</li>
		<li>Four horns of the altar in 9:13.</li>
		<li>Temple of God in 11:1.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Adam Clarke makes a comparison of this silence and the prayerful silence of the people who waited while the priest went in to burn incense in the holy place.

 <blockquote>Luke 1:10 -- And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</blockquote>
