    <blockquote>Revelation 10:1 -- And I saw another mighty angel come
      down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his
      head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars
      of fire:</blockquote>
    <p>The scene of the "Cloud-Robed Angel" is still part of the sixth
      trumpet that began in 9:13. It is not until 11:14 that the sixth
      trumpet (the second woe) is accomplished.</p>
    <h2 style='clear:both;'>The Angel</h2>
    <h3>The Title Suggests Deity. - "another mighty angel"</h3>
    <h4>"another" </h4>
    <p>This Angel is distinct from the other angels mentioned as we have
      seen in Revelation 7:2 and 8:3. We should also note that the
      phrase "another angel" is also used several times in chapter 14
      and once in 18:1, but especially chapter 14 does not seem to give
      the same sense of the exceptionalism of the angel as in the other
      passages.</p>
    <h4>"mighty"</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;John the Revelator uses the title "another angel" in 9
      verses, but "mighty" (ischuros) angel is used only here in 10:1
      and in 18:21 where a mighty angel announces and describes the
      judgment of Babylon the Great. "Ischuros" (greek word) is used in
      7 verses by John and can be found in 25 verses throughout the New
      Testament. It is adjective describing what He is and not what He
      has. He is mighty,&nbsp; powerful,&nbsp; strong and boisterious.
      "Ischuros" can also be used to give a comparative sense: stronger,
      mightier, more powerful. </p>
    <blockquote>Matthew 3:11 -- I indeed baptize you with water unto
      repentance: but he that cometh after me is <b>mightier </b>than
      I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with
      the Holy Ghost, and with fire: </blockquote>
    <blockquote> Mt 12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's
      house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the <b>strong </b>man?
      and then he will spoil his house. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Corinthians 10:22 -- Do we provoke the Lord to
      jealousy? are we <b>stronger </b>than he?</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Hebrews 6:18 -- That by two immutable things, in which
      it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a <b>strong </b>consolation,
      who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</blockquote>
    <h3>The Particulars Suggest Deity</h3>
    <p>Inspection of the particulars of the Angel suggest He is more
      than just "a messenger", but is "The Messenger". More convincing
      of the deity of this angel than His actual title ("another mighty
      angel") is the details of his description.
    </p>
    <h4>"clothed with a cloud"</h4>
    <p>Clothing speaks of Condition (Sinful or Righteous). For examples
      see: 2 Chronicles 6:41; Job 8:22; 29:14; Psalm 35:26; Psalm 104:1.
      In Ezekiel chapter one, the cloud and rainbow was a description of
      the glory of God.</p>
    <blockquote>Ezekiel 1:28 -- As the appearance of the bow that is in
      the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
      brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of
      the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and
      I heard a voice of one that spake.</blockquote>
    <p>Clouds also speak of Mystery (Indicating Deity). For examples
      see: Exodus 24:16;40:34; Lev. 16:2; Matt. 17:5.</p>
    <p>Clouds also speak of Judgment”. As clouds are indicators of a
      storm so the cloud here indicates a storm is coming! The storm is
      the judgments of God.
    </p>
    <h4> "a rainbow was upon His head"</h4>
    <p>The Rainbow is a Covenant Sign. God said in Genesis 9:13 that "I
      do set my bow in the cloud". The presence of this rainbow is sign
      of mercy which appears over the head of Him that is robed "with a
      cloud" which is sign of Judgment. In Judgment God Remembers Mercy!
      
    </p>
    <h4>"His face was as it were the sun"</h4>
   <p>In the first vision - Rev. 1:13-20. Mal. 4: 2 "Sun of Righteousness" Acts 26:13 "Above the brightness of the sun." </p>
    <h4>"His feet as pillars of fire"</h4>
    <p> This is an image of pureness and judgment. It is also an image
      of steadfastness and glorious majesty.
    </p>
    <h4>"And He had in his hand a little book open:"</h4>
    <p>Only ONE had proven worthy to open the book and release its
      seals!</p>
    <blockquote>Revelation 5:5 -- And one of the elders saith unto me,
      Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of
      David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven
      seals thereof.</blockquote>
    
	
	<h2>The Acts of the Angel </h2>
	
    <h3>Taking Possession</h3>
    <p>As described in Deuteronomy 11:24, He is taking possession of the earth and its people. "He set His right foot upon the sea". The sea or water is often people in Scripture (see Rev. 17:1, 15). "And His left foot on the earth". The earth is the place where the people dwell. Who is the world under dominion to now? Under the rule of Satan. (John 12:31; Luke 4:6; II Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2: 2) The Devil is in control
      now, but Jesus is soon to take over. He sets His foot upon the sea, and the land, and takes hold as His own.</p>
    <h3>Proclaiming Victory</h3>
    <p>"Cried with a loud voice," Not the cry of defeat or fear. But of
      POWER, VICTORY and TRIUMPH; John 11:43-44 At the grave of Lazarus.
      Could it be that He is Awakening the Dead? "As when a lion
      roareth." He is known as "The lion of the tribe of Judah" Judah-
      Praise -Victory -shouting in victory. Song writer said -"That
      breaks every chain." Also the Prophet said - "The Lord shall roar
      out of Zion " Jer. 25:29-31</p>
    <h3>Signaling Fulfillment.</h3>
    <p>"lifted up his hand to heaven" vs. 5. a signal of Readiness or
      Victory.</p>
    <blockquote>And sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever...
      ...that there should be time no longer." vs. 6. </blockquote>
    <p>There should be "No more delay" (Amplified Version). There is
      reason now for delay. II Peter 3:9-10.</p>
    <h2>The Response to the Angel, vs. 3 "and when He had cried"</h2>
    <h3>Indication of (More) Judgment.</h3>
    <p>More severe. "Seven thunders uttered their voices" Seven
      (Complete) Thunders or Judgment.</p>
    <h3>Personality Ascribed.</h3>
    <p>They speak -"Uttered their voices" John was going to write what
      he heard.</p>
    <h3>A Command Given, vs. 4.</h3>
    <p>Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write
      them not.</p>
    <h2>The Scroll in the Angel's Hand, vs. 2a; 8-11.</h2>
    <h3>It is a Revelation, vs. 7.</h3>
    <p>"The mystery of God should be finished (complete, execute,
      conclude) as He hath declared to His servants the prophets."</p>
    <h3>The Nature of the Revelation.</h3>
    <p>It had been a mystery. "He had in His hand a little book." The
      Book mentioned in Rev. 5; No man could open it -no one else.</p>
    <p>It is a mystery that has been solved . "A little book open" The
      mystery that had been hid for ages is now revealed.</p>
    <h3>The Facts Related To The Revelation.</h3>
    <h4>"Go and take the little book". Faith is the factor that receives
      from God. Faith takes hold of truth.</h4>
    <h4>"Which is open" Was closed now opened .</h4>
    <h4>"In the hand of the Angel" In His hand -earned -merited.</h4>
    <p>Based on the merits of Calvary. "a Lamb as it had been slain"
      Chp. 5:6 We can only take the open Book - The Revelation of God -
      from the hand of Christ.</p>
    <h3>The Effects of The Revelation.</h3>
    <h4>"In my mouth sweet as Honey" </h4>
    <blockquote>Psa. 119:103 -- How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
      yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</blockquote>
    <h4>"My belly was bitter." Bitter in Experience, vs. 11 gives us a
      hint as to why it is bitter: persecution.</h4>
