# Epilogue (22:6-21)

Revelation 22:6-21 can be considered the epilogue or the last and concluding statements.

## The Truthfulness of These Writings (v. 6)

> Revelation 22:6&mdash;And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.

### Truth is Refreshing

READ: Philippians 4:8-9; 

### No One Ever Spoke it Like Jesus!

Said of the Lord Himself "Never a man spake like this man."

### This Sayings are True

Three times it is repeated that the sayings of the book are true (19:9; 21:5; 22:6). 

Three times it is affirmed that the sayings come directly from God (1:1; 22:6; 22:16). 

> Romains 3:4&mdash;God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar;&hellip;

<blockquote class="quote">Either this book is nothing but forgery, or it is the most authoritative writing of all time&mdash;James R. Reynolds, Sr.</blockquote>

These Are Gods Own Words ("Faithful And True") and we must take them, build our faith on them, and testify of them. ( 2 Peter 1:19; Matthew 7:24-27; Isaiah 43:10)

## The Repetition of a Special Blessing (v. 7)

The special blessing promised to those who hear and keep the sayings of Revelation that was given in the first chapter is now repeated.

> Revelation 1:3&mdash;Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.

>  Revelation 22:7&mdash;Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.

Is there another Book that is so intense, emphatic, constant or having so much good in it to be gained and ill to be avoided?

## The Effect Upon The Apostle (vs. 8-9)

> Revelation 22:8,9&mdash;And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

## Direct Orders Concerning This Revelation (v. 10)

> Revelation 22:10&mdash;And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.

### "Seal not the sayings of The Prophecy of this book."

Dan 8:26 12:4,9 Daniel was told to seal up the book. John is told not to seal the book.

From the beginning John was directed to write what he saw and heard, and to make it known to the Churches. Rev 1:11, 19 Prophetical messages to each church. Rev 2:1, 8, 12, 18, 3:1, 7, 14.

### "Seal up."

In Chapter 10 he was about to write. The Seven Thunders He was to seal this up -- But the rest he was not to Seal. He was to record them. He was to make them known. He was to publish them to the Churches. These things where written both by Command and Revelation of God.

See the stress, Urgency, Importance. This Book is very important to us.

## The Effects of This Revelation (v. 11)

>  Revelation 22:11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.

There are two schools of thought here --

### One -- The idea of eternal fixedness of character. When these Revelations scenes have been fulfilled.

### The other idea -- is the Effect of these Words -- or this Revelation.

The meaning of the text has immediate reference to the context -- to the now -- sealing- writing and publishing. For a better understanding read it --

> Let the unjust one do injustice more and more and the filthy one defile more and more, and the righteous one do righteousness more and more."</blockquote>

II Tim 3:13 Heb 6:7-9

The same light of the Sun breeds pestilence in the marshland. Breeds life to all. It is an ill to the ill. Good to the Good.

## The Rewards To All (vs. 12-19)

### All Will be Rewarded

> 12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. 13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

Without exception, all will receive their just reward.

### The Reward of Entering God's City

> Revelation 22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 15 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

### Rewards of Blessing






 16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.
 17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
 18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
 


### To the wicked -

Degrees of Reward -- More tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah

### To the Righteous --

Degrees of Reward - Not Salvation but for works.

Wood -- hay -- stubble Gold- Silver -- Precious Stones.

## The Benediction (vs. 20-21)

> Revelation 22:20,21&mdash;He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. 21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
