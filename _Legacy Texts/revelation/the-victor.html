<h1>The Nature of the Victor, vs. 5-7</h1>
<p>The Book's Opener is presented as a Victor!</p>
<blockquote>Revelaton 5:5 - And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</blockquote>
<h3>A lion</h3>
<blockquote>v. 5 "Lion of the tribe of Judah"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Root of David"</blockquote>
<p>Being of the Root of David, his prowess is of no coincidence. It is by PROMISE and therefore Divine appointment.</p>
 <blockquote>Revelation 22:16 - I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</blockquote>
<p>He is both ROOT and OFFSPRING of David! By nature, Jesus is the ROOT of David and by divine incarnation he is the offspring of David. David, the greatly revered and legendary king of Israel, received his authority from this same Jesus!</p>

<h3>A lamb</h3>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Stood a lamb"</blockquote>
<p>A lion in power, but a lamb in nature. Notice:</p>
<h4>He is standing</h4>
<p>Because He is not dead, but alive.</p>
<p>Because He is accepted.</p>
<p>Because of us, on our behalf.</p>
<h4>He is a sacrificial lamb</h4>
<blockquote>v. 6 "A lamb as it had been slain"</blockquote>
<h4>His has perfect power and strength</h4>
<blockquote>v. 6 "Having seven horns"</blockquote>
<h4>He has perfect and universal intelligence</h4>
<blockquote>"And seven eyes"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Which are the seven spirits of God"</blockquote>
<h4>He has unlimited rights v. 7</h4>
