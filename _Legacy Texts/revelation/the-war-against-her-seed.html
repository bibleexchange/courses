<h1>The War Against Her Seed</h1>
<blockquote>
Rev. 12:17 "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed…"</blockquote>

<p>Defeated in his attack on the "Man-Child" (the Overcomers), and then defeated in his attack on the "Woman" (the Church), the dragon changes his focus and enters into a deadly war with the converts of the "Woman," "her seed."</p>
<h2>The Means the Dragon Uses in This War</h2>
<h3>The Anti-christ</h3>
<p>The anti-christ will be the head of the one world government.</p>
<blockquote>
Rev. 13:7 "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them…"</blockquote>

<h3>The False Religion</h3>
<p>The false religion is the system, which is practiced by the false prophet, bringing all the denominations of the world into one church. This one-world church will be government-controlled and government sponsored and headed up by the false prophet, who causes all to worship the "beast."</p>
<blockquote>
Rev. 13:11–15 "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."</blockquote>

<h3>The Economy</h3>
<p>A government-controlled one world monetary system will be introduced. No one will be able to buy or sell unless they fit into the government-controlled system and receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead. There will not be a money exchange system, as we know it. There will be a transfer of credits through the computers, and without the mark you will not be able to transact business. This will force many to receive the mark.</p>
<blockquote>
Rev. 13:16, 17 "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."</blockquote>
<p>Rev. 16:2 "And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image."</p>
<p>Rev. 19:20 "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast,andthemthat worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."</p>

<h2>The Effects of the War</h2>
<h3>Great Tribulation</h3>
<p>"Megas Thlipsis" – "Great Tribulation" – exceeding great affliction – to suffer affliction – primarily means a pressuring</p>
<p>The Great Tribulation indicates a definite period of time, which was spoken of by the Lord, which precedes His Second Advent. The Second Advent is the "Epiphany," the revelation of Christ coming back to take over the kingdoms of this world. This is not the secret coming in the air where He raptures the Church.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:29, 30 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."</blockquote>

<p>The believers will be greatly persecuted.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:21 "For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."</blockquote>
<p>Rev. 2:22 "Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation, except they repent of their deeds."</p>
<p>Rev. 3:10 "Because thou hast kept the Word of My patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."</p>

<h3>Saints Overcome</h3>
<blockquote>
Rev. 13:7 "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them…"</blockquote>

<p>The "Man-Child" (the Overcomers) overcame the dragon.</p>
<blockquote>
Rev. 12:11 "…They overcame him…"</blockquote>

<p>"The Woman" (the Church) escaped the dragon's attacks by a great miracle. However, these saints that were left behind during the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation are attacked and overcome by the dragon's murderous assaults. Permission was "given" (Rev. 13: 7) to the dragon and to the false-christ to make war with the saints and to overcome them. These saints are not Jews only, for the Scripture says, "over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."</p>
<blockquote>
Rev. 7:9 "...Of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues."</blockquote>

<h3>Many Martyrs</h3>
<p>Many of the saints that are left behind and go into the "Great Tribulation" will give their lives as martyrs, because they refused to give up their faith in Christ Jesus the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
Matt. 24:9 "Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for My name's sake."</blockquote>
<p>Jn. 16:2 "They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service."</p>
<p>Rev. 6:9–11 "And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."</p>
<p>Rev. 7:9–14 "After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the Throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."</p>
<p>Rev. 14:12, 13 "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them."</p>

<h3>The Martyrs' Reward</h3>
<blockquote>
Rev. 7:15–17 "Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shallhunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."</blockquote>
