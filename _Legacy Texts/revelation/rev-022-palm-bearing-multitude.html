<h1>The Palm&ndash;Bearing Multitude 7:9&ndash;17</h1>
<p>It was from heaven that John beheld the shaking and the sealing;. and from the same point of view he sees this company. The question of the Elder is what we want to deal with first. vs. 9 &quot;Who are they? and whence came they?&quot;
Some believe they are the early Christians victorious over the sorrows and persecutions. Some believe they are the Christians under Constantine. To decide who they are look at:</p>

<h2>Who They Are Not</h2>
<h4>They are not the highest class of the redeemed.</h4>
<p>The Elders &quot;Sit&quot; &ndash;these &quot;Stand&quot; vs. 9 &quot;Stood before the Throne&quot;. The Elders have Crowns and Thrones &ndash; These have neither. The Elders appear in their places &ndash; And have received their reward before judgment. These came to the throne after judgment has started. The Elders were &quot;counted worthy to escape all these things&quot; [Luke 21:36]. These were in the Judgment. &quot;Out of the great tribulation. &quot; vs. 14</p>
<h4>They are not the Church</h4>
<p>The Four Living creatures make up the Church. The Rapture of the Church takes place before the Great Tribulation. These are taken out of the Great Tribulation.</p>
<h4>They are not the sealed ones &ndash;</h4>
<p>The sealed ones were a definite number. These are uncounted and numberless. vs.9 The sealed ones were of Israel. &quot;These are out of every nation, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.&quot;</p>

<h2>Who They Are</h2>
<h3>They are redeemed people.</h3>
<p>They were once sinners. They are now saved. Vs. 10 &quot;Salvation to Our God, &quot; &quot; And to the Lamb.&quot;</p>
<h3>They are people living on the Earth during the Judgment vs. 14</h3>
<p>&quot;Come out of Great Tribulation. &quot; Some believe because of the number that they are from all ages&ndash; Come out of Great Tribulation.</p>
<h3>They are people who were unprepared, and were &quot;left&quot; when the Rapture took place.</h3>
<p>There were ten virgins in Matthew 25. Five were wise and five were foolish. The five foolish were left outside the marriage door.</p>
<blockquote>Matthew 25:11-13 &mdash; Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</blockquote>

<p>There are no crowns or thrones, but only palms. They did not hear the gentle voice of the Spirit, and therefore were not rewarded in the same way those that overcame and escaped the great tribulation. But they did learn their lesson through great trial and are given great promises of blessing.</p> 
<blockquote>Isaiah 26:9,10 &mdash;&hellip;for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</blockquote>
<p>Some will learn righteousness, but not all will turn to God even in such terrible judgment.</p>
<blockquote>Daniel 12:10 &mdash;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</blockquote>
