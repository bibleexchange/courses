<h1>The Third Letter: Pergamos</h1>

<h2>Messenger - "Martin of Tours"</h2>
<p>Martin of Tours (France). "Unto the angel of the Church"</p>
<p>His conversion took place after helping a poor beggar, took his own coat and cut it in two with his sword, wrapped the man in it and went his way. That night the Lord appeared unto him, in a vision, wrapped in the half of Martin's garment. He spoke to him, "Martin, though he is only a common soldier, has clothed Me with his garment." From that time on he sought to serve the Lord. His life was a series of miracles.After leaving the army, he became a leader in the church, he became very militant against idolatry. Challenged the pagans as Elijah did the False Prophets. He offered to be tied to a tree on its underside so that when it was cut down it would crush him unless God intervened. They tied him to a tree that was growing on the side of a hill, assured that the natural pull of gravity would fall and crush him. Just as the tree began to fall, God swung it around uphill and crushed several of the heathens as they were fleeing. Raised a man to life that had been hung for his faith.</p>
<p>Martin wanted to see the emperorâ€”he was refused audience. Martin laid at the gate and prayed. The iron gate opened and he heard a voice bidding him to rise. The ruler would not turn his head to speak to him. Martin prayed. Suddenly a fire came spontaneously from the seat of the throne and the emperor vacated speedily.</p>
<p>They came to kill him.He stood erect and bared his throat to the sword. As they leaped forward, the power of God hurled them back across the room. So overcome with fear, they begged forgiveness.</p>

<h2>City - "Pergamos"</h2>
<p>The name "Pergamos" expresses the idea of a tower. Pergamos was the most illustrious city in Asia. It was also a city of great sin. They worshipped an idol in a form of a living serpent, housed and fed in the temple.</p>
<p>v. 13 "Even where Satan's seat is" How did it become the seat of Satan? Babylon fell - to the Medes and Persians. The priest, A Halus - fled the city and went to Pergamos and started over.</p>
<p>The Age lasted 312 - 606 A.D.</p>
