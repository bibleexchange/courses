>  Revelation 12:1&mdash;And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

>  Revelation 12:3&mdash;And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

>  Revelation 13:13,14&mdash;And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of] those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.

>  Revelation 15:1&mdash;And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.

>  Revelation 16:14&mdash;For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, [which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

>  Revelation 19:20&mdash;And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

In the "Middle of the Week" two "Wonders" will appear in Heaven, for John is back again in Heaven. The Revised Version calls them "SIGNS," that is, they are "SYMBOLS" of something, and must be thus interpreted. The first will be a "SUN CLOTHED WOMAN." Who does this "Sun Clothed Woman" represent? Some would have us believe that this "Woman" is the Virgin Mary, others that she represents the Church. Those who say she represents the Church claim that she represents the visible or outward Church, and her "Child" represents the "True Church" or those who are to be "caught out" at the Rapture. If this be true, and the "Child" is not caught out until the "Middle of the Week," then the Church will have to go half way through the "Tribulation." The fact is, the "Woman" is neither the Virgin Mary or the Church. She is ISRAEL. We have only to be reminded of "Joseph's Dream," where he says--"Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the 'SUN' and the 'MOON' and the 'ELEVEN STARS' made Obeisance to me" (Gen. 37:9), to see the Jewish character of this "Woman." Joseph was the "Twelfth" star.

Israel is again and again compared to a woman, and a married woman, in the Old Testament. Isa. 54:1. And in the period of her rejection she is spoken of as a WIDOW (Isa. 47:7-9. Luke 18:1-8), and a DIVORCED Woman (Isa. 50:1), and an ADULTEROUS WIFE (Jer. 3:1-25, Hosea 2:1-23) but the Church is a VIRGIN, and an ESPOUSED Virgin at that. 2. Cor. 11:2. Eph. 5:25-27. The "Sun Clothed Woman" is described as being "WITH CHILD," and "TRAVAILING TO BRING FORTH." When was the Church in such a condition? To be found in such a condition would unfit her to be the Bride of Christ. Nowhere in the scriptures is it intimated that the Church is ever to be a Mother. But it is so prophesied of Israel. Speaking of the sevenfold privilege of Israel, Paul says--"Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises, whose are the fathers, and of whom AS CONCERNING THE FLESH CHRIST CAME." Rom. 9:4-5. Here we see that Christ was to come from ISRAEL. Then we know that the "PROMISED SEED" was to come through ISRAEL, and the Prophet Isaiah looked forward to the time when Israel could say--"UNTO US A CHILD IS BORN UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN." Isa. 9:6-7. Before the promised heir could be born Israel had to pass through many sore afflictions and judgments. These were her "TRAVAIL TIME." There can be no question but what the "Sun Clothed Woman" represents ISRAEL.
