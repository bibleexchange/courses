<h1>The Vision (1:10-20)</h1>

<h2>The Setting of the Vision (1:10,11)</h2>

<h3>Received in the Spirit</h3>
<blockquote>v. 10  "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day".</blockquote>

<p>Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:1) and Paul (I Corinthians 12:2) both speak of a similar "in the spirit" experience. Ezekiel was carried away "in the spirit" to a valley of dry bones. Paul was not sure whether it was in the body or out of the body in which he was caught up to the third heaven. John the Revelator was in a mode and mind of worship when first his ears and then his eyes are opened to the spiritual realm.</p>

<p>There is no suggestion that John is asleep. The book of Revelation is not the results of John's subconscious, but his experience is presented as if a veil were taken away and he began to hear, see and feel some very real things that were previously muted.</p>

<p>This Vision was received in the Spirit and can only be understood in the Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>1 Corinthians 2:14-- But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</blockquote>
<p>This does not mean the book of Revelation cannot be understood, but that in order to fully understand it we must be in that same condition of communion with the Spirit of God as John.</p>

<p>Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jesus, and John all gave a message expressly for those with "ears to hear". We can say that the Bible in its entirety was written for those who would yield their hearts, minds, eyes and ears to the Spirit of God. Some are STUBBORN and cover their eyes and ears (Zechariah 7:11; 2 Timothy 4:4) and others are SENSITIVE and make supplication that their eyes and ears would be unstopped! (Isaiah 50:4; Revelation 3:18)</p>
<blockquote>Isaiah 50:4-- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.</blockquote>

<h3>Given with a Command</h3>

<h4>Commanded to Record It</h4>
<blockquote>v. 11 "What thou seest, write in a book"</blockquote>

<p>This command is not unique to John. Moses (Exodus 17:14), Isaiah (Isaiah 30:8) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 30:2) all mention they were commanded to record what they heard and saw. Two reasons why this is so important to God is that He knows Humans forget and second, the message was not solely for John.</p>

<h4>Commanded to Share It</h4>
<blockquote>v. 11 "And send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia"</blockquote>

<p>The current situation of the Christian church demanded counsel and hope. They were under oppression and persecution by the Romans led by Domitian. Domitian was the first Roman Emperor who demanded to addressed as "master and god". Domitian was fairly tolerant of other religions than the state religion of Rome and religions like worship of Egyptian deities even flourished during his reign. Domitian was cruel however toward any religion that threatened especially the belief in his own godhood. According to 4th Century AD Eusebius Jews and Christians were heavily persecuted and even a special temple tax was leavied yearly. (The money was to be sent annually the the temple of Jupiter.)</p>

<blockquote>2 Corinthians 4:3-- But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</blockquote>

<p>As these seven churches of Asia are also symbolic of seven conditions present in every church age, John is writing to us just as much as he was writing to the first century churches. The Revelation was not John's to KEEP, but John's to SHARE.</p>

<h3>Announced by a Voice</h3>
<blockquote>v. 10  "Heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.</blockquote>

<p>It was clearly a VOICE that John heard but it was LIKE a TRUMPET--urgent, clear, strong, awakening, and startling.</p>
<p>God revealed Himself to Moses, on Mt.Sinai "voice of a trumpet exceeding loud." (Exodus 19:16)
The Temple opened its doors in the morning at the sound of the trumpet.
The Year of Jubilee came with the sound of the trumpet. Lev. 25:9,10
The Silence of the Age will be broken by the sound of a trumpet.</p>
<blockquote>I Thessalonians 4:16--The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised.</blockquote>

<h2>The Scenes of the Vision (1:12-20)</h2>
<h3>The First Scene: SEVEN CANDLESTICKS</h3>
<blockquote>v. 12  "I saw seven golden candlesticks". v. 20  "And the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches."</blockquote>

<h4>The lamp stands - "Candlesticks"</h4>

<blockquote>John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Matthew 5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</blockquote>

 <p>The candlesticks give light, illumination, and revelation which guide us, warn us and make us aware. The Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a light!</p>
 
 <blockquote>Matthew 4:16-- The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Luke 1:79-- To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>John 11:9-- Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</blockquote>
   <blockquote>2 Corinthians 4:6-- For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. </blockquote>
  
<h4>"Golden"</h4>
<p>GREAT COST. The candlesticks were composed of the costliest metal.</p>
<p>GREAT BEAUTY. The tabernacle use filled with the use of gold. Gold is expressive of Godliness.</p>
<blockquote>Psalm 96:9-- O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</blockquote>

<h4>"Seven"</h4>
<p>There was a candlestick with seven lamps in the tabernacle.</p>
<blockquote>Exodus 25:37-- And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. </blockquote>
<p>Seven is the number of completeness. (Lev. 4:6; Psalm 119:164; Prov. 24:16; Daniel 3:19; Luke 17:4) These seven candlesticks represent the WHOLE Church Age. </p>


<h3>The Second Scene: SON OF MAN</h3>
<h4>CHRIST as The Great High Priest - Priest. </h4>
<blockquote>Hebrews 7:26; 8:1; v.  13  "In the midst"</blockquote>
<h4>CHRIST as The True Prophet - Prophet</h4>
<blockquote>Acts 7:32; Rev. 1:14  "His head and hair white like wool, as white as snow:and His eyes were as a flame of fire..." "His voice as the sound of many waters."</blockquote>
<h4>CHRIST as The Only Potentate - King - Lord</h4>
<p>I Timothy 6:15; Revelation 19:16; Rev. 1:15 "His feet like unto fine brass". This represents Majesty and Judgment. John 5:22. Rev. 1:16  "And out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword." John 12:47-48</p>


<h3>The THIRD Scene: SEVEN STARS</h3>
<h4>The Seven Stars are The Lord's Ministers</h4>
<blockquote>v. 16 "And He had in His right hand seven stars." v. 20 "The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand,...are the angels of the seven churches." </blockquote>
<h4>God has His ministers in His hand. He holds, controls, owns and will reward them</h4>
