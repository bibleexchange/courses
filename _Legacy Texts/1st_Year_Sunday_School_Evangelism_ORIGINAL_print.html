		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA657E9A2">You, the </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Teacher </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">1</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Successful Christian teaching begins with you. It involves your personal talents, preparation, attitudes towards your students, and most of all, your personal relationship with God. Tools and techniques are important, as are facilities and equipment, but you are the key to their effectiveness in communicating spiritual truth.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your work as a teacher is filled with rich </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">opportunities </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">to help others and to influence lives. Eternal values are involved and your life becomes a model for those you teach.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">YOUR COMMISSION</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The ongoing success of the Christian faith depends in a large measure upon the success of the church&#39;s teaching program. Teaching was at the very heart of Jesus&#39; ministry. In fact, the Gospel accounts speak more often of him as a teacher than they do as a preacher.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your commission and goals as a teacher are found in the words of Christ, &quot;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations. . . to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you&quot; (Matt. 28:19,20). The commission involves making disciples and centers in the teachings of Christ.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The evangelistic goal of the great commission is to lead people</span></p><p class="csA5964A5E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">to Christ. The educational goal is to teach them to &quot;observe all things,&quot; or, to put into practice the things that Jesus taught. Christ did far more than impart knowledge. His teaching changed the lives of those he taught. In the same way, you are not teaching just facts, but principles that change the lives of your students. Your teaching ministry is a holy calling.</span></p><p class="csA5964A5E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">YOUR LIFE</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 435.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You face three important questions: Is your life-style God 	honoring? Is your message Christ-centered? Is your teaching Spirit-empowered? If you can answer &quot;yes&quot; to each of these, you will contribute greatly to the teaching ministry of the church. You will be able to say with the Apostle Paul, &quot;For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance;,as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake&quot; (1 Thess. 1 :5).</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Four important factors in successful teaching are directly related to you. They include your faith in God and his Word, the commitment of your personality to Christ, the example of your lifestyle, and your relationship to those you teach.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">FAITH</span></h1>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At its simplest level, teaching is sharing with others that which has been experienced. To communicate Christ and his message, you must have faith that Jesus Christ is your Savior and Lord.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your faith must be an active, vital, working faith in the Lord Jesus Christ-a triumphant, aggressive faith that shapes every, aspect of your life.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB" style="tab-stops:left 413.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You will also want to express faith in the Bible, God&#39;s Word. Again and again Jesus indicated his faith in the authority of the Scriptures when he said, &quot;It is written.&quot; Peter tells us that &quot;holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost&quot; (II Pet. 1 :21). Effective preachers, evangelists, and teachers derive their convictions through unswerving faith in the Bible as the Word of God. &quot;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God&quot; (II Tim. 3: 16), and as such provides the ultimate authority for your faith and an infallible guide for your life.	.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB" style="tab-stops:left 413.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">PERSONALITY</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When you commit yourself to God you surrender not only your talents and your possessions, but also your personality. Paul&#39;s life was made useful and effective by his surrender to Jesus. Because of his conversion and continued growth in the faith, he became</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">more open about the needs of his own life and more concerned _ about the needs of others. In a similar fashion, every Christian teacher needs to grow toward Christian maturity, giving Christ full control of his personality.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">EXAMPLE</span></h1>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Modern psychologists speak frequently about the importance of role models, not only for the proper psychological development of children but for adults as well. Actions often speak louder than words, and nowhere is this more evident than in Christian teaching.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You may emphasize the importance of God&#39;s Word, but if you always teach from a teacher&#39;s guide and never use the Bible, you contradict what you say. You may teach that the offering is an act of worship, but if you hurry through it in a casual manner, you cancel out your teaching. You may speak about love, but if you are unpleasant to your fellow teachers or your own family, you cannot teach with real results. One person expressed it this way: &quot;As Christian teachers, we have to put some walk in our talk if we expect our students to listen to us.&quot;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">RELATIONSHIPS</span></h3>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The quality of your relationships, with those you teach, also is a determining factor in your success. Long after facts are forgotten, your attitudes and your love will be remembered. Trying to fake a warm, personal relationship with your students will not succeed for long-students can spot a phoney very quickly. Ideal teachers are those who, rejecting an air of superiority, humbly join their students in an exciting quest for truth.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">YOUR KNOWLEDGE</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers who recognize the importance of their position seek to be qualified to fill their place. Those who appreciate the teacher&#39;s ministry also understand the need for preparation. Professional people spend years in hard study and application. Doctors are expected to know how to treat a wound or to dispense proper medication. Mechanics are expected to be able to repair an automobile when it stops running. Can any less be expected of a Christian teacher who is dealing not only with temporal problems, but with eternal truths?</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teaching periods are all too brief. Every minute must be turned to the best possible use. Only trained teachers can utilize these precious moments to the best advantage. For this reason, every teacher needs adequate preparation irl several areas.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">THE BIBLE</span></h3>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To teach the Bible effectively, you need a working knowledge of the sixty-six books, and must be familiar with how they relate to Christ. In his teaching, Paul frequently referred to Christ as the example to be followed. He was not satisifed to state principles. He gave down-to-earth examples from the life of Christ to encourage Christian living. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul&#39;s teaching was successful because the Holy Spirit was the source of his power. (See I Thess. 1 :5, and I Cor. 2: 1-5) You must be able to present the truths of the Bible. But you must also teach, as did Paul, in the power of the Spirit. You are not called to teach a message </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the Bible, but to teach the message </span><span class="csC382D2BB">of </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the Bible. This is the way the Bible changes lives.</span></p><h4 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">RELATED SUBJECTS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 16.8pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In addition to a knowledge of the Bible, you should be familiar with related subjects such as geography, history, and ancient culture.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Accurately describing the geographical settings will help your students understand various Bible events. These events actually happened at specific times and places and your descriptions can bring these events alive.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students are also greatly helped when their teacher is well informed about world historical events that parallel the narratives of the Bible. Many Bible events can be properly understood only in the light of their historical setting. Further, a knowledge of history will help students understand and appreciate how God in &quot;the fullness of time&quot; revealed his plan for human redemption.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In addition, students often have great difficulty in understanding some biblical beliefs and actions because they do not understand the culture that produced them. A working knowledge of the habits, customs, ceremonies, and attitudes of Bible times helps you enrich lessons and make them come alive.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">CONTEMPORARY CONDITIONS</span></h3>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teaching takes place in the context of the world-social, political, economic, religious, personal. You must understand all these relationships. This is no easy task in these times of rapid social changes. These social changes make it even more important that you be able to relate Bible teachings to life. When the foundations that were once considered permanent begin to break up, people need to realize that there is still one sure foundation. You must be aware of these threats and challenges if you are to help your students meet them.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You should know the age group characteristics of your students. Only then will you find an entrance into their lives. In seeking to understand your students, be sensitive to their needs. You must be prepared to deal with discipline problems resulting from your own leadership and others caused by faulty home conditions. You need skill in dealing with people and an understanding of broad social problems faced by students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You, therefore, need to take advantage of every opportunity to understand the needs and background of th&#39;ose you teach. Then you can build on this broad understanding by getting to know individual students through meaningful records, planned class contacts, and home visitation.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your responsibilities can be a delight or a drudgery. Systematic preparation procedures will enrich the entire teaching experience. Observing these three steps will increase the effectiveness of preparation and teaching.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">POSITIVE ATTITUDE</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your attitude toward your responsibilities will largely determine success. If you accepted a teaching assignment, do not do it out of a sense of duty, but because you are called of God. Be sure you are also motivated by love for your students. In exercising your ability to teach, you should see the potential for change in the lives of other persons and understand that God will be working through you to accomplish the mission of the church. These factors can instill within you an infectious enthusiasm that will be caught by your students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">LESSON PREPARATION</span></h2>
		<p class="cs4D363080"><a name="OLE_LINK7"></a><a name="OLE_LINK8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Enthusiasm is always a prerequisite to lesson preparation because your excitement will overflow into your lesson plans. Certain hours should be set aside each week for lesson preparation. Teaching is a holy calling and its preparation must not be relegated to the spare moments that are left after everything else is done.</span></a></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Time will be saved and far more will be accomplished if you establish a definite, clearly ouUined pattern for study. Bible study opens many avenues of interest. You may be tempted to follow inviting bypaths that are not directly associated with the lesson. However, an orderly plan of procedure will make it possible to accomplish much more in a given period of time.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Further information on lesson planning follows in later chapters.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF-PREPARATION</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible says that &quot;Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man&quot; (Luke 2:52). This four-fold development is equally applicable today. &nbsp;&quot;Increased wisdom&quot; focuses on an alert mind which is essential to successful teaching. Today&#39;s students learn to reason logically. They, therefore, quickly come to resent superficial reasoning in church education. You must think intelligently, analyze carefully, and dare not be behind the times. Be sure also to read Christian magazines, current events, newspapers, devotional literature, Christian fiction.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="OLE_LINK2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In addition, teaching can be greatly enhanced through vibrant, healthy bodies. It is difficult to teach enthusiastically when you do not feel well. Heredity and elements beyond your control will partly determine physical health. But because you as a Christian surrender your body to Christ, you will want to exercise constant discipline to maintain your health and strength.</span></a></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><a name="OLE_LINK3"></a><a name="OLE_LINK4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your personal relationship with God must be a priority for you to increase in &quot;favour with God.&quot; Study the Bible to learn the facts you need to teach. But more importantly, study the Bible in order to allow it to speak to your own spiritual needs. A time for personal daily devotions is essential. Every lesson should be immer.sed in prayer from the first steps of preparation to its conclusion and</span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">application to the lives of your students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><a name="OLE_LINK5"></a><a name="OLE_LINK6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus also increased in &quot;favour with man.&quot; Paul wrote that &quot;none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself&quot; (Rom. 14:7). If you are to grow as a Christian and as a Christian teacher, you must grow in your ability to relate meaningfully to other persons. Your class members must see in you a deep sense of honesty, &nbsp;sympathy, and acceptance. Though you are concerned about working to change persons through the Word of God, you must not become a manipulator; but be willing to openly share yourself and that which God has given you.</span></a></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><a name="OLE_LINK9"></a><a name="OLE_LINK10"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SUMMARY</span></a></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher is the focal point of teaching. Believers are commissioned by God to lead men to Christ and then to teach them to apply God&#39;s Word to their lives. You not only must know Christ as Savior; but must exhibit faith that works and faith in God&#39;s Word. Your personality, personal example, and relationships are yielded to God so that students can see and benefit from the attitudes and actions presented. Knowledge of the Bible, geography, history, ancient culture, contemporary conditions, ,and student characteristics offer you well-rounded information in preparing and presenting lessons.

You probably would think such behavior was strange, and not trust a bow and arrow in the hands of such a person again. Yet every week in innumerable church education classes something similar is happening. Teachers come to class and verbally shoot in every direction without ever taking aim_ at a target.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">VALVES OF AIMS</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The importance of lesson aims (goals, objectives) in the teaching-learning process is seen in the functions they perform. An aim is a clear statement of what you hope to accomplish by teaching the lesson. Lesson aims are valuable for planning, teaching, and evaluating.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">PLANNING</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The aim gives direction by helping you plan the lesson step by step through the approach, development, and application. This eliminates any unnecessary material or activities and allows you to use the limited amount of teaching time to the greatest possible advantage.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The aim also helps you determine your teaching methods. If the aim of the lesson is to impart a great deal of new information, you may choose the lecture method. If you seek to involve the students emotionally in the lesson, you may choose to use drama, projected visuals, or storytelling. A project may help students acquire certain skills; a word-by-word study may help them increase their understanding of a doctrine; and a general discussion about a controversial issue may help create a more tolerant attitude on the part of the students. Establishing a specific lesson aim will often help you use innovative teaching methods.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">TEACHING</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A clearly defined aim also allows you greater flexibility in the class presentation. Changing conditions in the classroom, the unexpected questions, the sudden interest in a special topic, even the lesson conclusion can best be handled when you have your aim clearly in mind. When you know where you are going, you can use the unexpected to help accomplish your goal rather than allow it to become a diversion.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">EVALUATING</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Successful Christian teachers realize the importance of evaluating the results of teaching. In order to be able to measure results, you must have some standard of evaluation and a lesson aim provides this needed yardstick. If the lesson aim was for students to be able to name the books of the New Testament, the teacher can take satisfaction when this goal is reached. If, on the other hand, the goal was not reached, consideration must be given to improving the situation and accomplishing the goal. Perhaps more time should be spent on reaching the goal, or the teaching method may need to be changed.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">DETERMINING AIMS</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 451.9pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are essentially two bases for determining teaching aims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One is the Bible content of the lesson; the other is the needs of thestudents.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 34.55pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">THE BIBLE</span></h1>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To determine biblical aims, teachers must become serious students of the Bible for it is the final authority for learning God&#39;s purpose for mankind. To be able to share with your students God&#39;s will for them, you must study the Scriptures diligently. Understanding the context and situation in which a particular passage - was written will help you state clearly the objective truth presented.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CLASS MEMBERS</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 14.4pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The needs of the class members is another basis for determining lesson aims. Older students will be aware of some of their needs, and you should consult with them in designing &quot;the lesson aims, but children and some older students may not be conscious of all of their needs. For this reason, teachers need to know the aims that are appropriate at various age levels. For example, a preschool teacher preparing a lesson on the story of Joseph in the house of Potiphar might suggest faithfulness as the lesson aim. With teenagers the lesson aim might focus on avoiding sexual temptation. .</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In addition to the needs that class members will have, each student has individual needs not necessarily shared with others. If you are to design your aims to meet these needs, you must know your students individually. This means that you need to spend time with them outside the classroom in informal social activities or visiting their homes. If your pray continually for your students you will soon develop a sensitivity to their needs and be better able to plan lesson aims to help meet those needs.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">GENERAL AIMS OF CHURCH TEACHING</span></h2>
		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 48pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Your major responsibility as a teacher is to transmit the Word of God so that every student may be transformed by God&#39;s grace.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 33.8pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">LEAD STUDENTS TO CHRIST</span></h3>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You must recognize and accept your responsibility to lead each student to trust in Christ and accept him as personal Savior. By explaining the way of salvation as revealed in the Scriptures, praying for your students, and living out your faith in Christ daily, you will make this responsibility a natural part of your teaching. Never use artificial, high-pressure methods, especially with young children.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">GUIDE STUDENTS TO FULFILL GOD&#39;S WILL</span></h1>
		<p class="csBF7E0EA4"><span class="csCF6BBF71">0 Acceptance of Christ as Savior is the first step toward a full life. You should not be satisfied, however, to stop with this first step. It is God&#39;s purpose that every Christian &quot;grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&quot; (II Pet. 3: 18). Therefore, a new Christian must be fed. Growing to Christian maturity takes time, and you need to be patient as you help your students strive toward maturity. Christian character develops as people come to know and obey God&#39;s will for their lives. Worship, consistent Christ-like living, and Christian service are vital to spiritual growth.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All believers must understand and apply the attitude of worship. Worship is the Christian&#39;s act of ascribing worth to God. In worship, believers adore God and contemplate his holiness and majesty. Worship is fellowship with God. Through class sessions and the church service itself, you can cultivate this worship experience. Instruction should be given in the definitions and application of such terms as reverence, gratitude, love, and faith. Teaching which includes songs and prayers suited to the age level will be effective in guiding students to an understanding of worship.</span></p><p class="csEFA8EBDB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Believers must also be challenged toward consistent Christian living. In today&#39;s complex society it is not always easy for students to translate God&#39;s will for their lives into practical daily actions. You must keep this in mind as you plan lesson aims that deal with the students&#39; needs to resist temptations and be faithful witnesses for the Lord.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">New life in Christ should result in daily efforts to honor him. An essential guide toward this is patient, dedicated teaching of the Word of God. It is, therefore, your responsibility to link the truths taught with the daily lives of your students to help them to be &quot;doers of the word, and not hearers only&quot; (James I :22). Christians who possess and profess the truth will be transformed.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In addition to consistent Christ-like living is the importance of Christian service. Jesus was particularly concerned about the needs of people. He healed the sick, comforted the sorrowing, helped the oppressed. Growing Christians need to increase their concern for others. You can plan lesson aims that will make your students aware of opportunities for Christian service and motivate them to learn how and where to serve.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The church provides many positions of service such as teachers, leaders, board members, ushers, and singers. In addition, there are numerous opportunities for Christian service beyond the local congregation. In every community there are the sick, the poor, the lonely who need the kind of personal, loving attention that Christians are well qualified to give. Beyond the local community are the multiplied needs of distant lands. You can open these avenues of service to your students by the lesson aims you prepare.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SPECIFIC AIMS OF CHURCH TEACHING</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the same lesson, aims can vary according to the emphasis that is needed. Three types of specific aims include: increasing factual knowledge, changing attitudes, and improving behavior. Each type of aim has a place in tl:te teaching process. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31B015EA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">INCREASE KNOWLEDGE</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The accumulation of information or gathering of facts is important in church education because Christianity includes a body of knowledge that students must know and understand before they can make a meaningful commitment to Christ. At the heart of the gospel stands the historical facts of Christ&#39;s life, death, and resurrection. The story of God&#39;s acts in the history of the Hebrew people as recorded in the Old Testament provides a necessary framework for the Christian faith. The teachings of the apostles convey essential doctrinal truth necessary for one to live the Christian life.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because biblical knowledge is needed for Christian commitment and growth, you should plan specific knowledge aims that state what facts of Scripture your students should know at the completion of the lesson.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">IMPROVE ATTITUDES</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students can learn facts and they also can react to and apply what they learn. Teaching aims which focus on changing attItudes deal essentially with emotions and desires. It is not enough for students to know factually that certain types of behavior are sinful, they must have&quot; conviction that it is wrong and want to glorify God instead. Attitudes are the springboard for changes in behavior.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Attitudes involve ideals and convictions. Individuals may be willing to die for a cause about which they feel very strongly. But they will not sacrifice their lives for something they merely know about or understand. Attitudes are closely connected with interpersonal relationships and are affected by the attitudes of others. You should desire the development of attitudes in your students that reflect the values of Jesus Christ. Attitudes are more likely to be changed if you definitely aim your lesson toward a specific attitude change.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CHANGE BEHAVIOR</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Changes of attitude should lead to changes of behavior in the lives of your students. You should not be satisifed just to have your students know more about the Bible; nor should you be willing to rest with an improvement in their attitudes. Changes in their behavior is the important completing step.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Knowledge is not the equivalent of the Christian life; neither is understanding the assurance of Christian maturity. Certainly the scribes and Pharisees were the best informed &quot;believers&quot; of their day, yet Christ said of them, &quot;Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter the kingdom of heaven&quot; (Matt. 5:20).</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible emphasizes action. Jesus said, &quot;Blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it&quot; (Luke 11 :28). James &#39;emphasized the same point when he wrote that &quot;faith without works is dead&quot; (James 2:26). Changes in behavior can be readily observed. Therefore, aims designed to change behavior need to be specific. Yet changes in behavior, since they go against previously practiced habits, do not come instantly. Keep this in mind when planning behavioral aims and realize that these aims must often be repeated many times before they finally take root in the lives of your students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">QUALITIES OF GOOD LESSON AIMS</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An effective aim has the following characteristics: </span></p><p class="csFA6B760A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

They should be achievable and the degree to which the aim is achieved should be measurable. This is not always easy to do, especially with attitude alms. &nbsp;An example of a knowledge aim is: &quot;That the students are able to locate the books of the Old Testament in a Bible quiz.&quot; &nbsp;An aim for attitude improvement might read, &quot;That the students will volunteer this week to do a job not required of them.&quot; &nbsp;In preparing a behaviorial aim in relation to the doctrine of the church, a teacher might state, &quot;That the students will attend church service three of the next four Sundays.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When specific aims are established and met in individual lessons, there is a much better chance that the general aims for the unit, the quarter, or the year will be met.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><a name="OLE_LINK11"></a><a name="OLE_LINK12"><span class="csCF6BBF71">SUMMARY</span></a></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 448.05pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly defined aims are essential and are valuable in plannIng, teaching, and evaluating lessons.

The answer: the one that is most effective in accomplishing the lesson aim.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Every carpenter&#39;s tool has its proper use. A carpenter does not use a saw to drive a nail, level a beam, or measure a board. In the same way, a teacher does not use the same teaching method for every teaching situation.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are probably at. least two reasons why anyone method:is overused. First, many teachers tend to teach in the same manner they were taught. If they were taught by the lecture method as students, when they become teachers, lecture is the method they use. The second reason many teachers tend to overuse one method is habit. They feel secure in familiar situations and often go to great lengths to resist change.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Recognizing that there are many effective teaching methods, each having an appropriate use, will improve your teaching. Understand also that change does not have to be threatening, but can actually help you feel more secure in your teaching. In this chapter, teacher-centered methods are presented. The next chapter deals with methods that involve more direct student participation.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

Know the details of the story so you won&#39;t have to read it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Use strong, action verbs and employ adjectives sparingly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

For example, Luke 15: </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">11, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">12 provide the beginning for the story of the prodigal</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">son. These verses immediately grab the listeners&#39; attention.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">..</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The </span><span class="csC382D2BB">growing action </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">results from the actions of the characters. A series of rhetorical questions and answers, or problems and possible solutions maintain the attention of the listeners. In</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the story of the prodigal son, the main character leaves home, spends his money, goes bankrupt, and then comes to himself in quick sequence. Storytellers may ask questions about each of these events. For example, when the prodigal leaves home, you may ask, &quot;Why did he want to leave home?&quot;&quot;&#39;When he goes bankrupt, you may ask, &quot;Where were all his new friends after he had spent all his money?&quot; &nbsp;Be careful to ask rhetorical questions that wiI.l maintain interest, not start a discussion that will divert the students from the story.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;What is the result of all the actions in the story?&quot; is the question answered by the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">climax. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">In</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the story of the prodigal son, climactic questions might include: &quot;Will the son really apologize?&quot; &quot;Will his father refuse to take him back?&quot; Certainly the son has no legitimate claim on his father&#39;s love. Yet to our amazement, &quot;his father . . . ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him&quot; (Luke 15:20). Since many students may already know the outcome of the parable of the prodigal son, you will need to be very, dramatic to hold their attention to the end.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The </span><span class="csC382D2BB">conclusion </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">should be short and direct, providing vivid word pictures.

Remember, be brief or the drama will lose its impact.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sometimes you may want to use an &quot;open-ended&quot; story. This type of story involves class members in a concrete true-to-life situa- &#39;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">tion. It presents a problem, relating to the lesson aim, that students might encounter. Present the situation and the problem, not the solution. Ask the class: &quot;What would you do?&quot; Answers should be tested by the scriptural truth presented in the lessoh. By making the lesson personal, students may better understand how the spiritual truths affect their daily lives.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">ILLUSTRATIONS</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Skillful teachers will find numerous opportunities to use one of the most valuable tools of instruction-the illustration. Illustrations lead students to understand the new or unfamiliar in terms of the old or familiar. The parables of Jesus are excellent examples of verbal illustrations. In</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the parables, Christ used familiar things and situations to help his listeners learn new spiritual truths or to understand old truths in a new light.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A teacher&#39;s work is not done when the facts of the lesson have been presented. Students must be helped to understand the signifi</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">cance of these facts and to retain them in their memories. Then &nbsp;these facts must make an impression on their wills and emotions and move them to take some actions or make some changes in their own lives. Illustrations will help accomplish each of these steps. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">TYPES OF ILLUSTRATIONS</span></h4>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are two general types of illustrations---,visual and verbal. Since visual illustrations are discussed in another chapter, verbal illustrations will be explained here.</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="cs31B015EA">Parable</span><span class="csC382D2BB">s, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">which are more than simple stories, are one type of verbal illustration. Although Jesus never gave a precise definition of the kingdom of heaven, yet by parables that drew upon familiar things and situations, he was able gradually to introduce his hearers to many aspects of the kingdom. Some of the parables were quite obvious in their intent. Others were deliberately veiled in order to force his listeners to think for themselves.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="cs31B015EA">Figures of speech</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">illustrate a thought by making a comparison.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">F or example, similes or metaphors are figures of speech. A simile is a comparison using &quot;like&quot; or&quot;&#39;as.&quot; A metaphor is a more direct comparison such as Jesus used when he said, &quot;I am the bread of life&quot; (John 6:35), &quot;I am the door&quot; (John 10:9), or &quot;I am the true vine&quot; (John 15: I).</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You may also illustrate your lessons by using </span><span class="cs31B015EA">allusions-passing</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">references to historical, biographical, literary, or scientific data. The Apostle Paul used this method often in his writings. He made allusions to law, medicine, architecture, athletics, commerce, agriculture, and Greek literature and religion. L</span><a name="OLE_LINK17"></a><a name="OLE_LINK18"><span class="csCF6BBF71">imit the use of allusions and other types of verbal illustrations, however, with younger students. Since an illustration goes from the known to the unknown, the student must understand the known. As a result, when teaching children, be careful to use illustrations they will understand.</span></a></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs31B015EA">SOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS</span></h5>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><a name="OLE_LINK19"></a><a name="OLE_LINK20"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible provides a rich source for verbal illustrations because the stories convey the truth as&#39; God intended. Bible illustrations help refresh the students&#39; memories of scriptural events and fix them more permanently in their minds.</span></a></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">PerSonal experiences also afford many valuable teaching illustra::tions. These can usually be presented vividly and dramatically. If illustrations from personal experiences are used thoughtfully and not too frequently, students will enjoy and learn from them.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">History and biography offer innumerable verbal illustrations as well as the areas of nature and science and current events. Illustrations are everywhere if you train yourself to look for them.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Finding illustrations is sometimes easy, but remembering them until they are needed is often difficult. Some teachers collect illustration ideas in notebooks or scrapbooks. Others prefer note cards that can be filed by subject matter or by Scripture text. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><h6 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">USING ILLUSTRATIONS</span></h6>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><a name="OLE_LINK21"></a><a name="OLE_LINK22"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What makes an illustration effective? Why do some illustrations grab and hold students&#39; interest while others fail? The following suggestions can make illustrations more vivid and vital.</span></a></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An illustration should be </span><span class="cs31B015EA">clear</span><span class="csC382D2BB">, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">depicting the meaning of the truth being taught. It should be based on something familiar to students, something drawn from the realm of their experience. If the illustration has to be explained, it is not effective.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An illustration should be long enough to convey the truth adequately, but </span><span class="cs31B015EA">brief</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">enough to allow the hearer to absorb the teaching. If, for example, half the lesson period is taken up by one illustration. it is too long.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Effective illustrations will be</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="cs31B015EA">fresh</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">and new. Even a good illustration, if it is overused, will become dull. The freshness of an illustration drawn from a current event or some recent personal experience will appeal to students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Illustrations should be </span><span class="cs31B015EA">dignified</span><span class="csC382D2BB">, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">appropriate for the spiritual truth being conveyed. Purity of life and thought must always match purity of doctrine. At the same time, tecrchers should not rule out humorous illustrations. Sometimes these are very effective. Jesus&#39; parable about the excuses given by those who had been invited to the supper certainly must have had his audience laughing before he finished (Luke 14: 16-20).</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">PARTICIPATION</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learning is more than listening. Students who only listen to stories or lectures tend to become intellectually lazy if they are not participating actively. The concepts they gain are often unclear and incomplete because they have not thought them through on their own.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Listening should lead to active participation. Good teachers use every opportunity to lead their students to take part in various kinds of participation. Students must become involved if they are to completely understand the lesson and be able to reproduce it in their own words or in their own life situations. At its best, education is a drawing-out process. Class participation helps achieve this goal.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If students are to participate, they must learn to study on their own. This enables the students to come to class with some familiarity with--the subject. It also provides the teacher an- opportunity to learn how much the students know about the subject or to identify errors that may have developed in their thinking. Advance preparation and oral presentation in class help students clarify their own thinking. Sometimes students are mentally lazy and, when this becomes apparent, the teacher will have an opportunity to challenge them to a more active participation.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No participation is very successful if conducted simply as routine. To insist that students merely repeat the facts of the lesson in the language of the textbook actually encourages mental laziness. It fails to call forth any activity except that of memory.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Effective participation requires that you give attention to assignment, student preparation, and class participation.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs31B015EA">ASSIGNMENT</span></h5>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher&#39;s attitude will largely determine whether an assignment is boring or exciting. If you are obviously excited about the lesson, this enthusiasm will be caught by your students. Then, on their own, they will seek to discover what this excitement is all about. One way to arouse interest is to help students see benefits they will enjoy by completin_g the assignments. Assignments within the range of individual abilities and available time are more likely to be completed. It is also a good idea to enlist the interest and aid of children&#39;s parents. Parents can be most helpful in providing assistance and encouragement to their children. In adult classes, students may be encouraged to complete assignments in areas of personal interest.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs31B015EA">STUDENT PREPARATION</span></h5>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If assignments are to lead to successful participation, they must be clearly understood by all stud_nts and assigned far enough in advance so that there is ample time for preparation. It is also important that students have the resources available to them such as Bibles, textbooks, activity books, and other references needed. Students need to feel that the assignment will lead to worthwhile information.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs31B015EA">CLASS PARTICIPATION</span></h5>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Allow sufficient time during the class period for student participation. As many students as possible should be encouraged to take part. Some students may be hesitant either because they are timid or because they have not prepared. To help students who are unsure of themselves, ask questions that are relatively easy. This will bolster their self-confidence. Students who are lazy need to be motivated, but it is rarely a good idea to embarrass a student publicly.

This chapter focuses on student-centered methods of teaching. Because some people feel that the teacher is the central </span><span class="csC382D2BB">focus </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">of the lesson, the teacher-centered methods are sometimes more widely used than student-centered methods. In fact, teacher-centered methods have become so traditional that many hesitate to try other approaches.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yet many student-centered methods have been used </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">centuries. Jesus, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">example, used dialogue in teaching Nicodemus (John 3) and the woman at the well (John 4). He used debate when His authority was challenged by His critics (Matthew 21: 13-25:46). The Lord also assigned a project when He sent the twelve out on a preaching mission (Matthew 10).</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are many advantages in using student-centered teaching methods. First, they relieve you of the responsibility of being an an-knowing authority. Instead, you become a co-learner along with your students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another advantage is that students are more likely to become involved in the teacher-learning process. The more involved the students are, the more they learn and the longer they retain what they have learned.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Student involvement also encourages the expression of different viewpoints. There is often not one correct answer that all Christians must accept. This is especially true in the area of application, where even mature, dedicated Christians often come to different conclusions. Often these differing viewpoints will not be expressed if teachers use only teacher-centered methods. Class involvement provides opportunity </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">students to share their various ideas.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christian teaching is concerned not only with presenting facts but with helping students change attitudes. Student-centered methods are often more successful in producing attitude changes. In a classroom where students feel free to present their ideas, attitudes of mutual respect and concern will develop resulting in Christian growth.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The use of student-centered methods does not produce results automatically. Both teachers and students need practice to develop skills and confidence with these approaches. So if you try some of these methods and feel disappointed after the first effort-try again.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All of the following methods cannot be used at every age level. Some work better with adults; others are more useful with children. Nor can they be used in every lesson. Decide what methods to use on the basis of lesson aims, the class, and the physical situation.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">GROUP DISCUSSION</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Most students are familiar with the discussion method. In</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">one form or another, intentionally or otherwise, discussion has been used in most classes of high school age or older and is appropriate for older children as well.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">ADVANTAGES</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Group discussion has several advantages: It involves the students directly in the-teaching-Iearning process. It encourages the expression of various viewpoints and it brings out erroneous ideas that the teacher may need to counteract at once, in later class sessions, or in private. It clarifies unclear thinking because students have to express concepts in their own words; and it helps students develop a sense of camaraderie and responsibility for developing the lesson.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">OBSTACLES</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 14.15pt right 451.9pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Obviously there are some obstacles involved in using this method such as:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 14.15pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Group discussion takes more time than the lecture method, and as a result, probably should not be used when the main lesson aim is to pass along a considerable amount of factual data.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The discussion can be dominated by one or two outspoken or opinionated class members. Timid members, who often have some excellent ideas, may not get an opportunity to express themselves.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5" style="tab-stops:left 14.15pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	. A discussion can ramble far from the topic, often reverting</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">again and again to the favorite hobbies of some of the members.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The discussion method is not very effective in large classes. Ordinarily the teacher will not use it if the class numbers more than 20 or 25 unless sub groups are used. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

Proper room arrangement is important. If at all possible, chairs should be &nbsp;arranged in a circle or around a table so that students may face one another.</span></p><p class="csF70856D0" style="tab-stops:left 15.1pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	. Design a stimulating subject or provocative question. A subject which interests only a few students or one in which everyone holds the same opinion is not likely to produce a lively discussIon.</span></p><p class="csF70856D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Create the proper atmosphere in the classroom. Consider yourself a co-learner, not an authority figure who intimidates the other learners.</span></p><p class="csF70856D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Evaluate the discussion. Spend a few minutes at the close of the lesson period summarizing what was said. One student might keep a record of how many times each person spoke. A report on this will tend to spotlight those who talk too much and those who have not spoken at all. Such a report will often help correct such situations without anyone having to criticize the persons involved.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">PANEL AND PANEL FORUM</span></h1>
		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 47.75pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The panel format consists of two or more persons discussing 	various aspects of a subject in front of the class. A moderator presides over and guides the discussion.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The panel forum format enlarges upon this 6y allowing the class members to raise questions or enter the discussion after the panelists have made their presentations.

		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 47.75pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Some advantages of the panel and panel forum are:</span></p><p class="csF70856D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The panelists have an opportunity to make adequate preparation for the discussion. The most effective panels consist of panelists who are experts in their field.</span></p><p class="cs702FA8D8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Various viewpoints and information will usually be presented by having several panelists that might not be possible with only one speaker.</span></p><p class="cs702FA8D8" style="tab-stops:left 42.2pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The different personalities of the panelists are more likely to hold student &nbsp;interest.</span></p><p class="csF70856D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The viewpoints and information presented by the panelists can provide a basis for a more enlightened discussion by the rest of the class.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5" style="tab-stops:left 42.2pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

Some possible obstacles in using these methods incfud-e: They take time, a serious problem when the lesson period is limited. Panelists who are experts and capable of communicating at the level of the class members are not always available. Since panelists are speaking from different viewpoints, the ideas may not always be presented in an orderly manner and might confuse the students.</span></p><p class="cs4EC675BA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">IMPROVING THE PANEL AND PANEL FORUM</span></h3>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The moderator is the key to a successful panel. He introduces the discussion, maintains order, keeps the decision flowing, and focuses it on the subject. He also directs the discussion that involves the other class members and should make provision for a summary at the close of the session.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Choose a subject that interests members of the class. Also, select panelists so that various aspects of the subject are discussed.

It may be used to illustrate a biblical event, to depict the application of a _Bible truth, or to make clearer some scriptural principle. Drama used in teaching may be prepared formally, or it can arise spontaneously within the classroom setting.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">ADVANTAGES</span></h3>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Properly used, drama has the advantage of involving students in the teaching-learning process. This causes Bible stories to come alive and take on deeper meaning for the students and helps them remember the material longer.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Drama also provides an outlet for students&#39; energies, especially smaller children. A bit of spontaneous drama can channel their activities into something creative rather than allowing them to become sources of discipline problems.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">OBSTACLES</span></h1>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are some obstacles to consider in using drama, and you need to be aware of these before deciding to use it. Ordinarily, the presentation of a major dramatic production requires much preparation: considerable time, costumes, props, and staging. Also, sometimes effective drama requires having an experienced director, capable assistants, and talented students. Because of this, many teachers do not use major dramatic presentations as part of their teaching.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">USING DRAMA</span></h3>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher who thinks of drama as an elaborate, time-consuming presentation will understandably reject it for use in the classroom. But drama need not be so elaborate to be useful in Christian teaching.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Short skits can be used in the classroom to illustrate a biblical</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">scene, costumes and props being kept to a minimum. In this use of drama, it is not necessary to spend much tinie in practicing. Keep in mind that the purpose is to teach Christian truths, not impress the viewers with a professional presentation. Most children, even when they appear shy, enjoy performing in a drama. Christian camps for years have made Bible dramas a highlight of the students&#39; camping experience.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Be alert to possibilities for spontaneous dramatic actions to capture and hold student attention. For example, in the story of David and Goliath, two students could be asked to dramatize the scene. Or the stoning of Stephen could be portrayed. One student could play the part of Stephen while the others bombarded him with &quot;stones&quot; made of wadded up newspaper.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">FIELD TRIP</span></h3>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A field trip takes the students out of the classroom. It gives them the opportunity to visit places or situations where they can see things or activities first hand or even have a &quot;hands on&quot; experience. Properly conducted, such experiences can given them insights into Bible truths or stimulate spiritual growth.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Field trips may involve a few hours and traveling several miles. Thus they are not usually conducted during a typical class period. On the other hand, a field trip could be no more elaborate than a walk to the back of the church parking lot.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">ADVANTAGES</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The greatest advantage of a field trip is that students are involved in a first hand experience. A teacher may lecture at length about God&#39;s hand in nature; but such a lecture is not likely to be as effective as a short trip to the church yard. There students may see a flower in bloom, an ant hill, or a cocoon-a far more vivid experience than merely hearing about them or seeing pictures of them. A field trip also often encourages, students to do further study on their own and it can be used with students of almost any age.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">OBSTACLES</span></h3>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are several obstacles to the use of field trips. Extensive field trips take considerable time, planning, and expense. Also, not all lessons can effectively use the field trip and appropriate places to visit may not be readily available.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SUCCESSFUL FIELD TRIPS</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before planning a trip, consider the lesson aims and decide whether they can be achieved by a field trip. Aimless activity alone does not make for good Christian teaching. Allow the students to share in the planning. They will be more enthusiastic about what they plan, and often contribute good ideas.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Plan well in advance for the trip. This includes clearing the activity with the church, making arrangements with the place to be visited, and arranging for transportation and meals, if necessary. Be sure also to keep the group small enough to be manageable and enlist enough help. This is important not only for good teaching but for safety. When taking minors on trips away from the church property, you will also need to get written permission from parents or guardians.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">PROJECT</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 451.9pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The project method can be used successfully in Christian education. A project is a purposeful activity that students plan because. they are interested in it. &nbsp;	The project should have practical application as well as teaching 	value. Usually it is started or at least planned in the class session and then completed at home.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Projects give students opportunity to learn by doing. Cooperation, tolerance of others&#39; opinions, initiative, responsibility, alertness, and judgment are developed. Projects also strengthen character and provide opportunities to acquire and develop skills.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The research project helps students become independent investigators. The teacher assigns the class members a part of the lesson to investigate for themselves and makes sure that resources are available to help them complete the project. During the lesson period class members may present their reports. These are then discussed, evaluated, and organized under the direction of the teacher. This is especially effective for older children through adult classes.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The service project involves students in activities that benefit others. There is scarcely a limit to the variety of projects-that students can accomplish, nor are these projects limited to any particular age level. Even small children can undertake activities that will help others. Usually students work together on service projects. Some suggestions for projects might be: running errands for the handicapped, visiting the aged, raking leaves for a disabled person, painting a church classroom. These projects can then be discussed during the next class session.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">INDUCTIVE BIBLE STUDY</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Inductive Bible study, which is very profitable in individual study, may also be used as a group method of instruction. The inductive method leads participants to discover Bible truths themselves. When inductive Bible study is used with a group, the teacher serves primarily as a coordinator and resource person.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are three steps in the inductive method: observation (what does it say?); interpretation (what does it mean?); and application (what does it mean to me?).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">OBSERV ATION</span></h4>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The first step in inductive Bible study for either individuals or groups is to discover exactly what the author has written. The students must attempt to lay aside any preconceived ideas they might have about the passage and approach it with an open mind.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One method is for students to write the Scripture passage in one column verse by verse, and phrase by phrase. In a second column observations can be recorded. A third column can then be used for students to write questions they might have. Observations and questions then become the basis for group discussion. When students complete this work prior to class time, a good basis for discussion has been laid.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs31B015EA">INTERPRETATION</span></h5>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The second step in inductive Bible study is interpretation. The purpose of this is to discover the meaning the author wished to convey. A series of questions may help at this point: Who is the author? When did he write? Under what circumstances did he write? To whom did he write? Why did he write?</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After these questions have been discussed, other questions may arise. Students as well as the teacher should be involved in this process. Sometimes it is necessary to define key words in the passage. Dictionaries ought to be available to the students for this purpose. Reading the pass,!ge in several different translations, noting similarities and differences, will often help.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The best interpretation of any scriptural passage is the Bible itself. Thus it is handy to have available Bibles with cross references or topical references.

		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The third step in inductive Bible study is often the most difficult because it confronts the participants with God&#39;s message. No longer are they merely seeking to understand. Now they must decide to obey or disobey. This requires prayer and faith but leads to changed lives. You can encourage right decisions by permitting time for sharing among class members.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You should be aware of the advantages of using the following student-centered teaching methods. The group discussion encourages every member of the class to participate. The panel can be used to bring expert information into the discussion, while drama enlivens Bible truths and directs student energies into useful channels. The field trip allows students to learn outside the classroom and to share in a first hand learning experience. The project gets the students involved in research or in useful Christian service. Inductive Bible study stimulates the students to seek new insights into and application of scriptural passages.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 21.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Preschool children have only brief attention spans, perhaps one &nbsp;minute for each&#39; year of age. Usually no more should be expected of them. Primary children will have an increasingly lengthened period of sustained attention. They begin to appreciate their own abilities and to enjoy longer periods of thought or discussion. By the middle of the first grade or during the second grade, welltrained students begin to make the transition from much physical activity to the enjoyment of mental exercise. Their attention span becomes noticeably longer. As soop as students arrive in the classroom get them involved in a creative or thought-provoking activity. If the first activity attracts their attention, you will be better able to keep it throughout the lesson. At any grade level you are wise to seek first to gain attention, then to retain it, and finally to turn attention into interest.</span></p><p class="cs7A681F3F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">INTEREST</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sustained attention is dependent on interest. It is comparatively easy to gain and hold the attention of an interested student. An imperative command or some clever eye-catching trick may tern.. pOrarily attract attention, but genuine interest alone will sustain it.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ability to gain and maintain interest will depend on these factors:</span></p><p class="cs8025A8DA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Discovering the student&#39;s plane of thought</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Guarding against outside distractions</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Providing a lesson suited to the student&#39;s capacity</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Enlisting the student&rsquo;s cooperation in the lesson</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Attention and interest are directly related to motivation. Motivated learning is that which is desired by the student. The quickest route to motivated learning is by gearing the lesson to the needs of the students. If learners are involved in activities that seem worthwhile to them and tbat meet their needs_ attention and interest will be maintained.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THE LAW OF THE LANGUAGE</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 47.25pt;"><span class="csC382D2BB">	</span><span class="cs31B015EA">The language used as a medium between teacher end the learner</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 29.75pt left 384.2pt;"><span class="cs31B015EA">	must be common to both.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher equipped with important knowledge is one element necessary for learning; tbe student witb his interested attention is the other.

It is fundamental to allieaming. Begin with what is already well known to the pupil upon the subject and with what he has himself experienced-and proceed to the new material by single, easy, and natural steps, letting the known explain the unknown.</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All teaching must begin at a known point of contact. If the subject is entirely new, a known point must be sought. This Jaw of association or contact is basic for all mental development. New truths can be understood only in terms of the old.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christ was a master of this law. He constantly built new truths on well-known facts. His hearers were familiar with the Old Testament. His crucifixion was to be similar to the lifting up of the brazen serpent in the wilderness. His burial and resurrection were likened to the experiences through which Jonah had passed. The times of his return would be like the days of Noah and the days of Lot. Future events were portrayed in terms of things that had already happened.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To observe the law of the lesson, you should be aware of several related procedures.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What has already been studied may be assumed to lie in the realm of the known. If you have taught these former lessons, you will be on familiar ground with your students. Every review is a demonstration of this law, and those who emphasize review best observe this principle.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">PROCEED BY GRADED STEPS</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Athletes set their goal at aD unattained level and then try to achieve it. They start at a level which they can attain and then advance little by little until a new goal is established. So a student must fully grasp each truth before the next can be explored and understood. New ideas become part of the student&#39;s knowledge and serve as a starting place for each fresh advance.

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">LAW OF THE TEACHING PROCESS</span></h2>
		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 46.8pt;"><span class="cs31B015EA">	Teaching is arousing and using the pupil&#39;s mind to grasp the	desired thought </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">or </span><span class="cs31B015EA">to master the desired art.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">not enough for students to learn BibJe facts. They must begin to live Bible truths. Your job is not complete until you arouse interest on the part of your students and help them begin to make the Bible teaching a part of their own lives.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To accomplish this you must deal with students as individuals leading them to think for themselves. &nbsp;If your students do not learn to think for themselves there will be little lasting results. &nbsp;The learning processes are quickened when students become independent investigators. &nbsp;Yet teachers are necessary elements in the process as well. &nbsp;Among other things, good teachers provide faverable conditions for self-learning. &nbsp;They do not merely impart knowledge but stimulate their students to acquire it. &nbsp;They motivate their students and set an example of earnest, serious scholarship and make available the resources students need to do independent study.</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">PROVIDE THOUGHTFUL MATERIAL</span></h2>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mental processes are limited to the field of acquired knowledge. Students who know nothing cannot think, for they have nothing to think about. In order to compare, criticize, judge, and reason the mind must work on the material in its own possession. For that reason, students need factual information which will serve as the basis of thought. Education is in part a drawing out process, but teachers cannot draw out knowledge that has not been previously implanted in students.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">PROVOKE INVESTIGATION</span></h2>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is important to arouse the spirit of investigation. Rich educational processes begin when students ask who, what, when, why, where, and how. The maturing mind grapples with the problems of</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">the universe. The falling apple caused the inquiring mind of Newton to ask the question about gravity. The boiling teakettle caused Watt to ask questions that led to the invention of the steam engine. The question is an index both to the students&#39; minds and to their inner lives. Questions lead to self..realization and self-seeking. You should stimulate this natural quest for knowledge, as well as a natural desire for expression.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">PROVIDE SATISFACTION</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When students derive pleasure from what they are doing, they are more likely to continue the activity. This is known as reward or reinforcement. The tendency is to repeat those experiences which are satisfying and avoid those which are not.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Satisfaction will be provided where learning is helpful to their daily lives, wbere it meets their needs. It is your opportunity to make the learning experience worthwhile for students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">LA W OF THE LEARNING PROCESS</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 46.3pt;"><span class="csC382D2BB">	</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Learning is thinking into one&rsquo;s own understanding a new idea of</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 33.1pt;"><span class="cs31B015EA">	truth or working into habit a new art or skill.</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Effective teachers arouse and guide the self-activities of their students. Teachers also evaluate the students&#39; responses. They help students to evaluate new. truths and translate them into the arts and skills of basic daily living.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learning requires active interest, attention and a clear and distinct act or process which only students can perform. They must cultivate their own minds by their own power to achieve a true concept of the facts or principles of the lesson. This law of the learning process is vital to aU teaching situations.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The work of education is more the work of students than of the teachers. True learning is more than repetition. Original discovery is a thrilling, stimulating process. The discoverer borrows facts known to others and adds that which he has learned by experience. Teachers use this law to guide students to be independent investigators.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are three distinct stages of learning; reproduction, interpretation, and application.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

And when they are able to express their own opinion of these facts, they understand what they have learned. They are able to deal with their own thoughts as well as the thoughts of others. Failure to insist on original thinking is a common fault of untrained teachers. Good teachers go beyond asking questions that can be- answered with factual information alone.

They are reviews of what transpired-at the beginning and end of the meeting. The first review establishes close relationship with former sessions. The second carries the day&#39;s proceedings into tbe next meeting. It is important to make contact with former lessons at the beginning of each lesson. It is equally essential that each day&#39;s instruction be carried over to the next lesson, and that all learning be vitalized in the lives </span><span class="csC382D2BB">of </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the students. Review reinforces previous learning; it deepens its impression by linking it with new i_eas.

		<p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Although repetition is often involved in the process, review is more than repetition. It is an attempt to refocus facts and principles. It also provides the opportunity to gain deeper insight and tie previous knowledge to new situations. The student will not catch nor retain every detail in the first reading of a book. The second reading usuaHy brings out-Jacts that were missed in the first reading. So it is with Bible study. No other book needs more careful reading and study. No other book is so filled with treasures and blessings. A review of familiar, favorite passages will reveal new light and disclose new lessons.</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">REMEMBER AND CONFIRM KNOWLEDGE</span></h1>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Review familiarizes and strengthens through association of ideas. A person who is introduced to a group of people may not remember many of the names. Later, when he sees and talks with a member of this group, however, he will review the names and his memory will be strengthened. The lesson that is studied only once will soon be forgotten. What is repeatedly reviewed will become part of the equipment of knowledge and be permanently remembered and used. This is the real measure of achievement.</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">APPLY AND PRACTICE KNOWLEDGE</span></h1>
		<p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Frequent, thorough review renders knowledge readily useful. The Scripture texts which help us most are those which have been applied and used. These verses are remembered when occasion demands. Truths which have become familiar by repetition can shape conduct and mold character. The &quot;line upon line and precept upon precept&quot; rule of the Bible is a recognition of this truth. Review is important, necessary&quot; activity, not a time-consuming drudgery. Teachers who review make their teaching complete.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

Because of rising educational&#39; standards and the growing pressures of the secular world, Christian teachers must do a better job than ever before.

You must become a serious student of the Bible-studying, interpreting, digesting, and applying its teachings.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible is its own best interpreter. A comparison of Scripture with S_ripture throws light on obscure passages. Fortunately, you have many different translations available to employ in your study and teaching. Each version has its own strengths and weaknesses. Teachers of children and youth may find that their students understand and have less difficulty using one of the modern language translations.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some Bibles contain valuable notes and geographical, historical, and archaeological information. More complete aids may also be purchased in separate volumes. Bibles which include a brief concordance also may help in the classroom. </span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some Bibles have notes and comments on various passages. In this arrangement a commentary is provided with the text. These explanations have particular value to those who do not have specialized training.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Since good teachers help their students become independent investigators, you should develop your own ability and technique of investigation.

Reliable, up-to-date commentaries are written by recognized Bible scholars who are familiar with recent developments in biblical literature and archaeology. While these volumes should be available in every church library, most teachers feel the need to have their own commentaries. A word of caution is needed here. Because commentaries are written by fallible and often biased people they should not be accepted as the final answer on Bible interpretation. For this reason, you should consult several diff_rent commentaries.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">TEACHER&#39;S GUIDE AND AIDS</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In studying the lesson, read the Bible several times: first for the story; then for the incidents; next for the persons mentioned; then for its doctrinal and practical teachings; and finally for the spirit of the message. Only after a background of independent study should you consult guides and other lesson helps. By following this order, you will personally discover many facts mentioned in the guide materials and have the satisfaction of blazing the trail for yourself.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher&#39;s guide should supplement your knowledge. It should be used with the Bible, never as a substitute for it and should not be prominent in the actual presentation. Teaching directly from the Bible reminds the students of the inspired source of Christian instruction. Any teacher who uses a teacher&#39;s guide without first studying the Bible passage independently is apt to do little original thinking or teaching.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teacher&#39;s aids clarify difficult passages, provide apt illustrations, and supply essential information on ancient manners and customs. Use Bible-centered, Christ-honoring aids so that students obtain a right understanding, interpretation, and application of the Scripture.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

Manufacturers and distributors offer valuable audiovisual literature and catalogs, often free of charge. The local library, travel agency, or the government can furnish vital information as well.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers who are up to date on current affairs, who know their subject thoroughly, and who understand students will teach from the overflow of their rich lives.

		<p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers, like newspaper reporters, should be alert to new materials. In devotional study; in reading of books, magazines, and newspapers; In listening to the radio and television; and in every personal contact you should be gathering material for long-range lesson preparation.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="csCF6BBF71">PLANS FOR FUTURE LESSONS</span></h1>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In carefully planned curricula, each lesson is related to those preceding and those following. Taken together, they develop a complete theme. Each study must be related to the general theme for the entire unit.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To assure full, active class participation you must make assignments in advance of the lesson. This cannot be done unless you have given considerable time to long-range planning and study.

		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you are to improve your effectiveness, you must continue to grow both spiritually and intellectually. To do this, you learn to read selectively, systematically, and intelligently. As you extend your own vision, increase your own knowledge, deepen your own spirituality, and vitalize your own faith your students will drink from rivers of living water rather than from stagnant pools.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you can present facts vividly, you will appeal to your students&#39; imaginations. But you cannot show students what you yourself do not see. For this reason, lesson material should be reproduced in mental pictures. During your preparation, occasionally close your eyes and form vivid pictures of the scenes and persons about whom you have been reading. This will develop your ability to cJvisualize and will make your teaching more creative.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

Recording and filing materials make them available at a later time.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you faithfully follow a systematic way of preserving this information, over the years you will accumulate a vast wealth of teaching material.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs31B015EA">For General Information</span></h5>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Never read without thinking; never think without writing. When you find something worthwhile, copy it into a notebook or on notecards along with information about the source so that it can be quickly relocated when needed. Many teachers underline important passages or use a special felt-tip pen to make them easier to find.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Facts and statistics are valuable. They form a foundation and a strong resource for class discussion. Quotations from representative leaders and educators carry authority. Information about the latest discoveries and inventions inspire wide-awake classes.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Personal experiences and human interest stories make lessons come alive and give them emotional appeal. Many are related to the spiritual realm: answers to prayer; reports of God&#39;s providence; demonstrations of God&#39;s power; missionary adventure. These are most effective if they are related to some class member or generally known as current news events. All pertinent information should be recorded correctly, including names, dates, places, and sources of information.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For Specific Lessons</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your notebook or card file is valuable in planning for future lessons.

An aid may help impart knowledge, .attitudes, skills, or understanding; arouse emtions; or develop appreciation. An in_tructional aid, therefore, is a tool for improving instruction.	,_</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Instructional aids are - valuabl_ for several reasons. First, they help overcome the language barrier in teaching. Most teaching is verbal, either written or oral; yet increasingly our culture emphasizes visual learning. Aids help capture and hold student attention and make learning more rapid, thus making more efficient use of class time. Students remember longer what they have learned when the aural sense is reinforced by the visual. Aids can make t_e Bible come alive in ways that words alone cannot.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If all of these things are true about instructional aids, why don&#39;t more teachers use them? Perhaps the main obstacle is habit-we use only what is most comfortable and familiar. Also, aids usually take extra time and planning to prepare and require certain skills in using equipment. Many aids, especially audiovisuals, do involve some expense for equipment and materials. Yet when you come to realize how effective these aids may be, you will quickly forget these obstacles.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Traditionally, instructional aids have been classified either as impressional or expre_sional.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">IMPRESSIONAL AIDS</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Impressional aids are used to create impressions on the students through activities that are done to or for them. Among the impressional aids that you will find effective are audio devices, visuals, and audiovisuals.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">AUDIO AIDS</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sound is vital to communication and equipment such as phonographs and tape recorders can be used profitably in church education.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Records</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Phonograph records are available on a variety of subjects such as Bible and life application stories. Recorded music might be used to set moods for the lesson, to teach new songs, or to accompany singing when an instrumental accompanist is not available.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Tapes</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Tape recorders, either reel-to-ree1 or cassette, have many uses in the classroom as well. Possibilities for using tape recorders include taping or playing lectures, panel discussions and interviews with experts, and class discussion. Taped class sessions can then be taken to shut-ins. On occasion, teachers who lI,!ust be absent from the class may prepare a tape of the lesson in advance and then have it played during the class period.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">VISUAL AIDS</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Visuals reach the student through the eyes as well as the ears. One value of visuals is that students who fail to grasp a truth orally may be able to comprehend it through visual means.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A wide selection of visuals is available. Teachers who use them report increased interest, more constant attention, and an enthusiastic response.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Included in this category are objects and models, maps and globes, pictures, bulletin boards, chalkboards and flipcharts, flannelgraph, and puppets.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Objects and Models</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 14.85pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Objects and models are tangible items used to help illustrate or define spiritual truth.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Objects appeal to everyone. A small object such as a coin, stone, or paper is easily used. Jesus frequently used objects in his teaching. When he wanted to teach his followers about the qualities they&#39; should possess, he set a child in their midst as an object lesson. On another occasion, when his enemies tried to trap him on the issue of paying tribute to Caesar, he called for a coin, which he then used as an object to make his point. When used effectively, objects</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">are valuable instructional aids. They give students firsthand experience with the subject being discussed.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A well-equipped church should also have among its materials a collection of models such as the tabernacle, temple, home in Bible times, as well as missionary artifacts. Bible models add background and substance to the biblical records and descriptions of life in ancient times and missionary artifacts provide realism to missions stories.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Maps and Globes</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Maps and globes help students become familiar with mISSIon fields and Bible geography and history. The journeys of the patriarchs, the wanderings of Israel, or the campaigns of Joshua and David cannot be followed without the use of maps. Every class, therefore, should have a good set of Bible maps available. Small maps in Bibles, classroom wall maps, and maps on overhead</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">transparencies are all helpful aids for effective teaching.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Pictures</span></h2>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The skillful use of pictures results in successful instruction. Some of the great works of art depict Bible scenes. Copies of these masterpieces can be used in class sessions. Often a series of pictures can be arranged to present a running narrative of the life of Christ or other Bible characters. Pictures may be purchased from publishers of curriculum materials or collected from magazines, posters, calendars, and other sources.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students may need help in interpreting a picture&#39;s message and its relationship to the lesson emphasis. Too much attention to details of a picture will cause the students to remember the picture more than the lesson. Often pictures are left up for several weeks after the lesson has been taught. In this way they silently help the students review previous lessons.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Bulletin Boards</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Often known as the classroom &quot;silent teacher,&quot; bulletin boards use good visual form, attractive colors, and effective pictures to communicate information. A bulletin board can emphasize, remind, review, introduce, or announce a variety of subjects. Bulletin boards should be kept current and fresh for maximum impact on the viewers. To add to their learning value, students can be involved in creating and constructing them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Chalkboard and Flip Chart</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Every classroom should have a chalkboard. If commerciallyprepared boards are beyond the budget, inexpensive boards may be made by applying a special chalkboard paint to a piece of hardboard.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Flip charts and chalkboards may be used by teachers to draw diagrams, outlines, and sketches step by step. Even the teacher&#39;s action while using the chalkboard helps sustain attention.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is not necessary to be a professional artist to make good use of a chalkboard or flip chart. A short line, a few stick figures, a circle, or a square can represent people, cities, or events. New and difficult words, names of characters, important dates, an outline or summary can be written for class members to see. Five things to remember when using a chalkboard or flip chart are:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Avoid too much detail.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Don&#39;t block the view.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Write legibly, but quickly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Stand at the side of your work as much as possible.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Talk while writing, but do not talk to the board.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers will also at times have the students use the flip chart or chalkboard. Student participation will help them remember the lesson longer.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Flannelgraph</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Flannelgraph is a very versatile instructional aid. It therefore is one of the most widely used aids in church educational programs. While it is most frequently used in young children&#39;s classes, it can also be effective with youth and adults.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This medium secures attention at the very outset and, as new factors appear, interest is sustained. At the end of the lesson, the class may repeat the story, placing the figures on the board. This activiity combines the faculties of hearing, seeing, and doing.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Frank G. Coleman, in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Romance of Winning Children, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">points out three basics which must be mastered if the flannelgraph is to be used successfully-dexterity, suspense, and movement.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First, to have </span><span class="csC382D2BB">dexterity, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">you need to practice the story in advance so that it flows swiftly and smoothly. The figures should be arranged in advance in the order in which they will be used. If backgrounds are to be changed during the story, these should be laid out or arranged so that the change can be made without interrupting the story. Talk as you work, but be sure to maintain eye contact with your students. produced by persons </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">diverse backgrounds, you should carefully preview them before showing them to your class. Imaginative teachers who have access to an 8mm home movie camera and projector have found creative ways to produce and use these in their teaching as well.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Filmstrips and Slides</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Similarly, filmstrips </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the 35mm projector are available in great numbers </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">sale or rental. Since these are less expensive than films, many churches purchase and maintain a filmstrip library.</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many 35mm projectors can use either filmstrips or slides. Slide programs are available commercially, but they can also b[prepared by teachers who have access to 35mm equipment. With a little practice you can photograph landscapes, buildings, other color photographs, classroom scenes, or individual students. By preparing an audio tape to accompany them, effective audiovisual programs can be produced.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Transparencies </span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">U sing a heat-sensitive photocopier, professional transparencies may be made </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">prepared masters. Commercially-prepared transparencies are available as well. Some teachers also use blank sheets of acetate and .special transparency pens to trace outlines or write comments as they teach.</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Phono-viewer programs</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The phono-viewer, which looks like a small television set, uses a record and a short filmstrip to present its message. Since this was originally designed as a toy, it is simple to operate and even younger children can use it. The phono-viewer is especially effective with a small class seated around a table. Many commerciallyprepared programs are available on Bible subjects.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Videocassettes</span></p><p class="cs7DB55037"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The video recorder-player, while still rather expensive, is becoming more readily available and is used in many churches. Videocassettes on biblical and Christian subjects are being produced in increasing numbers. As equipment prices decrease and availability of programs increase this medium will be more widely used in churches.</span></p><p class="cs7DB55037"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">EXPRESSIONAL AIDS</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 309.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	A distinction is often made between aids that are primarily</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 309.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	impressional and those that are expressional. Impressional aids include all things teachers do to make an impression on students in order to stimulate them to mental activity.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Expression, however, involves students in various activities that allow them to express some aspect of the lesson they are learningto encourage them to think through the lesson until they can express it in their own words and behavior. Expressional activities allow teachers to evaluate what students have really learned.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 21.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	To be effective, you must provide expressional activities that involve careful thinking, reasoning, analyzing, evaluating, and sum. marizing. This active involvement of the mind and will urges stu&#39;dents to become &quot;doers of the word&quot; (James 1:22).</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Expressional activities are part of good teaching. They are effective because they supplement the personality and skill of the instructor, and assist students in learning.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Impressional aids help to reach and stimulate-the student&#39;s mind but they do not necessarily secure a response. Expressional activities are effective because they deepen impression, capitalize on energy, and reach the personality in such a way as to bring lasting change in the students&#39; lives.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Children will often forget what they hear and they may forget what they have seen, but they will not soon forget what they have done. Learning is a process of .listening, looking, and doing. As students express themselves they reimpress their own minds and learn the truth through a different sense channel-not only through sight and sound, but also through activity. Learning begins and continues in what the learner does. Students taking piano lessons receive certain impressions when the teacher demonstrates a musical selection, but they don&#39;t begin to learn until they practice it for themselves.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Effective expressional activities will have a positive effect on the shaping of the lesson and the lives of the students. The objective of Christian teaching is the development of Christian character and living. This requires the appropriation and application of knowledge which is encouraged by the use of expressional activities.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Two very important expressional aids are student activity books and handwork projects.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">STUDENT ACTIVITY BOOKS</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Student activity books are important expressional aids and are included in most commercially-prepared curricula. They represent and set the pace for the students&#39; response to instruction. These materials are only a means to an end, however, and not ends in themselves. The activities contained in these books are not just busywork to keep students occupied, but are designed to help students learn by involvement and response.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">HANDCRAFT</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is estimated that students remember 1&#39;0 percent of what they hear, 50 percent of what they see, 70 percent of what they say, and 90 percent of what they do. For this reason, you should look upon handcrafts as an important part of your teaching, not just something to hold students&#39; interests or keep them quiet. Choose handcrafts carefully so that they reinforce the lesson aims.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Handcrafts may be used during presession periods to help prepare students for the lesson. Since younger children may need special supervision, it is wise to have extra helpers during the craft period.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A great variety of craft materials and projects are being produced by commercial companies. However, you can also prepare excellent crafts from inexpensive materials or- from scraps of paper, plastic, glass, cloth, and metal. The church library or your own personal library should contain several craft books which present hundreds of creative ideas for crafts.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Use projects that are related to one lesson, or to a lesson series. Your class will learn more by constructlng a model of the tabernacle than by just observing it or reading the description in Exodus. Making a relief map of Palestine will teach more about the locations of cities, mountains, and valleys than by pointing them out on a map or reading about them, or even by special instruction in Bible geography.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students may also be involved in making crafts that are to be given to others or used by others. Such projects have the added value of arousing within the student a serious c_ncern for others.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

Recorded music might be used to set moods for the lesson, to teach new songs, or to accompany singing when an instrumental accompanist is not available.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Tapes</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Tape recorders, either reel-to-ree1 or cassette, have many uses in the classroom as well. Possibilities for using tape recorders include taping or playing lectures, panel discussions and interviews with experts, and class discussion. Taped class sessions can then be taken to shut-ins. On occasion, teachers who lI,!ust be absent from the class may prepare a tape of the lesson in advance and then have it played during the class period.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">VISUAL AIDS</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Visuals reach the student through the eyes as well as the ears. One value of visuals is that students who fail to grasp a truth orally may be able to comprehend it through visual means.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A wide selection of visuals is available. Teachers who use them report increased interest, more constant attention, and an enthusiastic response.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Included in this category are objects and models, maps and globes, pictures, bulletin boards, chalkboards and flipcharts, flannelgraph, and puppets.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Objects and Models</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 14.85pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Objects and models are tangible items used to help illustrate or define spiritual truth.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Objects appeal to everyone. A small object such as a coin, stone, or paper is easily used. Jesus frequently used objects in his teaching. When he wanted to teach his followers about the qualities they&#39; should possess, he set a child in their midst as an object lesson. On another occasion, when his enemies tried to trap him on the issue of paying tribute to Caesar, he called for a coin, which he then used as an object to make his point. When used effectively, objects</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">are valuable instructional aids. They give students firsthand experience with the subject being discussed.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A well-equipped church should also have among its materials a collection of models such as the tabernacle, temple, home in Bible times, as well as missionary artifacts. Bible models add background and substance to the biblical records and descriptions of life in ancient times and missionary artifacts provide realism to missions stories.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Maps and Globes</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Maps and globes help students become familiar with mISSIon fields and Bible geography and history. The journeys of the patriarchs, the wanderings of Israel, or the campaigns of Joshua and David cannot be followed without the use of maps. Every class, therefore, should have a good set of Bible maps available. Small maps in Bibles, classroom wall maps, and maps on overhead</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">transparencies are all helpful aids for effective teaching.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Pictures</span></h2>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The skillful use of pictures results in successful instruction. Some of the great works of art depict Bible scenes. Copies of these masterpieces can be used in class sessions. Often a series of pictures can be arranged to present a running narrative of the life of Christ or other Bible characters. Pictures may be purchased from publishers of curriculum materials or collected from magazines, posters, calendars, and other sources.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students may need help in interpreting a picture&#39;s message and its relationship to the lesson emphasis. Too much attention to details of a picture will cause the students to remember the picture more than the lesson. Often pictures are left up for several weeks after the lesson has been taught. In this way they silently help the students review previous lessons.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Bulletin Boards</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Often known as the classroom &quot;silent teacher,&quot; bulletin boards use good visual form, attractive colors, and effective pictures to communicate information. A bulletin board can emphasize, remind, review, introduce, or announce a variety of subjects. Bulletin boards should be kept current and fresh for maximum impact on the viewers. To add to their learning value, students can be involved in creating and constructing them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Chalkboard and Flip Chart</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Every classroom should have a chalkboard. If commerciallyprepared boards are beyond the budget, inexpensive boards may be made by applying a special chalkboard paint to a piece of hardboard.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Flip charts and chalkboards may be used by teachers to draw diagrams, outlines, and sketches step by step. Even the teacher&#39;s action while using the chalkboard helps sustain attention.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is not necessary to be a professional artist to make good use of a chalkboard or flip chart. A short line, a few stick figures, a circle, or a square can represent people, cities, or events. New and difficult words, names of characters, important dates, an outline or summary can be written for class members to see. Five things to remember when using a chalkboard or flip chart are:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Avoid too much detail.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Don&#39;t block the view.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Write legibly, but quickly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Stand at the side of your work as much as possible.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Talk while writing, but do not talk to the board.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers will also at times have the students use the flip chart or chalkboard. Student participation will help them remember the lesson longer.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Flannelgraph</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Flannelgraph is a very versatile instructional aid. It therefore is one of the most widely used aids in church educational programs. While it is most frequently used in young children&#39;s classes, it can also be effective with youth and adults.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This medium secures attention at the very outset and, as new factors appear, interest is sustained. At the end of the lesson, the class may repeat the story, placing the figures on the board. This activiity combines the faculties of hearing, seeing, and doing.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Frank G. Coleman, in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Romance of Winning Children, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">points out three basics which must be mastered if the flannelgraph is to be used successfully-dexterity, suspense, and movement.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">First, to have </span><span class="csC382D2BB">dexterity, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">you need to practice the story in advance so that it flows swiftly and smoothly. The figures should be arranged in advance in the order in which they will be used. If backgrounds are to be changed during the story, these should be laid out or arranged so that the change can be made without interrupting the story. Talk as you work, but be sure to maintain eye contact with your students. produced by persons </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">diverse backgrounds, you should carefully preview them before showing them to your class. Imaginative teachers who have access to an 8mm home movie camera and projector have found creative ways to produce and use these in their teaching as well.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Filmstrips and Slides</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Similarly, filmstrips </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the 35mm projector are available in great numbers </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">sale or rental. Since these are less expensive than films, many churches purchase and maintain a filmstrip library.</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many 35mm projectors can use either filmstrips or slides. Slide programs are available commercially, but they can also b[prepared by teachers who have access to 35mm equipment. With a little practice you can photograph landscapes, buildings, other color photographs, classroom scenes, or individual students. By preparing an audio tape to accompany them, effective audiovisual programs can be produced.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Transparencies </span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">U sing a heat-sensitive photocopier, professional transparencies may be made </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">prepared masters. Commercially-prepared transparencies are available as well. Some teachers also use blank sheets of acetate and .special transparency pens to trace outlines or write comments as they teach.</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Phono-viewer programs</span></p><p class="csF3585C43"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The phono-viewer, which looks like a small television set, uses a record and a short filmstrip to present its message. Since this was originally designed as a toy, it is simple to operate and even younger children can use it. The phono-viewer is especially effective with a small class seated around a table. Many commerciallyprepared programs are available on Bible subjects.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Videocassettes</span></p><p class="cs7DB55037"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The video recorder-player, while still rather expensive, is becoming more readily available and is used in many churches. Videocassettes on biblical and Christian subjects are being produced in increasing numbers. As equipment prices decrease and availability of programs increase this medium will be more widely used in churches.</span></p><p class="cs7DB55037"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">EXPRESSIONAL AIDS</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 309.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	A distinction is often made between aids that are primarily</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:right 309.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	impressional and those that are expressional. Impressional aids include all things teachers do to make an impression on students in order to stimulate them to mental activity.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Expression, however, involves students in various activities that allow them to express some aspect of the lesson they are learningto encourage them to think through the lesson until they can express it in their own words and behavior. Expressional activities allow teachers to evaluate what students have really learned.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 21.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	To be effective, you must provide expressional activities that involve careful thinking, reasoning, analyzing, evaluating, and sum. marizing. This active involvement of the mind and will urges stu&#39;dents to become &quot;doers of the word&quot; (James 1:22).</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Expressional activities are part of good teaching. They are effective because they supplement the personality and skill of the instructor, and assist students in learning.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Impressional aids help to reach and stimulate-the student&#39;s mind but they do not necessarily secure a response. Expressional activities are effective because they deepen impression, capitalize on energy, and reach the personality in such a way as to bring lasting change in the students&#39; lives.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Children will often forget what they hear and they may forget what they have seen, but they will not soon forget what they have done. Learning is a process of .listening, looking, and doing. As students express themselves they reimpress their own minds and learn the truth through a different sense channel-not only through sight and sound, but also through activity. Learning begins and continues in what the learner does. Students taking piano lessons receive certain impressions when the teacher demonstrates a musical selection, but they don&#39;t begin to learn until they practice it for themselves.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Effective expressional activities will have a positive effect on the shaping of the lesson and the lives of the students. The objective of Christian teaching is the development of Christian character and living. This requires the appropriation and application of knowledge which is encouraged by the use of expressional activities.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Two very important expressional aids are student activity books and handwork projects.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">STUDENT ACTIVITY BOOKS</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Student activity books are important expressional aids and are included in most commercially-prepared curricula. They represent and set the pace for the students&#39; response to instruction. These materials are only a means to an end, however, and not ends in themselves. The activities contained in these books are not just busywork to keep students occupied, but are designed to help students learn by involvement and response.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">HANDCRAFT</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is estimated that students remember 1&#39;0 percent of what they hear, 50 percent of what they see, 70 percent of what they say, and 90 percent of what they do. For this reason, you should look upon handcrafts as an important part of your teaching, not just something to hold students&#39; interests or keep them quiet. Choose handcrafts carefully so that they reinforce the lesson aims.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Handcrafts may be used during presession periods to help prepare students for the lesson. Since younger children may need special supervision, it is wise to have extra helpers during the craft period.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A great variety of craft materials and projects are being produced by commercial companies. However, you can also prepare excellent crafts from inexpensive materials or- from scraps of paper, plastic, glass, cloth, and metal. The church library or your own personal library should contain several craft books which present hundreds of creative ideas for crafts.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Use projects that are related to one lesson, or to a lesson series. Your class will learn more by constructlng a model of the tabernacle than by just observing it or reading the description in Exodus. Making a relief map of Palestine will teach more about the locations of cities, mountains, and valleys than by pointing them out on a map or reading about them, or even by special instruction in Bible geography.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students may also be involved in making crafts that are to be given to others or used by others. Such projects have the added value of arousing within the student a serious c_ncern for others.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

The teacher may have presented much valuable information. Yet the lesson was not as effective as it should have been because the teacher did not present the lesson in an organized manner.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some teachers may argue that they are just not organized persons, and thus they cannot present the lesson in an organized way. But by following a few simple guidelines for lesson organization, any teacher can present a lesson with greater impact. It will take some time and practice, but it is well worth the effort.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Good planning will allow you to make better use of your -skills and natural talents.

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">CHRONOLOGICAL</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Large portions of the Bible can best be grasped and retained when presented in their historical relationship. God&#39;s revelation to man was chronological. In each age He revealed more of His divine purpose to chosen writers who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit (II Peter 1:21). The chronological pattern is especially appropriate when dealing with narratives. Chronological organization is related to the preparation of each lesson and to the entire curriculum of Bible study.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">PSYCHOLOGICAL</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This method consists of planning the subject matter to fit the comprehension and experience of the students. There is little purpose in teaching truth, however significant and profound, which is beyond the comprehension of the students. Material must be adapted to the understanding or it is either never received or soon forgotten. </span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB" style="tab-stops:left 399.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Both secular and Christian educators stress the psychological organization of materials. This method, however, must not take precedence over Bible content. There must be a balanced emphasis on both the application and the acquisition of God&#39;s Word. As you teach the facts of the Bible, constantly be aware of the students&#39; needs and their level of understanding. Also realize that at times a student will be more emotionally receptive to the truth than at other times.	_.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The young child requires materials and methods that differ from those required by the high school student. The junior has different needs than the adult.

You must identify and concentrate, therefore, on the central truth of the Scripture passage.

These include the students&#39; age and the lesson content. Vary your methods for more effective presentation.</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Keep in mind that more content is needed for a lecture than for a discussion. On the other hand, more time is r_quired if methods involve student participation-discussion, buzz groups, or reports.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The character of the lesson will also determine its treatment. Some lessons may require the extensive use of visuals. Other lessons involving controversial material may be best handled by the use of discussions, debates or buzz groups. In others, drama, roleplaying, or a field trip may be most effective.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After deciding the aims and methods, study all the available materials. Not all lesson materials can be used. Select those which will help in the realization of lesson aims.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Reports; assignments, questions, Bible memory work, pictures, and other collateral material require lesson time.

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">RELATE TO LIFE</span></h2>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Little is gained from teaching that is not related to life. A wellorganized lesson often incorporates questions, illustrations, and planned application which direct. the students&#39; thoughts to the meaning of the lesson in their personal lives.</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Questions</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If the lesson is to be developed by the use of questions, the facts and truths should be brought into prominence so that the students will recognize the train of thought, and feel that they are making progress as the lesson proceeds.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You can inspire good participation by thoughtful questions. Preparing these in advance makes it easier to formulate specific, thought-provoking questions that are pertinent to the lessoil. The best questions, however, often result from the response of the students and therefore cannot be completely anticipated in advance.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Illustrations</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB" style="tab-stops:left 17.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Appropriate illustrations must be selected beforehand and included in the outline. Sometimes you might introduce the lesson with an illustration. This approach gains attention and sets the stage for the presentation. The opening illustration may be woven into the entire teaching period and then repeated or referred to at the conclusion for response. It is a rewarding experience to antici,., pate points that will need clarification and then to illustrate them 	from everyday experience such as nature, history, stories, or songs.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB" style="tab-stops:left 17.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Application</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a saying that the lesson really begins with the application. This underscores the importance of application, an importance that, unfortunately, is not understood by many teachers.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This important phase of preparation, however, is not difficult for teachers who have -assembled and organized their material to meet the students&#39; needs. Ask yourself this pertinent question: &quot;How can I get my class to express in daily living the truths that I am preparing to teach?&quot; The Holy Spirit will enable you to follow the right procedure as you pray and plan for the personal application.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">INVOLVE STUDENTS</span></h1>
		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 15.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Involving students requires careful thought. Teaching is more than simply lecturing. The best teachers guide their students to become indepe.ndent investigators of truth. Definite assignments for each learner should be planned in advance. The desire for student cooperation will motivate you to plan and involve students through research projects and class reports.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Research Projects</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Research assignments may be made for the individual or group. They may be done as lesson preparation or by the group during the class session. In either case, assignments should be definite and designed to help achieve the lesson aims.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is not enough to urge students to study the lesson and complete projects. Even those who want to do this may be overwhelmed and discouraged by the size of .the task. You must communicate clearly, helping students know how and what to study.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Suggest definite sources of help. Without proper guidance, students will not know what books to consult. With younger students, it is advisable to give them the material and offer to help them in research.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Assignments should be personal and ihdi\ridual. One student may be given a question to answer; another, a topic for study and report; a third, a map to draw; a fourth, some Bible references to compare. The interest, capacity, and ability of each class member should be considered in selecting the nature of the assignment. Whenever possible, eve_y member of the class should participate.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Class Reports</span></h2>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students are frustrated if they do out-of-class assignments and then are not given opportunity to report their findings in class. Plan for the presentation of all assignments, using various means to make these effective. This requires making assignments sufficiently in advance.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Formulate questions which take into account the interests of the students and encourage them to express themselves freely. -Creativity should be encouraged at every opportunity.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If the class has a good background of Bible knowledge or is</span></p><p class="csA5964A5E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">making an intensive or extensive study of the lesson, individual student_ may use their assigned topics to introduce general discussion.

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">Student &nbsp;Teaching</span></h2>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In classes for older youth and adults, it is sometimes, profitable to have one of the students teach the lesson. This experience for the student teacher should be carefully supervised, so that each class member will have a genuine learning experience. Brief the student teacher before the class session. During a post-session evaluation encourage the student teacher to puruse training courses to prepare for future teaching.</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">

Teachers who have given adequate time, prayer, and thought to planning their lesson are now ready to work their plan. The campaign for attention and interest begins before the first student arrives. Be in the classroom early (at least 15 minutes before the class is scheduled to begin) so that you will be able to greet the class members as they arrive. Being habitually late is by your actions suggesting that the class or the students aren&#39;t very important. These minutes before the class begins are not wasted time. Use this time very profitably to check the classroom temperature, displays, seating arrangement, and teaching materials.</span></p><p class="csB19FDE58"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students often arrive well before the class time. Rather than &nbsp;allow them to remain idle, provide various activities to keep them involved. For younger children, learning centers, extra workbooks, or crayons and coloring books that deal with the day&#39;s lesson will be useful. Assisting in arranging the room or running errands will keep others busy. Provocative questions, pictures, projected visuals, or records and tapes will engage the interest of others.</span></p><p class="csC7725E85"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students are motiviated in various ways to come to class. Some come because they are brought by pare&#39;nts. Others come out of habit. Many come because they enjoy the fellowship of friends. Probably very few come because they have a sincere desire to study the Word of God.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How do you deal with these attitudes that may r-ange from indifference to outright antagonism? First, establish a point of contact. Convince the students that you have something to offer that interests them and meets some of their needs. Next, arouse interest in learning. Finally, focus their attention on the lesson. No introduction, regardless of how interesting it may be, is a success if it does not open the door to the lesson.

In some situations the teacher will even involve the students in desigping the lesson aims. Others insist that an application is more effective if the aim is not told in advance.

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To get your students thinking, the question and answer method may be very effective. A series of thought-provoking inquiries will likely accomplish this purpose. Whenever information is imparted, the class should be expected to think it through with you. Good teaching requires that the students be tested regularly to keep them alert and to see if they are profiting from the lesson.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One method of guiding thought is the pattern of deductive thinking. The teacher begins with a principle or general statement. This is followed by a number of illustrations. Then students are involved in seeking further examples from their own lives. The deductive method is like a cone.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Point</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Examples</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Student&#39;s Experience</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 0.7pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Encourage Expression</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 14.85pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	When students have the opportunity to express lesson principles in their own words, they are more likely to remember them. One way to accomplish this is through the use of the inductive method of teaching. To use this approach, begin with a situation or problem or perhaps a series of problems, then enlist the help of the students in gathering pertinent facts or illustrations. This information is then evaluated in the light of the Scriptures, and the class arrives at laws, or general principles, shown by the point on the cone. The inverted cone illustrates the inductive approach.

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">USE ILLUSTRATIONS</span></h3>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some teachers have a flair for using dramatic illustrations.

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The closing minutes of the lesson period provide a good time to prepare students for the truths that will follow in successive lessons.

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers want their classes to come back enthusiastically. By some startling statement or striking question, curiosity and interest can be aroused. Authors usually conclude a chapter so that the reader can hardly wait for the next chapter of a serial story. In the same manner, finish the day&#39;s portion of &quot;the most interesting story in the world,&quot; with such a climactic ending that the entire class will look forward to the next session.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Assignments must be carefully planned ahead of time, but the animated way in which they are assigned will determine the interest and enthusiasm of class members. These assignments should not be limited to academic activities such as reading the student text or quarterly or completing the workbook. They should include activities that involve applying the lesson to life situations.

Why? Perhaps teachers do not know how to express orderliness and Christian discipline. Perhaps they do not exercise authority.

So is disorder. One unruly student affects another; each distraction leads to another. Leaders or teachers with poorly prepared programs invite trouble. An orderly atmosphere will command attention and respect. If chairs are properly arranged with materials in their places, the students will likely leave them that way. Books or papers on the floor extend an invitation for more to follow. An orderly atmosphere is conducive to orderly students. Teachers and leaders should set a good example.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To stimulate good behavior, check the classroom equipment anc procedures.

Recognize this fact and give special attention to your own physical, men	tal, and spiritual life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 23.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF-CONTROL</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 10.55pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Most teachers hope that God will transform their class members into quiet, attentive students, but few teachers pray for their own self-control. Spirit-controlled teachers are victorious. Even the most extenuating circumstances should not cause you to lose control of yourself. Teachers who do not control themselves are not likely to control others. Many things may try your patience, and you need to be on guard lest you become irritated and impatient.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students quickly discover if you are in a state of confusion and they will disregard your leadership. To be effective, experience the &quot;fruit of the Spirit&quot; and demonstrate the grace that makes pleasant and cordial relationships between you and your students possible. The calm, quiet, forceful mastery of Christ impressed his listeners and made them listen to his words. In every controversy he was master of the situation.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF-IMAGE</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students quickly perceive the teacher&#39;s self-image. You need to undertake some honest self-exploration. Discipline problems may be related to your own emotional stresses such as fatigue, a quarrel at home, or job insecurity.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sometimes lack of confidence comes from inexperience. Students will occasionally take advantage of inexperienced teachers. This in turn causes teachers to become discouraged and feel that they are not cut out to be teachers. Beginning teachers can take some consolation in the fact that probably every teacher has gone through this experience at some time. If you become frustrated or feel inadequate because of any of these factors, do not hesitate to counsel with your superintendent or fellow teachers. They will be sympathetic and can offer many helpful s:uggestions.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">PREPARATION</span></h1>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers must be masters of their subjects if they are to influence their students. The lesson itself should keep order. Poorlyprepared teachers will have trouble. Orderliness in instruction leads to orderliness in conduct. Disorder leads to inattention and a lack of interest.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">ORDERLINESS OF THE STUDENT</span></h2>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You should not feel totally responsible or guilty because you are not always able to maintain perfect order in the classroom. Disorders may be caused by external conditibns or by students&#39; personal problems that have nothing to do with you or the quality of your teaching. Some disorderly students may be thoughtless, restless, or unknowingly self-centered.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">THOUGHTLESSNESS</span></h3>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learn how to distinguish between students who are merely</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">thoughtless and those with problems that are more deeply rooted. For example, some students act irrevently because they have never</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">been taught how to be reverent. This is sometimes a greater problem when students come from unchurched backgrounds. But even students who have been taught reverence for sacred things, find it difficult at times to carry aut their best intentions.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 18.95pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Many churches provide systematic training in the early years of a child&#39;s life. They believe that reverence </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">sacred things can become a part of life. If &nbsp;proper conduct patterns are formed early, students will be more likely to follow them later on.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">RESTLESSNESS</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Nervous tensions, frustrations, and hyperactivity are on the increase. It is not uncommon for you to have students in your class with serious emotional disorders. Some of these problems may be physical in origin; others may arise from unstable home conditions. Unless you are a trained psychologist you cannot be expected to deal with serious emotional problems. Yet you must try to help these students.</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you teach children, recognize that they will be active. God made them so that they want to shout, run, and jump, not sit quietly for long periods of time a(nd listen. Since they delight in activity, they will supply their own if you do not keep them involved. These alert, energetic students need a full program of activities that will allow them opportunities to participate in the lesson. Since variety will help hold their attention, plan several different types of activities, changing from one to another when stu, dent interest begins to wane.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF -CENTEREDNESS</span></h4>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">From the minute they are born, individuals are self-centered. Only through teaching and experience do they learn to be generous and to share. When they come to class, many young children have had only limited experience playing and sharing with brothers and sisters or other children. As a result, they need extra love and attention to help them work with the group.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some people feel rejected and unwanted. In an attempt to gain attention, they sometimes are disruptive. Openly reprimanding the students can sometimes make the situation worse, because, in a. negative way, a scolding gives them the attention they want. &nbsp;Instead, try to give such students tasks or assignments that will meet their emotional needs and at the same time make a positive contribution to the class.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learn to use disruptive behavior in creative ways. Here is what one preschool teacher did when an energetic student blew a whistle in class. The teacher said, &quot;Johnny has a whistle. A whistle is a good thing. What is a whistle good for?&quot; Several replied. Then the application was skillfully made. The warnings and admonitions of the Bible were referred to as God&#39;s manner of attracting attention.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible says, &quot;Blow the trumpet in Zion&quot;-a whistle blown for God&#39;s people. The theme was developed helpfully. In the course of the diversion the teacher asked for the whistle, took it in her hand, commented on its construction, and assured Johnny she would return it after class.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF DISCIPLINE</span></h6>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Quiet, controlled students and undisturbed classes are not necessarily the ideal toward &nbsp;which discipline should lead., Discipline looks beyond immediate emergency situations. There will always be those occasions where your immediate action will be necessary. However, external control is only temporarily effective. Young students need help in the maturation process to develop satisfactory images of themselves so they will grow in inner control as well.</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">LAY A FOUNDATION FOR DISCIPLINE</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Discipline begins with the general atmosphere which you establish. Loving the students, exhibiting a spirit of warmth, meeting their needs in teaching, and developing personal strength through faith in God will set the stage for increasing discipline.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Early in the classroom experience students should become&#39;laware of the type of behavior which is expected. Guiding class members to see and accept the right behavior is the secret of good discipline.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h6 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">DEAL WITH THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM</span></h6>
		<p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 13.9pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	There is a tendency to label some students as mischievous, rebelious, or malicious, when they do not measure up to standards of behavior. It is important to remember that students are by nature active and lacking in self-control. Many things they do may be normal behavior at their age.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Often students&#39; behavior is a signal that there are deeper, underlying problems. When students bully others, show off, or are destructive, they may be saying, &quot;Help me with my problems.&quot; Serious mistakes can be made when you fail to uncover the real problem.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h6 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">ESTABLISH POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS</span></h6>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many discipline problems can be resolved through a deep concern for the welfare of students and a relationship of love and acceptance.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Authority or superior physical strength may curb unwanted actions but only temporarily. Another method is to repeatedly lecture disruptive students about what they should or should not do. But these lectures often fall on deaf ears. The long-term result of negative action may be more rebellion. Positive relationships are needed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A better way is to exhibit genuine respect for students as indi... viduals in their own right and evidence a deep desire to help them.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">CLARIFY RULES OF BEHAVIOR</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students can participate in establishing acceptable patterns of behavior in the classroom. Often they will be more stringent in their demands than you might be. Students also can be called upon to assist in enforcing behavior.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You are responsible to help all class members know what is expected. Students should know when they may talk or walk around, that destruction of property is not allowed, and that all persons have equal rights and opportunities. Unfamiliar and vague rules contribute little to good discipline. It is also important to enforce the rules fairly, without playing favorites.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h6 class="cs95E872D0">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">WORK IN COOPERATION WITH THE HOME</span></h6>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers and parents share responsibility in helping children &quot; become disciplined individuals. Usually, a discussion with parents concerning unruly children will be helpful, both for parents and.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">teachers. Sometimes causes of problems can be discovered by visiting children in their homes. Discussions with parents should be private so that children do not feel the adults are joining forces against them. </span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">BE ADEQUATELY STAFFED</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sometimes discipline problems arise because teachers have too many students in a classroom that is too small. In these situations, good discipline requires that classes be adequately staffed. As a general rule, the younger the children, the smaller the ratio should be between students and staff members. Try to be assigned sufficient space and staff for your class to function in a work environment.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">PRAY FAITHFULLY FOR EACH MEMBER</span></h1>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Plan, work, teach, and pray that the grace of God will tr&#39;!nsform each student in your class. The problems, disciplines, and sacrifices will all be forgotten in the joy of watching students accept Christ and grow in grace.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">SUMMARY</span></h2>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The concern for disciR.line is basic to all Christian education. Your aim is to help every person mature toward Christlikeness. This inc_udes the development of self-discipline and inner-directed behavior in keeping with Christian goals and values.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Various sources of discipline problems can be eliminated by giving attention to equipment, surroundings, and distractions. But essentially, good discipline begins with you. Your self-control, instruction, and self-image will be perceived by the students who will respond in keeping within established patterns.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers need to understand that discipline is more than enforced good behavior. It is the effort to help students develop inner control. A knowledge of the student both personally and generally, will help to identify the source of problems. You should recognize normal behavior and also behavior which stems from deep, underlying problems.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Warm, accepting relationships with the class members will go far toward solving behavior problems. In addition, recognize that you are not working alone, but rather with parents who share your concern for the growth of the children and with the Lord who is interested in the best for all students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h5 class="cs95E872D0">

The real test of teaching is not what students learn, but what they become. Education includes. both the acquisition of knowledge and its use.

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">IMPORTANCE OF APPLICATION</span></h1>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You are responsible to help shape the lives of your students. To do this, you teach the Wgrd of God. However, the task is not completed when you have imparted Bible knowledge. You must help your students develop godly character and maturity as well.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CHARACTER BUILDING</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sincere teachers look for response in students&#39; lives. When godliness is manifested, they know that the Word of God has been effective and that the lessons have been learned.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is impossible to _parate Christian character from Christian living. Christian character is developed by living and expressed through living. The outward Christian life is the result of the Christ-formed character within. When Christ is acknowledged as Lord, the learner will be mastered by God&#39;s truth and will establish habits of study, prayer, reverence, worship, obedience, and unselfishness. An urgent desire to cultivate these habits should motivate Christian teachers.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CHRISTIAN GROWTH</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christian character grows by expression-not through dreaming or wishing or talking. The habit of doing nothing is as devastating as the habit of doing wrong. If instruction and inspiration are not expressed in action, they will destroy spiritual sensitivity and make response to the Holy Spirit&#39;s leading extremely difficult. Incorporating expressional activities in the teaching program will encourage positive, active Christian character.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christ&#39;s teaching methods included a strong emphasis on application. In the Sermon on the Mount he said, &quot;Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.&quot; (Matt. 7:24). &quot;Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&quot; (Matt. 7:21). &quot;By their fruits ye shall know them.&quot; (Matt. 7:20). He taught his disciples that the inner spiritual condition is manifested by outward deeds and actions. They did not learn this truth in a formal schoolroom, they learned it by sharing his life and work. They lived as he lived. They learned right attitudes toward God and their fellow men. They sensed his motives and the urgency of his ministry. Then he sent them out to complete their training by practical experience in everyday life.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People develop Christian behavior patterns in the same way. They learn to pray, not by defining or describing prayer, but by entering actively into prayer. They learn how to study God&#39;s Word by actual use of the Bible. They become reverent, obedient, and unselfish by practicing these virtues.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">
			<span class="cs91EF8B52">SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Word of God provides the foundation for Christian life and living. It is useless to attempt to build Christian character independent of instruction in it. The Bible is changeless in every changing age. It is &quot;profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness&quot; (n Tim. 3:16). The human &quot;heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked&quot; (Jer. 17:9). Students cannot build Christian faith on the foundation of everyday human experiences. The Bible is the chart and compass.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5" style="tab-stops:left 14.85pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible deals with life by recognizing sin and supplying God&#39;s remedy. It touches every inner and outer area-sports, social activities, home, school, church. The Bible meets life&#39;s greatest needs. . Bible-centered lessons aimed at life-centered needs provide the 	most effective curricula.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Our Lord laid great stress on application based on the Word of God. When Christ went into the synagpgue at Nazareth, he read and expounded the first two verses of Isaiah 61 (Luke 4: 16-21). His exposition provided an up-to-date application. He said that the words of this ancient prophet were fulfilled that very day. Years later, after his resurrection, when he met the disappointed disciples on the road tQ Emmaus, he drew from them the reason for their perplexity. He met their real life situation and comforted the sorrowful disciples by &quot;expounding unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself&quot; (Luke 24:27). This was his method of Bible teaching. It was applied instruction. It was aimed at human need.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">ACTIONS</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers cannot successfully relate truth until they have applied it to their own lives. Students must constantly see exemplified in you the biblical truth you wish them to apply to their lives. This is a categorical imperative in Christian teaching. If students are to learn of Christ, be sure you know him and live as he would have them live.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Lord Jesus accompanied his teaching by a constant demonstration of the truth. He-exemplified meekness by girding himself and washing the disciples&#39; feet (John 13:4-17).

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Truth is shared through relationships as well as transmitted by words. A recent study demonstrates that the attitude of junior high students toward God is not dependent on the amount of their Bible knowledge. Their attitudes are dependent on those expressed by their parents. Teachers also ttfansmit attitudes through frequent relationships with students. Often teachers will be more influential in the lives of their students by the attitudes they evidence than by what they say.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many young people have testified that while they forgot the verbal instruction received in their youth, they could never forget the exemplary lives of godly teachers. Your daily life must demonstrate your instruction in order to impress the hearts and minds of your students. Truths that have not helped you will not help your class.

			<span class="cs91EF8B52">RELATE TO LIFE</span></h2>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Until early adolescence, students have a limited power of generalization. They do not readily see the underlying principles of biblical teachings which apply to many different situations. For example, students may learn and be able to respond accurately to testing about the principle that a Christian should not steal. Yet when a store clerk returns too much change they may not understand keeping the extra change is a form of stealing. Use examples like this to help students apply what they learn to their own life situations. For this reason you must be familiar with students&#39; problems in order to construct situations that are realistic to them.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You cannot force change upon those you teach. Students must be confronted with the Word and see its relationship to their own need, before they are ready to make a personal response.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learning will be more effective when students participate in making the application. Sometimes the entire class can agree to select a certain behavior pattern, an attitude, or an activity which reflects the emphasis of the lesson. They may agree to follow this behavior pattern or set of values during the coming week. This can be followed by an evaluation of results in the review of the lesson the following week.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="cs7939122D">

As the reality of Christ increases by faith, the fruits of the Spirit will also become more evident (Gal. 5:22, 23).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Church educational programs should provide training in worship. Individuals or classes can plan and lead worship.

They should be taught to support the entire program of the church and to contribute their own money. The actual sharing of possessions provides the best learning. Even if their parents provide the offerings, students should be taught true stewardship. To the degree the spirit of sacrificial sharing permeates the entire church, students will learn and practice stewardship of time, talents, and possessIons.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Each generation needs training to be liberal, systematic, cheerful givers.

Children as well as adults should realize their responsibility for happiness at home. They should be encouraged to participate in the care of the home, and warned against shirking their duties. The entire family should share in the hospitality which the home extends to friends and neighbors, and take pride in demonstrating its attractiveness.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All students also should be impressed with their responsibility to</span></p><p class="cs4EC675BA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">the church, especially if they are members.

Yet, if teaching is taken seriously, and is earnest, thoughtful, and skillful, various methods of testing&#39; can be used effectively.

Teachers also desire to measure spiritual growth and behavior. This is more difficult because life consists largely of habits of thinking, feeling, or acting that have become deeply rooted through repetition. Younger students need assistance in the formation of right habits. Church teachers and parents should cooperate in this important minIstry. Jesus emphasized this phase of Christian instruction when he said, &quot;Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which bullt his house upon a rock&quot; (Matt. 7:24). Among several ways to measure behavior are the use of records and selfrating scales.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">RECORDS</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Successful Christian education programs are not satisfied with mere records of attendance. Several excellent systems have been developed to record additional information, including the interest and response of students. These systems tabulate such items as lesson preparation, church attendance, family background, punctuality, use of Bible, prayer life, witnessing, enlisting new students, and offering.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF-RATING SCALES</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An important objective of Christian education is to lead students to become mature, serving Christians. Progress toward this goal does not come instantaneously, nor does it come steadily. Growth takes time and it often comes in spurts. Further, growth in every aspect of one&#39;s character does not progress at the same rate. For example, the students&#39; growth in stewardship may develop more rapidly than in the areas of witnessing. Or their devotional life may be growing richer while their relations with their families and friends show little improvement.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To help measure spiritual growth, self-rating scales are useful tools. Two types of scales can be used. One provides self-evaluation in terms of the frequency of an action: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Always Usually Sometimes Seldom Never</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 6.45pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Providing help for a person in trouble &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 6.45pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another permits evaluation in terms of a scale and students are asked to evaluate their behavior on a scale of I to 10, where 10 is the highest score.	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 6.45pt;"><span class="cs31B015EA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Witness to friends</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;(</span><span class="cs31B015EA">circle the appropriate number) 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 &nbsp;&nbsp;9 &nbsp;&nbsp;10</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A class can identify a number of Christian behavior patterns based on the lesson.

Teachers need to be concerned about evaluating for growth in these areas, but it is not easy to measure such progress. SiTlce the Holy Spirit is involved in regeneration and spiritual growth, objective measurements are not always possible. No one can unde&#39;rstand the Spirit&#39;s mysterious operations or know the time when conviction is brought to the heart. Teachers must be sensitive to the moods of their classes. They must know how to take advantage of the moment when the time for decision has come. The greatest joy you can experience is to be able to lead one of your students to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers and leaders repeatedly indicate that many church edu	cation students possess only minimal Bible knowledge. Although church educational programs have avoided the use of testing programs responsible teaching includes an &#39;evaluation of results. These results are not limited to Bible knowledge, but extend to attitudes and behavior.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A simple approach to determine student knowledge is the use of the oral participation method. Through the skillful employment of questions students are given the opportunity to share their knowledge, insights, convictions, and decisions. It also is possible for teachers to develop and utilize various forms of Bible tests. Truefalse, completion, multiple choice, and matching tests are most popular.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Behavioral tests are more difficult to construct. Weekly records give an indication of participation in church-related activities. Selfrating scales are useful in helping students take a careful look at their own lives in terms of principles that are based on the biblical passages they have studied.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">FOR REVIEW</span></p><p class="cs4EC675BA"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.
