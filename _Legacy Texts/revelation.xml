<div class='chapter' id='d1c2s1'>
<text class='h1'><eng>Introduction (1:1-3)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Subject of this Book (1:1)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It is a Revelation</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Greek title for this book found in verse 1 is &quot;Apokalupsis&quot; which is transliterated &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>When the book of Revelation is talked about and especially when it is called the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; it often gives quiet a chilling impression. Our minds often travel to &quot;The anti-Christ&quot; or &quot;The Mark of the Best&quot; and especially, &quot;The End of the World&quot;. These are often made out to be the banner themes of this book&#44; but nothing could be farther from the truth.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Apocalypse&quot; does not mean &quot;judgment day&quot;. &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. means:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>something revealed&#44; disclosed&#44; manifested&#44; or shown. As a verb it means to uncover and as noun it means an appearing.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>It is a Revelation of Jesus Christ</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Banner Theme of this book is Jesus Christ and His righteous conquest. From the first to the last verse, it is the Lamb, the King, the Bridegroom Who takes center stage.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This is not a revelation of John but of JESUS (Savior&#44; Christ&#44; King). This book reveals truth concerning Jesus:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>His Exaltation as the Son (Rev. 3:21; Acts 2:33)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 3:21--To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>His ministry in the Church (Rev. 1:13)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 1:13--And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>His position in the throne (Rev 4:2; Eph. 1:20,21)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 4:2--And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>His rapture of the Church (Rev. 4:1)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 4:1--After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>His coming in power and glory (Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:30) </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 1:7--Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>His raising the dead (Rev. 1:18; John 5:27-29)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 1:18--I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>His judgment of the nations (Rev. 14:7)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 14:7--Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>His reign and rule on the earth (Rev. 11:15)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 11:15--And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>His judgment on Satan (Rev. 20:1-2,10)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 1:1&#44;2&#44;10--1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>It is a Gift of God</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Verse 1 says this revelation of Jesus Christ &quot;which God GAVE unto Him&quot; was in turn given by Jesus to His angel who gave it to John. The writer is describing a clear stream of inspiration from the throne of heaven which contests any suggestion that the following writing is of human origin and imagination.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>It is a Prophecy</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;To show unto His servants things which must come to pass shortly.&quot; This is a key to this book. v. 3 &quot;The words of this prophecy&quot; Ch. 4:1 &quot;I will show thee things which must (come) be hereafter.&quot; Revelation is essentially a book of prophecy rather than history.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>It is Symbolic</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>1:1 says &quot;&hellip;he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John.&quot; &quot;Signified&quot; is the Greek word &quot;Semaino&quot; meaning to give a sign or to express or reveal by signs. God in his infinite wisdom has chosen to use the language of symbolism and imagery to communicate this Revelation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>How can we unlock the symbolism of this book? Mainly by comparing scripture with scripture (2 Peter 1:20) do we understand its symbolism. This Revelation is profoundly positioned as the last book of the Bible. It not only contains prophecy of last things, but it is in its nature a climax to all Biblical revelation. We in part find understanding of the symbolism in Revelation by understanding previously given symbolism.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Some examples include: 1) The Four Living Creatures Ezekiel 1:5; Revelation 4:6 2) The 7 Churches of Asia were both literal and symbolic. As the New Testament Epistles were relevant to a first century Church so they are still relevant today. 3) Water of Life John 4:14; Revelation 21:6</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This Revelation with all its symbolism was given to John by God&apos;s &quot;angel&quot;. John himself was puzzled as to the role of this &quot;angel&quot; and eventually falls at his feet in 22:8 to worship him. In verse 9, the angel rebuked him saying he was only a &quot;fellow servant&quot; and that John must only &quot;worship God&quot;. The Believer must keep in constant remembrance amidst all the majesty of God&apos;s Grace that all the glory belongs to God and we are just &quot;His messengers&quot;.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Scribe of this Book (1:2)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 1:1 &hellip;unto His servant John 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Apostle John (Some believe another John.)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>He bare record (1:2; John 1:1-14)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>He gave witness (I John 1:1-3; 20:31)</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Value of this Book (1:3)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It is rewarding</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Blessed&quot; - happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>&quot;He that readeth&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>&quot;They that hear the words&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>&quot;And keep those things which are written&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It is enlightening (22:10)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 22:10--Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</eng><swa/></text>

Therefore, meaning: a &quot;Seven-fold spirit&quot;. God is described here in the fullness of His office and powers.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>The Son</eng><swa/></text>

<div class='chapter' id='d1c2s3'>
<text class='h1'><eng>The Vision (1:10-20)</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Setting of the Vision</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Received in the Spirit</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>v. 10 &quot;I was in the Spirit on the Lord&apos;s day&quot;.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:1) and Paul (I Corinthians 12:2) both speak of a similar &quot;in the spirit&quot; experience. Ezekiel was carried away &quot;in the spirit&quot; to a valley of dry bones. Paul was not sure whether it was in the body or out of the body in which he was caught up to the third heaven. John the Revelator was in a mode and mind of worship when first his ears and then his eyes are opened to the spiritual realm.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>There is no suggestion that John is asleep. The book of Revelation is not the results of John&apos;s subconscious&#44; but his experience is presented as if a veil were taken away and he began to hear&#44; see and feel some very real things that were previously muted.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>This Vision was received in the Spirit and can only be understood in the Spirit.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='blockquote'><eng>1 Corinthians 2:14-- But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This does not mean the book of Revelation cannot be understood&#44; but that in order to fully understand it we must be in that same condition of communion with the Spirit of God as John.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Isaiah&#44; Jeremiah&#44; Jesus&#44; and John all gave a message expressly for those with &quot;ears to hear&quot;. We can say that the Bible in its entirety was written for those who would yield their hearts&#44; minds&#44; eyes and ears to the Spirit of God. Some are STUBBORN and cover their eyes and ears (Zechariah 7:11; 2 Timothy 4:4) and others are SENSITIVE and make supplication that their eyes and ears would be unstopped! (Isaiah 50:4; Revelation 3:18)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Isaiah 50:4-- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Given with a Command</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Commanded to Record It</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>v. 11 &quot;What thou seest, write in a book&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>This command is not unique to John. Moses (Exodus 17:14)&#44; Isaiah (Isaiah 30:8) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 30:2) all mention they were commanded to record what they heard and saw. Two reasons why this is so important to God is that He knows Humans forget and second&#44; the message was not solely for John.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Commanded to Share It</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>v. 11 &quot;And send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The current situation of the Christian church demanded counsel and hope. They were under oppression and persecution by the Romans led by Domitian. Domitian was the first Roman Emperor who demanded to addressed as &quot;master and god&quot;. Domitian was fairly tolerant of other religions than the state religion of Rome and religions like worship of Egyptian deities even flourished during his reign. Domitian was cruel however toward any religion that threatened especially the belief in his own godhood. According to 4th Century AD Eusebius Jews and Christians were heavily persecuted and even a special temple tax was leavied yearly. (The money was to be sent annually the the temple of Jupiter.)</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='blockquote'><eng> 2 Corinthians 4:3-- But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>As these seven churches of Asia are also symbolic of seven conditions present in every church age&#44; John is writing to us just as much as he was writing to the first century churches. The Revelation was not John&apos;s to KEEP&#44; but John&apos;s to SHARE.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Announced by a Voice</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>v. 10 &quot;Heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>It was clearly a VOICE that John heard but it was LIKE a TRUMPET--urgent&#44; clear&#44; strong&#44; awakening&#44; and startling.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>God revealed Himself to Moses, on Mt.Sinai &quot;voice of a trumpet exceeding loud.&quot; (Exodus 19:16)</eng><swa/>
<eng>The Temple opened its doors in the morning at the sound of the trumpet.</eng><swa/>
<eng>The Year of Jubilee came with the sound of the trumpet. Lev. 25:9&#44;10</eng><swa/>
<eng>The Silence of the Age will be broken by the sound of a trumpet.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>I Thessalonians 4:16--The trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Scenes of the Vision</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The First Scene: SEVEN CANDLESTICKS</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>v. 12 &quot;I saw seven golden candlesticks&quot;. v. 20 &quot;And the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>The lamp stands - &quot;Candlesticks&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='blockquote'><eng>Joh 8:12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <b>I am the light of the world</b>: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</eng><swa/></text>
 <text class='blockquote'><eng>Mt 5:14 <b>Ye are the light of the world</b>. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</eng><swa/></text>

 <text class='p'><eng>The candlesticks give light&#44; illumination&#44; and revelation which guide us&#44; warn us and make us aware. The Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a light!</eng><swa/></text>
 
 <text class='blockquote'><eng>Matthew 4:16-- The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and <b>to them which sat in the region and shadow of death</b> light is sprung up.</eng><swa/></text>
 <text class='blockquote'><eng>Luke 1:79-- To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to <b>guide our feet</b> into the way of peace.</eng><swa/></text>
 <text class='blockquote'><eng>John 11:9-- Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, <b>he stumbleth not</b>, because he seeth the light of this world.</eng><swa/></text>
 <text class='blockquote'><eng>2 Corinthians 4:6-- For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the <b>light of the knowledge</b> of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. </eng><swa/></text>
 
<text class='h4'><eng>&quot;Golden&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>GREAT COST. The candlesticks were composed of the costliest metal.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>GREAT BEAUTY. The tabernacle use filled with the use of gold. Gold is expressive of Godliness.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Psalm 96:9-- O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>&quot;Seven&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There was a candlestick with seven lamps in the tabernacle.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Exodus 25:37-- And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Seven is the number of completeness. (Lev. 4:6; Psalm 119:164; Prov. 24:16; Daniel 3:19; Luke 17:4) These seven candlesticks represent the WHOLE Church Age. </eng><swa/></text>


<text class='h3' ><eng>The Second Scene: SON OF MAN</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>CHRIST as The Great High Priest - Priest. </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Hebrews 7:26; 8:1; v. 13 &quot;In the midst&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>CHRIST as The True Prophet - Prophet</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Acts 7:32; Rev. 1:14 &quot;His head and hair white like wool, as white as snow:and His eyes were as a flame of fire&hellip;&quot; &quot;His voice as the sound of many waters.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>CHRIST as The Only Potentate - King - Lord</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>I Timothy 6:15; Revelation 19:16; Rev. 1:15 &quot;His feet like unto fine brass&quot;. This represents Majesty and Judgment. John 5:22. Rev. 1:16 &quot;And out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword.&quot; John 12:47-48</eng><swa/></text>


<text class='h3' ><eng>The THIRD Scene: SEVEN STARS</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Seven Stars are The Lord&apos;s Ministers</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>v. 16 &quot;And He had in His right hand seven stars.&quot; v. 20 &quot;The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand,&hellip;are the angels of the seven churches.&quot; </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>God has His ministers in His hand. He holds, controls, owns and will reward them</eng><swa/></text>

<image id='sevenChurches' alt='Names of the Seven Churches of Asia' src='images/sevenChurches.gif' />
<text class='h2'><eng>Addressed To the Ministers</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 2:1--Unto the angel of the church&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Angel means messenger&#44; Rev. 22:8-9</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 22:8--And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It is A Revelation of Ministerial Responsibility</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>To hear from God&#44; Eze. 3:17</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>To receive from God&#44; Gal. 1:11-12</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>To speak for God&#44; Isa. 58:1</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>To answer to God&#44; II Cor. 5:10</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It Is A Revelation of Ministerial Distinction</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>They are a part of the Church&#44; I Cor. 12:28</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>I Cor. 12:28--And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Yet a separate part of the Church&#44; Phil. 2:25&#44;29; I Thess. 5:12&#44;13</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Philippians 2:25&#44;29--Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and <b>hold such in reputation:</b> [dear; more honorable]</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>I Thessalonians 5:12-13-- And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>It Is A Revelation of Ministerial Protection</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 2:1--&hellip;He that holdeth the seven stars&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Keeps for Himself&#44; John 10:27-28</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Keeps from the Enemy&#44; II Tim. 4:16-18</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>2 Timothy 4:16-18--At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. 17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>It Is A Revelation of Ministerial Authority</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>Messenger - &quot;Martin of Tours&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Martin of Tours (France). &quot;Unto the angel of the Church&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>His conversion took place after helping a poor beggar&#44; took his own coat and cut it in two with his sword&#44; wrapped the man in it and went his way. That night the Lord appeared unto him&#44; in a vision&#44; wrapped in the half of Martin&apos;s garment. He spoke to him&#44; &quot;Martin&#44; though he is only a common soldier&#44; has clothed Me with his garment.&quot; From that time on he sought to serve the Lord. His life was a series of miracles.After leaving the army&#44; he became a leader in the church&#44; he became very militant against idolatry. Challenged the pagans as Elijah did the False Prophets. He offered to be tied to a tree on its underside so that when it was cut down it would crush him unless God intervened. They tied him to a tree that was growing on the side of a hill&#44; assured that the natural pull of gravity would fall and crush him. Just as the tree began to fall&#44; God swung it around uphill and crushed several of the heathens as they were fleeing. Raised a man to life that had been hung for his faith.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Martin wanted to see the emperor&mdash;he was refused audience. Martin laid at the gate and prayed. The iron gate opened and he heard a voice bidding him to rise. The ruler would not turn his head to speak to him. Martin prayed. Suddenly a fire came spontaneously from the seat of the throne and the emperor vacated speedily.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They came to kill him.He stood erect and bared his throat to the sword. As they leaped forward&#44; the power of God hurled them back across the room. So overcome with fear&#44; they begged forgiveness.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The name &quot;Pergamos&quot; expresses the idea of a tower. Pergamos was the most illustrious city in Asia. It was also a city of great sin. They worshipped an idol in a form of a living serpent&#44; housed and fed in the temple.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>Messenger - &quot;Martin Luther&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>&quot;Unto the angel of the church in Sardis&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Martin Luther was a brilliant scholar of gentle disposition. He had been studying to be a lawyer when the death of a friend caused him to become serious concerning the spiritual condition of his own life. He soon entered the Augustinian convent at Erfurt in 1505 where he studied philosophy and also the Word of God</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Luther lived a life of severe penance but all his self affliction was in vain.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>I tormented myself to death to make peace with God&#44; but I was in darkness and found it not. --Martin Luther</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Martin Luther became a priest. On a visit to Rome he saw the futility of the Church&apos;s works.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Word of God struck his heart. &quot;The Just Shall Live By Faith&quot; Mixing the Word of God with faith&#44; Martin Luther was Born-again into the Family of God</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Luther fought against anti-scriptural teaching. When Leo X became Pope&#44; and John Tetzel came to sell indulgences for sin&#44; Luther first preached against it in his pulpit and then wrote his famous 95 thesis. On October 31&#44; 1517 he nailed his 95 thesis to the door of the Wittenberg Cathedral. He preached emphatically the Doctrine of Justification By Faith</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Luther translated the N.T. and gave it to the people in their own language. Aided by Hebrew scholars&#44; he translated the O.T.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>It was recorded in Sauer&apos;s History Vol. 3&#44; p. 406 that Luther was:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>a prophet&#44; evangelist&#44; speaker in tongues&#44; interpreter&#44; in one person endowed with all nine gifts of the Spirit.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>City - &quot;Sardis&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Sardis was the capital of ancient Lydia. At one time&#44; it was very important commercially. Sardis was destroyed by an earthquake in AD 17, but it was rebuilt. It was one of the great cities of western Asia Minor until the later Byzantine period. It fell out of importance as newer networks of roads and commerce bypassed the city. Today it is a heap of ruins and largely uninhabited.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Sardis&quot; means The Escaped One. The age lasted from 1520 to 1750. The Sardis Church Age is called the Age of Reformation.</eng><swa/></text>

</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d3c4s2'>
<text class='h1'><eng>Introduction</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This scene of the breaking of the Seven Seals follows after the translation of the Bride&#44; for the elders already have their crowns&#44; (Rev. 4:10). Also this scene comes after the Rapture of the Church. We read of the rapture in type in Rev. 4:1. The Four Beasts or Four Living Creatures which represent &quot;the Body of Christ&quot; or the Church are at the Throne&#44; also.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Similarities of the First Four Seals</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Opener of the Seals. &quot;The Lamb&quot; vs. 1</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>In Chapter 5&#44; it was dramatically shown that only the Lamb had the power to take the Book and the power and authority to open the book.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Seals Opened</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>John saw something vs. 1.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>John saw something before the thunder. Like a flash of lightening before the storm.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>He heard something.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>He heard - &quot;As it were the noise of thunder&quot;.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Command Given. &quot;Come&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Command is Not to John. He is there in the Throne.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Command is A call into Action. A release of Judgment.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Command is Repeated. In regard to the first four seals.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Source of the Command.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;One of the Four Beasts&quot;. The Elders are involved with things concerning heavenly subjects (ch. 5 &amp; 7) and The living Creatures are directly involved with things that are Earthly.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='blockquote'><eng>1 Corinthians 6:2 -- Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Particulars of the Seven Seals</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>The Number Seven</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There are Seven Seals in Number. This is indicative of the COMPLETENESS of this administration.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Seals are arranged in two distinct groups - first there are four and then there are three. A Worldly number that is followed by the heavenly number. These Seven Seals are a Divine judgment on a wicked world</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The First Four Seals are Distinguished by Horses and Horsemen.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Horses are symbolic pictures of the Power of the Almighty.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>2 Kings 6:17 -- And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. [Job 39:19-25; Zech. 1:8-10; Zech. 6:2-5]</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Four Spirits of the heavens from Zechariah 6:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Zechariach 6:1-8 -- And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>This also adds to the fact of scarcity of food.
&quot;A Measure of Wheat.&quot;The word&#44; measure&#44; used here is the Greek word&#44; choenix (which would be about a quart). Davis Dictionary of the Bible. A measure or quart of wheat would be the ordinary allowance of wheat to a man for one day&apos;s scanty subsistence.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Usual Price.The usual price of a &quot;choenix&quot; of wheat was one-eighth of a &quot;penny&quot; &#44; or denarius. The price named in the text&#44; being eight times this&#44; indicating further the greatness of the famine.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Value of the Penny.In the A.S.R.V. the word &quot;penny&quot; is translated &quot;shilling.&quot; A shillingin the Greek denotes a coin worth about eight pence&#44; or nearly seventeen cents. Probably the Roman Denarias a coin worth about 17 cents. This was the amount a soldier received for a days pay. Also in Matt. 20:###The ordinary wage for a full days labor&#44; would be (17 cents) a penny. All that a man can do is earn the bread that he will use himself.

<text class='h1'><eng>The Opening of The Fifth Seal 6:9-11</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The manifestations under the breaking of this seal differ&#44; in some respects&#44; from the four preceding. There is no expression from the Living ones. There are no 'horsemen or horses. And the burden of the description is exhibited in the results rather than in the processes. Yet&#44; everything belongs to the same general category of trial and suffering. lJnder this fifth seal&#44; we have added&#44; bloody persecution of those who hold and testify to the truth. The good as well as the bad suffer the hour of trial. Hence&#44; this fifth seal is the picture of Persecution and Martyrdom.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There are no voices of command from Heaven under this seal&#44; and no messengers despatched from the throne; the reason&#44; bloody persecutions of God's servants come from beneath -not from above.

<text class='p'><eng>It is not death&#44; but the cause of death&#44; which constitutes a martyr. Millions upon millions perish under the preceding seals&#44; but they are not called marytrs. The cause for which these were slain makes them martyrs.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Judah -confession or praise of God</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Reuben- behold a Son or viewing the Son</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Gad -a company or a troupe</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Asher- blessed or happy</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Naphtali- obtained by wrestling</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Manasseh -making to forget</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Joseph -added or addition</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Benjamin- Son of the right hand</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Look at them all together. Confessors or praises of God&#44; looking upon the Son&#44; a company of blessed ones&#44; wrestling or fighting for what is ahead&#44; forgetting these things that are behind&#44; hearing and obeying the word&#44; cleaving unto the reward of a heavenly habitation&#44; an addition to what has already happened&#44; sons of the day of God&apos;s hand&#44; or the day of His Power&#44; begotten in the extremity of the age.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>One reason the names of Dan and Ephraim is left out. Dan means a judge. These 144&#44;000 are not judges&#44; and never become judges. Ephraim -double fruitfulness&#44; or increase&#44; or growth by multiplication. These are a fixed number 144&#44;000.

<text class='h2'><eng>The Seven Angels - 8:2</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They Are of Divine Order &quot;Which stood before God&quot;.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They Are of Particular Rank and Distinction.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Not all angels are of the same dignity and office.Paul enumerates &quot;dominions&#44; principalities&#44; and powers&quot; among the celestial orders. Daniel speaks of some chief princes.Paul and Jude refer to arch angels. Angelic beings are not of one and the same grade. The Sons of God&#44; in general&#44; came before Him only at appointed times. Job 1:6; Yet&#44; Jesus spake of some angels who &quot;do always behold the face of their Father which is in heaven.&quot; Matt. 18:10.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They Are Seven in Number</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Jews were familiar with seven angels of this order.Gabriel- is one of them&#44; as he said to Zacharias; &quot;I am Gabriel&#44; that stand in the presence of God.&quot;Luke 1:19 Michael is another&#44; as he is ranked with Gabriel in the book of Daniel.
In the book of Enoch&#44; these are the names of the angels who watch:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='li'><eng>Uriel -one of the Holy angels&#44; who presides over clamor and terror.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='li'><eng>Raphael -one of the holy angels&#44; who presides over the spirits of men</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='li'><eng>Raguel- one of the holy angels&#44; who inflicts punishment on the world</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='li'><eng>Michael -one of the holy angels</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='li'><eng>Sarakiel -one of the holy angels</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They Are Servants.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They are Standing. This is the position of service. Yet &quot;standing in the presence of God&quot; is to be above all other servants.The Bride is going to be sitting -Dominion- rule -heirs of God joint heirs of Christ. In Esther 1:4&#44; The 7 Persian princes who &quot;saw the kings face&#44;&quot; were the highest officers of the realm&#44; and next to the monarch in rank and power.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They Were Given Seven Trumpets.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Trumpets are expressive instruments and God gave special directions in the use of the trumpet.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Trumpets are an emblem of war.Num. 10:9 Jer.4:19</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Trumpets were for the convocation of the people&#44;and the moving of the camps of Israel. Num.8</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Trumpets proclaimed the great festivals.Num. 10:10; Lev. 23:24; 25:9; II Chron. 29:27.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Trumpets are related to announce royalty.I Kings 1:34&#44;39 II Kings 9:13</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Trumpets are associated with the majesty of God. Ex. 19:16.(7) Trumpets were used in the overthrow of the ungodly. Josh. 6:13-16</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Mystery Angel - Rev.8:3-5</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Some understand this merely to be symbolic and others believe it to have no significant meaning at all. Remember: John was a faithful and true witness of the Lord&#44; and this&#44; he said&#44; is what he saw.Now&#44; who is this &quot;angel&quot;?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Nature of &quot;The Angel&quot; -</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Another Angel&quot;&quot;Allos&quot; &mdash;differentThis same Rhrase is used in Chpt. 7: 2and again in chpt. 10:###14:17; 18:1; 20:1.The word &quot;angel&quot; means (messenger of God)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Office of &quot;The Angel&quot; -</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>He offers the prayers of saints. You cannot give something unless you have it. He had to receive them to give them. Angels do not receive worship&#44; but &quot;the Angel of the Lord&quot; does. Gen. 16:7&#44;13; Ex. 3:2-5; Joshua 5:13-15
There are many passages in which the expression the &quot;angel of God/the Lord&quot; is definitely for a manifestation of God Himself. Compare Gen. 22:11-12; 22:15-19; Ex. 3:2-6.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Ministry of The Angel -</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Scripture itself presents us with fact&#44; to prove why this Angel is the Lord:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The First Proof -He had &quot;a Golden censer&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This instrument was used by the priests&#44; in the ministry of the worship of God. However&#44; it was used only by the high priest in the holy place. This indicating our great High Priest who is now entered into the heavens&#44; Jesus the Son of God. This is a scene in Heaven.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Second Proof -He offers the Prayers of Saints before God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>vs. 3 &quot;All Saints&quot;. There is no record of such an office found in the scripture as being assigned to angels&#44; however&#44; there is record of this office being executed by the Lord Jesus.
Eph. 2:18 I Tim. 2:5 Heb. 7:25; Heb. 13:15 I Peter 2:5 I John 2:1;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Third Proof -He cast fire on the earth.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>vs. 5 Taken from the altar. Luke 12:49&quot;I [Jesus] came to send fire upon the earth.&quot; A symbol of the Divine Presence &amp; Power. Ex. 3:2 Deut. 4:36 Psa. 50:3 97:3; Isa. 66:15-16; Acts 2:3 An Instrument of Divine Judgment. The action indicated here by the casting into the earth speaks of judgment. Gen. 19:24; Lev. 10:2; Num. 11:1; 16:35; Mal. 4:1; II Kings 1:10; II Thess. 1:8; II Peter 3:10.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Fourth Proof -To offer incense with prayers .vs. 3-4</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Given unto Him much Incense.&quot;It was given to Him through merit.For without His death and atoning work coupled with His pure and Holy life&#44; there would be no force in prayer. God hears us because of Him. (The Compounding of the Incense in the O.T.)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Events Related To the Angel&apos;s Actions. vs. 5</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Notice carefully the order:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Flash of Light -The Release</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>We are looking at the final blasts of judgment upon a wicked and rebellious world. The last seal hasbeen broken. The prayers of all the saints have been accepted before God&#44; and He has promised to avenge them. The fire and incense of the altar is cast into the earth that is doomed by the just judgment of Almighty God. Time has now come for the final judgments. &quot;And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.&quot; Not all seven were to sound at once. Varied events followed their soundings. Prearrangement as to order and time for each to sound. There are none that are alike but there is a progression of greater judgment.</eng><swa/></text>

This has somewhat of a correspondence to an earlier stage&#44; under the sixth seal. Not to hurt earth&#44; the sea&#44; nor the trees&#44; till the servants of God were sealed.

<text class='p'><eng>The fifth trumpet is different in character from the preceding four. All are blasts of judgment&#44; and all belong to the &quot;Great Day of the Lord.&quot; Thus far&#44; the trumpets have blown only for the objects of physical nature&#44; and wrought their effects through disturbances in the material world. But the trumpet now before us goes beyond the physical world and calls into action quite other agencies. The doors of separation between the earth and the prison of evil spirits are opened.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>What the Star Is - vs. 1.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Time of His Fall -</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>At the time of the original creation&#44; he fell into the condemnation of the devil. But in Revelations he fell from heaven to Earth. Just prior to the Rapture of the Church&#44; the Devil is cast out. Rev. 12:7-9.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>These two witnesses are not presented to John in vision. They are described to him by the glorious Angel&#44; who is the Lord Jesus Himself. The account that is given here is not John&apos;s but Christ&apos;s&#44; given in His own words.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Who&#44; then&#44; are these Two Witnesses?The connection in which the account is given may help to give us the answer. These Witnesses come upon us suddenly&#44; in the midst of the scenes of the Judgment&#44; and at a time when Christ is ready to take possession of the earth.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>&quot;After three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>They Ascend into Heaven - vs. 12 &quot;They ascended up to heaven&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Who are They? Some believe Moses and Elijah. Some believe Enoch and Elijah. Some believe O.T. and N.T. Some believe a body of believers. Malachi 3:1-6; 4:1&#44;5-6; Matt. 17:10-13; 11:14-15; Luke 1:15-17. John the baptist was a partial fulfillment - Mal. 4:6; Luke 1:17. Lev. 26:1&#44;9; Jer. 14:22; Zech. 10:1&#44;2; Hag. 1:9-11.
The Reason water to blood - Because of the bloody and oppressive tyranny. Moses in Egypt. The bloody persecution.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They Are Merciful Witnesses.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Though they appear in judgment&#44; the message is a warning -
&quot;To flee from the wrath to come&quot; - But they will hot listen - II Thess. 2:9-11.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>What have we identified the two witnesses to be? Now we continue&hellip;
Their Times -Their Doings -Their End</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Times of These Two Witnesses.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They are not Gospel Times.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The Jew and his Temple.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Ministers- different from Gospel ministers. vs. 5.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They kill -vs. 10 torment - deal out fiery judgment.Avenge the very wish to injure them. We are not to avenge ourselves.Not to smite and kill our enemies - but love them. Jesus was crucified Stephen was stoned. James was beheaded. Peter was crucified.Paul beaten -imprisoned - beheaded - Polycarp is burned.The Gospel is a thing of joy. Isa. 57:7.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Their garments symbols of calamity and judgment. The heavens are shut - no rain -no grain. Waters are turned to blood.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>They are very Evil Times.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Times of great affliction and sorrow for God&apos;s true ministers. Hell has incarnated itself upon earth.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>From the Abyss has come the Beast. All the world wonder at -</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>All worship and adore him - Not given to the worship of God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>War rages against God&apos;s People. Rev. 12:1###They are overcome.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The two witnesses are killed. How many more?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>They are times of Miracles&#44; vs.###The Two witnesses</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Beast and False Prophet - lying signs and wonders. II Thess. 2:3-10.Deceiving the world - Rev. 13:12-1###Moses overcame the magicans.These overcome the witnesses vs. 7.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Work of These Two Witnesses.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They Are Prophets&#44; vs.3; vs. 6; vs. 10.
They Are Preaching Prophets. Expounding God&apos;s Word. Calling to Repentance.
They Are Judgment Prophets&#44; vs. ###Elijah called down fire &quot;consumed fifty&quot; etc.
Mal. 4:6 &quot;smite the earth with a curse.&quot;Hebrew word -utter destruction. Matt. 24:21-22.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The End of These Two Witnesses.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Their career&#44; though illustrious&#44; and crowded with miracle from beginning to end&#44; is very brief. vs. 3.They shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 3 -1/2 years.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Put to death.
&quot;When they shall have finished their testimony. &quot;When their work is complete.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Form of Death They Die - vs.8.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Some believe reference is made of crucifixion. The ordinary mode of execution (at this time) is by beheading. Rev. 20:4a.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Place of Death - vs. 8 &quot;in the street&hellip;of the great city&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They are denied burial. &quot;Spiritually called Sodom and Egypt&quot; This is further proof of the literalness of this prophesy. Jerusalem in Apostasy&#44; is a Sodom. Isa. 1:9-10; 3:8-9; Deut. 32:30-33; Jer. 23:14.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Length of Their Death - vs. 1 3 -1/2 days.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>They Ascend into Heaven - vs. 12.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They hear the call. They descend up to heaven.Their enemies behold them.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Witness of God To Their Ascension. vs. 13</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A great earthquake. At the death of Christ - earthquake. But no one died -it was Mercy-Love-Grace. Here is Judgment - &quot;Tenth part of the city fell&quot; vs. 13. &quot;Seven thousand &quot; slain - The earthquake in California</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>This is a dividing point in the book. In the fulfillment of this part of the prophecy we are going back into the church age. Rev. 1:1-4 &quot;John to the Seven Churches which are in Asia.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>It is important to remember that this is a book of prophecy and not history. 
Revelation 1:3 &quot;the words of this prophecy.&quot; Revelation 1:3; 11:6; 19:10; 22:7; 22:10; 22:18; 22:19 &mdash; seven times.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h1'><eng>The Sun-Clothed Woman &mdash; 12:1&#44;2</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Importance of This Revelation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It was a sign.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;appeared a great wonder&quot; &quot;Semeion&quot; Miracle -Sign -Token -Wonder John 2:11; 4:45; 20:30; I Cor. 12:12; Matt.26:48;Luke 2:12; Rom.4:11; II Cor. 12:12; (II Thess.3:17 Token or Sign).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A sign -this is a word which he uses here for the first time in the Revelation -intending to bring before us something beyond itself.A sign - A symbol - A picture.A symbol of something else which is the true subject of contemplation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>When interpreting Revelation you must understand that there is literal and figurative language and you must know when which is being used. When the Scripture is absent from a figurative expression or a figurative setting we should not try to make it figurative&#44; but we should take it literal. Here John says&#44;&quot; And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven.&quot; Something very mysterious is happening in the heavens&mdash;figurative&#44; symbolic and not literal.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It was an important sign.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Megas&quot; great- extraordinary &mdash;important. Not only a sign -but -&quot;A great sign.&quot; This is a great&#44; important&#44; extraordinary&#44; remarkable event that needs to be considered.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Location of This Revelation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It was in the Spirit.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;I was in the Spirit on the Lord&apos;s Day.&quot; Transported through time and space.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It was in Heaven.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;A great wonder in heaven.&quot; That is&#44; it was revealed to him in the heavenly realm. </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It was spiritual.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>That is&#44; it was apart from the natural. It was something of a heavenly order. It&apos;s not a natural thing; it&apos;s not in the natural order. It&apos;s not of the earthly&#44; but of the heavenly.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Exposition of This Revelation. (Who is this woman?)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>A woman clothed with the sun&#44; and the moon under her feet&#44; and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Who the woman is not.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>She is not Mary &mdash;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Mary was of a very lowly and poverty stricken condition. Can we really interpret properly the lowly state of that little peasant woman that brought Jesus into the world&#44; with this prophecy&#44; fulfilling this position of a woman clothed with the sun and moon under her feet and crowned with twelve stars?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>It was a woman that brought a man-child into this world&#44; but was that man-child caught up to God as a child? Was Jesus just a child when He went to Heaven? &quot;And her child was caught up unto God and to His throne.&quot; This does not speak of a man 33 years old&#44; fully matured&#44; fully grown and fully developed. If John wanted us to understand that this was Jesus&#44; I&apos;m sure he would have said that the Lord Jesus was caught up to the throne. Also&#44; Mary had passed away a long time before this vision.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Now&#44; let us look back into the first chapter of Revelation. I think there are some keys for interpretation there. Rev. 1 :3 says &quot;Blessed is he that readeth&#44; and they that hear the words of this prophecy.&quot; &quot;This prophecy&quot; has to do with prophetic utterance&#44; foretelling something that is to come to pass. This book was written sixty years or more after the ascension of Christ. Remember&#44; he is speaking of prophecy&#44; something that is yet to take place. Also&#44; in Rev. 1: 1 &quot;Things which must shortly come to pass.&quot; That is these things have not come to pass. This is not a record of history&#44; but this is something that is to come to pass. Again&#44; in Rev. 4: 1 &quot; And I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.&quot; When Christ was caught up to God&#44; this Revelation was not yet written and it was said at the time of writing these were future. Also&#44; is Jesus the only one that will rule the nations with a rod of iron? Rev.2:24-27.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>She is not Israel &mdash;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There is another school of thought&#44; and probably this is the more prominent teaching today. This is the belief that this is literal Israel. Israel was an earthly heritage. An earthly people- An earthly kingdom - Earthly possessions. The only time anything is mentioned to Israel with the heavens is Abraham&apos;s seed being as the starts of the sky&#44; and then&#44; only of those that are believers. Rom. 9:6-8.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Israel as a nation is pictured in the Scriptures&#44; especially in the book of Hosea&#44; as an unfaithful wife and as a harlot on the streets. As you look at Israel today you can see that this is her condition rather that in the place of honor. Also&#44; Israel was clothed with the law which speaks of judgment&#44; darkness&#44; and death. This woman is clothed with the &quot;sun&quot;.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Some say this must be Israel because of what Isaiah said - Isa. 66:6&#44; Look closely at the two texts. They are the opposite of each other.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>She is not the world church &mdash;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A look at the condition of the church universally will reveal that she is not arrayed in this fashion - but&#44; is worldly&#44; ungodly&#44; and devilish. How can an unholy thing produce a holy thing that is to be caught up to God and to His throne?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Who the woman is</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The key to help interpret is in Rev. 1:4 &quot;John to the Seven Churches.&quot; Are we left to interpret whom John is speaking to? &quot;The Seven Churches&quot; The whole church age. John&#44; when referring to something else&#44; indicates this -when there is an absence of explanation -doesn&apos;t it only make sense that he is speaking then to the Churches?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A woman in scripture - Rev. 17 - False here. Rev. 12 - True Church. The woman is the Church. It is a revelation of Christ and the Church. Remember -&quot; A great wonder in heaven.&quot; This is the Church - the Body of Christ. Eph. 1 :22&#44;23</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>We see not a fulfillment but a beautiful type and foreshadowing of the birthing of the Man-child in the account of Mary and the birth of Christ in Luke The Church will prepared for her work by the Word of God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Angel Brought a Word Luke 1:28; Eph. 1:6</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Word brought was that she was &quot;highly favored&quot; of the Lord. This means she was &quot;endued with grace&quot;. God was with her and she was accepted by Him. What made her &quot;favored&quot; or &quot;accepted&quot; by God? (1) She was dedicated to the Lord [Jewish custom to dedicate their children to God by taking them to the temple when they are young.] (2) She was separated [vs. 27 She was a virgin] (3) She was a Believer though limited in her belief [vs. 29 &quot;troubled&quot; diatarasso &mdash; beyond her ability to believe.]</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Her question in verse 34 &quot;How shall this be&quot; was answered before she knew it- she was brought a Word and this Word must be germinated by the Holy Ghost.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Holy Ghost Has to Germinate the Word</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Luke 1:35 &hellip;The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee&#44; and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: &hellip;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;The Power&quot; is that &quot;dunamis&quot; which is the supreme&#44; infinite power of God. This was the same power with which God created the worlds. This work of perfecting the Believer is an IMPOSSIBLE one with us&#44; but not with God!</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Luke 1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Mary Had to Fully Surrender to the Word</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Luke 1:38 And Mary said&#44; Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Word&quot; in verse 38 is the Greek word &quot;rhema&quot;. &quot;Rhema&quot; is the revealed Word of God.

<text class='h1'><eng>The Man-Child&#44;12:2-5</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>If there is a message that the devil hates&#44; it is the message of the man&mdash;child.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Matthew 13:19 &mdash; When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom&#44; and understandeth not&#44; cometh the wicked one&#44; and catch it the way that which was sown in his heart.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The woman that is referred to in verse one is the church. This mystical woman is in the way of motherhood.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Identity of the Man-Child</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>If the woman is the church&#44; who is the man-child? </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Some believe the man-child to be Christ. (i.e.&#44; Scofield)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Some objections to this theory.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This chapter is part of the vision that was given to John the beloved 60 years after the ascension of crimes. The entire vision is a revelation of things that were &quot;to come to pass&quot; after was given. &quot; (Revelation 1:1; 4:1) how then can the translation of this manchild we for to the ascension of Christ&#44; which occurred six decades before this vision?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Christ came down from heaven at birth. The man-child is caught up to heaven.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>If this Scripture refers the ascension of Christ&#44; why should the figure of a child&#44; which the devil cannot kill&#44; &quot;caught up unto God&#44; and to his throne&quot; be used to symbolize the ascension into heaven of a full-grown man&#44; whom the devil did kill?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Christ was killed -put to death. True&#44; He surrendered His life but He died. The man-child is not harmed by the devil&#44; but is caught up to God and His throne.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The man-child is a product of the church.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;The woman is in travail to bring forth&quot;) the woman which is the church is producing sons. </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The manchild is a fully mature son (Ephesians 4:13; Hebrews 5:14).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The manchild is the Overcomer (Revelation 3:21). The manchild is the Bride of Christ (Revelation 19:7).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Revealing of the Man-Child. &quot;And she brought forth&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;brought forth&quot; &mdash; tikto &mdash; to produce from seed.
 Ephesians 4:11-13 This &quot;seed&quot; is the Word of God presented much through the efforts of God&apos;s ministers which are God&apos;s gifts given to the saints. </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The seed is the revealed Word or the Word of God that has been made alive by the Spirit of God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>To bring forth is to reveal the child. A manifestation of that which is born. Rom.8:17-19 Manifestation.I Peter 1:3-5 Revealing. To reveal is to bring to light</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Revealed with great pain. Vs. 2 &quot;cried&quot; travailing in birth. Pain to be delivered. Romans 8:23 - And not only they&#44; but ourselves also&#44; which have the first fruits of the Spirit&#44; even we ourselves groan within ourselves&#44; waiting for the adoption&#44; to wit&#44; the redemption of our body. The Man-child will be brought forth through intercessory prayer. quot;Cried&quot; &mdash; &quot;krazo&quot; &mdash; meaning to call aloud&#44; to cry out&#44; or any inarticulate cries. Romans 8:26-27 This is not a pious recital of prayers&#44; but is a travailing in prayer is a mother travails in giving birth. The prayer must be earnest and must be in faith. &quot;Waiting&quot; in Romans 8:23 is&quot;Apekdechomai&quot; meaning to fully or eagerly expect. There will be pain &quot;basanizo&quot; meaning to put to the test. There will be trials.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Revealed under great persecution. Vs. 4 &quot;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered&#44; for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot; The devil will fight harder against this truth than any other truth that has been revealed because the man-child takes his place in heaven. Vs.8.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Revealed in the last time. The 11th chapter ends with Christ ruling the kingdoms of this world which are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign for ever and ever. Chapter 12 brings us back to the third chapter and at the end of the church age. Luke 21:28; one Peter 1:3&mdash; The time of the revealing is just before the tribulation. The church is still on the earth and will face 3 -1/2 years of tribulation&mdash;vs. 6 &quot;in the wilderness&quot;. Also&#44; the Man-child is revealed before the Church is perfected. Verse 14</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Nature of the Man-Child.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;A man-child&quot;&quot;Arrhen&quot; or &quot; Arsen&quot; - means male. It has to do with manhood and not gender.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Manly characteristics -heroic virtues.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They are strong -not weak.They are true -not false.Not full of hypocrisy.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Overcomers&#44; vs. 5</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>.&quot;Who was to rule&quot; Rev. 12:11; 2:26&#44;27; 3:21.The &quot;Overcomer&quot; is promised to sit with Him on His throne. These are &quot;caught up to God and to His throne.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Humble&#44; vs.11.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Did not combat the devil in their own strength. II Cor. 10:4.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Characteristics of the Man-Child.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>A student of the Word.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>To confess the Word&#44; you must know the Word&#44; vs. 11.&quot;by the Word of their testimony&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>A believer in the Word.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>To confess the Word&#44; you must believe the Word They believed in the blood of the Lamb because of the Word.Vs. 11 &quot;overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>A lover of the Word.Vs 11</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;And loved not their lives&quot; They loved the Word more than their lives.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Development of the Man-Child.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There is a development here. The Scripture indicates a process&mdash;salvation&#44; Holy Ghost Baptism and fully mature son. </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Conceived.&quot;Gaster&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Vs. 2 &quot;With child&quot; (Born-Again Believers)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Conceived by the Word. The Word of God (like seed) is being planted in the Church by the Holy Ghost.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Child.&quot;Teknon&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Vs. 4 &quot;Developing&quot;(Holy Ghost Baptized Believers)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Son.&quot;Huios&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Vs. 5 &quot;Matured&quot; (the Bride of Christ&#44; Overcomers)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>In type in Gen. 2:21&#44; Adam and Eve. Gen. 5:24 Enoch - Methuselah - Noah.The Word of truth (like seed) is being planted in the heart of the Church by His Spirit. The Body of Christ is not yet fully-grown or mature but God is nourishing it.He will bring it forth. </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There are a lot of babes in the church. There are a lot of children in the church. There must be a maturing of sons &mdash; fully grown. 
A perfect man. Matthew 5:48; Ephesians 4:12-13.
&quot;Huious&quot; is a fully matured son (Hebrews 5:14) that is in a position to receive full inheritance (Galatians 4:1-2; I Peter 1:4) and full power (Ephesians 1:13-14).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Position of the Man-child</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>As a child&#44; the Believer does not differ from a servant (Galaitans 4:1). </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Nepos&quot; infant&#44; non-speaking&#44; immature&#44; childish. As the Believer develops and matures in Christ there awaits for him an &quot;adoption&quot; or &quot;positioning as son&quot;. This adoption is what we are &quot;waiting&quot; (Romans 8:23) for: &quot;the adoption&quot; &mdash;the placing or positioning of sons (&quot;huiothesia&quot;). </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>God does not adopt sinners into the family of God. The sinner must be born again into the family of God (John 3:7). The sinner is begotten by the Word and the the Spirit (John 3:5). Adoption is a term involving the positioning of Believers as sons. It is not a putting into the family by spiritual birth&#44; but a putting into position of sons. Notice the Adoption the Apostle is speaking of (Romans 8:23) is yet future at his time. This positioning is a reward for MATURITY and OVERCOMING.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 12:5 &hellip; who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Because of the prophecies about Christ in Psalm 2:9 and Revelation 2:26-27 many believe that Revelation 12:5 is talking only about Christ.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Psalm 2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&apos;s vessel.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Revelation 2:26 And he that overcometh&#44; and keepeth my works unto the end&#44; to him will I give power over the nations: 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>But&#44; Christ promised a position on His Throne with those that will overcome even as He overcame. The manchilde goes to the Throne of God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne&#44; even as I also overcame&#44; and am set down with my Father in his throne.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Revelation 12:5 &hellip;caught up unto God&#44; and to his throne.</eng><swa/></text>

<div class='chapter' id='d3c6s5'>
<text class='h1'><eng>The Great Red Dragon - 12:3&#44;4</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12: 3&#44; 4 &quot;And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon&#44; having seven heads and ten horns&#44; and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven&#44; and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered&#44; for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The appearance seen is not a literal representation of the devil as he actually is. The wonder (the sign) of the dragon is figurative and descriptive of the devil&apos;s particular characteristics&#44; suggestive of his destructive and murderous character. There is no doubt as to the significance of the dragon symbolizing the devil; invariably a symbol of what is harmful&#44; wicked&#44; evil&#44; tyrannous and murderous. The devil is a hideous bloodthirsty monster&#44; always &quot;seeking whom he may devour.&quot;
This is the history of a fierce&#44; hostile&#44; evil power with which the Church has&#44; and is&#44; and must yet contend. This evil force is set to hinder the progress and destroy the hopes of the Church. It is &quot;another wonder&quot; (sign) that is to be interpreted after the same manner as the preceding &quot;sign.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Dragon</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Image or &quot;Sign&quot; is that of a &quot;Dragon&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Understand&#44; this dragon is a terrible creature that delights in attacking&#44; terrifying and devouring. It is especially determined to attack and destroy the truth of God&apos;s Word.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Matt.13: 19 &quot;When any one heareth the Word of the kingdom&#44; and understandeth it not&#44; then cometh the wicked one&#44; and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Luke 8: 12 &quot;Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil&#44; and taketh away the Word out of their hearts&#44; lest they should believe and be saved.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>I Peter 5: 8 &quot;Be sober&#44; be vigilant; because your adversary the devil&#44; as a roaring lion&#44; walketh about&#44; seeking whom he may devour:&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>It is &quot;A Great Dragon&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>While the picture in general is that of a dragon&#44; it is altogether peculiar and different from the common dragon. It exceeds the ordinary idea in size and bulk&#44; and every dragon feature is greatly magnified. The dragon is &quot;great&quot; in its evil accomplishment and great in its power to kill. It is &quot;a great&hellip; dragon.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Megas&quot; &mdash; &quot;Great&quot; &mdash; mighty of external form&#44; measure &mdash; of a degree and intensity &mdash; mighty of rank (whether of persons or angels) &mdash; of all those who had position of authority and power</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Here is a being that has dared to set himself against the Almighty God. This &quot;dragon&quot; is trying to overcome Him and take over the universe by taking from the Creator the creation that God had created. Although this dragon had the power of death&#44; it was through death that Christ defeated him.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>The devil has the Power of Death</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>He has the power to put to death.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Heb. 2: 14 - Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood&#44; He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death&#44; that is&#44; the devil;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>The devil has the Ability to Deceive</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>He is great in his ability to deceive and destroy. The devil has the ability to deceive the whole world.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12: 9 - And the great dragon was cast out&#44; that old serpent&#44; called the devil&#44; and satan&#44; which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth&#44; and his angels were cast out with him.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>What a power of deception must lie in him who deceives angels to follow him!</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It is &quot;A Great Red Dragon&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>It is &quot;red&#44;&quot; seemingly for two reasons. The first is to enhance his terrible appearance. The second is suggestive of his murderous&#44; destructive character. It is a peculiar color.&quot;Purrhos&quot; &mdash; &quot;Red&quot; &mdash; fiery &mdash; bloody &mdash; the color of blood &mdash; murder. This was the color of the horse whose rider was to take peace out of the world&#44; and bring about terrible war and bloodshed.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 6:4 &quot;And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth&#44; and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Jesus said the devil was a murderer from the beginning&#44; and could not tell the truth.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Jn. 8:44 &quot;Ye are of your father the devil&#44; and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning&#44; and abode not in the truth&#44; because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie&#44; he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar&#44; and the father of it.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Dr. J. A. Seiss said&#44; &quot;There has never been a murder&#44; but he (the devil) caused it.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>I Pet. 5:8 &quot;Be sober&#44; be vigilant; because your adversary the devil&#44; as a roaring lion&#44; walketh about&#44; seeking whom he may devour:&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Fiery red also indicates the destructive and cruel nature of the dragon. The dragon is burning like fire with rage and out of control with malignant hatred against that which is righteous and godly.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It has &quot;Seven Heads&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Seven is a number of completeness&#44; or fullness. This indicates the fullness of evil and wickedness. Dragons ordinarily were given one head&#44; but this dragon possesses &quot;seven heads.&quot; Two heads would indicate confusion. Here there are seven heads. &quot;Seven heads&quot; also reveal a total and complete state of confusion. The head is the seat of governing power and it implies rule and control. The fact there are seven heads should be understood in the same sense that we read of &quot;the seven Spirits of God&quot; &mdash; a manifold unity. We have here in these heads the symbol of the entire imperial reign and rule of this world from the beginning of time to the end of this present age.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Three times the Lord calls the devil &quot;&hellip;the prince of this world.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Jn. 12:31 &quot;&hellip;Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Jn. 14:30 &quot;&hellip;For the prince of this world cometh&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Jn. 16:11 &quot;&hellip;Because the prince of this world is judged.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The Apostle Paul called him the &quot;god of this world.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>II Cor. 4:4 &quot;&hellip;The god of this world hath blinded the minds&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>I Jn. 5:19 &quot;&hellip;The whole world lieth in wickedness.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The Amplified New Testament reads&#44; &quot;The whole world (around us) is under the power of the evil one.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The image before us presents the dragon having dominion over the governments of this world. Therefore&#44; through these world powers&#44; he sets himself against the kingdom of God and all that is good and right.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It has &quot;Seven Crowns upon his Heads&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The &quot;heads&quot; being &quot;crowned&quot; would indicate at least to some degree&#44; that he has been successful in his diabolical attacks.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h4'><eng>Successful in Deceiving &mdash; A Crown</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon&hellip; called the devil&#44; and satan&#44; which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Successful in Dividing &mdash; A Crown</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>I Cor. 11: 18 &quot;&hellip;There be divisions among you&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Successful in Defeating &mdash; A Crown</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Matt. 24:12 &quot;And because iniquity shall abound&#44; the love of many shall wax cold.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Successful in Denying &mdash; A Crown</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Jude 4 &quot;&hellip;Denying the only Lord God&#44; and our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Successful in Devouring &mdash; A Crown</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>I Pet. 5:8 &quot;&hellip;Your adversary the devil&#44; as a roaring lion&#44; walketh about&#44; seeking whom he may devour:&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Successful in Delaying &mdash; A Crown</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Dan. 10:13 &quot;But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but&#44; lo&#44; Michael&#44; one of the chief princes&#44; came to help me&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h4'><eng>Successful in Deforming &mdash; A Crown</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Lk. 13:11 &quot;&hellip;A woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years&#44;and was bowed together&#44; and could in no wise lift up herself.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Lk. 13:18 &quot;&hellip;Whom satan hath bound&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>He is the destroyer of both body and soul. He seduceth and misleads the whole world&#44; promising everything including peace and prosperity&#44; so that he can more effectively enslave and destroy.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It has &quot;Ten Horns&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Ten&quot; signifies the perfection of Divine Order. This is in contrast to that of an evil&#44; wicked being&#44; so this would be in reverse of the Divine Order; complete and total disorder.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Keras&quot; &mdash; &quot;Horns&quot; are symbolic of strength&#44; power&#44; dominion and kingly rule &mdash; kings and their kingdoms.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Dan.7: 24 - And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&hellip;;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Dan. 8:20 - The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>These &quot;horns&quot; are not symbols of good rule but of evil power to hurt&#44; wound&#44; afflict and destroy. The forces which destroyedPalestinewere referred to as &quot;four horns&quot; in Zech. 1: 18&mdash;2###They scattered&#44; oppressed&#44; injured and destroyed the people of God. Likewise&#44; the &quot;horns&quot; of the dragon scatter&#44; divide&#44; oppress&#44; torment&#44; injure&#44; afflict&#44; destroy and kill the believers in Christ.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>It has A Tail</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 4: 12 &quot;&hellip;His tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven&#44; and did cast them to the earth:&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>His tail is certainly one of the most striking features of the dragon. It swings through heaven drawing a third part of the stars and casts them to the ground. These &quot;stars of heaven&quot; are very particular stars. They are not literal stars&#44; for the whole scene is a &quot;sign.&quot; These were the angelic hosts&#44; fitly called stars by reason of their brightness&#44; shinning beauty and glory.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Job 38: 4&mdash;7 &quot;Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare&#44; if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof&#44; if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the morning stars sang together&#44; and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>When Lucifer fell and became the devil&#44; he was able to deceive and draw away a third part of the angels with him.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Jude 6 &quot;&hellip;Angels which kept not their first estate&#44; but left their own habitation&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>II Pet. 2: 4 - &hellip;God spared not the angels that sinned&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Mystery of the Dragon</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The dragon is not altogether that great a mystery because of:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12: 9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out&#44; that old serpent&#44; called the devil&#44; and satan&#44; which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth&#44; and his angels were cast out with him.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The devil is not literally a dragon&#44; as the Church is not literally a woman&#44; but these are divinely given images or symbols. There is a devil. John recorded here that the dragon was the devil.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>&hellip;The great dragon was cast out&#44; that old serpent&#44; called the devil&#44; and satan&#44; which deceiveth the whole world&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>This is a great contrast from his original state.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Isa. 14: 12 &quot;How art thou fallen from heaven&#44; O Lucifer&#44; son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Eze. 28: 14 &quot;Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth&hellip;&quot;

<text class='p'><eng>Lucifer fell from the anointed cherub that covereth&#44; to a murderous dragon. What happened? What caused this terrible change? God did not make a dragon (devil); He created Lucifer &mdash; &quot;The light bearer.&quot; God created him with a free will to choose to do good or evil. He was not the devil&#44; but he became the devil through the desire to be like God&#44; or to be God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Dragon &mdash; &quot;The dragon&#44; figured prominently in ancient and medieval mythologies as an embodiment of evil principle. It has been superstitiously dreaded and even worshipped&#44; as in China&#44; where it is the imperial emblem. It is commonly represented as a large winged serpent&#44; with a crested head and powerful claws. In classical mythology&#44; a dangerous&#44; often a supernatural serpent.&quot; (Standard Dictionary)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The dragon has great power.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='blockquote'><eng>Jude 9 - Yet Michael the archangel&#44; when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses&#44; durst not bring against him a railing accusation&#44; but said&#44; the Lord rebuke thee.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Lucifer is of the highest order of angelic beings&#44; but is subordinate to God. Some compare the dragon in Rev. 12 to the Beast coming up out of the sea in Rev. 1###In Rev. 12&#44; the seven heads wear the crowns. In Rev. 13&#44; it is the horns that are crowned. The dragon is the head of a spiritual empire while the Beast is the head of a physical empire. This portrays a concentration of&#44; and the exercise of&#44; the devil&apos;s diabolical power in and through the world powers.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There is a likeness between the Dragon and the Beast because they are both the workings of the devil. There is also the distinction between them because one works in the spiritual realm and the other works in the physical realm.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Objects of The Dragon&apos;s Malignity</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 12:4 &quot;&hellip;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered&#44; for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The First Objective is to Devour the &apos;Man-Child&apos;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>To destroy and devour the &quot;Man-Child&#44;&quot; the devil would have to destroy the message (the Truth of the Word) that produces the &quot;Man-Child.&quot; If there ever was a message that the devil hates&#44; it is this message of the &quot;Man-Child&quot; &mdash; the message ofovercoming&mdash; the message ofperfection.
Jesus said:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Matt.13:19 &quot;Then cometh the wicked one&#44; and catcheth away that which was sown&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The power of the Word is &quot;&hellip;made of none effect&hellip;&quot; (Rom.4: 14) in the lives of those that &quot;&hellip;understandeth it not.&quot; (Matt. 13:19)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>When the Word is received and understood&#44; it will produce the characteristics of Christ in the life of the believer. The Word produces to the extent that it is believed and obeyed. Jesus said by the same &quot;Word&quot; some would produce &quot;&hellip;thirty&#44; and some sixty&#44; and some an hundred&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Mk. 4:20 &quot;&hellip;Such as hear the Word&#44; and receive it&#44; and bring forth fruit&#44; some thirtyfold&#44; some sixty&#44; and some an hundred.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The Scripture speaks of some as babes&#44; some as children and some of mature age.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Heb. 5:12&mdash;14 &quot;For when for the time ye ought to be teachers&#44; ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk&#44; and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the Word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age&#44; even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be a ruling body of Overcomers that will be given power to rule the nations.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 2:26&#44; 27 &quot;And he that overcometh&#44; and keepeth My works unto the end&#44;tohim will I give powerover the nations: Andhe shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:even as I received of My Father.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Psa. 2:9 &quot;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&apos;s vessel.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Here we see Christ ruling with the rod of iron. It is said that Rev. 12 has to be Christ because they believe He is the only one that is ruling with the rod of iron. The Overcomer has this promise of being given this power to rule the nations with a rod of iron.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The devil will try to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; as soon as he is born&#44; but the &quot;Man-Child&quot; will be &quot;&hellip;caught up unto God&#44; and to His throne.&quot; This is the promise to the Overcomer.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 3:21 &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne&#44; even as I also overcame&#44; and am set down with My Father in His throne.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The dragon&apos;s desire is to devour the &quot;Man-Child&quot; who is destined to &quot;&hellip;rule all the nations with a rod of iron&hellip;&quot; that the dragon has ruled over. All satanic activities are carried out under the ambitious motive to rule and to be worshipped. Does the devil know he will lose this place?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>When this objective failed&#44; he attacked the Woman.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Second Objective is to Devour the &quot;Woman&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12:13 &quot;And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth&#44; he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>In the Gospel according to St. Luke&#44; Jesus spoke of the great and awful signs of the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation Hour.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Lk. 21:12 &quot;But before all these&#44; they shall lay their hands on you&#44; and persecute you&#44; delivering you up to the synagogues&#44; and into prisons&#44; being brought before kings and rulers for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Basileus&quot; &mdash; &quot;King&quot; &mdash; a sovereign &mdash; ruler &mdash; dictator (kings are not presidents)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Several years ago the Lord showed me in a dream that the Church was going to go through &quot;Great Persecution.&quot; The Church is persecuted for three-and-a-half years to bring her to a place of separation from the world and complete dedication to the Lord.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12:6 &quot;And the woman fled into the wilderness&#44; where she hath a place prepared of God&#44; that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.&quot; (Three-and-a-half years)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 12:15 &quot;And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood (false doctrine) after the woman&#44; that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood (false doctrine).&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>When this failed&#44; he attacked the &quot;remnant of her seed.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Third Objective is to Destroy the Seed</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12:17 &quot;And the dragon was wroth with the woman&#44; and went to make war with the remnant of her seed&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The &quot;remnant of her seed&quot; is the saints that are left after the Rapture of the Church&#44; which takes place in the middle of the Tribulation Hour. These saints find themselves facing the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. They are represented by the foolish virgins that neglected their experience. They will have to wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb&#44; and will come out of Great Tribulation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 7:9 &quot;After this (the sealing of the 144&#44;000 Jews) I beheld&#44; and&#44; lo&#44; a great multitude&#44; which no man could number&#44; of all nations&#44; and kindreds&#44; and people&#44; and tongues&#44; stood before the throne&#44; and before the Lamb&#44; clothed with white robes&#44; and palms in their hands;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 7:13&#44; 14 &quot;And one of the elders answered&#44; saying unto me&#44; What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him&#44; Sir&#44; thou knowest. And he said to me&#44; These are they which came out of Great Tribulation&#44; and have washed their robes&#44; and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Destiny of the Dragon</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Cast out of Heaven</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 12:8 &quot;&hellip;Neither was their place found any more in heaven.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out&#44; that old serpent&#44; called the devil&#44; and satan&#44; which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth&#44; and his angels were cast out with him.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The devil&apos;s place was not left empty&#44; but was found no more. The &quot;Man-Child&quot; now occupies that place.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Bound in the Bottomless Pit</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 20:1&mdash;3 &quot;And I saw an angel come down from heaven&#44; having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon&#44; that old serpent&#44; which is the devil&#44; and satan&#44; and bound him a thousand years&#44; And cast him into the bottomless pit&#44; and shut him up&#44; and set a seal upon him&#44; that he should deceive the nations no more&#44; till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Loosed a Little Season</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The dragon will be loosed for a short season. He goes forth and deceives many nations.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 20:3 &quot;&hellip;And after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 20:7&#44; 8 &quot;And when the thousand years are expired&#44; satan shall be loosed out of his prison&#44; And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth&#44; Gog and Magog&#44; to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Cast Ultimately into the Lake of Fire</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The dragon will eventually be cast into the lake of fire&#44; where he shall be tormented forever&#44; and forever.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 20:10 &quot;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone&#44; where the beast and the false prophet are&#44; and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='blockquote'><eng>&quot;And there was war in Heaven&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Some that are of a skeptical mind&#44; ridicule the idea of a literal war&#44; and are astonished that reasonable men should believe in such an event&#44; and pass it off as mere fiction.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Others believe that it is a mere poetical and exaggerated account of certain moral conflicts in the history of the Church on earth.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Others believe the Dragon to mean the Pagan Roman Empire; Michael&#44; the Christian Roman Empire; Heaven&#44; the throne of the Roman Emperors; and the war in Heaven&#44; the conflicts between the Pagan and Christian Roman Emperors.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Also&#44; some teach that we are not to believe that this was an actual event&#44; but a sort of a summary of the prolonged battle between good and evil.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Remember that this is a divinely inspired revelation&#44; and it states&#44; &quot;And there was war in Heaven:&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This is a literal war in heaven.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There have been many battles&#44; but this is war. The last great conflict when the devil is cast out of heaven. There was a battle in Eden when the devil deceived man and he lost his position with God. There was a battle in hell when Christ fought and won redemption for man. He has&#44; &quot;the keys of hell and of death.&quot; This is not a battle but a war&#44; where man&#44; with the help of Michael and his angels&#44; lay claim to the fullness of redemption&#44; and overcome the devil and gain the rights to the throne.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There are battles going on in the physical world in many different places. This is a spiritual war that will take place in the heavens.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>&quot;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb&#44; and by the Word of their testimony.&quot; It is the war of believing saints&#44; supported by angels&#44; against a malignant and hellish intellect inflamed with desperate hate and anger.

<text class='h1'><eng>The Seed of the Woman&#44;12:17</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 12: 17 &quot;And the dragon was wroth with the woman&#44; and went to make war with the remnant of her seed&#44; which keep the commandments of God&#44; and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Completely defeated in his attempt to destroy the Woman&#44; the wrath and rage of the dragon was not satisfied&#44; but now burned more fiercely. Compelled to cease from his attempt to destroy the Woman because she has been raptured away out of his reach&#44; the dragon now turns to make war with the remnant of her seed.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Remnant of Her Seed</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Defeated beyond remedy in his attack on the Church (the Woman) the dragon changes his focus and enters into a war with theconvertsof the Church&#44; &quot;&hellip;the remnant of her seed.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;The remnant of her seed&quot;means the children of the &quot;Woman.&quot; This &quot;remnant&quot; is the born again believers (the family of God). The&quot;remnant&quot;is that which remains &mdash; that which is left out of the whole &mdash; that which is left from the Rapture of the Church.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Some believe &quot;the remnant&quot; to be two classes of people &mdash; the Jews and the Gentiles. Remember&#44; the Jews are not the seed of the Woman. In fact&#44; they are very much opposed to the Church and to the New Testament teaching that Jesus is God manifested in the flesh&#44; and that He is their Jewish Messiah.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Remnant Identified</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The &quot;&hellip;remnant of her seed&hellip;&quot; are the true believers in Christ who are left after the Rapture of the Church. These held fast the confession of their faith in Christ Jesus and are a separated people from the prevailing abomination of that time. Notice&#44; now there is a definite distinction between the masses who confess Christ and those who&quot;&hellip;keep the commandments of God.&quot;(Rev. 12: 17)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Matt. 7:21&mdash;23 &quot;Not every one that saith unto Me&#44; Lord&#44; Lord&#44; shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day&#44; Lord&#44; Lord&#44; have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them&#44; I never knew you: depart from Me&#44; ye that work iniquity.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Remnant Defined</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The&quot;&hellip;remnant of her seed&hellip;&quot;is the saved; it is not the Church (the Woman). The baptism of the Spirit is required to be in the Church (His Body). The remnant had not been baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ (His Church; the Woman).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
I Cor. 12:13 &quot;For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body&#44; whether we be Jews or Gentiles&#44; whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Paul makes it very plain in Eph. 1:22&#44; 23 that the Church is His body.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
&quot;And hath put all things under His feet&#44; and gave Him to be the head over all things to the Church&#44; Which is His body&#44; the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Either these were never baptized or they had allowed their experience to go dry. Like the five foolish virgins&#44; theywerevirgins&#44; but they had allowed the oil to go dry.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Matt. 25:7&mdash;10 &quot;Then all those virgins arose&#44; and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise&#44; Give us of your oil; forourlampsaregoneout. But the wise answered&#44; saying&#44; Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell&#44; and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy&#44; the Bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with Him to themarriage(feast): and the door was shut.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h1'><eng>The War Against Her Seed</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Defeated in his attack on the &quot;Man-Child&quot; (the Overcomers)&#44; and then defeated in his attack on the &quot;Woman&quot; (the Church)&#44; the dragon changes his focus and enters into a deadly war with the converts of the &quot;Woman&#44;&quot; &quot;her seed.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Means the Dragon Uses in This War</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>The Anti-christ</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The anti-christ will be the head of the one world government.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 13:7 &quot;And it was given unto him to make war with the saints&#44; and to overcome them&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>The False Religion</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The false religion is the system&#44; which is practiced by the false prophet&#44; bringing all the denominations of the world into one church. This one-world church will be government-controlled and government sponsored and headed up by the false prophet&#44; who causes all to worship the &quot;beast.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 13:11&mdash;15 &quot;And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb&#44; and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him&#44; and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast&#44; whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders&#44; so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men&#44; And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth&#44; that they should make an image to the beast&#44; which had the wound by a sword&#44; and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast&#44; that the image of the beast should both speak&#44; and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>The Economy</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A government-controlled one world monetary system will be introduced. No one will be able to buy or sell unless they fit into the government-controlled system and receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead. There will not be a money exchange system&#44; as we know it. There will be a transfer of credits through the computers&#44; and without the mark you will not be able to transact business. This will force many to receive the mark.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 13:16&#44; 17 &quot;And he causeth all&#44; both small and great&#44; rich and poor&#44; free and bond&#44; to receive a mark in their right hand&#44; or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell&#44; save he that had the mark&#44; or the name of the beast&#44; or the number of his name.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 16:2 &quot;And the first went&#44; and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast&#44; and upon them which worshipped his image.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 19:20 &quot;And the beast was taken&#44; and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him&#44; with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast&#44;andthemthat worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The Effects of the War</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>Great Tribulation</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Megas Thlipsis&quot; &mdash; &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; &mdash; exceeding great affliction &mdash; to suffer affliction &mdash; primarily means a pressuring</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Great Tribulation indicates a definite period of time&#44; which was spoken of by the Lord&#44; which precedes His Second Advent. The Second Advent is the &quot;Epiphany&#44;&quot; the revelation of Christ coming back to take over the kingdoms of this world. This is not the secret coming in the air where He raptures the Church.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Matt. 24:29&#44; 30 &quot;Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened&#44; and the moon shall not give her light&#44; and the stars shall fall from heaven&#44; and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn&#44; and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The believers will be greatly persecuted.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Matt. 24:21 &quot;For then shall be great tribulation&#44; such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time&#44; no&#44; nor ever shall be.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 2:22 &quot;Behold&#44; I will cast her into a bed&#44; and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation&#44; except they repent of their deeds.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 3:10 &quot;Because thou hast kept the Word of My patience&#44; I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation&#44; which shall come upon all the world&#44; to try them that dwell upon the earth.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Saints Overcome</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 13:7 &quot;And it was given unto him to make war with the saints&#44; and to overcome them&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>The &quot;Man-Child&quot; (the Overcomers) overcame the dragon.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 12:11 &quot;&hellip;They overcame him&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>&quot;The Woman&quot; (the Church) escaped the dragon&apos;s attacks by a great miracle. However&#44; these saints that were left behind during the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation are attacked and overcome by the dragon&apos;s murderous assaults. Permission was &quot;given&quot; (Rev. 13: 7) to the dragon and to the false-christ to make war with the saints and to overcome them. These saints are not Jews only&#44; for the Scripture says&#44; &quot;over all kindreds&#44; and tongues&#44; and nations.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 7:9 &quot;&hellip;Of all nations&#44; and kindreds&#44; and people&#44; and tongues.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>Many Martyrs</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Many of the saints that are left behind and go into the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; will give their lives as martyrs&#44; because they refused to give up their faith in Christ Jesus the Lord.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Matt. 24:9 &quot;Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted&#44; and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Jn. 16:2 &quot;They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea&#44; the time cometh&#44; that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 6:9&mdash;11 &quot;And when He had opened the fifth seal&#44; I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God&#44; and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice&#44; saying&#44; How long&#44; O Lord&#44; holy and true&#44; dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them&#44; that they should rest yet for a little season&#44; until their fellowservants also and their brethren&#44; that should be killed as they were&#44; should be fulfilled.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 7:9&mdash;14 &quot;After this I beheld&#44; and&#44; lo&#44; a great multitude&#44; which no man could number&#44; of all nations&#44; and kindreds&#44; and people&#44; and tongues&#44; stood before the Throne&#44; and before the Lamb&#44; clothed with white robes&#44; and palms in their hands; And cried with a loud voice&#44; saying&#44; Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the Throne&#44; and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the Throne&#44; and about the elders and the four beasts&#44; and fell before the Throne on their faces&#44; and worshipped God&#44; Saying&#44; Amen: Blessing&#44; and glory&#44; and wisdom&#44; and thanksgiving&#44; and honour&#44; and power&#44; and might&#44; be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the elders answered&#44; saying unto me&#44; What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him&#44; Sir&#44; thou knowest. And he said to me&#44; These are they which came out of great tribulation&#44; and have washed their robes&#44; and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 14:12&#44; 13 &quot;Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God&#44; and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me&#44; Write&#44; Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea&#44; saith the Spirit&#44; that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h3'><eng>The Martyrs&apos; Reward</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
Rev. 7:15&mdash;17 &quot;Therefore are they before the Throne of God&#44; and serve Him day and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shallhunger no more&#44; neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them&#44; nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them&#44; and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

	<text class='h1'><eng>FURTHER NOTES on Revelation 12</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>
These notes are pages 13 to 17 of the printed document I found. It obviously is missing the 1st 12 pages. I do not know where they&apos;re from. Other than they belong to grandpa.
</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Sun-Clothed Woman&#44; continued.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&hellip; And we have seen all the way through from Pentecost right on down through to this very hour. The Church is been existing&#44; militant&#44; and prosperous. The devil would come along and say the Church is never really accomplish too much. Brothers and sisters&#44; I&apos;m sure in the record of heaven you are going to find a different thing altogether. God keeps good books. The Church tonight has been insulted. It&apos;s been attacked. It&apos;s been put through the fire and burned at the stake. You read of the early disciples. Every one of them right on down through gave their lives. All was beheaded&#44; but the Church went on. They crucified Peter upside down&#44; but the Church 1st&#44; because it wasn&apos;t Peter&apos;s Church. Jesus said&#44; &quot;I will build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&quot; Brother&#44; God himself is building the Church and&#44; the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&#44; even though the devil would try to come against it with every devilish thing that he can. He&apos;s tried to attack it from every side. He&apos;s tried to attack that which the Church is been built upon&#44; the rock of revelation. Jesus said&#44; &quot;I&apos;m going to build my Church.&quot; What is it that causes you to stand in your heavenly position are sick heavenly places? What is it that carries you above the power of darkness? It is the revelation of the word; the revelation of Jesus Christ. He has built his Church on revelation&#44; and against this Church the gates of hell shall not prevail.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>he is not just building a church in the same time&#44; he has built it. The church is still in existence even though maybe as far as denominations and man&apos;s organization within the framework of the church&#44; we become disgusted with what we see. Yes&#44; God has a church tonight. Look at Ephesians 1:19 to 2###I think this is one of the most thrilling things that the Holy Spirit has come toward the believer.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Ephesians 1:19 to 23--And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe&#44; according to the working of his mighty power.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>we want the Lord to do great things in us. We want to see great things done. We say&#44; &quot;oh Lord&#44; can you do great things for us?&quot; The word of the Lord gives the answer. The Lord already has done great things.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us for which he rot in Christ&#44; when he raised him from the bed&#44; and set him at his own right hand and the heavenly places&#44; far above all principality&#44; empower&#44; and might&#44; and dominion&#44; and every name that is named&#44; not only in this world&#44; but also in that which is to come: and that for all things under his feet&#44; and gave them to be the head over all things to the church&#44; which is his body&#44;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>what is the church tonight? The body of Christ and he has put all things under his&#44; we are his body. We are more than conquerors in the church tonight is more than a comical. The &quot;moon is under her feet.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>now&#44; going into the last part of the verse&#44; &quot;upon her head a crown of 12 stars.&quot; There are a lot of folks that will say that these are the 12 apostles. Time to Ephesians 2:19 to 20.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Ephesians 2:19&#44; 20 &quot;Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints&#44; and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets&#44; Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Also you will find that in the new city Jerusalem the stones will have the names of the 12 apostles recorded on them. Now then&#44; the foundation stone sound to me a whole lot different than stars on a crown. I cannot fathom how foundation stones can be interpreted for 12 stars in a crown. The crown here has to do with the kingdom. The moment you think about a crown&#44; you think about royalty&#44; somebody was been crowned. Therefore there must be a kingdom&#44; and when you have a crown or kingdom have old and authority and government. Also&#44; a crown speaks of reward. Isn&apos;t this all true? Now when you begin to think of this in the light of Scripture and John already seen this one crowned&#44; before the child is produced; then we look for someone in the Scripture was already entered into a crown position&#44; was enrolled&#44; was now governing. Now it&apos;s got to be in connection with the church because we just proved from the Scripture that the church is referred to here. But now it doesn&apos;t say upon her feet were upon her shoulder&#44; but &quot;upon her head a crown of 12 stars.&quot; Isn&apos;t it that what it says? Now look at Ephesians 1:22</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Ephesians 1:22 &quot;that he is the head of the church</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Again look in Ephesians 5:23</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Ephesians 5:23 &quot;Christ is the head of the church.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>so then&#44; we are seeing something of a body composed of Jesus Christ the head and the great body of his people making up the body of the church. Now where is Christ tonight? Where is his position? Is he on the earth? He is in the place of authority. Isn&apos;t that right? He&apos;s already entered into the kingdom. He is an rulership tonight. He&apos;s already been crowned. 12 had to do with heavenly perfection. I&apos;m sure it must have some significance&#44; probably having to do with the greatness of the Lord. I&apos;m sure it is something more than the fact that it speaks about 12 apostles. It has something to do with the office and function and the reward of the Lord Jesus Christ. He learned obedience to the things he suffered&#44; and he became the capital of our salvation and was made perfect by these things. He brings 5:8; Hebrews 2:10.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This is his earthly life that we are talking about&#44; and Jesus received a reward for this. He has already entered and and he is already crowned the King of kings and Lord of Lords.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>one other thought with this: because he is the head of the church is part of his body&#44; therefore he being the king&#44; we must then also share in his rule and authority.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>I Peter 2:9 &quot;but ye are a chosen generation&#44; a royal priesthood&#44; and a holy nation&#44; a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;royal priesthood&hellip;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Revelation 1:6 &quot; And hath made us kings&#44; and priests unto God and his father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>this is just the 1st step of the lesson&#44; just trying to establish in your mind with this woman is. It&apos;s the church in a militant position&#44; with the Lord Jesus Christ&#44; and close relationship with them.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>there is a cry and a travail in the church to bring forth a company of over commerce&#44; the people that will live according to the truth of God&#44; out of the church&#44; out of this militant body.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>you and I know tonight that the church is in a state different from what it was when it started at Pentecost. When Pentecost came over when the church started&#44; it was like a young birds and going out to wrestling fight over common to conquer. But now it as she has come to the end of the age&#44; it&apos;s a woman over grown and developed&#44; producing something by the spirit of God. She has become weakened and in pain and agony&#44; ready to be delivered. This is the state of the church tonight because she is getting ready to bring forth. Why do you think we&apos;re living in an age when the Holy Ghost is being poured out in the manner in which it is? You know what happens to woman in the last phases are stages of being with child? As the last days&#44;&#44; she becomes greatly enlarged. This is what you see here&#44; a woman enlarged and in pain ready to be delivered. I believe that we are living in a time when the Holy Ghost and the church has leaped over the denominational barriers. We put them up&#44; God didn&apos;t. The Holy Ghost isn&apos;t breathing men today bringing them into something&#44; that he might bring out of them the most wonderful thing that has happened since the dawn of creation&#44; which is a manchild that is going to shake loose creation itself; and manifestation of sons of God in these last days. Romans 8:19 &quot; 23.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>this is not going to be the whole church itself. The church will go into the tribulation hour just like this revelation declares.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>there is a people that is going to come out and &quot;escape all these things&#44;&quot; &quot;and stand before the Son of Man.&quot; Luke 21:3###You say what you want to&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h1'><eng>The Vision of the Beast</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 13:1 &quot;And I stood upon the sand of the sea&#44; and saw a beast rise up out of the sea&#44; having seven heads and ten horns&#44; and upon his horns ten crowns&#44; and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The first part of the verse goes along with chapter twelve (&quot;And he stood&quot;).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Then we commence the new thought&quot;And I saw&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>John is seeing in the spirit this vision of&quot;The Beast&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Location It Came From:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>No particular place or people. &quot;A beast rise up out of the sea&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Sea has to do with nations&#44; and peoples (Rev. 17:15).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The fact it &quot;rose up&quot;&#44; came into power.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='h2'><eng>The description of &quot;The Beast&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Having Seven Heads&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev. 17:9-10says&#44; &quot;The seven heads are seven mountains &hellip; And &hellip; there are seven kings&quot;. Mountains in the scriptures&#44; we are made to understand&#44; are kingdoms (Psa. 30:7 - Jer. 51:25 - Dan. 2:25). </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Therefore these are seven kingdoms &mdash; seven world ruling powers. This is a full revelation of &quot;The Times of The Gentiles&quot;&#44; from beginning to end. Who are these Seven Kingdoms? History makes it plain who they are:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Assyria Egypt Babylon Persia Greece Rome </eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>And here we have the final kingdom; the kingdom of the anti-Christ.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>In the 17th chapter we read:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>&quot;&hellip;Five Are Fallen&hellip;&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Assyria Egypt Babylon Persia Greece</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>At this particular time John is beholding this scene&#44; there has been five fallen.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;&hellip;And One Is&hellip;&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Again&#44; there was &quot;one&quot; in power at the time of John&apos;s vision &mdash; there is no question as to what kingdom it was. The Roman Empire was still in rule and power at that time.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>&quot;&hellip;And the other is not yet come&hellip;&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>That is&#44; the anti-Christ has not yet set up his kingdom. He is the seventh kingdom and he must continue a &quot;short space&quot;.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>He comes on the scene during the first part of the Tribulation and then in the middle of the tribulation he is slain with the Sword&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>and resurrected to life to be the eighth which is of the seventh.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Rev 17:11: &quot;And the beast that was&#44; and is not&#44; even he is the eighth&#44; and is of the seven&#44; and goeth into perdition&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;&hellip;And Ten Horns&hellip;&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>Dan. 7:24: &quot;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 17:12: &quot;And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>These are not a description of the previous kings&#44; but are the ten kings&#44; the ruling powers&#44; which will rise up after the Roman Empire.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This is in agreement with Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream&#44; and Daniel&apos;s vision.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Nebuchadnezzar saw a Great Image broken up into</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Four Sections</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>and finally divided into ten toes.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Babylon: the head</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Persia: the shoulders and breast</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Greece: the belly and thighs</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rome: the thighs and legs and feet&#44; then the ten toes; the ten horns of John&apos;s vision</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Daniel&apos;s vision was four wild beasts.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A lion</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A bear</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A leopard</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>An indescribable beast; and coming out of this beast were ten horns</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>(Dan. 7:7)</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;And it had ten horns&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Comparing to the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream and the ten horns of John&apos;s vision.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>However we see something in Daniels vision that is not seen in either Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream or John&apos;s vision.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;There came up among them another little horn.&quot;:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>John sees:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The beast itself being the &quot;Little Horn&quot; that comes up among the ten.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>However Daniel sees:</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There were three of the &quot;First Horns plucked up by the roots.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This would indicate that Daniel saw a more advanced stage than what John declares.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>John saw ten horns in the 17th chapter of Revelations. This indicates that he saw them before any of them were plucked up.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Furthermore at this stage they have not received their Kingdom (Rev. 17:12).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The fact that John saw ten horns in the 17th Chapter of Revelations indicating the he saw them before any of them were plucked up&hellip;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Declares</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>&quot;And the other that has not yet come&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>At the time that John was seeing that the anti-Christ &quot;had not yet come&quot; into power&#44; was possibly just before or at&#44; the beginning of the Tribulation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Which received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.&quot; The first part of the Tribulation hour.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='blockquote'><eng>&quot;And Upon His Horns Ten Crowns&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>They have now received their crowns and John sees the time of the ten kings reigning with the anti-Christ during the first part of the Tribulation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>For after this John sees the seventh head wounded and resurrected.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>However John makes no more mention of the ten kings&#44; but Daniel declares that three of them fall before the anti-Christ when he is resurrected from death.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>&quot;Another Beast&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 13:11-</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot; &apos;I beheld another beast&apos; coming out of the earth;&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A beast in prophecy represents a &quot;kingdom&quot; (Dan. 7:23).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>This is a kingdom -</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;coming out of the earth&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;A beast coming out of the &apos;sea&apos; &quot; is representative in prophecy as such rising amid &quot;many peoples and multitudes&quot;&#44; a highly populated area (Rev. 17:15).</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;The waters which thou sawest &#44;&hellip; are peoples&#44; and multitudes&#44; and nations&#44; and tongues&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>To come out of the &quot;earth&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Earth: country&#44; ground-land.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>A nation springing up out of the &quot;Earth&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Instead of overthrowing other powers to establish itself&#44; this nation would rise in territory previously unoccupied.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Yet it is a &quot;beast&quot; &mdash; it has a beast nature.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;Therion&quot; &mdash; a wild beast &mdash; a dangerous animal.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Our country sprang up from the ground. It has been said by a prominent author&hellip; &quot;Like a silent seed we grew into an empire&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;And he had two horns like a lamb&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Horns are representative of a ruler</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Dan. 7:24 &quot;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;He (the beast- the nation) had two horns&quot; The constitution was set up in such a way that the state was sovereign and also the Church was sovereign.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The lamb-like horns indicated something of a spiritual nature.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The Founding Fathers &mdash; Spiritual leaders in Government as well as in the Church. George Washington was a praying man. This nation was at least lamb-like in nature in its foundation.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>&quot;And he spake as a dragon&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Speaking as a &quot;dragon&quot; is indicating there is a change in policy</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The lamb-like horns and then the voice of a dragon indicate a real change in character and in policy.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Our civil and religious freedoms are fast being taken away.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Notice in verses 12-18</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>The dragon is beginning to speak.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Slowly our government is becoming a dictatorship instead of a free democracy - a government by the people - of the people - for the people. We are headed to a New World Order.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Ministers across the land&#44; in an effort to stop national destruction&#44; have moved millions of Christians to political action. The feeling is that something must be done. Leaders of the &quot;Electronic Church&quot; launched a campaign to arise 50 million Christians.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Pat Robertson said: &quot;Unless Christians desire a nation and a world&#44; reordered to the humanistic/ hedonistic (pleasure is the good) model&#44; it is absolutely vital that we take control&#44; of the U.S. government&#44; away from the Trilateral Commission and the Council of Foreign Relations.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>I am afraid it is too little&#44; too late.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>We need to be preparing ourselves to get out. We failed as a people to occupy till he comes.</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>Why Is He Called The Beast In Revelations?</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>What Is The Sign Of His Coming?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>There will be a falling away in the Church.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Who Will Be Deceived?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 13:8 &mdash; &quot;And all that dwelt upon the earth shall worship him&#44; whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>

<text class='p'><eng>What Will Be The Final Outcome Of The Man Of Sin?</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Rev. 19:20 &mdash; &quot;And the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him&#44; with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast&#44; and worshiped his image.

<text class='h2'><eng>Direct Orders Concerning This Revelation Rev 22:10</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>&quot;Seal not the sayings of The Prophecy of this book.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>Dan 8:26 12:4&#44;9 Daniel was told to seal up the book. John is told not to seal the book.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>From the beginning John was directed to write what he saw and heard&#44; and to make it known to the Churches. Rev 1:11&#44; 19 Prophetical messages to each church. Rev 2:1&#44; 8&#44; 12&#44; 18&#44; 3:1&#44; 7&#44; 14.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h3'><eng>&quot;Seal up.&quot;</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>In Chapter 10 he was about to write. The Seven Thunders He was to seal this up &mdash; But the rest he was not to Seal. He was to record them. He was to make them known. He was to publish them to the Churches. These things where written both by Command and Revelation of God.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='p'><eng>See the stress, Urgency, Importance. This Book is very important to us.</eng><swa/></text>
<text class='h2'><eng>The Effects of This Revelation &mdash;</eng><swa/></text>
