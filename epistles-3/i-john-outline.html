<h1>I John Outline</h1>
<h2>Introduction 1:1-4</h2> <p>John begins this letter without introducing himself. Quite likely he was so familiar to his audience that he needed no introduction. He begins by saying that he was a personal witness of the &quot;Word of life&quot; (Jesus Christ), that he had personally heard Him, saw Him and handled Him. He declares this &quot;eternal life&quot; to them that they may have fellowship with him and that their joy may be full.</p> 


<h2>Fellowship with God 1:5 to 2:28</h2> <p>Here, John gives the evidence of those who truly have fellowship with God:</p>
<h3>They walk in the light (1:5-7)</h3> <p>There are many false teachers who twist the scriptures and deceive many, but our conduct ultimately proves whether we live in the truth of God&apos;s Word and have the Spirit of God.</p>
<h3>They repent upon the awareness of sin (1:9)</h3> <p>They will not tolerate sin in their lives or treat it lightly, but will deal with it upon discovery.</p>
<h3>To be like Christ and obedient to His Word (2:2-6)</h3> <p>If we have fellowship with God, we will be an imitator and revealer of Christ and live a life of obedience to His Word as He was obedient to the Word of the Father.</p>
<h3>They love the brethren (2:7-11)</h3> <p>They will keep this commandment that was given in the beginning and has been renewed up through the years.</p>
<h3>They have no love for the world (2:12-17)</h3> <p>They will hate the spirit of this world and sin which is the enemy of that Life that resides within them.</p>
<h3>They have pure doctrine (2:18-28)</h3> <p>There are many false teachers with the spirit of antichrist, but those who have fellowship with God need not be led astray by the subtle and plausible arguments of those who promote error for they have the Spirit to lead them into all truth.</p> 


<h2>Divine Sonship 2:29 to 3:24</h2> <p>Here, John gives the evidence of those who have divine sonship:</p>
<h3>A righteous walk (2:29 to 3:10)</h3> <p>The Christian is to show an absolute antagonism to sin because:</p>
<h4>His divine sonship and the desire to become like Jesus (2:29 to 3:1-3)</h4>
<h4>Sin is the transgression of the law of God – i.e. rebellion against God. (3:4)</h4>
<h4>Because of Christ&apos;s character and His atoning work for us. (v. 5-7)</h4>
<h4>Because of the diabolical nature of sin. (v. 8)</h4>
<h4>Because of the godly nature of the Christian life. (v. 9)</h4>
<h4>Because the final test as to whether we are children of God or children of the devil lies in our actions. (v. 10)</h4>
<h3>Love for the brethren (3:11-18)</h3> 


<h2>The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error 4:1-6</h2>
<h3>The appeal v. 1</h3> <p>No matter how &quot;right&quot; a teacher, prophet etc may seem, his words are to be tested.</p>
<h3>The test vs. 2,3,6</h3> 
<p>Those who confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh are of God. Those who are not of God and bear a false and deceiving spirit will claim to speak for God and to present divine truth, but not by Jesus Christ. They do not glorify Him and confess that Jesus Christ, as God, came to this earth and lived as a man.</p>
<p>Also they will not hear those whom God has sent and who speak the truth.  They speak of the world and the world hears them.  John 15:19 / I John 3:12, 13.</p>
<p>See also III John 1:11 (By their works you will know them, whether they do good or evil.) Mt 7:16, 20
</p>
<h4>By their confession (words)       I John 4:2, 3, 5 / II John 1:7</h4>
<h4>By whether or not they hear those whom God has sent       I John 4:6</h4>
<h4>By their works       Matt 7:16, 20 / II John 1:9 / III John 1:11</h4>
<h4>By who hears them         John 15:19 / I John 3:12, 13 / 4:5</h4>


<h3>The conflict v. 4</h3> <p>It is evident that these believers had encountered these false teachers, but had held to the truth.</p>
<h3>4. The contrast vs. 5-6</h3> <p>Godly men attract men who are similar in love and devotion to God. False teachers and men who are of the spirit of this world also attract those who are similar in spirit.</p>
