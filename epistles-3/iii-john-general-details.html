<h2>General Details</h2>
<h3>Who it was written to:</h3> <p>John sent this short letter to Gaius, a member of a local church to whom John had sent teachers.</p>
<h3>Why written:</h3> <p>To commend Gaius for receiving the teachers he had sent and who were entirely dependent on the hospitality of believers and to denounce Diotrepnes inhospitable and tyrannical actions.</p> <p>The reason John wrote this letter, judging from its contents, seems to be as follows: John had sent a group of teachers with letters of commendation to the various churches, one of which was the assembly to which Gaius and Diotrephes belonged. Diotrephes was in position of leadership of this church and because he &quot;loveth to have the preeminence among them&quot; (v. 9) would not show hospitality to these teachers. What&apos;s more, he would excommunicate any member of his church who would receive them. Gaius, a member of his church, refused to be intimidated and received these teachers who later reported his kindness to John. It seems that John was about to send these teachers out a second time (v. 6) and exhorts Gaius to continue his ministry of love to them. John apparently wrote a letter of remonstrance to Diotrephes, but was ignored. In response to this, John expressed his intention of paying a personal visit to this church and of deposing this ecclesiastical tyrant.</p>
