<h1>Jude Outline</h1>

<h2>Introduction 1-2</h2> <p>The author of this letter is believed to be Jude, the brother of James and the half brother of Jesus. Mark 6:3 Jude begins this letter with a fairly formal introduction of himself calling himself by name and identifying himself as, &quot;the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James&quot;.</p> 


<h2>Warnings against the false 3-16</h2> <p>At first, Jude had intended to write to them concerning &quot;the common salvation&quot;, but because of the presence of false teachers, he had felt the need to warn them to contend for the truths of the Gospel v. 3-4.</p> <p>Jude illustrates the doom of such teachers by giving three examples from the Old Testament, namely His own people that believed not, the angels that kept not their first estate and Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them (v. 5-7). These men who continually gave themselves to their own sinful desires were guilty of fleshly sin and of rebellion against authority (v. 8) and spoke of authority in terms that Michael the archangel did not dare to use in addressing Satan (v. 9). These speak evil of things they do not understand and in the things they do understand by mere natural instinct, in these things they defile themselves (v. 10). Scripture (v. 11) and nature (vs. 12-13) prefigure their sin and their doom. These are the ones that Enoch prophesied of (v. 14-15). Jude describes these men as men who grumble and complain, who are not content with their lot in life, men who go after their own desires and are controlled by their passions, they are boastful and arrogant and show admiration for men&apos;s persons and pay people flattering compliments to gain advantage. They create divisions, are utterly fleshly (carnal) and do not have the Spirit of Christ (vs. 16-19).</p> 


<h2>Admonition and conclusion 17-25</h2> <p>Jude reminds the believers of the words of apostles in the past who had warned them of such men and admonishes them to build themselves up in the faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, continue in God&apos;s love, ever looking to Jesus (vs. 20-21). Their attitude toward those in error is they should have compassion on the weak ones who have wavered and others they are to save by great effort, but always watchful lest they should be defiled with the filthy garments of tainted doctrine and sensual living (vs. 22-23).</p> <p>Jude concludes by praising Him who is able to keep the believer from falling into apostasy and sin and who is able to present him blameless before His presence (vs. 24-25).</p>
