<h2>A brief summary of each chapter</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3> <p>We must live our lives in obedience to the Word of God (truth, &quot;light&quot;) that our faith be not a mere profession and that we may have fellowship with the Father, the Son and with each other.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3> <p>Sin not. Keep His commandments. The proof or evidence that we know Him, that we are &quot;in Him&quot; is that we keep His commandments and love our brother. Love not the world. We have an unction or anointing that teaches us the truth and keeps us from error. Abide in Him.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3> <p>We are sons of God. We shall be like Him. Those who are sons of God and desire to be like Him, must purify themselves as He is pure. Jesus came that He might take away our sins. If we belong to God, we will love our brother and will not live under sin. If we are of the devil, we will sin. Believe on Jesus Christ and love your brother, not only in word, but also in deed.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3> <p>Try the spirits. Those that are of God will love the truth and confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. Love one another. As He is, so are we in this world. If we love God, we will also love each other. Evidences that we are in Him:</p>
<h4>We will have the love of God and manifest it toward one another. (v. 7-8)</h4>
<h4>We have received of the Spirit (v.13)</h4>
<h4>We will confess that Jesus is the Son of God (v. 15)</h4>
<h4>We will &quot;dwell in love&quot; (v. 16)</h4> <p>Perfect love:</p>
<h4>Gives us boldness in the day of judgment (v. 17)</h4>
<h4>Removes all fear (v. 18)</h4>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3> <p>If we believe that Jesus is the Christ, we are born of God. We know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep His commandments. This is the love of God that we keep His commandments. Those who are born of God overcome the world by faith. The Spirit is truth. There are three that bear record in heaven . . . and these three are one. There are three that bear witness in earth . . . and these three agree in one. The witness of God is greater than the witness of men. We that believe have this witness in us. If we ask anything according to His will, He hears us and if He hears us, we have what we ask for. There is a sin not unto death. All unrighteousness is sin. He that is born of God keeps himself and does not sin.</p>
