<h1>The Sounding of The Fifth Trumpet - Rev. 9:1-11</h1>
<p>The fifth trumpet is different in character from the preceding four. All are blasts of judgment, and all belong to the "Great Day of the Lord." Thus far, the trumpets have blown only for the objects of physical nature, and wrought their effects through disturbances in the material world. But the trumpet now before us goes beyond the physical world and calls into action quite other agencies. The doors of separation between the earth and the prison of evil spirits are opened.</p>
