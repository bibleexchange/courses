## Addressed To the Ministers

> Revelation 2:1--Unto the angel of the church&hellip;

Angel means messenger, Rev. 22:8-9

> Revelation 22:8--And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

#### They are a part of the Church, I Cor. 12:28
> I Cor. 12:28--And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

> Philippians 2:25,29--Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: [dear; more honorable]
> I Thessalonians 5:12-13-- And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.

### It Is A Revelation of Ministerial Protection
> Revelation 2:1--...He that holdeth the seven stars...
#### Keeps for Himself, John 10:27-28
> John 10:27-28-- My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
#### Keeps from the Enemy, II Tim. 4:16-18
> 2 Timothy 4:16-18--At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. 17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

### It Is A Revelation of Ministerial Authority

#### It is delegated authority, Luke 9:1

## Directed To The Churches
> Revelation 2:1--...Who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks...
### Seven is the number of completeness
#### To the whole Church
#### To the whole Age
### Seven Gentile churches
#### No letter for the church at Jerusalem
#### He will have a Gentile bride
### Seven churches Paul wrote to
#### Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians
#### Personal letters to Timothy, Titus and Philemon
#### Believe to have written Hebrews to the people
### Seven letters John wrote to the Seven Churches
#### Ephesus,Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea
#### He wrote the Gospel of John, the three Epistles and Revelation, Not addressed to the churches as such
### Seven distinct parts in each letter
#### An address -- "Unto the church in..."
#### A citation -- "These things saith He..."
#### A statement of knowledge -- "I Know thy works"
#### A description of moral status -- "Thou art..."
#### A personal application to the individual -- "he that hath an ear..."
#### A command -- "Remember", "Repent" etc.
#### A promise -- "To him that overcometh will I..."
### Out of the seven, Christ finds fault with five
#### One of these He finds nothing to commend (Laodicea)
#### Two alone pass inspection (Pergamos and Philadelphia)
Pergamos--thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith. Philadelphia--hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
Yet they are in contact with elements which He condemns
