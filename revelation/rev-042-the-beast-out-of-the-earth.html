<h1>Another Beast (13:11-18)</h1>

<blockquote>Rev. 13:11&mdash;And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</blockquote>

<p>John said &quot;I beheld another beast&quot;. In the exact same sense that John saw the first beast, he sees also a second beast. Whatever reasoning is used to understand the first beast must also be applied to the second beast. Both beasts (though they are different) are <em>seen</em> by John in the same setting.</p>

<p>The secular empire that will overwhelm the world will not work alone. The extant of the first beast&apos;s success can largely be attributed to the presence and work of another beast.</p>

<h2>Description of the Second Beast</h2>

<h3>Another</h3>
<img src='/assets/revelation/two-beasts-relationship.png' id='two-beasts-relationship'>
<p>This beast is addition to the first beast and rises up <strong>after</strong> the first beast. By great deception, he will advertise and promote the beast which came &quot;before him&quot; The relationship of these two beasts has often been compared to the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist. This other beast will be a prominent promoter of the Anti-christ. This second beast will be instrumental in the deception of the Anti-christ.</p>

<h3>Beast</h3>

<p>Like the first, the second is a dangerous, wild and even venomous beast (empire). Standing on the shore, John saw a tremendously evil influence rise out of the earth. Despite having some characteristics of a lamb, there is no confusion here&mdash;this is an evil thing in rebellion against God and His order. </p>

<h3>Coming Out of the Earth</h3>

<p>Though a beast (empire) it&apos;s realm is of a different nature than the first beast. Key to understanding the second beast is noticing its source. This beast&apos;s origin can be compared with the first beast&apos;s. The first rises out of the sea of humanity and through a succession of rising and falling empires, but the second comes from out of earth.</p>

<p>At a crucial and vulnerable time when all humanity is an unsettled and tempestuous sea crying for answers and clarity comes from out of the &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;land&quot; (stable, settled, authoritative) something whose appearance and whose voice validates the authority of the first beast. The second beast&apos;s message is &quot;Have no fear, this is the <em>right</em> path!&quot;. Coming from a seemingly neutral and stable perspective and wielding supernatural ability, the world will conclude: &quot;It must be ok, the <em>voice of reason</em> said it was.</p>

<h3>Two horns like a Lamb</h3>

<p>Horns are representative of a ruler.</p>
<blockquote>Daniel 7:24&mdash;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings</blockquote>

<img src='/assets/revelation/philomena.jpg' id='philomena'>

<p>The lamb-like horns indicate something of a spiritual nature. This second beast completes the depth of the world system of evil. The Dragon empowers the first beast with a secular empire and the second beast validates and completes this empire with its own spiritual or religious empire. Here is something that appears in part <em>lamb-like</em> but has the nature of a wild and venomous beast.</p>

<blockquote>Mt 23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</blockquote>

<h2>Actions of the Second Beast</h2>

<h3>Spoke as a Dragon</h3>

<p>The lamb-like horns and then the voice of a dragon indicate a real change in character and in policy. For example, laws that were promoted as protections for religious liberty today could be used to accomplish the opposite! The beginning will be applauded for the sake of the &quot;greater good&quot;, but will not manifest in a utopia but in great terror. </p>

<blockquote class="quote">Slowly our government is becoming a dictatorship instead of a free democracy - a government by the people - of the people - for the people. We are headed to a New World Order. We failed as a people to occupy till He comes. We need to be preparing ourselves to get out.&mdash;Rev. James Reynolds, Sr.</blockquote>

<p>The Second Beast is actually the mouthpiece of the Dragon, so truly, the Dragon is speaking. Even now, the Dragon is already speaking. Herein is an warning to KNOW the voice of God! The only security in this age of deception is a vibrant relationship with Christ and familiarity with His voice. By knowing the TRUE you can spot the FALSE a long ways off.</p>

<h3>Exercised the Power of the First Beast</h3>
<blockquote>vs. 12a&mdash;And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,&hellip;</blockquote>
 
 <p>The Greek word (poieo) for <em>exerciseth</em> is a very common word in the New Testament. It is used at least 519 times and in the book of Revelation is also translated as: <em>do, bring forth, make, cause, commit, continue, fulfil, wrought, bare</em> and <em>work</em>.</p>
 <p>The Greek word (exousia) for <em>power</em> means <em>mastery, strength, right</em> or <em>authority to rule</em>. To the second beast will be delegated the power of authority that belongs to the first beast. The first beast will have the both the ability and right to act as it does in the same sense a king acts sovereignly within his kingdom. The second beast will have the same ability and authority because it will be delegated to him by the first beast.</p>
 
 <blockquote>vs. 12b&mdash;&hellip;and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</blockquote>
 
 <h3>Performs Great Miracles (Sets the Hook)</h3>
 
<p>Among other unexplainable and miraculous feats, he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. It is by the means of these miracles that he deceives those that dwell on the earth. (Galatians 1:8) This miracle power does come from God, but comes from the beast. A union or pact has been made between these beasts as we see the first beast delegating power and authority and the second beast returns loyalty and validation to the first beast.</p>

<h3>Teaches a Blasphemous Gospel (Reels them in.)</h3>
 
 <p>The first beast is wounded, and then raised, and incarnated by the devil. The second beast teaches that the world should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. He tells them that the miracle of resurrection now proves beyond all doubt that this is not just a good leader, but this beast is a god to be worshipped!</p>
 
 <h3>Murders in the Name of God</h3>
 
<p>And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>
 
 <h3>Mark &amp; Number of Apostasy</h3>
<blockquote>Revelation 13:16,17&mdash;And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</blockquote>

<p>The Mark Of The Beast will be instituted by the false prophet.</p>
