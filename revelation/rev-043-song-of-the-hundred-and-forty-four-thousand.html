<h1>Song of the Hundred and Forty-Four Thousand (Revelation 14:1-5)</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Revelation 13 concludes with a gloomy tale of a reign of darkness. In Chapter 13 we read of two terrible beasts and their great deception against those who would receive the Beast&apos;s mark. Chapter 14 opens with a glorious scene featuring firstly the Lamb and secondly 144,000 redeemed souls who were marked, but it was God the Father's name on their forehead! We find the details surrounding the Song of this 144,000 in Revelation 14:1-5.</p>
<h2>The Lamb on Mount Sion (vs. 1)</h2>
<blockquote>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion,</blockquote>
<h3>The Lamb</h3>
<p>The &quot;Lamb&quot; appears in 27 verses throughout Revelation and His identity cannot be mistaken!</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 5:6&mdash;And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood <strong>a Lamb</strong> as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote> John 1:29&mdash;The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</blockquote>
<h4>Was Slain</h4>
<p>the Lamb that was slain
unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
the wrath of the Lamb:
made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p>
<h4>Standing in the midst of the Throne</h4>
<blockquote>Revelation 22:3&mdash;And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</blockquote>
<h5>And the four beasts, and the elders (5:6)</h5>
<h5>With the Sealed Book [WAS slain!] (5:8; 6:1)</h5>
<h5>With Wrath (6:16)</h5>
<h5>With an Innumerable Multitude worshipping before Him (7:9)</h5>
<h5>Feeding and Leading the Innumerable Multitude (7:17)</h5>
<h5>Overcoming those that Make War with Him (17:14)</h5>
<h5>Marrying His Bride (19:7; 21:9)</h5>
<h5>As the Temple (21:22)</h5>
<h5>As the Light (21:23)</h5>
<h5>Having a Book of Life (21:27)</h5>
<h5>Having a Pure River of Water Proceeding out of His Throne (22:1)</h5>
<h3>Standing on Mount Sion</h3>
<blockquote>Psalm 87&mdash;His foundation is in the holy mountains.  2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.  4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.  5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.  6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.</blockquote>
<p>Matthew 21:5 and John 12:15 say to Tell the daughter of Sion that her King is coming to her! Hebrews 12:22 says the Believer has not come to a smoking and burning physical mountain that cannot be touched but unto Mount Sion the City of the Living God.</p>
<blockquote>Hebrews 12:22&mdash;But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;zion&quot; expresses ideas of strength and permanence such as a fortress, monument, or landmark.</p>
<p>Zion is called both the city of David (1 Kings 8:1; 1 Chronicles 11:5; 2 Chronicles 5:2) and the city of God. The fortress was considered so impenetrable they mocked David saying he would not be able to take fortress even with blind and lamb sentries on guard. David captured the Jebusite fortress in 2 Samuel 5:7:</p>
<blockquote>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</blockquote>
<p>Mount Zion is also the highest and southernmost mount of Jerusalem, rising about twenty-five hundred feet above the Mediterranean, but Scripture emphasizes Mount Zion more as a Spiritual concept and less as a physical place. Mount Zion is most importantly understood as the people of God.</p>
<blockquote>Psalm 48:2&mdash;Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.  13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.</blockquote>
<h2>The 144,000 (vs. 1-2)</h2>
<p>and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</p>
<p>2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p>
<h2>A New Song (vs. 3-5)</h2>
<blockquote>3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</blockquote>
