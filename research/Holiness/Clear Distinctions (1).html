The Believer&rsquo;s life must be distinctive and unquestionable. To be borderline, lukewarm, or to compromise with the oppressive majority negatively affects our spiritual experience with God. This world is not our home and our choices are affected in every situation by that fact.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;	</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Heb 11:13:</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="csFA67760E" style="tab-stops:right 72pt left 360pt;"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;These all died in faith, not having received the promises, </span></p><p class="csFA67760E" style="tab-stops:right 72pt left 360pt;"><span class="csC382D2BB">but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them,</span></p><p class="csFA67760E" style="tab-stops:right 72pt left 360pt;"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;and embraced them, and confessed </span><span class="cs54A12280">that they were strangers</span></p><p class="csFA67760E" style="tab-stops:right 72pt left 360pt;"><span class="cs54A12280">&nbsp;and pilgrims on the earth.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Absolute and clear distinctions of conduct, truth, and responsibility are our defense against compromise, which always ends in &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; (We never win the sinner by our compromise, but only fall to his level. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Lu 6:39</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> If we are to help the lost, we must be in a position to help where we ourselves safe/saved.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If there are questionable and weak areas in our convictions, we will be tested in those areas, and if our faith can be shaken it will be shaken. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hebrews 12:27</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(Such a shaking that </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">only</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> those things that CANNOT be shaken will remain.)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As we are lights to a dark and dieing world, our lives must be of power and must sound a clear message. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">1Corinthians 14:8</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">What a Believer may allow or do in moderation or in careful balance the sinners that watch our lives will carry to extremes. If the Believer&rsquo;s true ultimate goal is to make Heaven his home and to bring as many as he possibly can with him, every decision in his life must be preceded by the question, &ldquo;Am I moving on, or stepping back by this choice?&rdquo; If a person were to follow tightly the edge of a mountainous precipice, ONE misstep means death. A believer with a heart sensitive to the will of God and that is truly concerned about the eternal welfare of those around him pays no attention to the majority pressure, but will abstain even from just the &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; of evil (I Thessalonians 5:22) that he may in no case cause his Lord shame.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Can a Believer sin </span><span class="csC382D2BB">moderately</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">? Can a Believer disregard clear distinctions of sin? Absolutely not. If something is defined as sin and an abomination unto God the Believer may take no part in it.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How are clear distinctions of truth, principles, and convictions to be made? </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">John 17:17</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> It is the TRUTH that sanctifies us, sets us apart.

The spirit of this world is to fight for no distinctions; they rage this war under the guise of &ldquo;equality.&rdquo; For example, the homosexual community does not honestly seek equal rights, but special rights. Men and women are not &ldquo;equal&rdquo; (the same) in respect to the details of their existence. &ldquo;Men are from Mars and women are from Venus,&rdquo; is acceptable philosophy throughout the secular world. Peter expresses some of these distinct differences in his first letter:</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1Pe 3:1 &para; Likewise, ye </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
