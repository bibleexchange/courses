Men and women are not &ldquo;equal&rdquo; (the same) in respect to the details of their existence. &ldquo;Men are from Mars and women are from Venus,&rdquo; is an acceptable philosophy throughout the secular world.

For the sake of preserving their popularity they remained neutral on many important issues, but this has resulted in a generation overwhelmed by people who are totally in the dark and confused about the practical things of Christian living. Just as the people of Israel did not possess their land until Joshua in his old age clearly defined each tribe&rsquo;s inheritance, the Christian&rsquo;s practical life must also be clearly defined.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Ezekiel 22:25-26</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</span></p><p class="cs7CA40804"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs7939122D">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is an earthly wisdom that is of no spiritual benefit and there are spirits in this world driving people into confusion. In light of these two facts it is apparent that the Believer more than ever before must rely on the leading of the Holy Ghost. In these last days the very elect might even be deceived. We must keep our guard up in constant vigilance against the persistent bombardment of this world and their father, the devil, to bring the church to more and more compromise. </span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1Corinthians 2:1-16</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &para; And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man&#39;s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: </span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;5 </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;6 &para; Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;10 </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;12 </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; </span><span class="csA657E9A2">that we might know</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> the things that are freely given to us of God.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&#39;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;14 </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</span></p><p class="csC8883595"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?

Worldly woman dress in such a fashion to purposely attract the lustful attention of men, (luring, seductive) these motives are absolutely impure and non-Christian. Your motives maybe to dress more comfortably, but can a Christian be comfortable practicing the same methods as the world? No matter what your motive may be, wearing slacks automatically creates a pre-programmed response from the lust driven men of this world. Slacks on a woman present a temptation that tests even good men who must respond with their eyes cast down. Would you knowingly dress in such a fashion that would cause a good man with a pure heart to have to turn his eyes away from you?</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For the larger part of American History slacks were always considered male apparel. A close friend of mine has a Sears&rsquo;s catalogue from the early 1960&rsquo;s and in the 4 inch catalogue only one page is devoted to what you could even consider &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s slacks.&rdquo; On the page is several &ldquo;riding knickers&rdquo; for horseback riding. (That is a secular catalogue guided by the purpose to appease the general public by selling whatever it is the public seems to want to buy.)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	In America&rsquo;s Christian beginning slacks on women were absolutely unheard of. The guiding principles that these people lived by are permanent and unchanging, but what has changed and will continue to change are the fads and fashions of the world. People&rsquo;s definitions of men&rsquo;s clothing and woman&rsquo;s clothing are constantly changing, but we must also remember the world as a whole is becoming more and more evil in their imaginations. Their evil imaginations are displayed in their provocative, immodest, and gender-crossing clothing designs.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">	The world is of a different spirit than the Christian; therefore, the Christian ought not to follow the world in their fad chasing.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Is it a compromise with sin for a Christian woman to wear slacks?
