The bad news is there&#39;s only one of you. It&#39;s time to take the plunge and hire some help. There are many good sources of information about finding the right people, writing job descriptions, interviewing candidates, and managing people once they are on board. While those are all important issues, understanding your regulatory requirements as an employer is crucial to the success of your business. This guide lays out ten easy steps for new employers to follow to ensure compliance with key federal and state regulations.</span></p><h2 class="cs5F75281B">
			<span class="cs48C35B0F">Step 1: Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN)</span></h2>
		<p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">Before hiring employees, you need to get an employment identification number (EIN) form the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The EIN is often referred to as an Employer Tax ID or as Form SS-4. The EIN is necessary for reporting taxes and other documents to the IRS. In addition, the EIN is necessary when reporting information about your employees to state agencies.

		<p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">The IRS states that you must keep <a class="cs45C1A964" href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98548,00.html" title="Employment Tax Recordkeeping"><span class="cs3707C82">records of employment taxes</span></a></span><span class="cs1D89FD78"> for at least four years. Also, keep good records for your business to help you monitor the progress of your business, prepare your financial statements, identify source of receipts, keep track of deductible expenses, prepare your tax returns, and support items reported on tax returns.</span></p><h3 class="csDA01F764">
			<span class="cs489B9A2F">Federal Income Tax Withholding (Form W-4)</span></h3>
		<p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">Every employee must provide an employer with a signed withholding exemption certificate (Form W-4) on or before the date of employment. The employer must then submit Form W-4 to the IRS to ensure. For specific information on employer responsibilities regarding withholding of federal taxes, read the IRS&#39; <a class="cs45C1A964" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf" title="(circular e), employer's tax guide"><span class="cs3707C82">Employer&#39;s Tax Guide</span></a></span><span class="cs1D89FD78">.</span></p><h3 class="csDA01F764">
			<span class="cs489B9A2F">Federal Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2)</span></h3>
		<p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">On an annual basis, employers must report to the federal government wages paid and taxes withheld for each employee. This report is filed using Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. Employers must complete a Form W-2 for each employee to whom they pay a salary, wage, or other compensation.</span></p><p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">Employers must send Copy A of Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) to the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the last day of February (or last day of March if you file electronically) to report the wages and taxes of your employees for the previous calendar year. In addition, employers should send copies of Form W-2 to their employees by January 31 of the year following the reporting period.</span></p><p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">Visit the Social Security Administration&#39;s <a class="cs45C1A964" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/employer/erii2b.htm" title="Employer W-2 Filing Instructions &amp; Information"><span class="cs3707C82">Employer W-2 Filing Instructions and Information</span></a></span><span class="cs1D89FD78"> for further guidance and assistance.</span></p><h3 class="csDA01F764">

			<span class="cs48C35B0F">Step 3: Employee Eligibility Verification (Form I-9)</span></h2>
		<p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">Federal law requires employers to verify an employee&#39;s eligibility to work in the United States. Within three days of hire employers must complete an Employment Eligibility Verification Form, commonly referred to as an I-9 form, and by examining acceptable forms of documentation supplied by the employee, confirm the employee&#39;s citizenship or eligibility to work in the United States. Employers can only request documentation specified on the I-9 form. Employers who ask for other types of documentation not listed on the I-9 form may be subject to discrimination lawsuits. </span></p><p class="cs5F75281B"><span class="cs1D89FD78">Employers do not file the I-9 with the federal government. Rather, an employer is required to keep an I-9 form on file for 3 years after the date of hire or 1 year after the date the employee&#39;s employment is terminated, whichever is later. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency conducts routine workplace audits to ensure that employers are properly completing and retaining I-9 forms, and that employee information on I-9 forms matches government records.</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
