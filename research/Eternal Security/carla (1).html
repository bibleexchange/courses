Suffice it to say, there is a large amount of misinformation in the minds of many, as to what Calvinists actually believe.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">First of all, let me make something as clear as I can. &nbsp;Not everyone who agrees with the teaching of sovereign grace, or TULIP, or the doctrines of grace, is a Calvinist. &nbsp;Oddly, that fact seems to go right over the heads of many. &nbsp;They dont want to listen, they dont want to know facts they&#39;re perfectly comfortable believing what they believe, wrong or not. &nbsp;This article is not for them, this article is for you, the discerning reader, who has a desire to dig a little deeper, and form an educated opinion on what a Calvinist, actually is. You may still disagree with this theology after reading this article, but at least you can do so from an informed perspective.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">Generally, although not accurately, anyone who expresses that they do not believe in the free will of man, and/or that they believe in the Biblical doctrine of election (that God has elected from before the foundation of the world, who would come to Him, not based on their will, but based on His will), or that only those predestined for salvation, will be saved, those people are labeled Calvinists.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csB61B709B">Why?</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">Simple, John Calvin taught these things from Scripture. &nbsp;But this is not all he taught, and he certainly didnt pull these teachings out of left field, or some deluded mindset. &nbsp;These teachings are to be found richly embedded in a golden thread in Scripture, right from Genesis, all the way to Revelation. &nbsp;For a thorough understanding of what John Calvin did teach, I highly recommend getting your hands on a copy of The Institutes of the Christian Religion. &nbsp;At one time, it was the most highly recommended piece of literature in every Protestant church. &nbsp;Your own church library or pastor, might even have a copy of it. &nbsp;If not, you can order it <a class="cs81E09B82" href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?event=AFF&amp;amp;p=1018169&amp;amp;item_no=8166" target="_blank"><span class="csD364B5D6">here</span></a></span><span class="cs5DE65DA"> for a very reasonable price.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">I will first address a couple of the blatantly false statements I heard this morning, and then I will present a simple, point by point (5 of them) summary of what a Calvinist actually believes.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csB61B709B">False Teachings</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">The first, and most ignorant statement I heard today, was that Calvinists believe you are born a Christian, and never need to become born again, or repent, or do anything, because youre already saved.</span><span class="cs99624FC6"> </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">When I first heard this, I was certain I misunderstood. &nbsp;Once I heard it repeated several times, and many (many!) in this chat room agreeing, it was painfully clear I had not misunderstood.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">While I suspect this teaching comes from a very mutilated view of the Biblical doctrine of election, it was still very sad to see that so many who profess Christ, agreeing with the lie, that Calvinists believe or teach this. &nbsp;Many in the room, even many who dont agree with reformed theology, came to the mic to express their concern that this false doctrine alleged to be that of Calvinists, be stopped. &nbsp;It fell largely, on deaf ears.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">The doctrine of election is both simple, and complex, at the same time. &nbsp;For the most basic understanding of it, we have these facts from Scripture:</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">Ephesians 1:1 &para;

Repent, and turn </span><span class="csC9DBCCCC">yourselves</span><span class="cs5DE65DA"> from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. 31 &nbsp;Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 32 &nbsp;For </span><span class="csD364B5D6">I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth</span><span class="cs5DE65DA">, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn </span><span class="csC9DBCCCC">yourselves</span><span class="cs5DE65DA">, and live ye.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">Ezekiel 33: 10 &para; Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins </span><span class="csC9DBCCCC">be</span><span class="cs5DE65DA"> upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? 11 Say unto them, </span><span class="csC9DBCCCC">As</span><span class="cs5DE65DA"> I live, saith the Lord GOD, </span><span class="csD364B5D6">I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</span><span class="cs5DE65DA">; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">While interpretations of these 2 passages vary among many people, the fact remains that God does not delight in, or take some malicious joy, out of the destruction of the wicked. &nbsp;The word pleasure used in both of these passages, is the Hebrew word chaphets, and it literally means to be delighted. &nbsp;While God is just, and His holiness demands justice, I do not believe (nor does any other Calvinist I know) that God receives some kind of twisted joy, in the condemnation of those who love sin, more than they love Him.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">2.The second part of the false statement that is bothersome, is assuming any human being is innocent to begin with.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">Scripture is very clear on this. &nbsp;I could list literally hundreds of passages or verses that tell us ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23) and there is none righteous, no not one (Romans 3:10, Psalm 14:1-3, Psalm 53:1-3). &nbsp;Any human being who ever finds themselves under condemnation, doesnt get there accidentally.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csFC966AA7">With that said, following is brief summary, with Scripture text, to show you what it ACTUALLY is, a Calvinist believes, commonly referred to by the acrostic TULIP. &nbsp;Some of us dont use that phrase, some prefer reformer, or sovereign grace believer.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csB61B709B">Total Depravity</span><span class="csFC966AA7"> </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csFC966AA7">Because of the fall in Adam, man is unable of himself to savingly believe the Gospel. The sinner is spiritually dead, blind, and deaf to the things of God; his heart is deceitful and desperately corrupt. His will is not free but is in bondage to his sinful nature. He is as spiritually dead and estranged from God as are the fallen angels. Therefore he will not, indeed cannot, choose good over evil in the spiritual realm. Consequently it takes regeneration by which the Spirit brings a sinner to Christ - it takes regeneration by which the Spirit brings a sinner from spiritual death to spiritual life and gives him a new nature. Faith is not something man contributes to salvation but is itself a part of God&#39;s gift of Salvation - it is God&#39;s gift to the sinner , not the sinner&#39;s gift to God.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csFC966AA7">Key Verses: John 6:44,</span><span class="csA63DAD61"> </span><span class="cs5DE65DA">Romans 5:6 and 8:7,8, Ephesians 2:1,5, Colossians 2:13, Titus 3:3-5</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csB352E29">Unconditional Election </span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="cs5DE65DA">God&#39;s choice of certain individuals unto salvation, before the foundation of the world, rested soley on His own Sovereign Will. His choice of particular sinners was not based on any foreseen response or obedience on their part, such as faith, repentance, etc. On the contrary, God gives faith and repentance to each individual whom He selected. These acts are the result, not the cause, of God&#39;s choice. Election therefore was not determined by or conditioned upon an virtuous quality or act foreseen in man. Those whom God sovereignly elected He brings through the power of the Spirit to a willing acceptance of Christ. Thus God&#39;s choice of Christ, is the ultimate cause of salvation. </span><span class="csFC966AA7">Key Verses: Romans 9:11 ; 11:5,7 ; 11:28 ; 8:38-39, 1 Thessalonians 1:4, 2 Thessalonians 2:13 ; 14:2, 2 Peter 1:10, </span><span class="cs5DE65DA">Ephesians 1:3-14, 2 Timothy 1:9,10</span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csB61B709B">Limited Atonement </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="cs5DE65DA">Christ&#39;s redeeming work was intended to save the elect only and actually secured salvation for them. his death was a substitutionary endurance of the penalty of sin in the place of certain specified sinners. In addition to putting away the sins of His people, Christ&#39;s redemption secured everything neccessary for their salvation, including faith which unites them to Him. The gift of faith is infallibly applied by the Spirit to all for whom Christ died, thereby guaranteeing their salvation. Key Verses: Matt. 1:21, John 6:37-40 , 10:14-16,26-28 , 15:13-14, Acts 20:28, Heb. 10:14, Rom. 8:31-34, 1 Cor. 8:11, Eph. 5:25-27, 1 John 4:10-11</span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csB61B709B">Irresistible Grace </span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="cs5DE65DA">In addition to the outward general call to salvation which is made to everyone who hears the Gospel, the Holy Spirit extends to the elect a special inward call that inevitably brings them to salvation. The external call (which is made to all without distinction) can be, and often is, rejected, whereas the internal call (which is made only to the elect) cannot be rejected; it always results in conversion. By means of this special call the Spirit irresistible draws sinners to Christ. He is not limited in His work of applying salvation by man&#39;s will, nor is He dependent upon man&#39;s cooperation for success. The Spirit graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ. God&#39;s grace, therefore, is invincible; it never fails to result in the salvation of those to whom it is extended. Key Verses: Eph. 1:19, 20, Ezek. 11:19, I Cor. 4:7, John 17:2, John 5:21,Acts 13:48</span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="csB61B709B">Perserverance Of The Saints</span></p><p class="cs9CFBBBCD"><span class="cs5DE65DA">All who were chosen by God, redeemed by Christ, and given faith by the Spirit are eternally saved. They are kept in faith by the power of Almighty God and thus persevere to the end.
