The links have also been updated.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">On January 15, 2004, famed southern Gospel singer Kirk Talley <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040218213929/http://www.kirk-talley.com/html/news_pages/dear_friends_info.htm"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">disclosed</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> (under alleged threat of extortion) a 30-year struggle with sexual orientation.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">On Feb. 17, Talley described <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040226220510/http://www.kirk-talley.com/html/news_pages/hallelujah_info.htm"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">in detail</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> a sexual/spiritual conversion experience away from homosexuality. The description of the event was, for some critics, a bit reminiscent of an exorcism.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">On March 5, the Rev. Phil Hoskins reported Talley&#39;s &quot;confession of sin, his cleansing, and his deliverance from a thirty-year struggle with homosexuality.&quot; (This page from Talley&#39;s site was not archived.)</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Hoskins, a Tennessee Baptist pastor and friend of Talley, says, &quot;It was one of the most memorable days of my Christian journey and I know that God is preparing Kirk&#39;s heart with a new song and a fresh start to make others aware of the liberating power of Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">In August 2004, Talley announced that he will resume concerts and continue counseling. </span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Canceled concerts, backlogged merchandise and ex-gay counseling expenses have been costing Talley a fortune. All because a bigot (convicted in August) decided to blackmail a southern Gospel singer -- and because many people reacted by <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://www.inthefaith.com/archives/000850.php"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">blaming</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> victim, not perpetrator.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Going forward, can Talley&#39;s restoration team be of assistance? </span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Hoskins&#39; apparent expertise is extremely limited. His only online connections to homosexuality are <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://www.trbc.org/sermons/960721.html"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">two</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> isolated <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:UxqR29J8GqEJ:www.mbcpathway.com/story08.htm+%22phil+hoskins%22+homosexual&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">references</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> to his association with antigay sermons by Jerry Falwell. </span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">More promising: Another key member of Talley&#39;s restoration team is Roy A. Blankenship, a conservative-Christian sexual-addictions counselor who heads a <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://www.pcrmi.com"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">ministry</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> that is affiliated with Exodus.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">By all accounts, the ministry&#39;s <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://www.pcrmi.com/Staff.html"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">staff</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> are sincere, have good intentions, and have served as spiritual inspiration to Talley. </span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Some concerns are worth raising. For one, the restoration staff claim to hold (or be pursuing) master&#39;s degrees, but the degrees appear to be from a mix of unidentified and <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://www.gospelcom.net/bakersguide/accreditation.php"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">unaccredited</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> Bible schools. Other other concerns exist in the form of unanswered questions: </span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Is the goal to achieve change of orientation -- or is it celibacy? Are short- or long-term results being promised? What is the team&#39;s success/failure rate? </span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Talley is entitled to privacy regarding the first two questions, but the third question (in my opinion) is a matter of public accountability, since this team has no doubt treated other people before, and will in the future.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Talley is entitled to prayers and support &mdash; and, as I said, a reasonable degree of privacy. He did not ask to have his sexual struggles dragged before the public. Talley will, in time, choose whether or not to affirm same-gender attraction, and whether or not to opt for celibacy. He already appears to have made some decisions: He does not label himself &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;exgay,&quot; he is simply... Kirk Talley.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">Here is a wise <a class="cs1B4A34A7" href="http://www.averyfineline.com/gospelmusic/sg2.htm"><span class="cs9C8A6D3">blog commentary</span></a></span><span class="cs16EA4F9A"> on the situation from someone far more knowledgeable about southern Gospel music than I.</span></p><p class="cs92E907C1" style="tab-stops:left 432pt;"><span class="cs16EA4F9A">What follows are selected comments from the original discussion that appeared on this page. We had only a few hostile comments, but I&#39;ve pared things down nevertheless. Also, out of concern for Talley&#39;s privacy, I will consider moving this page offline. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
