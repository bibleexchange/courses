Little to my knowledge, he had contacted people all over the country who had agreed to fast and pray on Friday our counseling session.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deacons and men from his church were praying.&nbsp; In the office building where we were, there was a group of Ladies that were praying, LOUDLY!&nbsp; Rev. Larry Lykens entire church were fasting and praying on that day.&nbsp; Thousands were storming the gates of hell on my behalf and I was unaware of it.&nbsp; After Roy had talked to me for several hours, he asked me if I was ready to totally surrender my all to Christ.&nbsp; I said &quot;yes.&quot;&nbsp; He then handed me a cross, asked me to hold it tightly in my hand as he read some scripture.&nbsp; Honestly I don&#39;t remember where he read from, because I was crying and praying myself.&nbsp; But the word of God is powerful and the Holy Spirit was present as he read.&nbsp; For several minutes he read and prayed and read and prayed.&nbsp; Then he asked me to lay in the floor in the same position as Christ was on the cross.&nbsp; I laid down as if I was laying on top of the body of Christ.&nbsp; Roy prayed and read more scripture.&nbsp; I prayed.&nbsp; Phil and Shannon were in the floor praying, I could hear the ladies across the hall crying out to God for my&nbsp;cleansing and healing. I&nbsp;CONFESSED my sins, I FORSOOK my&nbsp;sins and asked Jesus to receive me.&nbsp;Roy asked me to vision in my mind Christ putting his arms around me and holding me.&nbsp; As I cried, I did just that.&nbsp; What a great feeling to have Christ hold me.&nbsp;He asked me to imagine in my mind Christ releasing his arms from around me.&nbsp; All of a sudden in my&nbsp;mind I saw chains and shackles falling to my feet.&nbsp; I could see Christ kicking them away from me. I cried and thanked the Lord for what he was doing.&nbsp; After a few minutes, Roy asked me to turn over on my back.&nbsp; Still holding on to that cross, I turned over.&nbsp; My eyes were swollen, I was emotionally exhausted, totally drained, but free.&nbsp; As I lay on my back, Roy read scripture about LIVING WATER and how it heals and cleanses.&nbsp; I prayed, we all prayed.&nbsp; As I lay there on my back with my eyes closed, Roy began to pour water on my face, in my mouth, on my heart, my hands, my legs, my feet and quote more scripture and pray.&nbsp; When that water hit my mouth, immediately I felt something leave my body.&nbsp; I felt 300 pounds lighter.&nbsp; Lying there with my eyes still closed, I began to see a bright white light&nbsp;shining around me.&nbsp; Hallelujah.&nbsp; I have never experienced anything like this before in my life.&nbsp; This was better than my salvation experience.&nbsp; I raised my hands in praise to him.&nbsp; The ladies across the hall started shouting and praising the lord.&nbsp; What a wonderful experience.&nbsp; I&nbsp;KNOW the demonic oppression left me that instant!&nbsp; At 12:05 PM on Feb 12th, in the floor of the conference room at Higher Ground Baptist Church offices in Kingsport Tennessee, Jesus passed by and set me free! Hallelujah.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">Phil said that he had seen the compassion of Christ as never before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">The first call we made was to Roger and Debra Talley and then to Claude and Connie Hopper.&nbsp; These two couples had been in prayer all morning on their buses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">After lunch, Roy and I talked several more hours about a lot of different things.&nbsp; Roy got a lot of information on my background, all the time he was gathering personality information to know what kind of program of counseling he wanted me to be a part of.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">My original plans were to come back home on Friday evening, but after such an emotional day on Friday, I doubt that I could have held the steering wheel the hour and half trip back home.&nbsp; So I told Phil that I would just spend the night once again with he and his wife and daughter.&nbsp; I went to bed about 6 PM on Friday and woke up on Saturday morning about 7 AM.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">Saturday morning, there was a men&#39;s prayer breakfast scheduled.&nbsp; I hadn&#39;t intended to go. I didn&#39;t have any clean clothes as I had not planned to stay overnight the second night.&nbsp;But Phil knew I needed to be there, so I said &quot;If you can stand the odor, I will go.&quot;&nbsp;Little did I know what was in store for me there!&nbsp; Little did I know that the entire church (3200 people) had been praying for me all week long.&nbsp; When Phil introduced me to the group of men that morning as his &quot;new friend,&quot; they began to shout and clap and stood to their feet and praised the Lord for the miracle that he had done!&nbsp;Phil explained what had happened the day before and told the room of men that it was the second most exciting day in his ministry!&nbsp; He then asked me to come to the front of the room.&nbsp; All the men (approximately 150-175) gathered round me and got down on their knees and prayed like I have never heard men pray before.&nbsp; I knew then why I was supposed to be there!&nbsp;&nbsp;But. . . .My experience wasn&#39;t over.&nbsp; Phil explained a new family life center building plan that the church was starting and he talked about how Greed would not be blessed.&nbsp;There were a few testimonies from various men about tithing, and how their lives were so blessed because they tithed.&nbsp; This really hit home with me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">Since&nbsp;December, I have been very very worried about my&nbsp;finances.&nbsp; First of all let me say, I have no complaints as to how the Lord has blessed me thru the years.&nbsp; I have been very blessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lived good, worked hard and invested money in a lot of business things, hoping one day when I old enough to retire, I would be able to and not have to travel and sing when&nbsp;I was too old to do so.&nbsp; Since I don&#39;t work for a corporation that puts money back for me for retirement, I have had the opportunity to do that myself.&nbsp; My name is on lots of things that require monthly pledges.&nbsp; When I was traveling, I could fund those things, and be comfortable with the financial requirements of traveling and singing and also fund the things that would benefit me in years to come.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">But since I am no longer traveling, I have watched the funds continuously dwindle.&nbsp; I have always prided myself in not being late on payments, always paying my bills on time.&nbsp; In January, I had two good weekends of dates booked, and then a 17 day trip with concerts and church services scheduled every night.&nbsp; Therefore I had ordered a LOT of product to be sent to these dates.&nbsp;All that product had arrived at the office.&nbsp; There was so much of it, that we created new places to stack it at the office.&nbsp; Well, when I had to stop traveling,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;stuck with all this product.&nbsp;About&nbsp;$50,000 dollars worth of CD&#39;s, cassettes, Video&#39;s and DVD&#39;s were sitting in my office that had to be paid for.&nbsp; I told Beth (my secretary) to pay all the bills and see where we were.&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched as the account dwindled.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past&nbsp;few weeks,&nbsp;my mind has been in the state of paranoia.&nbsp;I sold both my car and truck to get rid of some big lease payments.&nbsp; But....I said all of that to say this.&nbsp; Saturday morning as all the men got on their knees and asked&nbsp;God to speak to them about what they needed to give for the building fund for the Family&nbsp;Life Center, I bowed on my knees and cried out to God again and told him, that he could have it all.&nbsp; I gave him my home, my business...my future.&nbsp; I told him that he could take it all if that&#39;s what needed to happen.&nbsp; All that mattered&nbsp;to me was that I was whole.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/><br/>I have a long road ahead of me as far as restoration.&nbsp; I am going to take 6 months off (with the exception of March 21 in Roanoke, VA) to drown myself in studies and a strengthening, spiritual and emotional restoration process.&nbsp;I will be visiting Roy Blankenship in Georgia once a week as part of my restoration.&nbsp; I have many books to read and&nbsp;many hours to be spent in prayer and study.&nbsp;So I am going to ask your assistance in allowing me the time to do so.&nbsp; For the past few weeks, I have only had time to read and respond to thousands of email.&nbsp; I need to free up some time to study, so I am going to ask you not to email me for a while.&nbsp; I won&#39;t be making many posts or newsletter for&nbsp;a while.&nbsp; Please respect my need to be quiet.&nbsp; I love hearing from people but please pray for me and ask God to allow me some space and time during this restoration process.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">The&nbsp;team of pastors that are going to be my accountable partners and walk with me through this time include:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">Dr.&nbsp;Phil Hoskins-Higher Ground Baptist Church -Senior Pastor<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">Dr.&nbsp;Shannon Salyer-Higher Ground Baptist Church, Minister of Pastoral Care<br/>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA16174BA">Rev.
