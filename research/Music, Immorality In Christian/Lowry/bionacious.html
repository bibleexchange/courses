And it looks like the greatest racemixer in American history was also one of its biggest fags. There&rsquo;s a new book due out in March from Free Press that says the Log Cabin Republicans are right-<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/49/news-ireland.php"><span class="cs93865101">Dishonest Abe was a homo</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many of Tripp&rsquo;s findings come from finely argued circumstantial deductions &mdash; which will no doubt be seized upon by what Vidal has called the &ldquo;scholar squirrels&rdquo; of the considerable Lincoln industry, who have a lot of skin in the game. But it will take more than their usual regurgitations of the clich&eacute; about the absence of central heating back in those days to explain Lincoln&rsquo;s consistent, yearslong choice of male bed partners, a same-sex affinity that he acted on even as president.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The late author was an associate of Kinsey, so there&rsquo;s reason for skepticism, but he&rsquo;s far from the only one to assert that Lincoln was a pillowbiter. It&rsquo;s been rumored ever since he was president. Carl Sandburg wrote about it between the lines:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the few traditional Lincolnists to describe (however obliquely) the lifelong Lincoln-Speed relationship as homosexual was the Illinois poet Carl Sandburg, in his masterful, six-volume Lincoln biography. In the tome titled </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Prairie Years </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(1926), Sandburg wrote that both Lincoln and Speed had &ldquo;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">a streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &ldquo;I do not feel my own sorrows more keenly than I do yours,&rdquo; Lincoln wrote Speed in one letter. And again, &ldquo;You know my desire to befriend you is everlasting.&rdquo; In a detailed retelling of the Lincoln-Speed love story &mdash; including the &ldquo;lust at first sight&rdquo; encounter between the two young men, when Lincoln readily accepted Speed&rsquo;s eager invitation to share his narrow bed &mdash; Tripp notes that Speed was the only human being to whom the president ever signed his letters with the unusually tender (for Lincoln) &ldquo;yours forever&rdquo; &mdash; a salutation Lincoln never even used to his wife. Speed himself acknowledged that &ldquo;No two men were ever so intimate.&rdquo; And Tripp credibly describes Lincoln&rsquo;s near nervous breakdown following Speed&rsquo;s decision to end their four-year affair by returning to his native Kentucky.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the preface to his massive biography, Sandburg wrote that &ldquo;month by month in stacks and bundles of facts and legend, I found invisible companionships that surprised me. Perhaps a few of these presences lurk and murmur in this book.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Lincoln shared Speed&rsquo;s bed for four years. Lincoln historians say that this was due more to a lack of funds than anything else, but seems that in four years Abe could&rsquo;ve scrounged up enough money for his own mattress. And surely the cottage that served as Lincoln&rsquo;s summer White House had more than one bed, but even while Abe was president, he invited another man to share his bed while Mary Todd was out of town. Washington insiders were quite shocked at the arrangement:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Tripp&rsquo;s book is remarkable and precedent-shattering because, for the first time, he restores names and faces (more than just Speed&rsquo;s) to a number of those previously invisible homosexual companions and love objects of the most venerated of America&rsquo;s presidents, among them, Henry C. Whitney; the young Billy Greene, a Salem contemporary of Lincoln&rsquo;s and another bedmate (who admired Lincoln&rsquo;s thighs); Nat Grigsby; and A.Y. Ellis.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of them was the handsome David Derickson, by nine years the president&rsquo;s junior, captain of Lincoln&rsquo;s bodyguard Company K, the unit assigned to ensure Lincoln&rsquo;s protection in September 1862. Citing a variety of sources &mdash; including an autobiographical essay by Captain (later Major) Dickerson, Lincoln&rsquo;s letters, contemporary diaries and historical accounts written while many of the witnesses to the Derickson-Lincoln relationship were still living &mdash; Tripp describes in great detail how Derickson was the object of &ldquo;the kinds of gentle and concentrated high-focus attention from Lincoln that [Lincoln&rsquo;s law colleague] Henry C. Whitney, from having himself once been on the receiving end, well described: &lsquo;[It was] as if he wooed me to close intimacy and friendship, a kind of courtship, as indeed it was.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Lincoln&rsquo;s seduction of Dickerson was more than successful. Tripp discovered a forgotten volume of Union Army history, an account of The Pennsylvania Volunteers, Second Regiment, Bucktail Brigade, published in 1895 by Derickson&rsquo;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Chamberlin, who was historian of the Bucktail Survivors Association, and in which he recounted:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Captain Derickson, in particular, advanced so far in the President&rsquo;s confidence and esteem that in Mrs. Lincoln&rsquo;s absence he frequently spent the night at his cottage [at the summer White House], sleeping in the same bed with him, and &mdash; it is said &mdash; making use of his Excellency&rsquo;s night-shirt! Thus began an intimacy that continued unbroken until the following spring, when Captain Derickson was appointed provost marshal of the Nineteenth Pennsylvania District, with headquarters in Meadville.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Dickerson-Lincoln affair was common gossip in Washington&rsquo;s high society, as Tripp notes with a citation from the diary of the wife of Assistant Navy Secretary Gustavus Fox: &ldquo;Tish says, Oh, there is a Bucktail soldier here devoted to the president, drives with him, and when Mrs. L is not home, sleeps with him. What stuff!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Maybe Abe was just very, very lonely, and couldn&rsquo;t bear to be by himself? Well, what about this poem about gay marriage that Tripp says Lincoln wrote as a teenager?</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">I will tell you a Joke about Jewel and Mary</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">It is neither a Joke nor a Story</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">For Rubin and Charles has married two girls</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">But Billy has married a boy</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">The girlies he had tried on every Side</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">But none could he get to agree</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">All was in vain he went home again</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">And since that is married to Natty</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">So Billy and Natty agreed very well</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">And mama&rsquo;s well pleased at the match</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">The egg it is laid but Natty&rsquo;s afraid</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">The Shell is So Soft that it never will hatch</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">But Betsy she said you Cursed bald head</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">My Suitor you never Can be</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">Beside your low crotch [slang for big penis] proclaims you a botch</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csC382D2BB">And that never Can serve for me</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Tripp notes that the stanza beginning &ldquo;The egg it is laid&rdquo; suggests that &ldquo;Abe was well aware of the term &lsquo;jelly baby.&rsquo; Originally from Negro vernacular, the phrase soon came to be used by whites as well: slang denoting what uneducated folk imagined . . . as a &lsquo;pregnancy&rsquo; from homosexual intercourse . . . As a poem, Lincoln&rsquo;s rhyme of course is a mere trifle, except that it is perhaps the most explicit literary reference to actual homosexual relations in 19th-century America &mdash; more explicit certainly than anything Walt Whitman ever wrote about the &lsquo;Love of comrades.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It all seems very, uh, queer. No wonder the Repubs are always going on about the wonders of diversity. Mary Cheney is one of Abe&rsquo;s own jelly babies. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It&rsquo;s just a shame that the black jelly babies <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040922/flw011_1.html"><span class="cs93865101">can&rsquo;t get along </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">with the White jelly babies:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Black Gay Republicans Break with Log Cabin Republicans, Endorse Bush<br/>Wednesday September 22, 9:07 am ET </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">DALLAS, Sept. 22 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; The Abe Lincoln Black Republican Caucus (ALBRC), a group of young urban Black gay Republicans, voted today in a special call meeting in Dallas, Texas, to endorse President Bush for re- election.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The ALBRC was co-founded by Don Sneed, a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, to address the political issues and needs of young Black gay Republicans, who he says: &ldquo;Our voices are never heard, yet we exist and are growing in numbers.&rdquo; The endorsement was fueled by the Log Cabin Republicans&rsquo; refusal to endorse President Bush. &ldquo;We think that the &lsquo;Republican Tent&rsquo; is inclusive and there is room for differences, but one does not pick up their marbles and go home if there are a few points of disagreement,&rdquo; stated Anthony Falls, Republican Precinct Chairman &ndash; Dallas and the ALBRC National Spokesperson. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gosh, ya hate to see that. Can&rsquo;t we all just get along? The black conservative fags and the White conservative fags need to all meditate on RC Sproul Jr&rsquo;s glorious exposition of Galatians 3:28.

Joe Carter says that animalistic Negro &ldquo;music&rdquo; is destroying our culture, and our kids in the process. Says it&rsquo;s even turning our little girls into pimps. And he&rsquo;s right. Every so often, some TV program will do a special on the history of rock and roll. And no documentary is complete without a clip of some old Southern cracker back in the fifties being asked his opinion of this newfangled music, and replying something to the effect that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s just nigger music, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s bad news.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> We should&rsquo;ve obeyed the Fifth Commandment, and listened to the old folks. If you disagree, go over and read <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/000943.html"><span class="cs93865101">the article </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">at Evangelical Outpost. He posts some lyrics from seventeen of these brute beasts, and they&rsquo;re unbelievably disgusting. And these aren&rsquo;t obscure songs-they&rsquo;re all from Billboard&rsquo;s current Top 50. This is the stuff that the Jews are playing for our kids on the TV and radio. And there&rsquo;s no subtlety or euphemism here, and no love or romance; these &ldquo;songs&rdquo; are verbal celebrations of nothing but thrusts and grunts and orifices.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And it&rsquo;s nothing new. Even back in the seventies, Chuck Berry was telling women that he wanted them to &ldquo;play with my ding a ling&quot;. And it isn&rsquo;t just men; Carter&rsquo;s pointing out that our little girls are now becoming animalized from listening to animalistic music, much of it from women themselves.

They claim they want churches to start impacting the culture for Christ, and use the political clout of tens of millions of evangelical Christians to vote &ldquo;pro life pro family&rdquo; types into office. At the same time, they lambast churches that aren&rsquo;t integrated for not embracing diversity. Which is nuts-you can have diversity, or you can have &ldquo;conservatism&quot;, but you can&rsquo;t have both.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">James Dobson is largely responsible for the huge popularity of Promise Keepers. He has promoted it heavily on his radio show for the last dozen or so years. I remember hearing the very first Focus on the Family program about the movement, when Bill McCartney, the worthless excuse of a man and a father who heads up PK, came on to talk about his plans for the organization, before they had held one get together. He talked about the vision &ldquo;God&rdquo; had given him, of 50,000 men coming together in the name of Jesus to hug, cry, confess their sins, and promise to keep their promises, and be better men and fathers, and work to turn this nation back to &ldquo;God&quot;. But, he told Dobson, there was one caveat. If it&rsquo;s 50,000 White men, God won&rsquo;t be there. And Dobson assented to this. That&rsquo;s nice. I guess the deity of Christ means nothing, if it impedes diversity. Jesus said that where two or three are gathered in his name, he&rsquo;d be in the midst of them. So if 50,000 White guys are gathered in his name, we know Christ is there. But Dobson and McCartney assure us that God isn&rsquo;t there. But never mind the details and the hateful orthodox Christian theology; the important thing is race mixing. But it looks like the racemixing part is sort of interfering with the turning the nation back to God part. Thanks largely to &ldquo;diversity&quot;, Republicans are having a harder time campaigning for the evangelical vote, and pastors of multiracial evangelical churches are reluctant to bring up divisive social issues, for fear of being &ldquo;political&quot;, and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/102804C.shtml"><span class="cs93865101">alienating their darker members</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The diversity of viewpoints has made campaigning to evangelical churchgoers more complicated than some GOP strategists initially anticipated. Some churches refused requests to provide member directories to the Bush campaign, fearful of losing their tax-exempt status and alienating members who might not be sympathetic to the president. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;If I become political in any direction, I&rsquo;ll become 50% less effective,&rdquo; said Marc Erickson, pastor of Eastbrook Church in Milwaukee, an inner-city church whose parishioners are white, black, Latino and Asian. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I think that long march through the institutions is going to be a lot longer than originally planned.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/badlands/index.php?p=31#comments"><span class="cs93865101">Comments (2)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h2 class="cs95E872D0">

That&rsquo;s disaster for an incumbent, because, as I&rsquo;ve pointed out previously, undecideds always wind up going heavily for the challenger. Very heavily. And the Bush campaign is speaking more openly about their &ldquo;apprehension&quot;:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;The Republican official said polling for Bush showed him in a weaker position than some published polls have indicated, both nationally and in battlegrounds. In many of the key states, the official said, Bush is below 50 percent, and he is ahead or behind within the margin of sampling error &ndash; a statistical tie.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just no place where they&rsquo;re polling outside the margin of error so they can say, &lsquo;We have this state,&rsquo; &rdquo; the official said. &ldquo;And they know that an incumbent needs to be outside the margin of error.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Karl Rove tries to spin it the best he can:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a close election, but we have a persistent lead&rdquo; in national polls, said Rove, who was wearing a &ldquo;Pennsylvania Victory&rdquo; cap as he traveled with Bush on Saturday. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The only problem for Rove is that it&rsquo;s not a national election. It&rsquo;s 50 separate state elections. And the states which Bush absolutely must win aren&rsquo;t looking too hot:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">GOP officials who talked to Bush-Cheney campaign leaders said the leaders have grown more worried about Ohio, Florida and other key states where Bush lacks a lead with just 10 days until the election. A poll by Ohio University&rsquo;s Scripps Survey Research Center, completed Thursday night, found Kerry leading 49 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, with a margin of error of five percentage points. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57458-2004Oct23.html"><span class="cs93865101">Read it and weep</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, incrementalists.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/badlands/index.php?p=30#comments"><span class="cs93865101">Comments (0)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs95E872D0">

Bush for President, and I urge everyone of you not to vote for him. Why am I changing my position? It&rsquo;s not because of his support of gay marriages under the name of civil unions. Or his broad and wholesale support of the gay rights agenda. Or his repeated claim that Christians worship the same God as pagan Jews and Muslims. Or his declaration that the time isn&rsquo;t right to ban abortion. Or his senseless slaughter of 50,000 Iraqis who were no threat to us whatsoever. No, it&rsquo;s none of those things. As a relevant culture reclaimer, I can live with all of the above. But I&rsquo;ve just now come across information which alleges that our President has engaged in the most vile, disgusting behavior imaginable; a wickedness so despicable that I hesitate to even describe it, and yet I must. There are <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.s5000.com/what_the_huck/610/george_bush_vote.php"><span class="cs93865101">reports</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> that George W.

We first received information regarding this claim as it relates to George Bush last week. A source who claims to be a former acquaintance of George Bush, and spent time with him said, </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t friends now and this was a while back. But I seen some things he said and these ain&rsquo;t right. George said something about doing right for the blacks but I recollect when he calls them nigger and niggers.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Forgive me if I made you ill, but this sort of thing cannot be ignored. I realize that it&rsquo;s an anonymous source, but given the ebonical nature of the quote, who dares doubt it? It is imperative that Judeochristians everywhere know about this, so please spread the word. We must take a firm and uncompromising stand against hate, no matter who the hater is. Urge everyone you know to vote against Bush (and Peroutka, the Nazi), or stay home in protest. The Republican Party must learn that there are some things that are not negotiable. Abortion, gay rights, and polytheism are not among them. But racism most certainly is.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And please send the largest gift you can to CCL. We are working toward the day when every candidate for every office in America will have to answer the question: &ldquo;Have you ever used the N word?&rdquo; Please help us make that day a reality as soon as possible with a generous contribution.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Incrementally yours,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">P.

And it leads, ineluctably, to other perversions. And because Judeochristians have accepted the first perversion, they will come to accept the later ones. Interracial marriage leads to gay marriage. Acceptance of IR marriage leads to acceptance of gay marriage. Justifying <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://mt.ektopos.com/parablemania/archives/000838.html"><span class="cs93865101">your own hideous IR marriage </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">leads you to speculate that it&rsquo;s possible we&rsquo;ll all be faggots in heaven. And digging hip, relevant, interracial Christian bands, leads you to declaring that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; and &ldquo;cool&rdquo; when you hear their music on David Letterman. Even years after their Negro lead singer very publicly announces that he&rsquo;s gay and no longer believes in God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Case in point-King&rsquo;s X. I remember hearing about them years ago. They were THE band to like for hip, relevant Christians not that long ago. They had their Negro lead singer. They were openly Christian, but shunned the CCM label, and said they just wanted to make good music, period. And it wasn&rsquo;t Amy Grant style music for wimps; these dudes rocked out. What wasn&rsquo;t to like for relevant culture reclaimer types? King&rsquo;s X was what it was all about, man. They </span><span class="csC382D2BB">got</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> it. It wasn&rsquo;t about sitting around reading your Bible all day, sheltering your kids, and running around in old fashioned clothes. It was about being out there; interacting with the world where they are, and speaking to them on their terms. They showed you could play at Cornerstone, and still be good enough to make the cover of Rolling Stone. And making the cover of Rolling Stone, for relevant culture reclaimer types, is about the same thing as having a dove rest on your shoulders after you&rsquo;re baptized.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They lost favor with a few of their less relevant Christian fans back in 1998, when Doug Pinnick announced that <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.hwcn.org/~ad825/IFTHEREI.HTM"><span class="cs93865101">he&rsquo;s gay, but he thought God was cool with it</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. A few years later he clarified things- he&rsquo;s been gay the whole time he was in the band, his bandmates always knew and accepted it, and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.sonicgarden.com/sonic-web/news.cfm?newsid=642&amp;newstypeid=5"><span class="cs93865101">he&rsquo;s now an atheist</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So what&rsquo;s a hip, relevant Christian to do when he hears a TV show playing music from a guy who boasts that he enjoys gay butt sex, blasphemes the name of Christ, and says there is no God?

Before the 2000 campaign, she held a job that literally announced her homosexuality: gay and lesbian liaison for Coors, a public marketing assignment that even required her to travel the country with the winner of the 1999 International Mr. Leather competition.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Friends, this ugly insinuation that a man is a homosexual based simply on his cutting edge, culturally relevant (and nowhere forbidden in the Bible) fashion choices is beyond despicable, and is an act of sheer desperation on the part of the secularists. They&rsquo;re implying that International Mr. Leather is a homosexual simply because of the way he dresses, and then tying him to Mary Cheney, who has never made her sexuality an issue of any kind, and then insinuating that because Mary Cheney is her father&rsquo;s campaign manager the Republicans must be hypocrites who have no problem with sodomy except when the Democrats make it a campaign issue. I have never seen such a cheap, tawdry political tactic in my entire life. The liberals should be ashamed of themselves. This attack is indisputable proof that we&rsquo;re taking this culture back, and our incremental progress is driving the secularists to new depths of character assassination in their rage. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Please send the largest gift you can to CCL at once so we can continue our work.

And instead of writing one word in defense of the movie, he actually spent the entire article defending the Christhaters who were attacking Gibson, by claiming that it was liberalism, not Jewry, raising Cain about his film? I replied to him <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://badonicus.blogspot.com/2004/02/jews-murdered-jesus-christ-your-pastor.html"><span class="cs93865101">here</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and not so subtly pointed out that it was Jews, and Jews alone attacking </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Passion</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and they weren&rsquo;t accusing it of conservatism, but anti semitism. And they were attacking the very Gospels in doing so.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Well, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/abbott/041017"><span class="cs93865101">DoorMatt&rsquo;s back</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and he&rsquo;s </span><span class="csC382D2BB">still</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> lying to cover up for his beloved Christ haters. He calls our attention to <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6257067/site/newsweek/"><span class="cs93865101">this article </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">from </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Newsweek</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, which says that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Passion </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">is unlikely to be nominated for Best Picture Oscar. And even </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Newsweek</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is more honest than DoorMatt:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Of the many high-placed studio executives, producers, Oscar strategists, publicists and Academy members interviewed for this story&hellip; all say that a &ldquo;Passion&rdquo; best-picture nod is almost unthinkable. Hollywood, with its Jewish roots, did not experience &ldquo;The Passion&rdquo; as a transcendent religious and emotional event, as so many other viewers did. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;A lot of older Academy voters, who are largely Jewish, refuse to even see this movie,&rdquo; says one Oscar-campaign vet. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a level of animosity toward this film that is very real. When I talk to the members, I hear it over and over and over again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Newsweek </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">lays it right out there-</span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Passion </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">hasn&rsquo;t got a chance at Best Picture, and it hasn&rsquo;t got a chance because Hollywood is Jewish, and Jews hate the movie, and many refuse to even see it. Of course, they don&rsquo;t go into exactly why Jews hate the movie, because </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Newsweek</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is a family publication, and it just wouldn&rsquo;t do to print all that stuff from the Jewish holy book about Jesus Christ <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.preteristarchive.com/Jesus_is_Israel/th_talmud.html"><span class="cs93865101">boiling in hot semen and excrement for all eternity</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But they&rsquo;re still way ahead of Matt C. Abbott. Here&rsquo;s how he explains why Gibson&rsquo;s film is being stonewalled:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Newsweek magazine reports that Mel Gibson&rsquo;s hugely successful film, &lsquo;The Passion of the Christ,&rsquo; is unlikely to get an Oscar nomination for best picture.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This, of course, isn&rsquo;t surprising. Politics, politics, politics. Ah, well. (By the way, does anyone know if John Kerry has seen the film?)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Is that amazing, or what? The article he refers to says it&rsquo;s because of Jews. Abbott lies, and says it&rsquo;s politics, politics, politics. Then, just for good measure, he throws in a jab at Catholic John Kerry, to make the point that it&rsquo;s those pesky liberals, not those pesky Jews, who hate the film. I don&rsquo;t know how he writes this stuff with a straight face. But one thing I do know- seeing that he used to be executive director of the Illinois Right To Life Committee, it&rsquo;s crystal clear why we&rsquo;ve made no progress whatsoever in stopping abortion. And it&rsquo;s no coincidence that this article appears on Alan Keyes&rsquo; website, since Keyes is one of the best friends Christhating Judaism has in its&rsquo; war on Christian civilization. Check out the left side bar, for the list of Keyes&rsquo; &ldquo;Sister Sites&quot;.

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash; Badonicus @ 10:10 pm </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the biggest problems those of us who do battle against the Jewish supremacist hatred of White Christian civilization face is incredulity. And, of course, that&rsquo;s largely due to Jewish media control. For 99% of Americans, Christian or not, TV doesn&rsquo;t inform our worldview; TV </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> our worldview. We watch thousands of hours a year of both subtle and blatant propaganda. The time we spend studying the Bible and history is miniscule in comparison. TV shapes our world. It defines &ldquo;normal&quot;. It defines good and evil, which is why Christians are bent out of shape that Kerry pointed out that Cheney&rsquo;s daughter is a dyke. If, instead of being a dyke, Mary Cheney were straight, and married to David Duke, these same Christians would be demanding that Cheney fire her from his campaign, praising Kerry for his moral courage in confronting Cheney, and urging Christians to vote third party until the Republican Party takes a stand against HATE. We all know this is true. Because Equality is our real religion, we get outraged about &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti semitism&quot;, but we&rsquo;re merely &ldquo;grieved&rdquo; over Cheney&rsquo;s support of his daughters vile perversion. Because that&rsquo;s what TV teaches us is important. And after people hear and see that message tens of thousands of times over decades, they internalize it. Christians see no problem at all with being outraged over &ldquo;sins&rdquo; that are nowhere defined, described, or prohibited in the Bible, while being far more tolerant of sodomy. It&rsquo;s what TV has taught them.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And the flip side of thought control via the Jewish media is what it omits. Go over to Worldmagblog, or ten thousand other internet forums, and tell them how outraged you are that Jews in Israel are spitting on Christians, and have been doing so for years. You&rsquo;ll be called a hater, an anti semite, a Jewhater, a Nazi, and a liar. People will say you made it up, or that some Jewhater made it up, and you fell for it. Post a link from one of Israel&rsquo;s biggest daily papers to <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/487412.html"><span class="cs93865101">prove it</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and no one will apologize for the names they just called you. Some will insist that the paper&rsquo;s mistaken. But everyone will agree that, even if true, it&rsquo;s an isolated incident, those people don&rsquo;t represent real Jews, and only a Jewhater would bring it up. Then show them another story about <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://badonicus.blogspot.com/2004/10/israeli-jews-attack-american.html"><span class="cs93865101">Jews attacking Christians with baseball bats</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/CalgarySun/News/2004/10/10/663376.html"><span class="cs93865101">another one </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">about Jews attacking more Christians with baseball bats. The epithets will increase exponentially; there will be calls to ignore and ban the Nazi Jewhater, because we&rsquo;re all sinners, and you pointing these things out proves you hate Jews, and you&rsquo;re obsessed. Virtually no one will confront the plain facts if they reflect negatively on Jews. That&rsquo;s due in part to dispensationalists and culture reclaimers who teach that Jews are God&rsquo;s Chosen People, but the Jewish media is also largely to blame. Because on TV, Jews are always the vic, never the perp. SIX MILLION of them were killed for absolutely no reason, they&rsquo;ve been persecuted throughout history, all over the globe, for absolutely no reason, and they&rsquo;re surrounded by a billion Arab terrorists who hate them and want to kill them all for absolutely no reason. That&rsquo;s the meme that most people have in their head, and they cannot bring themselves to accept anything that so violently contradicts everything they believe to be true. If Jews were really beating and spitting on Christians, FOX News would talk about it. And they don&rsquo;t, so it can&rsquo;t be true.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And it&rsquo;s crazy to even think something like that could be true, anyway. Because everyone knows that Jews don&rsquo;t hate; they&rsquo;re only hated, everyone knows that there&rsquo;s a worldwide resurgence of anti semitism; the problem is so bad that <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=4040"><span class="cs93865101">the President just signed a bill </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">that Congress passed unanimously to monitor &ldquo;anti semitism&rdquo; all over the world. And they&rsquo;ve all heard about the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=4040"><span class="cs93865101">poor woman in France </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">who was attacked on a train, and had swastikas carved into her belly, because she was thought to be Jewish. Headlines blared the story <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=france+jewish+attack+train&amp;btnG=Google+Search"><span class="cs93865101">all over the world</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Just as headlines blared all over the world a few weeks after that when <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=france+jewish+attack+cemetery&amp;btnG=Search"><span class="cs93865101">a Jewish cemetery was vandalized </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">in France. Of course, when both incidents turned out to be staged, and the alleged victims turned out to be the actual perpretrators, those headlines didn&rsquo;t blare. There weren&rsquo;t any headlines. Those stories appeared in a small paragraph on page 27, if at all.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And that&rsquo;s why we have so much trouble getting a hearing, let alone getting people to believe us. Jews spit on Christians, and beat them with baseball bats, and, thanks to Jewish media control, not one American in ten thousand is aware of it. Phony crimes against Jews in France are headline news worldwide. But have you heard about the very real incident in France recently, where <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=13093"><span class="cs93865101">a gang of Jews terrorized a book signing </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">by an author they didn&rsquo;t approve of?</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In Paris on Sept. 28, two-dozen men armed with clubs and wearing motorcycle helmets stormed the Pays de Cocagne bookshop on the Rue Vieille du Temple to the cries of Isra&euml;l vaincra! (Israel will be victorious.) Six people were slightly injured.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The men disrupted the book-signing event of Alain Soral, the self-proclaimed agitator, anti-feminist, anti-gay, pro-Palestinian philosopher and boxer. The men broke windows, knocked over bookshelves and sent fans of the writer running out the back door of the bookshop into a courtyard, some of them bleeding. Neither Soral nor his bodyguard were hurt in the incident. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Witnesses claimed the attackers had tear-gas bombs and that they got away within minutes before the police arrived. A video of the attack is posted on the French Islamic Web site www.oumma.com. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Soral, who is well known for his anti-Zionist opinions, said he had received death threats after a recent controversial appearance on the television station France 2. In that interview, he said that &ldquo;certain Jews never autocriticize,&rdquo; hinting that Jews always blame others for their woes.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Soral said Sept. 20, &ldquo;If you tell a Frenchman, a Zionist Jew, that maybe some of your problems come from you, that maybe you&rsquo;ve made some mistakes, it&rsquo;s not systematically everybody else&rsquo;s fault if no one can stand you anywhere you go, because really, that&rsquo;s their history [the Jews&rsquo;] for the last 2,500 years. Everywhere they put their feet in, they get kicked out after 50 years &mdash; you have to admit it&rsquo;s bizarre; everybody&rsquo;s always wrong except for them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For his appearance at the book store signing, he had asked for police protection and it was denied.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You can see some video and still photos of the incident <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.oumma.com/article.php3?id_article=1191"><span class="cs93865101">here</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

I&rsquo;m not sure why, but he seems to have<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.visionforum.com/hottopics/blogs/dwp/?archive=/2004_10_01_index.htm"><span class="cs93865101"> removed the post</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. In it, he pointed out that Bush says sodomy is worthy of respect, and that people should be able to live how they want. He also pointed out that Cheney is completely in favor of legalizing gay marriage, and he also said something about a Christian&rsquo;s responsibility to promote good, and resist evil, and that Christians should remember that responsibility on election day. Now Kevin Johson, Andrew Sandlin&rsquo;s good buddy, says that by criticizing Bush and Cheney for promoting sodomy, Doug Phillips is &ldquo;advocating homosexuality&quot;. I kid you not. And Sandlin calls John Kerry despicable&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">From: &ldquo;Kevin Johnson&rdquo;<br/>Date: Sat Oct 16, 2004 11:57 pm<br/>Subject: Kerry Campaign Advocate Doug Phillips</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Senator John Kerry, whatever else he may be, is a smart man. The<br/>people running his campaign now&ndash;the same people that helped<br/>President Clinton get elected&ndash;are at least as smart, probably more<br/>so. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything in a debate with the President of the<br/>United States that he doesn&rsquo;t mean. Talk about the Vice President&rsquo;s<br/>daughter and her &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; were not by accident. Anyone<br/>who thinks they were is just not dealing with the facts of the matter.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I watched just a snippet of the McLaughlin Group flipping channels<br/>the other day (I can only stand so much yelling and talking at the<br/>same time) to hear the liberals on the show take Kerry&rsquo;s side and try<br/>to spin his comments as being offensive only to those who are against<br/>homosexuals and homosexual behavior (as if that made the comments<br/>less problematic). But, I think in at least one sense they were<br/>correct. What Senator Kerry said was offensive and it was meant to<br/>draw votes away from the very group who would be most offended&ndash;the<br/>Christian base of the Republican party. His comments tried to paint<br/>Vice President Cheney and his family as something other than what<br/>conservative Christians in his party know him to be. So too with the<br/>President.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We, as Christians, shouldn&rsquo;t fall for this ploy and most Christians,<br/>I believe haven&rsquo;t. In fact, the fallout from his remarks has caused<br/>quite the problem for the Kerry campaign and time will tell if it<br/>will become even more significant.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are those Christians, though, that have fallen for Senator<br/>Kerry&rsquo;s ploy. You would think by now that we would have learned our<br/>lesson. It is not enough for us to hear talk about how the Republican<br/>Party is taking advantage of Christian voters and the like but the<br/>very same people who keep using this old uninformed and tired line<br/>wind up in the service of Senator Kerry, his campaign, and the<br/>Democratic Party. Take a look at what Doug Phillips penned recently<br/>on his website:</span></p><p class="cs568662F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Across America this week the spin-doctors are spinning. The damage<br/>control experts are looking for some creative tactic to get<br/>Christians to stop thinking about the fact that their born-again<br/>Christian president told fifty million Americans, including untold<br/>millions of young people, that sodomy should be tolerated, that it is<br/>worthy of moral respect, and that homosexuals have every right to<br/>practice their perversion.</span></p><p class="cs568662F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yes, President George Bush endorsed and blessed the idea<br/>that &ldquo;consenting adults [sodomites &ndash; DP] can live the way they want<br/>to live.&rdquo; Though he professes to be a Bible believing Christian, the<br/>president told the American people that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I just don&rsquo;t<br/>know&rdquo; whether or not homosexuality is a choice.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, that there is not one word here about Kerry&rsquo;s<br/>answer or how President Bush just doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to the<br/>immorality that Senator Kerry and his liberal friends, contra<br/>Christianity, would bring to the table on this and several other<br/>issues. No, the person that Doug Phillips and other like-minded<br/>purists must attack is none other than the President and Vice<br/>President of the United States even though clearly both those men are<br/>closer to his own position on the matter than Senator Kerry ever<br/>would be.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And, what are the practical results of Doug Phillips and others who<br/>advocate a conservative third-party candidate contra President Bush?<br/>Votes for Kerry, very simply. That&rsquo;s what Senator Kerry would want,<br/>that&rsquo;s what Doug Phillips is giving him, and that&rsquo;s what attacking<br/>President Bush on homosexuality does&ndash;it gives votes to Senator<br/>Kerry.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So much for standing on principle. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Who&rsquo;s really advocating<br/>homosexuality here? The one who works hard to preserve the identity<br/>of the family through his own presidency contra homosexual and<br/>Democratic critics or the one who gives votes to the wannabe<br/>President that sees homosexuality as a natural condition&ndash;one who<br/>would help open the floodgates of homosexual marriage in this society<br/>and the continued disintegration of the nuclear family?</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I think the answer for Kerry campaign advocate Doug Phillips is<br/>astoundingly clear.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/badlands/index.php?p=12#comments"><span class="cs93865101">Comments (2)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs95E872D0">

The RNC&rsquo;s National Field Director, Dan Gurley, is also openly homosexual. And at the same time, you&rsquo;ve got Judeochristian nut job Tom Coburn, who&rsquo;s running for US Senator from Oklahoma, making ludicrous claims about<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/ElectionsStory.asp?ID=041012_El_A5_Cobur2390_1"><span class="cs93865101"> all the girls in Oklahoma turning queer</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, which he seems to think is a bad thing:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At an Aug. 31 town hall meeting, Coburn said: &ldquo;You know, John Burkeen is our rep down here in the southeast area. He lives in Coalgate and travels out of Atoka. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;He was telling me lesbianism is so rampant in some of the schools in southeast Oklahoma that they&rsquo;ll only let one girl go to the bathroom.

But I have a real hard time believing it&rsquo;s so bad that two girls can&rsquo;t be in the restroom at the same time without going down on each other. The local principal said he had no idea what Coburn was babbling about. But Coburn, his goofy claim notwithstanding, knows very well how it got as bad as it&rsquo;s gotten. The Jewish entertainment media has been promoting lesbianism and bisexuality for the last decade as the hip thing for young women. They&rsquo;ve had the chicks on </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Friends</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> kissing each other, they&rsquo;ve had Madonna and Britney kissing each other, and late night cable is filled with lesbian porno.

So stop asking, as if it&rsquo;s some big mystery, and start telling people the truth. And if you&rsquo;re so upset about our young girls turning queer, which you should be, why don&rsquo;t you say something to the freaks at the top of your ticket who have turned the Republican Party into a veritable gay pride parade? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/badlands/index.php?p=11#comments"><span class="cs93865101">Comments (6)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs95E872D0">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash; Badonicus @ 7:58 pm </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Anyone who knows anything about the Jesus Movement of the 1970&rsquo;s is familiar with the song </span><span class="csC382D2BB">For Those Tears I Died (Come To The Water)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. It ranks right up there with </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Pass It On</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> for sentimental heretical drivel, and like </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Pass It On</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, it became phenomenally popular. The song was so influential that its author has been called &ldquo;the mother of Contemporary Christian Music&quot;. It was written by a sixteen year old girl, and the lyrics betray that, although you could be excused for thinking that an RTS grad wrote this:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And Jesus said come to the water and stand by my side<br/>I know you are thirsty you won&rsquo;t be denied<br/>I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried<br/>And I strove to remind you<br/>That for those tears I died</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The song isn&rsquo;t quite as popular as it once was, because the sixteen year old writer, Marsha Stevens, not long after that, became Marsha Stevens, &ldquo;conservative Christianity&rsquo;s worst nightmare - a Jesus-loving, Bible-believing, God-fearing lesbian Christian.&rdquo; For years she&rsquo;s had her own &ldquo;ministry&quot;-BALM, which stands for Born Again Lesbian Music. Here&rsquo;s <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.balmministries.com/"><span class="cs93865101">her website</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">-be sure to check out the pictures of her and her bride, Cindy. I&rsquo;m not sure if RC Sproul, Jr married them. Maybe, since his perversion of Galatian 3:28 means that once someone&rsquo;s baptized <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/sproul2.html"><span class="cs93865101">they&rsquo;re no longer male or female, but only Christian</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t Doug Wilson, since he only <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.credenda.org/issues/16-2memorandum.php"><span class="cs93865101">recently embraced gay marriage</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But it might have been his colleague, Doug Jones, since <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.reformed.org/webfiles/antithesis/v1n1/ant_v1n1_racism.html"><span class="cs93865101">he wrote almost 15 years ago that </span></a></span><span class="csC382D2BB">&ldquo;the only grounds Scripture gives us for prohibiting a marriage is religious in nature. Believers are not permitted to marry unbelievers&hellip;&rdquo; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Doesn&rsquo;t really matter, because the important thing is not being a hater. Besides the pictures of her wedding, there&rsquo;s other photos, too. Like <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.balmministries.com/images/nyeve2002.jpg"><span class="cs93865101">the one from New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2002</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, featuring her and her bride arm in arm with Bill Gaither and Mark Lowry. Yep, Bill Gaither, the king of gospel music, and Mark Lowry (the queen?), his longtime sidekick.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gaither is wildly popular with evangelical Christians, and brings in millions of dollars a year &ldquo;ministering&rdquo; to them in song. Mark Lowry has made millions from his &ldquo;ministry&quot;, which consists of singing and comedy. I saw him live at Mount Vernon Nazarene College, in Mount Vernon, Ohio, about 10 years ago. My buddy Dilettante had been given some tickets, and I went with him and his family. If you&rsquo;ve never seen and heard Lowry, just think of an even more effeminate Richard Simmons. He&rsquo;s </span><span class="csC382D2BB">that</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> bad. I&rsquo;d never seen him before, nor had Dilettante, and if I recall correctly, after the concert, we were both pretty sure that Lowry had a little sugar in his gas tank. And this Marsha Stevens business only makes me more suspicious.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because this isn&rsquo;t one of those photos where the big shot had no idea who he was posing with, and it comes back to haunt him later, a la <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.prairieghosts.com/gacy.html"><span class="cs93865101">Rosalyn Carter and John Wayne Gacy</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. No, both Gaither and Lowry knew all about Stevens and her faggot &ldquo;ministry&quot;, and not only did they pose with her, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiangays.com/news.shtml"><span class="cs93865101">they also praised Stevens for her work, and condemned those haters </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">who think Christians can&rsquo;t be faggots:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The first person to come up to us was Mark Lowry. He sang with the Gaither Vocal Band for many years and retired recently after he wrote the song &ldquo;Mary Did You Know&quot;, but he&rsquo;d been singing with the group that night. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He said, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re Marsha Stevens!&rdquo; I thought, okay, there&rsquo;s only 6 of us here, they must have told them our names. But </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">he went on to say that he loves the song &ldquo;For Those Tears I Died&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;s proud of what I&rsquo;m doing now.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">I said, &ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m doing now?&rdquo; He answer, &ldquo;I sure do and I wish the fundamentalist would find Jesus. They&rsquo;re going to have a lot to answer for, leaving out people that Jesus died for.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">While I stammered (I am SO dumb around famous people), Bill and Gloria Gaither came over and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Bill said how much he loved my song, and appreciated my ministry today, too.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Gloria thanked me for it. I was not sure Bill knew what he was saying, but we got pictures and it was time to go back out for the rest of the concert. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At about 10 till midnight we thought they would be starting their big finale. But Bill said that he had lost a couple of people very close to him in the past couple of years - his brother and his Mom - and one song had been sung at both funerals . . . a song that has gotten more people than we will ever know through a &ldquo;dark night of the soul.&rdquo; Then he handed the microphone to Kim Hopper and she sang the first verse of &ldquo;For Those Tears.&rdquo; It was incredibly beautiful. Then the whole group sang the chorus and he invited the crowd to join in. I was crying. Cindy was finding an old napkin in her pocket to wipe my nose with. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">While the piano continued to play my song, Gloria read a tribute her daughter had written to them on the occasion of their 40th wedding anniversary, then the whole crowd sang the chorus again. By now it was just seconds to midnight, so I was CERTAIN they were done. But we suddenly realized that he was continuing to talk. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;You know, the young (sic) woman who wrote that song is here with us tonight, and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">maybe you&rsquo;re like she was and you&rsquo;ve heard about a god who would reject you for who you are or who might turn you away for something you&rsquo;ve done or where you&rsquo;ve come from. Well I want you to know that I don&rsquo;t know that god.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The only God I know is the one in this song that she wrote. The one that says, &lsquo;I am right here for you.&rsquo; The one who sent His son. The one who says, &ldquo;You are my child, I love you, come stand by my side.&rsquo; So sing with me again!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The King Is Coming, alright, Bill. And he ain&rsquo;t gonna be very happy with this racemixing, fag loving, Jew worshiping monstrosity that the Church has become. And when He comes, it won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;something beautiful, something good&quot;. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to it, myself. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/badlands/index.php?p=9#comments"><span class="cs93865101">Comments (3)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs95E872D0">

Back in the 1940&rsquo;s, she was the Bo Derek of her era. She was famous for two things-her big breasts, and her willingness to show as much of them as possible, along with as much of the rest of her body as possible, to anyone with a quarter. At that time, the Jews in Hollywood were still forced to abide by the Hayes Code, and therefore weren&rsquo;t able to get away with complete nudity. But Russell was still quite the slut-you can see pictures of her with her top almost falling off, lying down with her legs apart and a come hither look on her face, dancing provocatively in her underwear, and various other slutty poses <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=jane%20russell&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi"><span class="cs93865101">here</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.briansdriveintheater.com/janerussell.html"><span class="cs93865101">here</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Here&rsquo;s what one website <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.altreel.com/offbeat-cinema/Guilty_Pleasures.html"><span class="cs93865101">says about just one of her slutty roles</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Outlaw [1943]&mdash;Howard Hughes&rsquo; The Outlaw is notable for bringing sex to the Western genre. The whole controversial production seems to have gone forward for one reason: To showcase actress Jane Russell&rsquo;s magnificent breasts. The film&rsquo;s slogan was &ldquo;What are the two biggest reasons for Jane Russell&rsquo;s success?&rdquo; During filming, Hughes once commented, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not getting enough production from Jane&rsquo;s breasts.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The film was considered so shocking to the Christian public that <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.indexonline.org/indexindex/20030307_britain.shtml"><span class="cs93865101">it was banned for seven years</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So Jane Russell was an incrementalist. She helped break down resistance to Jewish filth; so much so that her films, which were then considered &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and sexually explicit, are now seen as tame and innocuous. But thanks to her hard work at being as slutty as possible in the 1940&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re now able to view things on TV, even shows aimed at kids, that would have sent people to prison on pornography charges in the 1940&rsquo;s. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I was vaguely aware of Jane Russell-I remember her doing TV commercials for bras when I was a kid, after she was too old to make money selling her body. But I had no idea she was still alive, or what she was doing, until the other day. What </span><span class="csC382D2BB">does </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">an 84 year old slut do since no one in their right mind wants to see her naked anymore? Oh, c&rsquo;mon! This should be easy.

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash; Badonicus @ 3:50 pm </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There&rsquo;s a lot of nonsense going on about Kerry&rsquo;s reference to Cheney&rsquo;s gay daughter in last night&rsquo;s debate. Cheney&rsquo;s wife is outraged, saying it was cheap and dirty to mention that her daughter&rsquo;s a queer. Her husband&rsquo;s mad too. The local kosher conservatives on DFW radio are fuming. Why? Contrary to <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/000908.html#more"><span class="cs93865101">the lies of the Judeochristian blogosphere</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, Kerry didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;out&rdquo; Mary Cheney. She&rsquo;s been openly gay, and proud of it, for years. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.cwfa.org/articles/468/CFI/cfreport/"><span class="cs93865101">She&rsquo;s a freakin&rsquo; gay activist</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, for crying out loud!! But now it&rsquo;s suddenly wrong to mention the fact that the VPOTUS has a daughter who&rsquo;s a pervert, even approvingly? Why the outrage? It&rsquo;s simple-Bush/Cheney want the rubes on the Christian Right to think that they&rsquo;re against the sodomizing of America. That&rsquo;s why they talk about an amendment to the Constitution to ban gay marriage. They know it will never pass, and they&rsquo;re not going to pound the pulpit for it, but it energizes the kind of folks who think Alan Keyes is on our side. While they prattle on about &ldquo;traditional values&rdquo; and amendments, the head of Bush&rsquo;s California campaign is gay, two of the top officers at the Republican National Committee are openly homosexual, Bush&rsquo;s daughters are attending gay weddings while on the campaign staff, and Cheney </span><span class="csC382D2BB">has hired a gay rights activist to run his re-election campaign</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. That shows how they really feel about the sodomizing of America. They have no problem with it. And everyone in DC knows this, and knows that Bush will do nothing to oppose or roll back the gay agenda if he wins the election. But his winning the election depends on the Christian rubes NOT knowing this-they&rsquo;re supposed to think he&rsquo;s opposed to the homosexual agenda. And Kerry&rsquo;s reference to Mary Cheney being queer was no doubt news to a bunch of them, who aren&rsquo;t political junkies, and take their cues from Falwell and Dobson. The last thing they need to be hearing about is Mary Cheney, bull dyke. That&rsquo;s why the outrage, or the pretended outrage. But one article I read on the controversy really takes the cake.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christianculture.com/cgi-local/npublisher/viewnews.cgi?category=3&amp;id=1097725525"><span class="cs93865101">a piece of work </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">this guy Sandlin is:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the third Presidential debate, George W. Bush was asked whether he believes that homosexuality is a choice (Bush responded that he did not know). Senator John Kerry declared that he is sure that it is not a choice but, more significantly, invoked the lesbianism of Vice President Dick Cheney&rsquo;s daughter to buttress his position. The President is on record &ndash; correctly in my view &ndash; as supporting a Constitutional amendment defining marriage Biblically: as a union between one man and one woman.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Each of us that has adult children has been disappointed at one time or another by those children &ndash; just as each of us has disappointed our parents at some juncture. Homosexuality is a grievous sin that cannot be defended in any way whatsoever. However, we can sympathize with Cheney&rsquo;s love for his daughter and willingness to maintain a loving relationship with her, despite the fact that we disagree fully with his policy views on homosexuality.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For John Kerry (and earlier, John Edwards) to invoke the lesbianism of Cheney&rsquo;s daughter as a campaign issue when in fact neither she nor the Republicans have made her sexuality an issue of any kind is worse than a punch below the belt.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is, as Mortom Kondracke implied, despicable politics. Kerry and Edwards should be ashamed.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And they should apologize.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What lies. I hold no brief for Kerry and Edwards, but calling them despicable for pointing out what Cheney himself has pointed out, that his daughter&rsquo;s queer, is despicable in itself. Sandlin says it wasn&rsquo;t a campaign issue until the Democrats brought it up. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/08/25/MNGHQ8DV6Q1.DTL"><span class="cs93865101">Cheney himself invoked his dyke daughter a few weeks back </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">when he said he personally thinks gay marriage is just fine, and should be legal.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Vice President Dick Cheney spelled out Tuesday his differences with President Bush on the volatile issue of gay marriage, while for the first time discussing the sexual orientation of his gay daughter in a public setting. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Asked his position on the subject at a town hall meeting in Davenport, Iowa, Cheney replied: &ldquo;Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it&rsquo;s an issue that our family is very familiar with. &hellip; With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be able to free &ndash; ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sandlin lies when he says Republicans haven&rsquo;t made an issue of Cheney&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s perversion. And who cares if Cheney mentioned her or not? <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=2431&amp;issue=851"><span class="cs93865101">His queer daughter is HEADING UP HIS CAMPAIGN</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, for crying out loud! And, even though she&rsquo;s a well known gay activist who&rsquo;s spoken often about her perversion, and her goal of mainstreaming perversion, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Popsicle Toes claims she&rsquo;s &ldquo;never made her sexuality an issue of any kind&quot;! </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">So Cheney can hire a homo to run his campaign, but Kerry can&rsquo;t mention the homo&rsquo;s name? Hiring a pervert to run your campaign while you promise to oppose the pervert agenda isn&rsquo;t a campaign issue to Sandlin? So if Cheney mentions his dyke daughter, and hires his dyke daughter to run his campaign, and it&rsquo;s common knowledge that she&rsquo;s queer, and not only queer but an outspoken gay activist, and Republicans get points for inclusiveness and tolerance from fags because of it, that&rsquo;s OK, because he&rsquo;s a Republican. But if Kerry even mentions Cheney&rsquo;s dyke daughter </span><span class="csC382D2BB">approvingly</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, he&rsquo;s despicable.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And these culture reclaimer buffoons wonder why no one takes them seriously? Bush and Cheney are playing them like fiddles-giving lip service once every six months to an unpassable and stupid gay marriage amendment, while Bush&rsquo;s daughter attend gay weddings, and Cheney hires a homosexual to run his campaign. And Sandlin&rsquo;s such a brown nosing tool that he loves it, and calls Kerry despicable for even mentioning the name of the person that heads up Cheney&rsquo;s campaign. He thinks what Kerry did is worse than being a pervert. Ever heard him refer to Mary Cheney as despicable? Or say that it&rsquo;s despicable that Dick Cheney hired a pervert to run his campaign? Let me know if you do. I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Tools, useful idiots, buffoons-call &lsquo;em what you want. Just don&rsquo;t send these lying, slandering clowns any money. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/badlands/index.php?p=5#comments"><span class="cs93865101">Comments (8)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs95E872D0">

Everyone thinks I&rsquo;m nuts, that I&rsquo;m a lunatic, when I link to articles about detectives in NYC viewing The Passion for possible HATE CRIME violations. Big deal, they say, the cops are just pandering. It&rsquo;s an overreaction. It&rsquo;s just political correctness run amok, etc, etc. But now they&rsquo;ve charged 11 Christians in Philly with HATE CRIMES for showing up at a faggot festival and witnessing. And these Christians aren&rsquo;t the Fred Phelps kind-you know, the kind that most Christians think </span><span class="csC382D2BB">should</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> be locked up for HATE because they&rsquo;re not very nice. No, these guys were polite. This ain&rsquo;t Sweden. This ain&rsquo;t Canada. It&rsquo;s Philadelphia, PA, right here in the Jew S of A. Be sure to thank your local Jew, and your local Judeochristian pastor, that the Jews have now made preaching the Gospel a HATE CRIME in the nation founded by the Puritans and Pilgrims. This is the JewSA now. And since Jews hate Jesus Christ and his Word, they have to go. And Judeochristians love to have it so. Be sure to say a special thanks to RC Fool, Jr, for promoting Marren Loofer Keen&rsquo;s vision, the vision that made this all possible. Be sure and thank George Grant and James White and every other &ldquo;Reformed&rdquo; Christian leader who got up this past spring and agreed with the Christhaters that it&rsquo;s HATE to believe the parts of the Bible which say Jews killed Jesus. Because that&rsquo;s what all this is all about-the phony Holomocaust stories, Marren Loofer Keen, Civil Rights, the legalization of interracial marriage, giving colored people the vote, hate crime legislation, immigration, gay marriage, &ldquo;diversity&quot;&hellip;it&rsquo;s all part and parcel of the same program. Jewish hatred of White people, and Jewish hatred of Christianity, the White man&rsquo;s religion. That&rsquo;s what all this has been about-not &ldquo;fairness&quot;, not &ldquo;justice&quot;, not &ldquo;equality&quot;-what a laugh!, not anything but genocide and deicide. That&rsquo;s it. And until a person understands that, he doesn&rsquo;t understand anything. Jews boast that they created and ran the Civil Rights movement. If I say it I&rsquo;m a HATER. The Jewish ADL boasts that they invented the concept of &ldquo;hate crimes&quot;, and got them on the books, starting quietly back in the eighties. And now, they&rsquo;re being used against Christians for <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/10/132004a.asp"><span class="cs93865101">sharing the gospel at a gay rights celebration</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Police arrested 11 Christians last Sunday in Pennsylvania for exercising their First Amendment rights at a homosexual pride celebration. The six men and five women from <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.repentamerica.com/"><span class="cs93865101">Repent America </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">were jailed and charged under hate crimes legislation after attempting to do evangelistic outreach at &ldquo;Outfest,&rdquo; a homosexual event that was being held on the public streets and sidewalks of Philadelphia.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Among the Christians taken into custody was Michael Marcavage, founder of Repent America. Just two days before the October 10 arrests, the American Family Association Center for Law &amp; Policy had filed a lawsuit on behalf of Marcavage, alleging that the City of Philadelphia has a policy and practice of continually denying him his constitutional rights to free speech and free exercise of religion.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The lawsuit also claims the City has repeatedly threatened, intimidated, and arrested the Christian activist for merely proclaiming the gospel on the public ways. Sunday&rsquo;s events at Outfest would seem to substantiate these allegations.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Marcavage and the other Repent America representatives approached the Outfest site on the first day of the group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life and Liberty Tour,&rdquo; carrying banners with biblical messages and gospel literature, and they were immediately confronted with unlawful opposition from homosexual activists. A militant group called the &ldquo;Pink Angels,&rdquo; whose main objective is to silence outspoken Christians, formed a human chain to block the Repent America members&rsquo; access to the sidewalk.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The police eventually escorted the Christians past the blockade, and they began to preach and distribute gospel tracts on the public sidewalk and street inside the event. However, homosexual activists continued to harass the open-air evangelists, screaming obscenities, hooting and whistling to drown out their message. Some of Pink Angels carried large signs alongside the Christians to block their message and prevent them from speaking with other Outfest attendees.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the spirit of cooperation, the Repent America group was careful to obey all laws and even the unlawful requests of city Civil Affairs police to relocate. Nevertheless, without warning the head of the Civil Affairs Unit ordered the Christians arrested and hauled off to jail. After 21 hours behind bars, ten of the Christians were charged with eight crimes &ndash; including three felonies and five misdemeanors &ndash; and released. A teenager in the group was charged with a misdemeanor.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Repent America representatives have been charged with criminal conspiracy, possession of instruments of crime, reckless endangerment, ethnic intimidation, riot, failure to disperse, disorderly conduct, and obstructing highways. The Christian group members are scheduled to be arraigned on October 18, 2004 at 8:00 a.m. in the Philadelphia Criminal Justice Center.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These guys will probably get off. At least this time. But in a country where you can get 15 years in prison for spray painting NIGGER on a wall, it won&rsquo;t be long before you&rsquo;ll be going to prison for reading Romans in public. Then from the pulpit. Because Jews hate White people, and they really, really, hate Jesus Christ. And they&rsquo;re in charge now. So get used to it. Because they&rsquo;re going to start rubbing it in our faces. And why shouldn&rsquo;t they? Over in Israel, Jews are beating Christians senseless with baseball bats. They&rsquo;ve been spitting on priests and Christians for decades. Ever seen anything about that in your local newspaper? Think you&rsquo;d hear about if Baptists in South Carolina were spitting on Jews? You know as well as I do we&rsquo;d never STOP hearing about it. Or how about Frenchmen spitting on Jews? Yeah, you hear about &ldquo;anti semitism&rdquo; in France all the time, even though most of it turns out to be fake. But not a word from the Jewsmedia about what&rsquo;s happening to Christians in Israel. And what&rsquo;s our government&rsquo;s response to Americans being spat upon and beaten with baseball bats in Israel? They unanimously pass a bill <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041013-052818-7671r.htm"><span class="cs93865101">requiring the State Department to monitor the entire world for &ldquo;anti semitism&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

It&rsquo;s Christianball-using baseball bats to savagely beat Christians, including women. I told you about one attack last week, where they <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://badonicus.blogspot.com/2004/10/israeli-jews-attack-american.html"><span class="cs93865101">attacked a man and woman </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">from America, which resulted in the man being hospitalized for a punctured lung and other injuries. He&rsquo;s still in the hospital as I write this. The lady got off with a broken arm and swollen knee. The Orthodox Jews then stole their passports and money for good measure. Yesterday <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/CalgarySun/News/2004/10/10/663376.html"><span class="cs93865101">there was another attack</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and again they&rsquo;re beating men and women with baseball bats, or what the paper euphemistically calls &ldquo;sticks&quot;. Must be some big sticks to break an arm. This time it was eight attackers viciously beating an Italian man and a Canadian woman. The female victim in the newest attack is the one who found last week&rsquo;s victims lying in pools of blood. And this time they stole the man&rsquo;s camcorder.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And still not a word from Worldmagblog, or The Evangelical Outhouse, or National Review, etc., etc.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/badlands/index.php?p=88#comments"><span class="cs93865101">Comments (0)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h2 class="cs95E872D0">
