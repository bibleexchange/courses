		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash; Badonicus @ 7:58 pm </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Anyone who knows anything about the Jesus Movement of the 1970&rsquo;s is familiar with the song </span><span class="csC382D2BB">For Those Tears I Died (Come To The Water)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. It ranks right up there with </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Pass It On</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> for sentimental heretical drivel, and like </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Pass It On</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, it became phenomenally popular. The song was so influential that its author has been called &ldquo;the mother of Contemporary Christian Music&quot;. It was written by a sixteen year old girl, and the lyrics betray that, although you could be excused for thinking that an RTS grad wrote this:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And Jesus said come to the water and stand by my side<br/>I know you are thirsty you won&rsquo;t be denied<br/>I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried<br/>And I strove to remind you<br/>That for those tears I died</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The song isn&rsquo;t quite as popular as it once was, because the sixteen year old writer, Marsha Stevens, not long after that, became Marsha Stevens, &ldquo;conservative Christianity&rsquo;s worst nightmare - a Jesus-loving, Bible-believing, God-fearing lesbian Christian.&rdquo; For years she&rsquo;s had her own &ldquo;ministry&quot;-BALM, which stands for Born Again Lesbian Music. Here&rsquo;s <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.balmministries.com/"><span class="cs93865101">her website</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">-be sure to check out the pictures of her and her bride, Cindy. I&rsquo;m not sure if RC Sproul, Jr married them. Maybe, since his perversion of Galatian 3:28 means that once someone&rsquo;s baptized <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://littlegeneva.com/sproul2.html"><span class="cs93865101">they&rsquo;re no longer male or female, but only Christian</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t Doug Wilson, since he only <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.credenda.org/issues/16-2memorandum.php"><span class="cs93865101">recently embraced gay marriage</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But it might have been his colleague, Doug Jones, since <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.reformed.org/webfiles/antithesis/v1n1/ant_v1n1_racism.html"><span class="cs93865101">he wrote almost 15 years ago that </span></a></span><span class="csC382D2BB">&ldquo;the only grounds Scripture gives us for prohibiting a marriage is religious in nature. Believers are not permitted to marry unbelievers&hellip;&rdquo; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Doesn&rsquo;t really matter, because the important thing is not being a hater. Besides the pictures of her wedding, there&rsquo;s other photos, too. Like <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.balmministries.com/images/nyeve2002.jpg"><span class="cs93865101">the one from New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2002</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, featuring her and her bride arm in arm with Bill Gaither and Mark Lowry. Yep, Bill Gaither, the king of gospel music, and Mark Lowry (the queen?), his longtime sidekick.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gaither is wildly popular with evangelical Christians, and brings in millions of dollars a year &ldquo;ministering&rdquo; to them in song. Mark Lowry has made millions from his &ldquo;ministry&quot;, which consists of singing and comedy. I saw him live at Mount Vernon Nazarene College, in Mount Vernon, Ohio, about 10 years ago. My buddy Dilettante had been given some tickets, and I went with him and his family. If you&rsquo;ve never seen and heard Lowry, just think of an even more effeminate Richard Simmons. He&rsquo;s </span><span class="csC382D2BB">that</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> bad. I&rsquo;d never seen him before, nor had Dilettante, and if I recall correctly, after the concert, we were both pretty sure that Lowry had a little sugar in his gas tank. And this Marsha Stevens business only makes me more suspicious.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because this isn&rsquo;t one of those photos where the big shot had no idea who he was posing with, and it comes back to haunt him later, a la <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.prairieghosts.com/gacy.html"><span class="cs93865101">Rosalyn Carter and John Wayne Gacy</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. No, both Gaither and Lowry knew all about Stevens and her faggot &ldquo;ministry&quot;, and not only did they pose with her, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiangays.com/news.shtml"><span class="cs93865101">they also praised Stevens for her work, and condemned those haters </span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">who think Christians can&rsquo;t be faggots:</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The first person to come up to us was Mark Lowry. He sang with the Gaither Vocal Band for many years and retired recently after he wrote the song &ldquo;Mary Did You Know&quot;, but he&rsquo;d been singing with the group that night. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He said, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re Marsha Stevens!&rdquo; I thought, okay, there&rsquo;s only 6 of us here, they must have told them our names. But </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">he went on to say that he loves the song &ldquo;For Those Tears I Died&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;s proud of what I&rsquo;m doing now.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">I said, &ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m doing now?&rdquo; He answer, &ldquo;I sure do and I wish the fundamentalist would find Jesus. They&rsquo;re going to have a lot to answer for, leaving out people that Jesus died for.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">While I stammered (I am SO dumb around famous people), Bill and Gloria Gaither came over and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Bill said how much he loved my song, and appreciated my ministry today, too.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Gloria thanked me for it. I was not sure Bill knew what he was saying, but we got pictures and it was time to go back out for the rest of the concert. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At about 10 till midnight we thought they would be starting their big finale. But Bill said that he had lost a couple of people very close to him in the past couple of years - his brother and his Mom - and one song had been sung at both funerals . . . a song that has gotten more people than we will ever know through a &ldquo;dark night of the soul.&rdquo; Then he handed the microphone to Kim Hopper and she sang the first verse of &ldquo;For Those Tears.&rdquo; It was incredibly beautiful. Then the whole group sang the chorus and he invited the crowd to join in. I was crying. Cindy was finding an old napkin in her pocket to wipe my nose with. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">While the piano continued to play my song, Gloria read a tribute her daughter had written to them on the occasion of their 40th wedding anniversary, then the whole crowd sang the chorus again. By now it was just seconds to midnight, so I was CERTAIN they were done. But we suddenly realized that he was continuing to talk. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;You know, the young (sic) woman who wrote that song is here with us tonight, and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">maybe you&rsquo;re like she was and you&rsquo;ve heard about a god who would reject you for who you are or who might turn you away for something you&rsquo;ve done or where you&rsquo;ve come from. Well I want you to know that I don&rsquo;t know that god.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The only God I know is the one in this song that she wrote. The one that says, &lsquo;I am right here for you.&rsquo; The one who sent His son. The one who says, &ldquo;You are my child, I love you, come stand by my side.&rsquo; So sing with me again!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
