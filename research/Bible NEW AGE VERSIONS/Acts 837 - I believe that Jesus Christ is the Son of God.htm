<P class=smtxt>The following is an excerpt from Dr. Thomas Holland's <I><A 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/books/review-cwg.html">Crowned With Glory</A></I>, 
©2000, used with permission.</P>
<H1>Acts 8:37 - "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God"</H1>
<P><I>"And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And 
he answered and said,<B> I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God</B>."</I> 
</P>
<P>Here the testimony of this faithful and beloved African, the Ethiopian 
eunuch, does not appear in the Critical Text. Some have argued that the verse is 
not genuine because it is found in only a few late manuscripts and was inserted 
into the Greek text by Erasmus from the Latin Vulgate. It is true that the 
passage appears in the Latin Vulgate of Jerome. However, the passage also 
appears in a vast number of other Old Latin manuscripts (such as <I>l, m, e, r, 
ar, ph, </I>and<I> gig</I>). It also is found in the Greek Codex E (eighth 
century) and several Greek manuscripts (36, 88, 97, 103, 104, 242, 257, 307, 
322, 323, 385, 429, 453, 464, 467, 610, 629, 630, 913, 945, 1522, 1678, 1739, 
1765, 1877, 1891, and others). While there are differences even among these 
texts as to precise wording, the essence of the testimony still remains where it 
has been removed from other manuscripts.<A title="" name=_ftnref1 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_ac8_37.html#_ftn1"> [1] 
</A>Additionally, Irenaeus (202 AD), Cyprian (258 AD), Ambrosiaster (forth 
century), Pacian (392 AD), Ambrose (397 AD), Augustine (430 AD), and Theophylact 
(1077 AD) all cite Acts 8:37. </P>
<P>If the text were genuine, why would any scribe wish to delete it?<A title="" 
name=_ftnref2 href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_ac8_37.html#_ftn2"><SUP> 
[2] </SUP></A>In his commentary on the book of Acts, Dr. J. A. Alexander 
provides a possible answer. By the end of the third century it had become common 
practice to delay the baptism of Christian converts to assure that they had 
truly understood their commitment to Christ and were not holding to one of the 
various heretical beliefs prevalent at that time.<A title="" name=_ftnref3 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_ac8_37.html#_ftn3"> [3] </A>It is 
possible that a scribe, believing that baptism should not immediately follow 
conversion, omitted this passage from the text, which would explain its absence 
in many of the Greek manuscripts that followed. Certainly this conjecture is as 
possible as the various explanations offered by those who reject the reading. 
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, because of biblical preservation, the reading remains in some 
Greek manuscripts as well as in the Old Latin manuscripts. Clearly the reading 
is far more ancient than the sixth century, as some scholars have suggested. 
Irenaeus noted that "the believing eunuch himself: . . . immediately requesting 
to be baptized, he said, 'I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God'."<A 
title="" name=_ftnref4 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_ac8_37.html#_ftn4"> [4] </A>Likewise, 
Cyprian quotes the first half of the verse in writing, "In the Acts of the 
Apostles: 'Lo, here is water; what is there which hinders me from being 
baptized? Then said Philip, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou 
mayest'."<A title="" name=_ftnref5 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_ac8_37.html#_ftn5"> [5] </A>These 
statements, clearly quotations of Acts 8:37, appear by the end of the second 
century and at the first half of the third. We see that the passage was in 
common use long before the existing Greek manuscripts were ever copied. This in 
itself testifies to its authenticity and to the assurance of biblical 
preservation.</P><BR clear=all>

<P class=MsoFootnoteText><A title="" name=_ftn1 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_ac8_37.html#_ftnref1">[1] </A>The 
variants within the manuscripts that maintain this passage are minor. For 
example, 88 omits <I>o Philippos</I> (Phillip) and adds <I>o eunouchos</I> (the 
eunuch) and <I>auto</I> (very). Thus the verse reads in 88, "And he said, If 
thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And the eunuch answered and 
said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the very Son of God." Such variants are 
common among the vast host of Greek manuscripts. It should be noted, 
nevertheless, that such variants do not constitute the removal of the passage 
from the text. Nor, are such variants of like significance as those that would 
remove the passage from the text.</P></DIV>
