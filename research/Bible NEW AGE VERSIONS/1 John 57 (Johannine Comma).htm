<P class=smtxt>The following is an excerpt from Dr. Thomas Holland's <I><A 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/books/review-cwg.html">Crowned With Glory</A></I>, 
©2000, used with permission.</P>
<H1>1 John 5:7 (Johannine Comma)</H1><I>"For there are three that bear record in 
heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one." </I>
<P>The passage is called the <I>Johannine Comma</I> and is not found in the 
majority of Greek manuscripts. <A title="" name=_ftnref1 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn1">[1] </A>However, the 
verse is a wonderful testimony to the Heavenly Trinity and should be maintained 
in our English versions, not only because of its doctrinal significance but 
because of the external and internal evidence that testify to its 
authenticity.</P>
<P>The External Support: Although not found in most Greek manuscripts, the 
Johannine Comma is found in several. It is contained in 629 (fourteenth 
century), 61 (sixteenth century), 918 (sixteenth century), 2473 (seventeenth 
century), and 2318 (eighteenth century). It is also in the margins of 221 (tenth 
century), 635 (eleventh century), 88 (twelveth century), 429 (fourteenth 
century), and 636 (fifteenth century). There are about five hundred existing 
manuscripts of 1 John chapter five that do not contain the <I>Comma</I>.<A 
title="" name=_ftnref2 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn2"> [2] </A>It is clear 
that the reading found in the Textus Receptus is the minority reading with later 
textual support from the Greek witnesses. Nevertheless, being a minority reading 
does not eliminate it as genuine. The Critical Text considers the reading 
<I>Iesou</I> (of Jesus) to be the genuine reading instead of <I>Iesou 
Christou</I> (of Jesus Christ) in 1 John 1:7. Yet <I>Iesou</I> is the minority 
reading with only twenty-four manuscripts supporting it, while four hundred 
seventy-seven manuscripts support the reading <I>Iesou Christou</I> found in the 
Textus Receptus. Likewise, in 1 John&nbsp; 2:20 the minority reading 
<I>pantes</I> (all) has only twelve manuscripts supporting it, while the 
majority reading is <I>panta</I> (all things) has four hundred ninety-one 
manuscripts. Still, the Critical Text favors the minority reading over the 
majority in that passage. This is common place throughout the First Epistle of 
John, and the New Testament as a whole. Therefore, simply because a reading is 
in the minority does not eliminate it as being considered original.&nbsp; </P>
<P>While the Greek textual evidence is weak, the Latin textual evidence for the 
Comma is extremely strong. It is in the vast majority of the Old Latin 
manuscripts, which outnumber the Greek manuscripts. Although some doubt if the 
Comma was a part of Jerome's original Vulgate, the evidence suggests that it 
was. Jerome states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In that place particularly where we read about the unity of the Trinity 
  which is placed in the First Epistle of John, in which also the names of 
  three, i.e. of water, of blood, and of spirit, do they place in their edition 
  and omitting the testimony of the Father; and the Word, and the Spirit in 
  which the catholic faith is especially confirmed and the single substance of 
  the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit is confirmed.<A title="" name=_ftnref3 
  href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn3"> [3] 
</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Other church fathers are also known to have quoted the Comma. Although some 
have questioned if Cyprian (258 AD) knew of the Comma, his citation certainly 
suggests that he did. He writes: "The Lord says, 'I and the Father are one' and 
likewise it is written of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, 'And these 
three are one'."<A title="" name=_ftnref4 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn4"> [4] </A>Also, there 
is no doubt that Priscillian (385 AD) cites the Comma: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>As John says "and there are three which give testimony on earth, the water, 
  the flesh, the blood, and these three are in one, and there are three which 
  give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and these 
  three are one in Christ Jesus."<A title="" name=_ftnref5 
  href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn5"> [5] 
</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Likewise, the anti-Arian work compiled by an unknown writer, the 
<I>Varimadum</I> (380 AD) states: "And John the Evangelist says, . . . 'And 
there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the 
Spirit, and these three are one'."<A title="" name=_ftnref6 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn6"> [6] 
</A>Additionally, Cassian (435 AD), Cassiodorus (580 AD), and a host of other 
African and Western bishops in subsequent centuries have cited the Comma.<A 
title="" name=_ftnref7 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn7"> [7] </A>Therefore, 
we see that the reading has massive and ancient textual support apart from the 
Greek witnesses.</P>
<P>Internal Evidence: The structure of the Comma is certainly Johannine in 
style. John is noted for referring to Christ as "the Word." If 1 John 5:7 were 
an interpretation of verse eight, as some have suggested, than we would expect 
the verse to use "Son" instead of "Word." However, the verse uses the Greek word 
<I>logos</I>, which is uniquely in the style of John and provides evidence of 
its genuineness. Also, we find John drawing parallels between the Trinity and 
what they testify (1 John 4:13-14). Therefore, it comes as no surprise to find a 
parallel of witnesses containing groups of three, one heavenly and one 
earthly.</P>
<P>The strongest evidence, however, is found in the Greek text itself. Looking 
at 1 John 5:8, there are three nouns which, in Greek, stand in the neuter 
(Spirit, water, and blood). However, they are followed by a participle that is 
masculine. The Greek phrase here is <I>oi marturountes</I> (who bare witness). 
Those who know the Greek language understand this to be poor grammar if left to 
stand on its own. Even more noticeably, verse six has the same participle but 
stands in the neuter (Gk.: <I>to marturoun</I>). Why are three neuter nouns 
supported with a masculine participle? The answer is found if we include verse 
seven. There we have two masculine nouns (Father and Son) followed by a neuter 
noun (Spirit). The verse also has the Greek masculine participle <I>oi 
marturountes</I>. With this clause introducing verse eight, it is very proper 
for the participle in verse eight to be masculine, because of the masculine 
nouns in verse seven. But if verse seven were not there it would become improper 
Greek grammar.</P>
<P>Even though Gregory of Nazianzus (390 AD) does not testify to the 
authenticity of the Comma, he makes mention of the flawed grammar resulting from 
its absence. In his <I>Theological Orientations</I> he writes referring to 
John:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>. . . (he has not been consistent) in the way he has happened upon his 
  terms; for after using Three in the masculine gender he adds three words which 
  are neuter, contrary to the definitions and laws which you and your 
  grammarians have laid down. For what is the difference between putting a 
  masculine Three first, and then adding One and One and One in the neuter, or 
  after a masculine One and One and One to use the Three not in the masculine 
  but in the neuter, which you yourselves disclaim in the case of Deity?<A 
  title="" name=_ftnref8 
  href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn8"> [8] 
</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is clear that Gregory recognized the inconsistency with Greek grammar if 
all we have are verses six and eight without verse seven. Other scholars have 
recognized the same thing. This was the argument of Robert Dabney of Union 
Theological Seminary in his book,<I> The Doctrinal Various Readings of the New 
Testament Greek </I>(1891). Bishop Middleton in his book, <I>Doctrine of the 
Greek Article,</I> argues that verse seven must be a part of the text according 
to the Greek structure of the passage. Even in the famous commentary by Matthew 
Henry, there is a note stating that we must have verse seven if we are to have 
proper Greek in verse eight.<A title="" name=_ftnref9 
href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftn9"> [9] </A></P>
<P>While the external evidence makes the originality of the Comma possible, the 
internal evidence makes it very probable. When we consider the providential hand 
of God and His use of the Traditional Text in the Reformation it is clear that 
the Comma is authentic.</P><BR clear=all>

href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html#_ftnref1">[1] </A>The first 
and second editions of Erasmus' Greek text did not contain the Comma. It is 
generally reported that Erasmus promised to include the Comma in his third 
edition if a single manuscript containing the Comma could be produced. A 
Franciscan friar named Froy (or Roy) forged a Greek text containing it by 
translating the Comma from the Latin into Greek. Erasmus was then presented with 
this falsified manuscript and, being faithful to his word, reluctantly included 
the Comma in the 1522 edition. However, as has now been admitted by Dr. Bruce 
Metzger, this story is apocryphal (<I>The Text Of The New Testament</I>, 291). 
Metzger notes that H. J. de Jonge, a respected specialist on Erasmus, has 
established that there is no evidence of such events occurring. Therefore, 
opponents of the Comma in light of the historical facts should no longer affirm 
this report.</P></DIV>
