Spence</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2-19-02</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The question is both theological and theoretical in nature. Theologically it is related to the study of the word of God. Theoretically it is related to ideas of the human mind and heart that brings into question the ability of the human mind and emotion to comprehend intelligently the existence of God. (See Jeremiah 17:9) &nbsp;However, when you also note that man is spirit and by innate comprehension he realizes that there is a universal understanding of a Being greater than man that put into motion the laws and dynamics of science and the existence of the universe and man himself.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">According to Hebrews 11:6 Without &ldquo;Faith&rdquo; it is impossible to please God&hellip; Therefore if a person comes to God they must first of all believe that He is&hellip; and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The entire chapter of Hebrews 11 gives a multiplicity of examples of men and women who had faith in this unseen God&hellip; To them God was real because they believed in the God that could not be seen or touched with human hands. God is not tangible&hellip; We cannot touch Him&hellip; You cannot touch your brain&hellip; but does that mean that it is not real? &nbsp;You cannot touch the wind &hellip; but does that mean it is not a real force in the world today? We see the results of where it has been and where it is moving today. Think back to a Hurricane Fran and Floyd&hellip; Just as the wind is a real and viable force in the world so is God.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hebrews 11:1 states, &ldquo;Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.&rdquo; So why do we hope for things that we cannot and have not seen? Because by faith we look for the evidence to appear&hellip;We believe in God who can and will bring it to pass&hellip;Hebrews 11:2 states that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. God is everywhere in everything because He made it all&hellip;Well, He is almost everywhere and in everything&hellip; You see, He stands outside the heart of a man, woman, boy or girl, the doorknob is only on the inside&hellip; We must open it for Him to come in&hellip;( See Revelation 3:20) A person may believe that God exists&hellip; But not know him in a personal way. A person may know the President but not know him in a personal way&hellip; there is a difference you see. Some people have zeal for God but not according to knowledge. (Romans 10:2) In Romans 10:16, Isaiah asked. &ldquo;Who hath believed our report?&rdquo; You see to those who believe &hellip;God is. And yet God proves His own existence even by Pharaoh who hardened his heart for Paul states in Romans 9:17 that &hellip; &nbsp;&ldquo;Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.&rdquo; So by the Word of God&hellip;God proves again and again that He is real and a viable force in the universe and just because men don&rsquo;t believe, it does not erase the fact that God is. While Christ was on the cross two men were hanging beside him one on either side. One said &ldquo;If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.&rdquo; But the other said, &ldquo; Remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.&rdquo; The fact that one believed and the other believed not, did not change the fact that He was the Son on God. The pivotal point is whether or not a man will have faith in this triune God who sent His only begotten Son to die for the sin of sinful man. He today sends His Spirit to convict men of their sin and yet they turn a deaf ear to Him. ( See John 16:8) You see, once again it is in the heart of man to either believe or deny the existence of God&hellip; Jesus pleads with his disciples to believe Him, if for no other reason except the works that He performed. (John 14:11) But God&rsquo;s Word is true whether we accept it or not&hellip; In 2 Peter 3:10 it states that heaven and earth shall pass away but my word abideth forever. God spoke through His prophet for the people to &ldquo;Hear&rdquo; that he was one God. Many don&rsquo;t hear even though they have ears. People can sit in church for years and sit under preachers and teachers and still not hear. You question how this can be&hellip; It is simply that they have ears but refuse to hear. Over and Over the scripture tells people to hear and Revelation goes so far as to say, &ldquo;He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.&rdquo; Rev. 3:22. Sadly, in America today we are programmed not to hear God&hellip; We tune God out until a tragedy occurs and then we call on Him just long enough for Him to get us out of trouble and then we go on living like He doesn&rsquo;t exist until the next problem comes that we can&rsquo;t handle and then we call it another act of God that we can&rsquo;t handle. Why don&rsquo;t we turn to Him? We boldly say that we are rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing. What a sad day it is as we sit in prosperous America in the middle of all of our grown-up toys and say look what I have and realize not that we are poor, blind and naked and that we need his riches, his clothing of righteousness and the eye salve of God to open our eyes. ( See Rev. 3:17 &amp; 18)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">What is faith? &ndash; belief in something or someone&hellip;Trust? </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Webster </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">puts it this way&hellip; a firm belief in something in which there is no proof. It has been said &nbsp;&ldquo;The proof is in the pudding!&rdquo; What does that mean? You must taste it to see for yourself if it is really as good as you have been told. In order to know the existence of God you must trust Him for yourself and fall back into His arms with the belief that He will catch you. There is a certain amount of uncertainty&hellip;but this force of belief or faith is what lets you fall into His arms and gives you the assurance that He will without a doubt catch you. The proof that God is can be evidenced in a person&rsquo;s life. Do you or do you not allow God to work in you and through you. &nbsp;Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen. (See Hebrews 11:1) The fact that you don&rsquo;t keep falling is knowledge to the believer that there is a God and that He is real&hellip;for He manifests Himself in bringing to pass that which He wills in our lives. It&rsquo;s an individual thing &hellip; every man must work out his own salvation with fear and trembling&hellip;Philippians 2:12&hellip; That He might through us perform His will&hellip; Phil 2:13.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Case In Point</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Pharaoh did not believe God and Moses did.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">To one He was not and to the other He was.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Did the fact that Pharaoh did not believe make God not exist? &ldquo;No!&rdquo; A thousand times &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t believe in his heart and therefore he denied the existence of a very real God although he saw all the wonders that God wrought in Egypt. Jesus said in John 4:24 that worshipers must worship God in Spirit and in truth. God is a Spirit and must be worshipped by that part of man that is spirit. We get tripped up many times about believing God because we can&rsquo;t see Him except by faith. We need to recall that the Devils believe and tremble. They know about God&rsquo;s existence but they don&rsquo;t know about His existence within their hearts. &nbsp;(See James 2:19) A person has to put our belief in the existence of God &nbsp;by having faith and works. &nbsp;See the story of Abraham (James 2:21-23). It is not enough to believe&hellip; we must act on what we believe and this puts our reputation on the line in the front of our fellowman&hellip; We must be willing to let our reputation be sacrificed and let God be true as it states in Romans 3:4. When we act on our belief in God this acts to persuade other men to the side on the side of light and truth as seen in God&hellip; (John 4:24) Also see John 4:28-29 &amp; 39 &ndash; 42.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">For more understanding in this matter turn to the book of Romans 10:17&hellip; &ldquo;So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Begin with the Romans 10:1 and read the entire chapter and it will reveal that there is a people that have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In essence each man must be persuaded in his own mind. For one the existence of God is and yet he doesn&rsquo;t act on the fact. He may be a good moral person and yet doesn&rsquo;t accept the atonement God has provided through His Son Jesus Christ. He therefore does not &nbsp;allow the appropriate of God&rsquo;s atonement in his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;To another the Bible is enough proof for him and he acts according to faith by allowing the activation of that faith in the similitude of works. To another he completely ignores the Bible and lives his own life according to the pleasure of his heart and denies the existence of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">So the answer is both &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no.&rdquo; To one it proves the being of God because he believes and to another he ignores or doesn&rsquo;t embrace the existence of God and thereby, he doesn&rsquo;t believe that God is.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Both Cain and Abel believed that God is&hellip; One acted in obedience the other in defiance. They both believed God but for one it was imputed for righteousness and for the other it did not matter. On the other hand Pharaoh did not believe God at all and so he ignored the wonders of God and went on in disobedience because of the hardness of his heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the believer and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the unbeliever.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">You see the believer takes the Word of God to heart while the unbeliever just stands on the sidelines and mocks God and the believer by not obeying God&rsquo;s Word. Two men hung on the cross when Jesus was crucified one believed and the other did not. (See Matthew &nbsp;Note the story of Ruth and Orpah&hellip; one followed her mother-in-law to serve the one true God and the other did not. ( SeeRuth 1) Noah answered the call of God to build an ark when it had never rained before while others mocked him. Hebrews 11:7 What was the difference? &nbsp;&nbsp;God is very real to the believer and not so real to the unbeliever. A creationist accepts the fact that in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&hellip; the evolutionist argues the point and refuses to believe. &nbsp;Because of unbelief the children of Israel could enter into the rest they had been promised. (See Hebrews 3:18 &amp;19) The evolutionist uses the finite (limited mind) to try to figure out an infinite God and how the worlds were made. The believer accepts by faith Hebrews 11: that the worlds were made and framed by the word of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;In essence when man tries to figure out God&hellip;. He must come to the realization that God is not so small that He can be figured out by the creation of which man is a part. On the other hand the creationists believes by Faith that God created the Heaven and the Earth&hellip;. Reason can only go so far&hellip;. But faith has no limits&hellip;. How can man figure out God?&hellip; If this were possible God would not be God&hellip;. So does the Bible prove that God is?&hellip;. You decide&hellip; by acknowledging what you do with a belief in God&hellip; God is to those who allow Him to be that I AM in their lives. Do you believe and tremble as the devils do or do you allow God to act on that belief in you heart and life through your actions? &nbsp;By answering this question for yourself &hellip;you will answer the age old question, &ldquo;Does the Bible prove that God is?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;God Bless!</span></p></body>
