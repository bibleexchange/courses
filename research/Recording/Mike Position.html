			<span class="cs16E84F30">Mike Position</span></h3>
		<p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At the top of a recording session, the engineer will &quot;get a level,&quot; that is, he&#39;ll have you speak so that he can adjust the mike volume and position for optimal pick-up. He may even &quot;spike&quot; your position on the floor with tape or chalk. Generally, you need six to eight inches between the mike and your mouth. To check for yourself, open your hand and spread your fingers. When the tip of your little finger just touches the business end of the mike, the tip of your thumb should touch your mouth. When you need to raise your voice, you should back slightly away from the mike; when you speak softly, feint into it.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Note that when you get close to the mike, the &quot;proximity effect&quot; kicks in, making you sound particularly warm. Therefore, intimate scenes or internal monologue are often performed in a tight mike position. Feinting &mdash; that is, adjusting mike position for changes in volume or for warmth &mdash;&nbsp; takes a great deal of practice. Some voice artists (e.g., the legendary Ken Nordine) are famous for their ability to &quot;make love to&quot; the mike.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Do not talk directly into the mike. Talk </span><span class="csC382D2BB">across</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the field. To facilitate this, hold your script up so that, in order to read it, you have to aim your mouth across, under or over the microphone. You will thereby avoid popping.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you can, stand, don&#39;t sit, at the mike. Standing improves concentration and energy. Also, stand </span><span class="csC382D2BB">still</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Doing so not only prevents random volume or stereo changes, but channels your energy up and out your mouth. Gesticulating with your free hand, which many actors like to do, only diffuses energy. I wish it were needless to say, but experience suggests you must be admonished to keep from rattling change in your pocket or fidgeting with anything else on your person. In fact, get rid of anything you wear that tinkles, shakes, rattles or rolls. Wear soft clothes, especially soft-soled shoes, unless your director wants you to do your own footfall effects.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You don&#39;t have to be heard in the last row of a thousand-seat playhouse. Use only as much volume as you need to be heard by the character or characters you are speaking to. Notice I said &quot;character,&quot; not &quot;fellow actor.&quot; The actor may only be a few feet away, but the character is supposed to be on the other side of a chasm. You never play to the actor &mdash; or the mike, for that matter. You play to&nbsp;characters in an environment you conjure in your mind, not to anything or anyone in the sound studio. What is your proximity to these fictional people? Are you in a noisy or quiet place? Is it stuffy or bad smelling or hot or breezy? All these things affect your delivery.</span></p><h3 class="cs7169E63A">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Most Important Principle</span></h3>
		<p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This brings up the most important principle of acting for audio. Your job is to stimulate sights and smells and sensations in the imagination of your audience. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Y</span><span class="csBAF33195">ou can&#39;t do this unless you create them in your own mind for yourself while you&#39;re performing</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Remember what it was like playing make-pretend with the other neighborhood kids? Making fallen branches serve as swords and porches as castle turrets? Well, that&#39;s exactly what acting in audio plays is all about, just more so.</span></p><h3 class="cs7169E63A">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">On- and Off-Mike</span></h3>
		<p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A small distance goes a long way. To give the effect that you are leaving the scene &mdash; or to &quot;go off-mike,&quot; as we say &mdash; you need only turn your head away from the mike. To fade up, you need only do the opposite. In audio drama, unless your director is striving for a specific effect, no character moves in silence. To give the effect of a move, you need to move on or off mike or across the stereo field </span><span class="csC382D2BB">while you&#39;re talking</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Otherwise, you will sound as if you have jumped to a new position.&nbsp; And unless the script or director tells you otherwise, assume you are supposed to be in an &quot;on mike&quot; position, that is, standing in relation to the mike for the maximum pick-up of your voice with maximum isolation and &quot;slap&quot; from the walls. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It&#39;s slap &mdash; your voice bouncing off the walls and ceiling back into the mike &mdash; that gives you the &quot;off-mike&quot; sound. It betokens distance even more than changes in volume. You need to compromise on such changes anyway as the mike exaggerates them. Get too loud, and your voice will get distorted. Speak too softly and you won&#39;t be heard at all. That is why you need to practice a style of delivery that keeps dynamics smooth. Some actors hit the top of a sentence hard and peter out at the end or vice versa. Some have a jerky dynamic. Those styles don&#39;t work well at the mike. Smoothness does. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Hence, changes in dynamic effects should be accomplished more by changes in voice quality than volume. If your character is supposed to shout, close your throat a bit the way people do when they shout and only raise your voice slightly. If you&#39;re supposed to whisper, get breathy but adjust your volume only slightly. And, as already stated, when supposedly moving, adjust your head to increase slap rather than to decrease your actual volume.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In monophonic productions, its conventional that when anybody enters or leaves a scene they fade up or down, go on- or off-mike. The problem is that outdoors there is no slap, for sound can&#39;t bounce off walls that aren&#39;t there. The best studios have a &quot;dead room&quot; for outdoor scenes,&nbsp; a space within or adjacent to the main room that is baffled to eliminate slap. In the United States, such spaces are rare to non-existent apart from certain facilities for post-production film sound. Therefore, handling movement in outdoor scenes can be very tricky even when tracked outdoors. You may have to adjust volume while remaining still to sound distant or create the illusion of movement.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
