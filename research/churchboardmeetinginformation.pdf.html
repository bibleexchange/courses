Minutes also can protect the board from litigation or other administrative proceedings. Additionally, board minutes may be one of the first places the IRS and other oversight groups look during an audit.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Procedures for Recording Minutes: It is essential that a ministry develop procedures to thoroughly document the proceedings of various corporate board meetings, including meetings conducted by conference call and Web conferencing. The procedures should outline what meeting notes should include who is responsible for taking them and when and how they should be translated into the formal minutes.</span></p><p class="csE8924016"><span class="csA7555675">Responsibility for Recording Minutes: Who is responsible for taking board minutes? Is this the best person for the job? Is this the best use of this person&rsquo;s time, or could another person perform this function more efficiently in terms of organizational resources?</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">In many organizations, the board or organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; is charged with the responsibility of taking minutes and, often, with additional review and signatory responsibilities.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Although any staff member may record the actual minutes, it is imperative that someone with knowledge of and/or a background in taxation and legal issues carefully review the minutes. The person designated as &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; should possess experience and education in these areas, as they are the areas in which potential problems are most likely to arise. Quick action can make a huge difference. Consideration should be given to having the organization&rsquo;s attorney and CFO review all board minutes soon after they have been prepared. This is especially important when potentially litigious issues or significant, finance-related issues are discussed by the board.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Determining the Level of Detail to Include in Minutes: Determining the amount of detail to include in (board) meeting minutes may be challenging. Some minutes are so skeletal in nature that they do not represent a complete record of proceedings. Conversely, other minutes reveal far too much detail&mdash;even including what each member said about every issue. Neither of these approaches serves an organization well.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">It is vital to adopt a policy on how detailed the board minutes should be. Do not leave such an important decision to the discretion of individual secretaries. In</span></p><p class="cs63C0DF30"><span class="csD007A21A">Recording Church Board Minutes Page 2 of 10</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">deciding how detailed minutes should be, consider how a court might judge board actions if the minutes were examined. Most courts use the &ldquo;business judgment&rdquo; rule to decide if directors are carrying out their duties. This rule does not look so much at what a board has done as how the board went about its actions. A director must act prudently, in good faith, and in the best interests of the corporation. No one has a crystal ball, and the best-intentioned decisions will sometimes turn out horribly wrong.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">The minutes should contain sufficient detail so that if legal issues were to arise, the minutes would document the corporate body&rsquo;s prudence and responsibility in its decisions. However, minutes that read like a novel may subject the organization to undue legal liability should the minutes become discoverable in a legal action. Therefore, it is important to establish balance. The minutes should be adequately substantive so that the intent of all actions is easily understood, even if the minutes are later read by someone who did not attend the original meeting. Minutes should identify any agenda items that were not covered, as well as all responsibilities delegated for future activities.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Review and Approval of Minutes: After board meetings, draft minutes should be prepared promptly and reviewed by relevant parties. Draft minutes should be distributed to board members for review before the next board meeting. Organizations should encourage their boards to perform thorough reviews of minutes and to be alert to any potential problems or conflicts. The board may then vote to amend the minutes, or approve them as is. The secretary may then sign them and incorporate them into the board minute book, a process that should occur in a timely manner. Board minute books always should be well organized and up-to-date.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Meetings to Which These Procedures Apply: In addition to corporate board meetings, separate minutes should be maintained for each of the following:</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">1) Executive Committee meetings. If an executive committee of the board convenes between board meetings, separate minutes of executive committee meetings should also be maintained and presented to the full board for ratification at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 2) Audit Committee. If the organization utilizes an audit committee, the minutes of</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">meetings should be recorded. The board should be presented with minutes of audit committee meetings, and should act on any recommendations the audit committee makes. This will inform and assure the board that the audit review responsibilities are being met. 3) Annual meetings of members, nominating, and compensation committees.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Board Minutes Reference Systems: Some boards find it helpful to assign a sequential code (numbers, letters, or a combination of numbers and letters) to each action of the board and to record them in the board minutes. This provides an efficient means of cross- referencing board actions and preparing indexes and board meeting minutes.</span></p><p class="cs63C0DF30"><span class="csD007A21A">Recording Church Board Minutes Page 3 of 10</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Recording Board Policies: The board may adopt policies that deal with the way the board governs the ministry. To retain these policies for future reference by the board, it is often helpful to develop a board policy manual. New policies and changes to existing policies are recorded in the board policy manual following each board meeting.</span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Items to include in minutes: When taking minutes, include the following items:</span></p><p class="csAFA31FCB"><span class="csA7555675">Date, time, and place of meeting  </span></p><p class="csB4E0910F"><span class="csA7555675">Names of all voting board members, indicating whether each individual was present or absent (the listing of voting board members is the basis to determine if a quorum has been established in accordance with any quorum provisions in the bylaws)  </span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Names of any nonvoting board members, with these names listed separately from voting board members  </span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Names of all non-board members who are in attendance at the meeting, with these names listed separately from the board members  </span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Indication of whether a quorum of voting members is present (this includes determining if a quorum is present at the beginning of each session of the board; e.g., morning session, afternoon session, evening session, etc.)  </span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Who convened the meeting and an indication if proper notice was given to board members, as required by the bylaws  </span></p><p class="csAFA31FCB"><span class="csA7555675">Indication of whether this was a special or regular meeting  </span></p><p class="csAFA31FCB"><span class="csA7555675">Approval of the minutes of the most recent board meeting  </span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">Approval of any actions by the executive committee or other committees during the interim of board meetings  </span></p><p class="csB4E0910F"><span class="csA7555675">Notation as to any departures and reentries of board members to the board meeting (some boards only reflect changes in attendance at the beginning of each segment of a meeting; e.g., morning session, afternoon session, evening session, etc.)  </span></p><p class="cs7CCE9F5D"><span class="csA7555675">A record of every motion made, even if withdrawn.
