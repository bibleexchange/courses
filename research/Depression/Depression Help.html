		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4663348A">I suffered from depression for ten years. And even though things seemed almost hopeless at times, now it&#39;s over, I wouldn&#39;t trade what I learnt from having it. Not to say manic depression is good - it&#39;s not - but God used it to the good. </span><span class="cs31301148">&#39;Almost hopeless&#39;</span><span class="cs4663348A"> is important as God promises in the Bible never to leaves us utterly hopless in our trials, no matter what the situation - something I have found to be true. So what is the best treatment for depression?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1800F0CE">a quick fix . . .</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">There are 2 ways to deal with depression - you can buy your way out of it, filling your life with a constant stream of activties and pleasures which relieve the pain but never realy get to the root of the problem. Or you can accept that you have weaknesses, take hold of God&#39;s promise that he can overcome anything, and slowly begin to work through them with him, facing and overcoming each, one at a time. There is no quick fix with depression but it can be overcome.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1800F0CE">life&#39;s not easy!</span><span class="cs42A2E37D"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">One of the first things I had to learn before I was able to overcome depression was that </span><span class="cs1800F0CE">life isn&#39;t easy </span><span class="cs4663348A">and sometimes it can be especially so for Christians. It was however years before I took this to heart and so I had no relief - always expecting things to change for the better - not realising it was me that was going to have to change if I was going to survive in a tough world. Everyone else always looked so sorted. We&#39;re often told that God meets every need and this taken at face value leaves us disapointed and bewildered when we face trials. We are left wanting and feeling neglected. Often I wanted to die, seeing no hope - just a life of rules and regulations that I couldn&#39;t stick to and that were taking what little joy I had away. But in my concience I saw something spineless about throwing in the towel, and knew there must be more to suffering than met the eye. It was then I asked the question, if I were God, how would I make real men and women out of the fallible often frail people humans are. Therein lay the challenge. God had set before me a chance to become a fighter. Not just that, an honest fighter with a solid foundation that wouldn&#39;t be washed away when things got rough. I realised that people wern&#39;t quite as &#39;sorted&#39; as they appeared. Real men and women survive in a world constantly bombarded by temptations too numerous to mention, and are still standing at the end, with more faith and more patients than could ever be attained by having an easy ride. What could be more desirable than to be such a strong person!! But I had to be prepared to fight and not roll over and die - easier said than done. It meant facing myself and challenges head-on, bit at a time as I could handle it. I sought councelling (everyone needs different help). And there were many steps forward and many steps back. My battle with depression would last nearly 10 years. But I overcame it with God&#39;s help and the great news is, anyone can overcome depression! But my starting point was accepting that life isn&#39;t easy. It sounds obvious but many people never face this reality and hop from one thing to another never facing the deeper issues from which real maturity can begin to grow. Come to terms with this, and you&#39;re ready for anything. You can get on with the business of going higher and father than you ever imagined! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1800F0CE">the person as a whole - overall well-being</span><span class="cs42A2E37D"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">The general well being of a person depends on a balance of heart mind and body. When one part of the being is not working well, it will eventually have an effect on another part. For instance it is known that continual mental stress can negatively effect cholesterol levels. Even not eating properly can effect the way you feel. But the most important part of your person is your heart (not your physical one!). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Depression%20Help_files/image1.gif" width="74" height="109" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1800F0CE">who gets it?</span><span class="cs42A2E37D"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">Anyone can suffer from it but but some people more predisposed to depression than others since basic personality type is determined partly by genetic make up. However it is also obviously linked to personal circumstances, health, finances etc and of course a persons beliefs are going to have an effect.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1800F0CE">Why do some get depression and others not?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">Depression can take on many forms and there are lots of terms used to describe its type and severity which can make things confusing! Looking at the different personality types, you could predict that people would react differently to different situations. We all know people that respond well to problems like a rubber band, springing back and overcoming them. Often resulting in the person being better off than they were at the start. Others dont respond well to life&#39;s problems. They may analyse the problem, see no way out and get themselves in a downward spiral.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1800F0CE">People will react differently to the same situation.</span><span class="cs17B271C3"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">Person </span><span class="cs1800F0CE">A</span><span class="cs4663348A"> has lost his job. He dwells on his past experience and focuses on the long struggle ahead. Not only does this make him depressed and affect his performance in an interviews, it takes away the little motivation he had to start - the result is negative.<br/><br/>Person </span><span class="cs1800F0CE">B</span><span class="cs4663348A"> on the other hand becomes angry at loosing his job and rather than take out his frustration on his boss who has long since forgotten him, he channels it into finding a new job. Within 3 weeks he has succeeded in getting a better job than he had before. For him the result of being sacked has ended putting him in a better place than before!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs4663348A">A person needs to have confidence in God, themselves and their abilities - whatever the circumstances - not easy! </span><span class="csE5208FE0">(see <a class="cs1447905D" href="http://www.christianadvice.net/christian_self_esteem.htm"><span class="csF3B45C7">self-esteem</span></a></span><span class="csE5208FE0">)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1800F0CE">confide in the right people!</span><span class="cs17B271C3"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">If you reall feel down it&#39;s often tempting to confide in someone of the opposite sex. Sometimes the very people who we wish to attract. Not only are you displaying your lack of stability but in danger of becoming attached to the wrong person at a vulnerable time.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs42A2E37D"><img src="Depression%20Help_files/image0.jpg" width="79" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="cs1800F0CE">other things to avoid</span><span class="cs17B271C3"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A"><br/>This magazine claims to answer all your problems. In fact, its claims are empty. The only people left really smiling are the magazine companies. There have been recent studies that claim a link between depression, rising male suicide rates (brought on by rising insecurities) and the massive increase in soft porn magazines. Even magazines like GQ don&#39;t contain much useful. Young men especially, - do not read this stuff. It is not designed to seduce the stable but the unstable - people who arn&#39;t aware of soft porn&#39;s addictiveness. It will leave you feeling insecure. Exactly what we don&#39;t want as christians! Insecure is not attractive.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs17B271C3"><img src="Depression%20Help_files/image1.jpg" width="107" height="65" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="cs42A2E37D"><br/>what the Bible says</span><span class="cs17B271C3"><br/></span><span class="cs4663348A">The Bible says many times to guard your heart and to be careful of what you allow to enter it. It needs to be looked after and norished with good spiritual food and company. This food is the Word of God!! Feed your spirit bad spiritual food or keep bad company and it will soon affect the way you&#39;re thinking. The way your thinking will affect the way your feeling and might lead to depression or actions that you may regret. So as the bible says, keep every thought captive and don&#39;t allow bad thoughts to take root.
