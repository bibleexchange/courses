And we said, OK.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn&rsquo;t spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem. And we said, an expert should know what he&rsquo;s talking about so we won&rsquo;t spank them anymore.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">Then someone said that teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave. And the school administrators said no</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we don&rsquo;t want any bad publicity, and we surely don&rsquo;t want to be sued. And we accepted their reasoning.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">Then someone said, let&rsquo;s let our daughters have abortions if they want, and they won&rsquo;t even have to tell their parents. And we said, that&rsquo;s a grand idea.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">And then some of our top elected officials said that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs. And agreeing with them, we said it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me what anyone, including the President, does in private as long as I have a job and the economy is good.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">And the entertainment industry said, let&rsquo;s make TV shows and movies that promote profanity, violence, and illicit sex. And let&rsquo;s record music that</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">encourages homosexuality, rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and satanic themes. And we said it&rsquo;s just entertainment, it has no adverse effect,</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">and nobody takes it seriously anyway, so go right ahead.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">Therefore, now we&rsquo;re asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don&rsquo;t know right from wrong, and why it doesn&rsquo;t bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="cs5890E09F">Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with... &ldquo;we reap what we sow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"></p></body>
