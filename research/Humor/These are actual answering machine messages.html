		<p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">1.	My wife &amp; I can&rsquo;t come to the phone right now, but if you&rsquo;ll leave your name &amp; number we&rsquo;ll get back to you as soon as we&rsquo;re finished.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">3.	Hi. &nbsp;This is John: If you are the phone company, &nbsp;already sent the money. &nbsp;If you are my parents, please send money. &nbsp;If you are my financial aid institution, you didn&rsquo;t lend me enough money. &nbsp;If you are my friends, you owe me money. &nbsp;If you are a female, don&rsquo;t worry I have plenty of money.</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6FE56D2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">4.	Hi. Now you say something.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">5.	Hi, I&rsquo;m not home right now but my answering machine is, so you can talk to it instead. &nbsp;Wait for the beep.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">6.	Hello. &nbsp;I am David&rsquo;s answering machine.</span></p><p class="cs332056D6"><span class="csAEEDF97E">What are you?</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">8.	Hi. John&rsquo;s answering machine is broken. &nbsp;This is the refrigerator. &nbsp;Please speak very slowly, and I&rsquo;ll stick your message to myself with one of these magnets.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">9.	Hello, you are talking to a machine. &nbsp;I am capable of receiving messages. &nbsp;My owners do not need siding, windows, or a hot tub, and their carpets are clean. &nbsp;They give to charity through their office and do not need their picture taken. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re still with me, leave your name and number and they will get back to you.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">10.	This is not an answering machine this is a telepathic thought recording device. &nbsp;After the tone, think about your name, your reason for calling and a number where I can reach you, and I&rsquo;ll think about returning your call.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">11.	Hi. I am probably home. I&rsquo;m just avoiding someone I don&rsquo;t like. &nbsp;Leave me a message, and if I don&rsquo;t call back, it&rsquo;s you.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">12.	Hi, this is George. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t answer the phone right now. &nbsp;Leave a message, and then wait by your phone until &nbsp;I call you back.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">13.	If you are a burglar, then we&rsquo;re probably home cleaning our weapons right now and can&rsquo;t come to the phone. &nbsp;Otherwise, we probably aren&rsquo;t home and it&rsquo;s safe to leave a message.</span></p><p class="cs2620E72"><span class="csAEEDF97E">14.	Please leave a message. &nbsp;However, you have the right to remain silent. &nbsp;Everything you say will be recorded and will be used by us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
