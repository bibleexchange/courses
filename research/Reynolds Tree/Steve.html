Perhaps the cooks weren&#39;t even aware of it being there. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t get any call. &nbsp;If I had I would have called Shannon to see when she was coming in and maybe asked Glenda to cut it up and prepare it for a salad. &nbsp;I would only have had to buy one thing&hellip; Cool Whip &hellip;.. and we would have had a FREE nice fruit salad. &nbsp;Maybe Glenda could be &nbsp;put in charge of letting Tammy know each time stuff comes in &hellip;&hellip; or something. &nbsp;Tammy can let me know if it is something that she can&#39;t do. &nbsp;She just told me yesterday that she had time and wanted me to let her know if she could do something. &nbsp;The veggie still could be dealt with and cooked up for a stir-fry meal if they do it today. &nbsp;The rest is gone by, I am sure. &nbsp;As you know, every free meal is dollars saved.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Please don&#39;t get the mental impression that you hate to see these papers or listen to me. &nbsp;I am only trying to keep things running smoothly and I know you have a HUGE amount of responsibility on your shoulders. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know how you can continue to do all that is required of you, never mind try to find time to do physical work. &nbsp;I will be praying for you, Steve. &nbsp;We do appreciate all you are doing. &nbsp;You won&#39;t hear it much, but know that your Dad and I see all you are carrying for a load. &nbsp;The Center would not be running if it were not for your part. &nbsp;Be CAREFUL, however, to meet the needs of your wife and your body. &nbsp;You have to get rest!! &nbsp;You have to have a healthy body. &nbsp;If I can help in any way, please do not hesitate to let me know. &nbsp;As I speak, Elaine is teaching Joe how to use the machine in the learning center. &nbsp;The man that gave us the white tote gave Dad a machine that he was no longer using. &nbsp;We have it here and it can and will be a great help to the ministry. &nbsp;Joe needs to get involved and this can be done right in his room. &nbsp;So, if we can be of help typing or something, please let me know. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thanks, Mom</span></p></body>
