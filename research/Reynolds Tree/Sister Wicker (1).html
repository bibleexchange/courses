It is a small one, but all equipped so she could go with the tent etc. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	The last thing in the world that I would want to do is cause you any grief. &nbsp;If only I could get an understanding of what I have sent to your husband through to you. &nbsp;I know, you probably don&#39;t even want to know, but before God, if you only knew. &nbsp;All it is, Sister Wicker, is an opportunity to get some easy income. &nbsp;You could do it and earn as much as you do in a part time job, or even a full time one. &nbsp;The business is so simple. &nbsp;You simply have brochures, tapes or whatever and share them with people. &nbsp;People that you don&#39;t even know will take a wrapped tape and agree to let you call them to ask what they thought about it. &nbsp;Of course, not everyone will want any one thing. &nbsp;But this is something that everyone needs. &nbsp;Simply stated: a lawyer, prepaid to work for you when you need him. &nbsp;It covers five areas in life. If anyone needs a lawyer, they don&#39;t have to come up with the money up front to get one. &nbsp;Most people have not even made out a will. &nbsp;That is part of the plan. &nbsp;They want anyone to immediately get one. &nbsp;This is true even if you only have a vehicle. &nbsp;The seller doesn&#39;t have to know much at all. &nbsp;The &quot;tools&quot; do it for you. &nbsp;Of course, one has to familiarize himself with the content, however. &nbsp;They have 3-way calling to answer any questions that a prospect might have. &nbsp;We are taught not to answer questions, but rather to have a call made, or a tool played for the person or to have a person come and talk to them that has been in it for longer. &nbsp;It is so easy. &nbsp;You might not believe it because of words, but in reality, it is. &nbsp;Just passing out a tool and receiving a phone number so one can follow up is almost the extent of it. &nbsp;If there are meetings that one can go to in order to have input and encouragement, it is highly recommended. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	Do you realize that if you did this and people understood what they had in front of them, you would get money for them wanting the protection? &nbsp;If you would allow me to send you the video tape, would you watch it? &nbsp;It could help you so much in your finances. &nbsp;It has already brought in hundreds to James and John and over a hundred to me. &nbsp;Yes, there are &quot;tool&quot; to invest in. &nbsp;They are so cheap. &nbsp;It only costs one dollar for the cassettes. &nbsp;That is so good! &nbsp;&nbsp;There are things to know about the business and you don&#39;t get that all said in a letter if this kind. This is NOT a typical letter. &nbsp;You are a friend and I know this scares you, and I do understand. &nbsp;I want to try to help suppress those fears and give it a chance. &nbsp;What if this worked? &nbsp;What if this really did change things for your family? &nbsp;It has to many. &nbsp;It really has changed things for many!! &nbsp;I needed extra cash. &nbsp;I like, as you do, to be able to help my children. &nbsp;I enjoy that, and I know you do too. &nbsp;This is going to make me able to do so. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	My husband went to a salesman last night. &nbsp;He had known him a little bit from a car lot where he was working. &nbsp;They spent a very minimal amount of time with him and he could immediately see the potential. &nbsp;He asked for a dozen applications. &nbsp;He is going to call us and we will sign him and them up. &nbsp;That will be worth big bucks. I will get $30. prepaid commission on each person that he signs up plus him. &nbsp;That would mean $390.00 for me, because I don&#39;t have 3 managers under me. &nbsp;If and when I do, some of that would go to them. &nbsp;That is a part time job paycheck because of one conversation. &nbsp;That isn&#39;t bad. &nbsp;Of course, that doesn&#39;t happen every time. &nbsp;But the potential is there. &nbsp;We are excited with it. &nbsp;We both do it and it is beginning to grow. &nbsp;I am going to try to find out how far a person is from where you live that is a professional is. &nbsp;The 3-way calling will do it all for you. &nbsp;They have special times that thy set aside to explain to any interested prospect. &nbsp;There are different ways of doing it. &nbsp;Some are just working with video tapes and they sit in their homes and let it play and then sign the members up. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	I&#39;m going to close. &nbsp;I hope I haven&#39;t said anything to you to make you unhappy. &nbsp;I only want to help. &nbsp;This is not a quit your job and go work for Pre-paid. &nbsp;This is a side job until you build your business big enough to be getting more than you are at your present job. &nbsp;We went to a meeting to hear a man that got in 4 years ago and he gets 1/4 million dollars each year. It has already made him a millionaire. &nbsp;Not everyone will get to that status, for sure. &nbsp;Many are getting to where this brings in more than their jobs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	I love you, Sister Wicker. &nbsp;I trust this turns out to be more than you ever dreamed of. &nbsp;I hope this will help you in ways that you have always wanted the stability of financial status. This would take you off your feet forever. &nbsp;This could free you up in many ways. &nbsp;I know my husband said you shared with him about the &quot;anger.&quot; &nbsp;He told me he was going to be praying. &nbsp;I know you don&#39;t want this. This is the enemy and we all know it. &nbsp;I once experienced it. &nbsp;God set me free. &nbsp;Keep believing Him. &nbsp;He is going to work in your behalf. &nbsp;I know He is. &nbsp;I love you. &nbsp;If you can squeeze in time, drop me a note. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">						In Christian love,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">						Sister Reynolds</span></p></body>
