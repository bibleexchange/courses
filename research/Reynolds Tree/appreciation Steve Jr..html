Nursing home ministry, street work, singing with the rest&hellip;. Anything you can do would always be appreciated. &nbsp;He really wants to, I think. &nbsp;He watches you. &nbsp;He respects you. &nbsp;He repeats some of your advice. &nbsp;He thinks about the remarks you offer. &nbsp;Thanks!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">							Grammy</span></p></body>
