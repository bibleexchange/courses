		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">To the family in Christ at the Del. Institute,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">My name is Lateef. &nbsp;I am writing you from the confines of Cumberland County Jail. &nbsp;I was recently incarcerated here for a violation of probation which I was placed on in July of 2000. &nbsp;I was arrested on July 5</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"> for failing to adhere to the guidelines of probation. &nbsp;I got a new charge for assaulting a man. &nbsp;I am telling you all this to be open and honest with my brethren. &nbsp;If I have left out any pressing details or if you have any questions on my legal matters, feel free to ask. &nbsp;I have been shown by the Lord that honesty gets results.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	Moving on, the most miraculous part of my stay has been that the last 2 months I have lived behind bars, I have been spiritually revealing in no small way. &nbsp;But before I describe the joy and freedom I have been feeling (though I am physically confined), I would like to tell you somewhat about myself.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	I am from Maine. &nbsp;I was born here in Portland at the MMC. Most of my life I have spent living in the greater Portland area (except some months I lived and worked in Sacramento, CA. St. John, V. I., and Dorchester, MA as a youth). &nbsp;My family is rooted here and considering the amount of energy I put into &quot;escaping&quot; Maine, I feel God always brings me back to remain. &nbsp;So, I have finally surrendered.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	At a very young age I was a rebel. &nbsp;Pushed and pulled against every authority in front of or around me. Home life wasn&#39;t too peachy, so at the age of 14 I was running away, spending time in group homes, on the streets, and a </span><span class="csE163F6C2">lot</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"> of time at the Maine Youth Center. (crimes like assault, car thefts, and vandalism)All the time using marijuana or alcohol, or any other form of intoxicant.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Yet even during these times there seemed to be a &quot;threshold&quot; of evil .I would not cross. &nbsp;Looking back I would say that I always knew in my heart that there was a God. &nbsp;Even though satan had a stronghold over me with a number of his vices and delusions (money, drugs, woman, * anger) &nbsp;The Lord had a protective Angel over me, and He blessed me with a real strong conscience and compassion for others. &nbsp;I ran with a pretty wild bunch who are all doing </span><span class="csE163F6C2">real time </span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">in the Maine State Prison in Warren. &nbsp;In fact there is four of us, I am the only one left who is not doing or facing serious time for a serious crime. &nbsp;This is not coincidence! &nbsp;When I was released from the &quot;Youth Center&quot; at age sixteen, I sincerely wanted to stay out of jail. &nbsp;Yet I did not want to give up my sinful vices: marijuana, alcohol, women. &nbsp;What I figured was that if I settled down with a strong woman and try to stay focused. &nbsp;I would not go down the road that I watched so many of my brothers and &nbsp;elders go down. &nbsp;You see at 16 I was deemed &quot;pretty intelligent&quot; even &quot;mature&quot; for my age. &nbsp;And if I do say so myself &hellip; I was a pretty good ACTOR. &nbsp;Opart of the reason today I battle with pride.is because people around me praised me so, but they never saw the scared little tramp inside me. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	So I bamboozled an older woman into falling in love with me (I was 16 she was 23). &nbsp;She lead children (I have none of my own&quot; previously, and I spent the next six or seven years destroying all their lives with my</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">infidelity, abuse, addictions, and frequent trips to the hoosegow. &nbsp;Last summer &nbsp;&quot;01 my now 3x-wife finally had enough and got the strength to say enough is enough. &nbsp;We had been to counseling, churches, she went to the military, I went to the nuthase, and twice I had run away from her and the kids to California, only to come back to Maine and rekindle the sick little frame.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	Well, something finally &quot;gave&quot; as they say, (Here&#39;s the good part), towards the end of our broken relationship, some vfriends (read Angels) brought me to a little storefront church in Brunswick. &nbsp;I was living in </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Bath at the time off and on with my ex-wife, and we were desperate. &nbsp;So I walked in tho Life Tabernacle Pentecostal Church. &nbsp;The Pastor &nbsp;there, &nbsp;Michael White, and I hit it off real great. &nbsp;But everything was strange to me. &nbsp;All my life I prided myself on &quot;being a man,&quot; &nbsp;I was intelligent and mature for my age and I &quot;didn&#39;t cry.&quot; &nbsp;I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;I walked through those doors during a mid-week service and I never felt so much at home. &nbsp;All those years I spent running and running, and running. &nbsp;I finally felt like I didn&#39;t have to run anymore.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	I cried, I cried. I cried. &nbsp;It took some time. &nbsp;My wife encouraged me to enroll in college. (SMTC) &nbsp;I went to Life Tabernacle and cried. &nbsp;Yet I still did not get it. &nbsp;I went to jail . &nbsp;My wife left me, I cried. &nbsp;Man, every time I walked in that church I cried. &nbsp;That was all last fall. &quot;01 and winter until July 5</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">. &nbsp;God was calling. &nbsp;I was still running though. &nbsp;And honestly it was my pride. &nbsp;I thought I &quot;had it.&quot; It was like God had shown me all He could give me: an apartment of my own, a heautiful church family, a job with the bosses&#39;favor (I was promoted to assistant manager ikn 30 days), and He even allowed me to be on speaking terms with my ex and her children. &nbsp;(She has since moved from Maine * we don&#39;t tal, but I pray for her and I know God portects them.) &nbsp;Well after God blessed me with some stability and I finally felt like I could be on my way &hellip; You know the rest. &nbsp;I wanted to drive. &nbsp;My. Prideful told God that He could &quot;run things from here.&quot; &nbsp;Thanks God but I got it&quot; that was probably late February or early March of this year. &nbsp;Needless to say my church attendance went down. &nbsp;I barely held my job. &nbsp;I lost my apartment, and Mr. Man was seeking worldly things again, mariuauna, booze, women. &nbsp;I went from somewhere to nowhere fast in a few months flat. &nbsp;Then I came to jail in July. &nbsp;For valiantly coming to the aid of a friend who was being attacked (insert laugh here) I was furious. &nbsp;&quot;God, what was the point!&quot; &nbsp;&quot;It was all your fault.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Why didn&#39;t you just give me what I wanted!&quot; &nbsp;I was hoppin mad at God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	What a fool! &nbsp;I can&#39;t believe He even wanted to deal with me any more. &nbsp;He sent me to jail to protect me from me&hellip; &nbsp;to protect me from satan and the world. &nbsp;Then not only did He send me to jail, He sent me a man. &nbsp;A pastor away from home: &nbsp;Gregory Lee. &nbsp;This brother set me straight. &nbsp;God blessed Greg with wisdom and Mr. Lee gave me some. &nbsp;For my first three days here in C.C.J. all I wanted to do was lash out at my circumstances. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;I wanted to control somebody. &nbsp;Make God pay for what I felt He did to me. &nbsp;It&#39;s amazing the Lord didn&#39;t smote me right there. &nbsp;Really miraculous the patience God showed with His angry little Mr. Pride. &nbsp;Greg told me one word. &nbsp;OPPORTUNITY. &nbsp;Greg told me this was an oppo9rtunity to grow. &nbsp;To strengthen my life&#39;s walk. &nbsp;The man said yea I could go to the library and work out my mind, or I could go to the gym and build my physical muscles. &nbsp;I could do either of those (and I did) but what he said next stuck. &nbsp;Greg told me the biggest opportunity I would benefit from is to strengthen my spirit. &nbsp;OPPORTUNITY!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	After that my hunger for His Word, His Holy Word, came back. &nbsp;I was reading the Bible and praying and even fasting again. &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t do those things before, because I was trying to use my will. &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t finish High School or College because I was trying to use my will. &nbsp;My marriage didn&#39;t hold together and I couldn&#39;t keep my finances together, or keep my apartment because I didn&#39;t have the power. &nbsp;He did. &nbsp;All that time He spent trying to get me to see that He loved me and wanted me to have my hearts desires, but I had to surrender to His will. &nbsp;Mr. Pride could NOT DO IT! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	I want to be a teacher. &nbsp;I want to go into psychotherapy (counseling) and I wold love to be a minister someday. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">All three are possible. &nbsp;I just have to do it. &nbsp;God&#39;s way. &nbsp;Him first. &nbsp;And I want to start when I leave here. &nbsp;I honestly do not know when that is. &nbsp;(I don&#39;t even have a court date yet.) &nbsp;But patience is going to have her perfect work in me. &nbsp;The sixty or so days I have been here, have been like hours. &nbsp;I will wait on God. &nbsp;I believe He wants me to attend your courses there at the Deliverance Institute, of course, you all will have to feel it in your hearts to accept me. &nbsp;I do not know the protocol. &nbsp;All I know is what Mr. Lee told me that was enough. &nbsp;I have no responsibilities at this present time . &nbsp;My only obligation is my commitment to Jesus. &nbsp;And as I understand, you folks are big on commitment. &nbsp;If you would be so kind to send some literature and please &hellip; any and all questions you have for me. &nbsp;God will guide and I will answer them as best and honest as I can. &nbsp;I will also be sure to correspond often (ifyou are so willing to receive such wretched scrawlings), so that you all can be a little more familiar with the kind of man God has created as well as what&#39;s going on in my legal standings. &nbsp;I understand Mr&gt; Lee is cast in a good light there at the institute, so please feel free to ask him of his opinion on me. &nbsp;I&#39;ll inform him not to hold back. &nbsp;(I told you my head is pretty big.) &nbsp;I pray I will meet the good brothers and sisters there at the Deliverance Center in a more personal way. &nbsp;On however God&#39;s basis of the visit will be, I look forward to it. &nbsp;In the meantime&hellip;.. &nbsp;God&#39;s love and God bless. &nbsp;Lateef.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">After thought: Feel free to call Pastor Michael White in regards to my testimony.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">721-0797</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Life Tabernacle in Brunswick</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">	</span></p></body>
