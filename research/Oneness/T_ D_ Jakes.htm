      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>Questioner:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial> My first 
      question would be, the Trinity would be defined as one God Who's revealed 
      Himself in three distinct Persons, each co-equal and co-eternal. How 
      important is it for the believing Christian to hold to this 
      belief?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial>T. D. Jakes:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial> I think 
      it's very, very significant that we first of all study the Trinity apart 
      from salvation, and first of all that we embrace Christ and come to Him 
      and come to know Who He is. Having come to know Who He is, then we begin 
      to deal with the Trinity, which I believe is a very complex issue. <B>The 
      Trinity, the <IMG height=165 src="T_ D_ Jakes_files/tdjakes.jpg" width=160 
      align=left border=0 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">term Trinity, is not a biblical 
      term, to begin with. It's a theological description for something that is 
      so beyond human comprehension that </B></FONT><B><FONT face=Arial 
      color=#ff0000>I'm not sure that we can totally hold God to a numerical 
      system.</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000> </FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial>The Lord said, "Behold, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one, and 
      beside Him there is no other." When God got ready to make a man that 
      looked like Him, He didn't make three. He made one man. However, that one 
      man had three parts. He was body, soul and spirit. </FONT><B><FONT 
      face=Arial color=#ff0000>We have one God, but He is Father in creation, 
      Son in redemption, and Holy Spirit in regeneration.</FONT></B><FONT 
      face=Arial> It's very important that we understand that, but I think that 
      the first thing that every believer needs to do is to approach God by 
      faith, and then having approached Him by faith, then they need to sit up 
      under good teaching so that they can begin to understand who the God is 
      that they have believed upon." ("Living by the Word" on KKLA, hosted by
