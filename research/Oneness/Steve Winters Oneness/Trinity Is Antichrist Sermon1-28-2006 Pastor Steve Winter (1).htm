<H3>Trinity Is Antichrist Sermon - Pastor Steve Winter</H3>
<P>&nbsp;These are my notes that I used to preach tonight's (1/28/2006)<BR>I 
have uploaded it to <A

size=4>The word "antichrist" appears 4 time in the Holy Bible in four separate 
verses.</P>
<P>1 John 2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that 
antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that 
it is the last time.</P>
<P>1 John 2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus&lt;2424&gt; is the 
Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.</P>
<P>1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus&lt;2424&gt; Christ 
is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, 
whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the 
world.</P>
<P>2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not 
that Jesus&lt;2424&gt; Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an 
antichrist.</P>
<P>In each of these verses the word translated as Jesus comes from reference 
2424. Since words do mean things so let us look at the definition of the word. 
If we are to understand a Bible verse then we need to know the meaning of the 
words used in that verse, eh?</P>
<P></P>
<P>2424 Iesous {ee-ay-sooce’} </P>
<P>of Hebrew origin 03091; TDNT - 3:284,360; n pr m </P>
<P>AV - Jesus 972, Jesus (Joshua) 2, Jesus (Justus) 1; 975 </P>
<P>Jesus = "Jehovah is salvation" <BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Notice also the Hebrew of 03091</P>
<P>03091 Y@howshuwa‘ {yeh-ho-shoo’-ah} or Y@howshu‘a {yeh-ho-shoo’-ah} </P>
<P>from 03068 and 03467; </P>
<P>AV - Joshua 218; 218 </P>
<P>Joshua or Jehoshua = "Jehovah is salvation" n pr m </P>
<P>Then notice the Hebrew for 03068 referred to above:</P>
<P>03068 Y@hovah {yeh-ho-vaw’} </P>
<P>from 01961; TWOT - 484a; n pr dei </P>
<P>AV - LORD 6510, GOD 4, JEHOVAH 4, variant 1; 6519 </P>
<P>Jehovah = "the existing One" </P>
<P>1) the proper name of the one true God </P>
<P>1a) unpronounced except with the vowel pointings of 0136 </P>
<P>The trinity does not teach that "Jehovah Savior" came in the flesh, but 
rather teaches that a "second person", or "junior deity" came in the flesh. Does 
the trinity teach that Jehovah Himself died on the cross for your sins or do 
they teach a "junior person", a second person in a man made god squad?</P>
<P>Many are taught John 3:16 but what about 1 John 3:16</P>
<P>1 John 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life 
for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</P>
<P>That does not say that a junior god person died on the cross now does it? It 
says that God laid down His life. Now a lot of people say that God cannot die 
and in the sense they are saying that they are correct that God cannot cease to 
exist. </P>
<P>However, God is the inventor of life and death so God is able to die and then 
raise Himself from the dead. You think that is a stretch consider the following 
verses.</P>
<P>John 2:19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in 
three days I will raise it up.<BR>20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was 
this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?<BR>21 But he 
spake of the temple of his body.<BR>22 When therefore he was risen from the 
dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they 
believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</P>
<P>God is also the inventor of time as well as life and death. Life and death 
are tools in his hands.</P>
<P>2 Peter 3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is 
with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</P>
<P>But anyway back to our topic of why trinitarianism is not merely stupid and 
foolish, it is actually antichrist!</P>
<P>There is also another group of verses that warn particularly against 
polytheistic theories, and further declare them capable of "spoiling".</P>
<P></P>
<P>Colossians 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain 
deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not 
after Christ.<BR>Colossians 2:9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the 
Godhead bodily.<BR>Colossians 2:10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head 
of all principality and power:</P>
<P></P>
<P>Let us review our original verses and simply substitute Jehovah for Jesus 
since we know that is the actual definition of the word "Jesus".</P>
<P>1 John 2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that 
antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that 
it is the last time.</P>
<P>1 John 2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus&lt;2424&gt; is the 
Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.</P>
<P>1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus&lt;2424&gt; Christ 
is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, 
whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the 
world.</P>
<P>2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not 
that Jesus&lt;2424&gt; Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an 
antichrist.</P>
<P>That's right friend. Trinitarianism is not merely stupid foolish and 
deceitful, it really is ANTICHRIST!</P>
<P>Consider also this verse regarding the human tendency that man has to "make 
up" his own "gods" (If people didn't get a measure of peace and satisfaction 
they wouldn't have been worshipping creations of their own minds for 
centuries).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Jeremiah 5:7 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, 
and sworn by [them that are] no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then 
committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' 
houses.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Jeremiah 16:20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they [are] no 
gods?</P>
<P></P>
<P>Genesis 3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in 
the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of 
the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</P>
<P></P>
<P>According to the trinity there would had to have been 5 pair of feet walking 
in the garden in this verse. 1 pair for Adam, 1 pair for Eve and three pair for 
the trinity that they were hiding from. Of course the more scholarly of the 
trinitarians might suggest that there were only 4 pair of feet actually walking 
because god person #2 was riding on the right hand of god person #1 and I 
suppose they could have their</P>
<P>god person #3 flying around. To a lot of them their concept of "god" is 
senior, junior and birdie as it were.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Also let us consider the trinitarian attempt to preach plural gods from Gen 
1:26:</P>
<P></P>
<P>Genesis 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: 
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the 
air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing 
that creepeth upon the earth.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Too bad they didn't read just one more verse, eh?</P>
<P>Genesis 1:27 So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God 
created he him; male and female created he them.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Shouldn't verse 27 read "created they them"? And if the "trinity" of three 
created Adam in "their image", where are the other two Adam persons? We need two 
other "persons" here. I mean, if one "person" can sit on the other "person"'s 
right hand then where were Adam's two "co-equal" persons. Then we would need a 
trinity of wives.</P>
<P>Was Adam, created in God's image, three separate persons one of which was 
sitting on the hand of the other? But don't forget our theme, trinitarianism is 
not merely stupid and foolish but it is very evil and harmful.</P>
<P>We have many trinitarians who claim to be "one god", Biblically Christian, 
and monotheistic. How can this be?</P>
<P>2 Corinthians 11:12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off 
occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be 
found even as we.<BR>13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, 
transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.<BR>14 And no marvel; for 
Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.<BR>15 Therefore it is no 
great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of 
righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.<BR><BR>Is not the 
devil the father of lies? We should not be surprised when his false-christian 
ministers will lie too, eh?</P>
<P>In the above verses Paul says that it is Biblical to try to cut off occasion 
from the Satanic ministers who will be pretending to be ministers of 
righteousness.</P>
<P>Revelation 17:1 ¶ And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven 
vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee 
the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:<BR>2 With whom 
the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the 
earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.<BR>3 So he carried 
me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet 
coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten 
horns.<BR>4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked 
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full 
of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:<BR>5 And upon her forehead 
was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND 
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.<BR>6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of 
the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I 
wondered with great admiration.</P>
<P>Which church is the mother of the harlot trinity denominations? Is it not the 
RCC herself.</P>
