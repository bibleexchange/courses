		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Men of Qumran and the Messiah</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Juma was beginning to get nervous. Some of his <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/goat.html"><span class="cs92015F65">goats</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> were climbing too high up the cliffs. He decided to climb the face of the cliff himself to bring them back. Little did Juma realize as he began his climb on that January day in 1947 that those straying goats would eventually involve him in &ldquo;the greatest archaeological discovery in the twentieth century.&rdquo; Such thoughts were far from his mind when he saw two small openings to one of the thousands of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/cave.html"><span class="cs92015F65">caves</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> that dot those barren cliffs overlooking the northwestern shore of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/deadsea.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Dead Sea</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He threw a rock into one of the openings. The unexpected cracking sound surprised him; what else could be in those remote caves but treasure? He called to his cousins, Khalil and Muhammed, who climbed up and heard the exciting tale. But it was getting late, and the goats had to be gathered. Tomorrow they would return&mdash;perhaps their days of following goats would come to an end once the treasure was uncovered!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Discovery%20of%20the%20Scrolls_files/image1.gif" width="218" height="151" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Cave 4 at Qumran where approximately 15,000 fragments from some 574 manuscripts were found.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The youngest of the three, Muhammed, rose the next day before his two fellow &ldquo;treasure-seekers&rdquo; and made his way to the cave. The cave floor was covered with debris, including broken <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/pottery.html"><span class="cs92015F65">pottery</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Along the wall stood a number of narrow jars, some with their bowl-shaped covers still in place. Frantically, Muhammed began to explore the inside of each jar, but no treasure of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/gold.html"><span class="cs92015F65">gold</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> was to be found&hellip; only a few bundles wrapped in cloth and greenish with age. Returning to his cousins, he related the sad news&mdash;no treasure.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No treasure indeed! The scrolls those Bedouin boys removed from that dark cave that day and the days following would come to be recognized as the greatest manuscript treasure ever found&mdash;the first seven manuscripts of the Dead Sea Scrolls!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Such was the discovery of a group of manuscripts which were a thousand years older than the then-oldest-known <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/hebrewlanguage.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Hebrew</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> texts of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/bible.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Bible</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (manuscripts, many of which were written more than 100 years before the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/christmas/home.html"><span class="cs92015F65">birth</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/jesus.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Jesus</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). These manuscripts would excite the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/archaeology/home.html"><span class="cs92015F65">archaeological world</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and provide a team of translators with a gigantic task that even to this day has not been completed.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The story of how those scrolls traveled from the hands of young Bedouin goat herders to be under the scrutinous eyes of international scholars is stranger than fiction. Although all the details of the next few years will probably never be known for sure, this much is clear. After hanging from a pole in a Bedouin tent for a period of time, the seven original scrolls were sold to two separate Arab antiquities dealers in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/bethlehem.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Bethlehem</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. From there, four were sold (for a small amount) to Athanasius Samuel, Syrian Orthodox Metropolitan at St. Mark&#39;s Monastery in the Old City of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/jerusalem.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Jerusalem</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Scholars at the American School of Oriental Research, who examined them, were the first to realize their antiquity. John Trever photographed them in detail, and the great archaeologist William F. Albright soon announced that the scrolls were from the period between 200 BC and AD 200. The initial announcements were then made that the oldest manuscripts ever discovered had been found in the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/judea.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Judean</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/desert.html"><span class="cs92015F65">desert</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Discovery%20of%20the%20Scrolls_files/image2.gif" width="151" height="223" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Clay jar of the type the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in. From Qumran, now in the Citadel Museum, Jordan.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Three of the other original scrolls found by the Bedouin boys were sold to E. L. Sukenik, archaeologist at Hebrew University and father of Yigal Yadin (a general in the Israeli army who later became a famous archaeologist and excavator of Masada and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/hazor.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Hazor</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). It should be noted that the drama of these events was heightened because these were the last days of the British Mandate period in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/palestine.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Palestine</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and tensions between the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/arab.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Arab</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and Jewish population were great. This made examination of the scrolls by scholars extremely dangerous.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All of the scrolls finally came together at Hebrew University under another strange set of circumstances. After touring the U.S. with his four scrolls and not being able to find an interested buyer, Metropolitan Samuel placed an ad in the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. By coincidence (or divine providence?) Yigal Yadin happened to be lecturing in New York and saw the advertisement. Through intermediaries, he was able to purchase these priceless scrolls for around $250,000. In February of 1955, the Prime Minister of Israel announced that the State of Israel had purchased the scrolls, and all seven (including the three purchased earlier by Professor Sukenik) were to be housed in a special museum at Hebrew University named the Shrine of the Book, where they can be seen today.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Needless to say, the initial announcement about the scrolls prompted feverish searches in the area of the original discoveries. An official archaeological expedition was begun in 1949 which eventually resulted in the discovery of ten additional <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/cave.html"><span class="cs92015F65">caves</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in the surrounding area also containing scrolls. The archaeologists then directed their attention to a small ruin nearby called &quot;Khirbet (ruins of) Qumran,&quot; which had been thought of as the remains of an old <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/rome.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Roman</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> fortress. After six seasons of intensive excavation, the scholars were sure beyond any reasonable doubt that the scrolls found their origin in this community which flourished between 125 BC and AD 68. The scrolls had been stored in haste in the caves as the community fled the encroaching Roman army, which was in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/judea.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Judea</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to put down the Jewish Revolt of AD 66-70.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The ruins of Qumran, which can be visited today, revealed that a substantial group of Jewish ascetics inhabited this community. Storehouses, aqueducts, ritual <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/baths.html"><span class="cs92015F65">baths</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and an assembly hall were all uncovered. One of the most interesting rooms uncovered was a scriptorium, identified by two ink wells discovered there along with some benches for <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/scribes.html"><span class="cs92015F65">scribes</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. It was in this room that many, if not all, of the discovered manuscripts were copied.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As soon as the announcement of the scrolls&#39; discovery was made, the scholarly debates about their origin and significance began.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Those seven original scrolls were just the beginning. Over six hundred scrolls and thousands of fragments have been discovered in the 11 caves of the Qumran area. Fragments of every Biblical book except <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/estherbookof.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Esther</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> have been found, as well as many other non-Biblical texts.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the most fascinating of the finds was a <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/copper.html"><span class="cs92015F65">copper</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> scroll which had to becut in strips to be opened and which contained a list of 60 treasures located in various parts of Judea (none of which have been found)!

This has been appropriately called the &ldquo;Temple Scroll.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls indicate that their authors were a group of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/priest.html"><span class="cs92015F65">priests</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and laymen pursuing a communal life of strict dedication to God.

This wicked priest was probably one of the Maccabean rulers who had illegitimately assumed the high priesthood between 150-140 BC. Most scholars have identified the Qumran brotherhood with the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/essenes.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Essenes</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, a Jewish sect of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/jesus.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Jesus&#39;</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> day described by Josephus and Philo.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Whoever the men of Qumran were, their writings provide us with a marvelous background picture of one aspect of the religious world into which Jesus came. Some have sought to draw parallels between figures in the scrolls and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/johnthebaptist.html"><span class="cs92015F65">John the Baptist</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> or <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/jesus.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Jesus</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, but an objective examination of such parallels reveals that the differences are greater than the similarities. Any contact of Jesus with Qumran is entirely speculative and most improbable. The suggestion that John the Baptist may have spent some time with the Qumran community is possible, since the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/gospels.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Gospels</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> tell us that he spent considerable time in the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/wilderness.html"><span class="cs92015F65">wilderness</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> near the area where the Qumran community is located (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/mat3.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">Mt. 3:1-3</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/mark1.html#4"><span class="cs92015F65">Mk. 1:4</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; Lk. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/luke1.html#80"><span class="cs92015F65">1:80</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/luke3.html#2"><span class="cs92015F65">3:2-3</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/john1.html"><span class="cs92015F65">John</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&#39;s message, however, differed markedly from that of the Qumran brotherhood. The only real common point was that they both taught that the &quot;<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/kingdomofgod.html"><span class="cs92015F65">kingdom of God</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; was coming.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One of the most important contributions of the Dead Sea Scrolls is the numerous Biblical manuscripts which have been discovered. Until those discoveries at Qumran, the oldest manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures were copies from the 9th and 10th centuries AD by a group of Jewish scribes called the Massoretes. Now we have manuscripts around a thousand years older than those. The amazing truth is that these manuscripts are almost identical! Here is a strong example of the tender care which the Jewish <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/scribes.html"><span class="cs92015F65">scribes</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> down through the centuries took in an effort to accurately copy the sacred <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/scripture.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Scriptures</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The men of Qumran fervently believed in a doctrine of &ldquo;last things.&rdquo; They had fled to the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/desert.html"><span class="cs92015F65">desert</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and were readying themselves for the imminent judgment, when their enemies would be vanquished and they, God&#39;s elect, would be given final victory in accordance with the predictions of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/prophet.html"><span class="cs92015F65">prophets</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. It was in connection with these end-time events that one of the most fascinating teachings of the sect emerges.

As a matter of fact, evidence shows that they actually believed in three messiahs&mdash;one a <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/prophet.html"><span class="cs92015F65">prophet</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, another a <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/priest.html"><span class="cs92015F65">priest</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and the third a <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/king.html"><span class="cs92015F65">king</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> or <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/prince.html"><span class="cs92015F65">prince</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the document mentioned earlier called the &ldquo;Manual of Discipline&rdquo; or the &quot;Rule of the Community,&quot; it is laid down that the faithful should continue to live under the rule &quot;until the coming of a prophet and the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/anoint.html"><span class="cs92015F65">anointed</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> ones [messiahs] of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/aaron.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Aaron</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and Israel&quot; (column 9, line 11).

The Qumran community and the early Christians agreed that in the days of the fulfillment of Old Testament <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/messianicprophecies.html"><span class="cs92015F65">prophecies</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> there would arise a great prophet, a great priest and a great king. But these three figures remained distinct in Qumran expectation, whereas the New Testament saw them unified in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One more manuscript that has come to light in recent years provides a fascinating background to the New Testament messianic hope. It has been reconstructed from twelve small fragments, furnishing less than two columns of writing; but this much can be ascertained from its brief contents. It is a prediction of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/christmas/home.html"><span class="cs92015F65">birth</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of a Wonderful Child, possibly drawing on <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/isa9.html#6"><span class="cs92015F65">Isaiah 9:6-7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: &quot;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given... and his <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/namesofgod.html"><span class="cs92015F65">name</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> shall be called Wonderful.&quot; This child will bear special marks on His body and will be distinguished by <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/wisewisdom.html"><span class="cs92015F65">wisdom</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and intelligence. He will be able to probe the secrets of all living creatures, and He will inaugurate the new age for which the faithful fervently awaited.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Is it not striking that soon after this manuscript was composed, a child wa sborn who fulfilled the hopes of Israel and inaugurated a new age? Although the men of Qumran were mistaken in the details of their messiah, they did expect one whose general characteristics were strikingly illustrated by Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God and Messiah. It is not known if some early Christian brought the message of Jesus to this wilderness community. We are left only to speculate on how they would have responded to the Wonderful Child born in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/bethlehem.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Bethlehem</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> who was the Prophet, Priest and King of Israel.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC382D2BB">ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Dr. Will Varner is Professor of Old Testament at The Master&#39;s College and Director of IBEX, the college&#39;s campus in Israel.
