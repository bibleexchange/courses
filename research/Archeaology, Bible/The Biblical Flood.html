This would have caused the growth of lush vegetation on the land all around the globe. The discovery of coal seams in Antarctica containing vegetation that is not now found growing at the poles, but which obviously grew under warmer conditions, was taken as support for these ideas.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c010.html#10"><span class="cs92015F65">[10]</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csDA5A99D0"><a class="cs654FAE9F" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs777ED152"><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image15.jpg" width="151" height="113" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A vapor canopy would also affect the global wind systems. Also, the mountains were almost certainly not as high before the flood as they are today, as we shall see. In today&#39;s world, the major winds and high mountain ranges are a very important part of the water cycle that brings rain to the continents. Before the flood, however, these factors would have caused the weather systems to be different.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Those interested in studying this further should consult Dillow&#39;s and Vardiman&#39;s works.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

But where did those waters go after the flood?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are a number of Scripture passages that identify the flood waters with the present-day seas (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/amos9.html#6"><span class="cs92015F65">Amos 9:6</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/job38.html#8"><span class="cs92015F65">Job 38:8-11</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> note &ldquo;waves&rdquo;). If the waters are still here, why are the highest mountains not still covered with water, as they were in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/noah.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Noah&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> day? <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/psa104.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Psalm 104</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> suggests an answer. After the waters covered the mountains (verse 6), God rebuked them and they fled (verse 7); the mountains rose, the valleys sank down (verse 8) and God set a boundary so that they will never again cover the earth (verse 9)<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-floodwater.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">[1]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. They are the same waters!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Isaiah gives this same statement that the waters of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/noah.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Noah</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> would never again cover the earth (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/isa54.html#9"><span class="cs92015F65">Isaiah 54:9</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Clearly, what the Bible is telling us is that God acted to alter the earth&#39;s topography. New continental landmasses bearing new mountain chains of folded rock strata were uplifted from below the globe-encircling waters that had eroded and leveled the pre-Flood topography, while large deep ocean <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/basin.html"><span class="cs92015F65">basin</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> were formed to receive and accommodate the Flood waters that then drained off the emerging continents. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csDA5A99D0"><a class="cs654FAE9F" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs777ED152"><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image17.jpg" width="192" height="129" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That is why the oceans are so deep, and why there are folded mountain ranges. Indeed, if the entire earth&#39;s surface were leveled by smoothing out the topography of not only the land surface but also the rock surface on the ocean floor, the waters of the ocean would cover the earth&#39;s surface to a depth of 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers). We need to remember that nearly 70 percent of the earth&#39;s surface is still covered by water. Quite clearly, then, the waters of Noah&#39;s Flood are in today&#39;s ocean basins.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">A Mechanism?</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The catastrophic plate tectonics model gives a mechanism for the deepening of the oceans and the rising of mountains at the end of the flood.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As the new ocean floors cooled, they would have become denser and sunk, allowing water to flow off the continents. Movement of the water off the continents and into the oceans would have weighed down the ocean floor and lightened the continents, resulting in the further sinking of the ocean floor, as well as upward movement of the continents.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-floodwater.html#2"><span class="cs92015F65">[2]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The deepening of the ocean basins and the rising of the continents would have resulted in more water running off the land.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The collision of the tectonic plates would have pushed up mountain ranges also, especially toward the end of the flood.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image18.jpg" width="151" height="85" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Could the Water Cover Mt. Everest?</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mount Everest is more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) high. How, then, could the flood have covered &ldquo;all the high hills under the whole heaven&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible refers only to &ldquo;high hills,&rdquo; and the mountains today were formed only toward the end of, and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">after</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, the flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting. In support of this, the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mount Everest are themselves composed of fossil-bearing, water-deposited layers.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This uplift of the new continental landmasses from under the Flood waters would have meant that, as the mountains rose and the valleys sank, the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces. The collapse of natural dams holding back the flood waters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding. Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today&#39;s earth surface.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image19.jpg" width="225" height="301" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thus, it is not hard to envisage the rapid carving of the landscape features that we see on the earth today, including places such as the Grand Canyon of the United States.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The present shape of Uluru (Ayers Rock), as sandstone monolith in central Australia, is the result of erosion, following tilting and uplift, of previously horizontal beds of water-laid sand. The feldspar-rich sand that makes up Uluru must have been deposited very quickly and recently. Long-distance transport of the sand would have caused the grains to be rounded and sorted, whereas they are jagged and unsorted. If they had sat accumulating slowly in a lake bed drying in the sun over eons of time, which is the story told in the geological display at the park center, the feldspar would have weathered into clay.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image20.jpg" width="301" height="120" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Likewise, if Uluru had sat in the once-humid area of central Australia for millions of years, it would have weathered to clay.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-floodwater.html#3"><span class="cs92015F65">[3]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Similarly, the nearby Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) are composed of an unsorted mixture of large boulders, sand, and mud, indicating that the material must have been transported and deposited very rapidly.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The erosion caused by receding flood waters is the reason that river valleys are far larger than the rivers now flowing in them could have carved. The water flow that carved the river valleys must have been far greater than the volume of water we see flowing in the rivers today. This is consistent with voluminous flood waters draining off the emerging land surfaces at the close of Noah&#39;s flood, and flowing into the rapidly sinking, newly prepared, deep ocean basins.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Our understanding of how the flood could have occurred is continually developing. Ideas come and go, but the fact of the flood remains. Genesis clearly testifies to it, Jesus and the apostles confirmed it, and there is abundant global geological evidence for a global watery cataclysm.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image14.gif" width="24" height="20" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />Noah&#39;s Flood&mdash;Where did all that water come from? <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c010.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Answer</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

					<span class="cs2C025596">Nine Biblical Evidences that the Flood was Global</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some evangelical teachers today are claiming that Noah&#39;s flood did not cover the entire Earth nor all the mountains of the day. Further, they claim that Noah and the animals floated on a shallow, temporary inland sea caused by the flood, somehow covering only the Mesopotamian region. Thus, they must claim that the Earth&#39;s entire human population was limited to this area, or that not all humans were killed in the flood. Is there really biblical evidence for claims of this nature?</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
					<li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">All The Mountains Were Covered.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The tops of all the high mountains under the entire heavens were at least 20 feet beneath the waters surface (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen7.html#19"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 7:19-20</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). It would be absurd to think that a flood covering the highest mountains of the Middle East would not affect the rest of the world. In addition, the waters remained at this awesome, mountain-covering height for five months! (Genesis <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen7.html#18"><span class="cs92015F65">7:18-24</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen8.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">8:1-5</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Ark Was Huge.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The ark was necessary to prevent the extinction of humans and animals. If the Flood were merely local, God could have sent them to a safer part of the world. God warned Noah about the Flood 120 years prior to its start. Surely, Noah and his family could have traveled a great distance in that time. Also, if the Flood was local, the ark was <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-c013.html"><span class="cs92015F65">unnecessarily large</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Until the first metal ships were constructed in modern times, the ark was the largest ship ever built. It was <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-c013.html"><span class="cs92015F65">big enough</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to house representative pairs of every created-kind of air-breathing, land animal on Earth.</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Humans Populated The Entire World.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> After more than 1600 years of habitation on Earth, the planet&#39;s population was surely large (millions or billions). The Bible confirms that (a) Man had multiplied upon the face of the Earth (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 6:1</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), (b) Violence and corruption filled the Earth (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html#11"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 6:11-12</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The Bible is clear that man could not have existed only in the Mesopotamian region - a region too small to support such a large population, especially considering the natural dispersion affect of a violent society.</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">All Humans Were Killed.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The Bible clearly teaches that all flesh died&hellip;every man (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen7.html#21"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 7:21</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen9.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 9:1</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> confirms that only Noah&#39;s family was saved and that every person living today is descended from his family.</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">All Air-Breathing, Land Animals Killed.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The world&#39;s entire population of air-breathing, land animals died, except those taken into the ark (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen7.html#21"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 7:21</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) - &ldquo;everything on Earth&rdquo; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html#17"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 6:17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) - &quot;all <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/livingcreatures.html"><span class="cs92015F65">living creatures</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of every kind on the Earth&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen9.html#16"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 9:16</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). If only those animals in a specific geographic location died, it would seem unnecessary for God to protect pairs in the ark for the express purpose of preventing their extinction. Surely there would be representatives of their kinds in other areas. If, on the other hand, there were some unique kinds of animals in the local flood&#39;s path, then it would seem more logical for God to send representative pairs out of the area, rather than to the ark, as He did. The Bible is clear that all the air-breathing, land animals perished during the flood, except those preserved with Noah - from which all modern animals are descended.</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A &ldquo;Cataclysm,&rdquo; Not A Mere Flood.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Both Hebrew (Old Testament) and Greek (New Testament) use words to describe Noah&#39;s flood which are different than the ordinary words for flood. In this way, Noah&#39;s flood was represented as a totally unique occurrence. [Hebrew / &ldquo;Mabbool&rdquo; - Greek / &ldquo;Kataklusmos&rdquo; (cataclysm)].</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">God&#39;s Rainbow Promise.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> God promised never again to send a global flood (Genesis <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen8.html#21"><span class="cs92015F65">8:21</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen9.html#8"><span class="cs92015F65">9:8-17</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). This promise is demonstrated by the symbol of the rainbow, a sign for God&#39;s promise to all the Earth. The rainbow is a sign to every living creature, mankind and animals. If this promise was not made to all creatures on Earth, then God has broken His promise. Local floods have repeatedly killed hundreds and even thousands of humans and animals since Noah&#39;s time.</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Why Stay In The Ark A Year?!</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Noah was in the ark for more than a year, not just 40 days (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen8.html#14"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 8:14</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). 53 weeks is absurdly long to stay in the ark for a local flood since dry land would have been just over the horizon. After the flood waters had been going down for 4 months, the dove could still find no suitable ground (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen8.html#9"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 8:9</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). This does not seem to fit the circumstances for a local flood in which the dove could fly to dry land. However, these situations are consistent if the Flood was global.</span></li><li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Whole Earth Was Devastated.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> God said, &quot;I am surely going to destroy both them (the people) and the Earth&quot; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html#13"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 6:13b</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The global extent of the Flood is referred to more than 30 times in Genesis 6-9 alone! In <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/isa54.html#9"><span class="cs92015F65">Isaiah 54:9</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, God states, &quot;I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the Earth.&quot; Peter delivered a clear global warning, confirming that God created the Earth, devastated it by the Flood, and will one day destroy it again by fire (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/2pet3.html#5"><span class="cs92015F65">2 Peter 3:5-7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Peter certainly did not mean that just a local area on Earth would be burned. Just as the Flood was global, so will be <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/judgmentthefinal.html"><span class="cs92015F65">the final judgment</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></li></ol>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible specifically teaches that the Flood of Noah&#39;s time was global in extent and that all air-breathing, land animals and all humans were killed, except those saved in the Ark. How could the Bible be any more clear concerning the global nature of the Flood?! Or, if this was actually a local flood, how could the Bible have been any more misleading about its extent?!</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

This means that the ark would have been at least 450 feet long [137.16 meters], 75 feet wide [22.86 meters] and 45 feet high [13.716000000000001 meters]. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/noah.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Noah&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Ark was said to have been the largest sea-going vessel ever built until the late nineteenth century when giant metal ships were first constructed. Its length to width ratio of six to one provided excellent stability on the high seas. In fact, modern shipbuilders say it would have been almost impossible to turn over. In every way, it was admirably suited for riding out the tremendous storms in the year of the flood.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These dimensions are especially interesting when compared to those given in the mythical, Babylonian account of the Ark. Here the ark is described as a perfect cube, extending 120 <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/cubit.html"><span class="cs92015F65">cubits</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in all directions and with nine decks.

					<span class="cs2C025596">Was the ark big enough to hold the number of animals required?</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The total available floor space on the ark would have been over 100,000 square feet, which would be more floor space than in 20 standard-sized basketball courts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csDA5A99D0"><a class="cs654FAE9F" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs777ED152"><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image24.jpg" width="151" height="113" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Assuming an 18-inch <a class="csB4F56505" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/cubit.html"><span class="cs777ED152">cubit</span></a></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> [45.72 centimeters], Noah&#39;s Ark would have had a cubic volume equal to 569 modern railroad stock cars.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The total cubic volume would have been 1,518,000 cubic feet [462,686.4 cubic meters] --that would be equal to the capacity of 569 modern railroad stock cars.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now comes the question, how many land dwelling air breathing animals would have had to be taken aboard the ark to survive the flood?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">According to Ernest Mayr, America&#39;s leading taxonomist, there are over 1 million species of animals in the world.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csDA5A99D0"><a class="cs654FAE9F" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs777ED152"><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image25.jpg" width="175" height="131" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">God only provided the Ark for the protection of humans and land-dwelling, air-breathing creatures. A huge number of animals would not need to be taken aboard the Ark because they are water dwellers. Representatives would be expected to survive the catastrophe. With God&#39;s protection against extinction during the Deluge, survival would have been assured. (Scene from <a class="csB4F56505" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs777ED152">The World that Perished</span></a></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">, a Christian motion picture about the Flood)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">However, the vast majority of these are capable of surviving in water and would not need to be brought aboard the ark. Noah need make no provision for the 21,000 species of fish or the 1,700 tunicates (marine chordates like sea squirts) found throughout the seas of the world, or the 600 echinoderms including star fish and sea urchins, or the 107,000 mollusks such as mussels, clams and oysters, or the 10,000 coelenterates like corals and sea anemones, jelly fish and hydroids or the 5,000 species of sponges, or the 30,000 protozoans, the microscopic single-celled creatures.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In addition, some of the mammals are aquatic. For example, the whales, seals and porpoises. The amphibians need not all have been included, nor all the reptiles, such as sea turtles, and alligators. Moreover, a large number of the arthropods numbering 838,000 species, such as lobsters, shrimp, crabs and water fleas and barnacles are marine creatures. And the insect species among arthropoda are usually very small. Also, many of the 35,000 species of worms as well as many of the insects could have survived outside the Ark.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">How many animals needed to be brought aboard?</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Doctors Morris and Whitcomb in their classic book,</span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Genesis Flood</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> state that no more than 35,000 individual animals needed to go on the ark. In his well documented book, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Noah&#39;s Ark: A Feasibility Study</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, John Woodmorappe suggests that far fewer animals would have been transported upon the ark. By pointing out that the word &ldquo;specie&rdquo; is not equivalent to the &ldquo;created kinds&rdquo; of the Genesis account, Woodmorappe credibly demonstrates that as few as 2,000 animals may have been required on the ark. To pad this number for error, he continues his study by showing that the ark could easily accommodate 16,000 animals.)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csB956BC15"><a class="csC91BF5E7" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs92015F65"><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image26.jpg" width="151" height="113" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">But, let&#39;s be generous and add on a reasonable number to include extinct animals. Then add on some more to satisfy even the most skeptical. Let&#39;s assume 50,000 animals, far more animals than required, were on board the ark, and these need not have been the largest or even adult specimens.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Remember there are really only a few very large animals, such as the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dinosaurs/j-ark1.html"><span class="cs92015F65">dinosaur</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> or the elephant, and these could be represented by young ones. Assuming the average animal to be about the size of a sheep and using a railroad car for comparison, we note that the average double-deck stock car can accommodate 240 sheep. Thus, three trains hauling 69 cars each would have ample space to carry the 50,000 animals, filling only 37% of the ark. This would leave an additional 361 cars or enough to make 5 trains of 72 cars each to carry all of the food and baggage plus Noah&#39;s family of eight people. The Ark had plenty of space.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The bigger problem would have been the construction of the Ark. But the Bible indicates that Noah did this under Divine guidance and there is no reason to believe he did not hire additional workmen.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">How were the animals gathered?</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another enormous problem some have posed is the problem of gathering specimens of each kind of air-breathing land animal and bringing them aboard the Ark. However, the Genesis account indicates that God gathered the animals and brought them to Noah inside the ark two by two. Some have suggested this may have involved the origin of animal migratory instincts or, at least, an intensification of it. We also know that most animals possess the ability to sense danger and to move to a place of safety.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">How could Noah&#39;s family take care of all those animals?</span></h2>
				<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csDA5A99D0"><a class="cs654FAE9F" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs777ED152"><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image27.jpg" width="151" height="129" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Noah with the animals, as depicted in the motion picture, <a class="csB4F56505" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/wp-vs.html"><span class="cs777ED152">The World that Perished</span></a></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Once aboard, many have suggested that Noah&#39;s problems really began, with only 8 people to feed and water, to provide fresh air and sanitation for the huge menagerie of animals for a total of 371 days. However, a number of scientists have suggested that the animals may have gone into a type of dormancy. It has been said that in nearly all groups of animals there is at least an indication of a latent ability to hibernate or aestivate. Perhaps these abilities were supernaturally intensified during this period. With their bodily functions reduced to a minimum, the burden of their care would have been greatly lightened.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Conclusion</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is evident, when all the facts are examined that there is no scientific evidence that the biblical account of Noah&#39;s ark is a myth or fable. The facts support the view that Noah&#39;s ark was large enough to carry the number of animals required to repopulate the earth after the flood and that Noah and his family were capable of caring for the animals during their time on the Ark.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/deluge.html"><span class="cs92015F65">flood</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/noah.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Noah&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> day was a universal <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/judgmentsofgod.html"><span class="cs92015F65">judgment</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/sin.html"><span class="cs92015F65">sin</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Evolutionists acknowledge that men and animals could once freely cross the Bering Strait, which separates Asia and the Americas.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">[1]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Before the idea of continental drift became popular, evolutionists depended entirely upon a lowering of the sea level during an ice age (which locked up water in the ice) to create land bridges, enabling dry-land passage from Europe most of the way to Australasia, for example.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The existence of some deep-water stretches along the route to Australia is still consistent with this explanation. Evolutionist geologists themselves believe there have been major tectonic upheavals, accompanied by substantial rising and falling of sea floors, in the time period which they associate with an ice age. For instance, parts of California are believed to have been raised many thousands of feet from what was the sea floor during this ice age period, which they call &ldquo;Pleistocene&rdquo; (one of the most recent of the supposed geological periods). creationist geologists generally regard Pleistocene sediments as post-flood, the period in which these major migrations took place.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the same way, other dry-land areas, including parts of these land bridges, subsided to become submerged at around the same time.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html#2"><span class="cs92015F65">[2]</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is a widespread, but mistaken, belief that marsupials are found only in Australia, thus supporting the idea that they must have evolved there. However, living marsupials, opossums, are found also in North and South America, and fossil marsupials have been found on every continent. Likewise, monotremes were once thought to be unique to Australia, but the discovery in 1991 of a fossil platypus tooth in South America stunned the scientific community.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html#3"><span class="cs92015F65">[3]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Therefore, since evolutionists believe all organisms came from a common ancestor, migration between Australia and other areas must be conceded as possible by all scientists, whether evolutionist or creationist.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Creationists generally believe there was only one Ice Age after, and as a consequence of, the flood. The lowered sea level at this time made it possible for animals to migrate over land bridges for centuries. Some creationists propose a form of continental break-up after the flood, in the days of Peleg. This again would mean several centuries for animals to disperse, in this instance without the necessity of land-bridges. However, continental break-up in the time of Peleg is not widely accepted in creationist circles.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Did the Kangaroo Hop All the Way to Australia?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How did animals make the long journey from the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/ararat.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Ararat</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> region? Even though there have been isolated reports of individual animals making startling journeys of hundreds of miles, such abilities are not even necessary. Early settlers released a very small number of rabbits in Australia. Wild rabbits are now found at the very opposite corner (in fact, every corner) of this vast continent. Does that mean that an individual rabbit had to be capable of crossing the whole of Australia? Of course not. Creation speakers are sometimes asked mockingly, &quot;Did the kangaroo hop all the way to Australia?&quot; We see by the rabbit example that this is a somewhat foolish question.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><div style="float:right;width:114pt;height:74.25pt;">

				<span class="csCF6BBF71">Populations of animals may have had centuries to migrate, relatively slowly, over many generations. Incidentally, the opposite question (also common), as to whether the two kangaroos hopped all the way </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Australia to the ark, is also easily answered. The continents we now have, with their load of flood-deposited sedimentary rock, are not the same as whatever continent or continents there may have been in the pre-flood world.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We also lack information as to how animals were distributed before the flood. Kangaroos (as is true for any other creature) may not have been on any isolated landmass. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen1.html#9"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 1:9</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> suggests that there may have been only one landmass. (&quot;Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry </span><span class="csC382D2BB">land</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> appear.&quot;) For all we know, kangaroos might have been feeding within a stone&#39;s throw of Noah while he was building the Ark.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It may be asked, if creatures were migrating to Australia over a long time (which journey would have included such places as indonesia, presumably) why do we not find their fossils en route in such countries?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fossilization is a rare event, requiring, as a rule, sudden burial (as in the flood) to prevent decomposition. Lions lived in israel until relatively recently. We don&#39;t find lion fossils in Israel, yet this doesn&#39;t prevent us believing the many historical reports of their presence. The millions of bison that once roamed the United States of America have left virtually no fossils. So why should it be a surprise that small populations, presumably under migration pressure from competitors and/or predators, and thus living in only one area for a few generations at most, should leave no fossils?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Unique Organisms</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another issue is why certain animals (and plants) are uniquely found in only one place. Why is species x found only in madagascar and species y only in the Seychelles? Many times, questions on this are phrased to indicate that the questioner believes that this means that species y headed only in that one direction, and never migrated anywhere else. While that is possible, it is not necessarily the case at all. All that the present situation indicates is that these are now the only places where x or y </span><span class="csC382D2BB">still survive</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The ancestors of present-day kangaroos may have established daughter populations in different parts of the world, most of which subsequently became extinct. Perhaps those marsupials only survived in Australia because they migrated there ahead of the placental mammals (we are not suggesting anything other than &ldquo;random&rdquo; processes in choice of destination), and were subsequently isolated from the placentals, and so protected from competition and predation.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Palm Valley in central Australia is host to a unique species of palm, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Livingstonia mariae</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, found nowhere else in the world. Does this necessarily mean that the seeds for this species floated only to this one little spot? Not at all. Current models of post-flood climate indicate that the world is much drier now than it was in the early post-flood centuries. Evolutionists themselves agree that in recent times (by evolutionary standards), the sahara was lush and green, and central Australia had a moist, tropical climate. For all we know, the Livingstonia mariae palm may have been widespread over much of Australia, perhaps even in other places which are now dry, such as parts of Africa.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The palm has survived in Palm Valley because there it happens to be protected from the drying out which affected the rest of its vast central Australian surroundings. Everywhere else, it died out.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Incidentally, this concept of changing vegetation with changing climate should be kept in mind when considering post-flood animal migration&mdash;especially because of the objections (and caricatures) which may be presented. For instance, how could creatures that today need a rain forest environment trudge across thousands of miles of parched desert on the way to where they now live? The answer is that it wasn&#39;t desert then!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Koala and Other Specialized Types</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="176" style="border-collapse:collapse;">

				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some problems are more difficult to solve. For instance, there are creatures that require special conditions or a very specialized diet, such as the giant panda of China or Australia&#39;s koala. We don&#39;t know, of course, that bamboo shoots or blue gum leaves<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html#4"><span class="cs92015F65">[4]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> were not then flourishing all along their eventual respective migratory paths. In fact, this may have influenced the direction they took.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But, in any case, there is another possibility. A need for unique or special conditions to survive may be a result of specialization, a downhill change in some populations. That is, it may result from a loss in genetic information, from thinning out of the gene pool or by degenerative mutation. A good example is the many modern breeds of dog, selected by man (although natural conditions can do likewise), which are much less hardy in the wild than their &ldquo;mongrel&rdquo; ancestors. For example, the St. Bernard carries a mutational defect, an overactive thyroid, which means it needs to live in a cold environment to avoid overheating.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This suggests that the ancestors of such creatures, when they came off the Ark, were not as specialized. Thus they were more hardy than their descendants, who carry only a portion of that original gene pool of information.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html#5"><span class="cs92015F65">[5]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In other words, the koala&#39;s ancestor may have been able to survive on a much greater range of vegetation. Such an explanation has been made possible only with modern biological insights. Perhaps as knowledge increases some of the remaining difficulties will become less so.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Such changes do not require large time periods for animals under migratory pressure. The first small population that formed would tend to break up rapidly into daughter populations, going in different directions, each carrying only a portion of the gene pool of the original pair that came off the ark.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sometimes all of a population will eventually become extinct; sometimes all but one specialized type. Where all the sub-types survive and proliferate, we find some of the tremendous diversity seen among some groups of creatures which are apparently derived from one created kind. This explains why some very obviously related species are found far apart from each other.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The sloth, a very slow-moving creature, may seem to require much more time than Scripture allows to make the journey from <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/ararat.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Ararat</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to its present home. Perhaps its present condition is also explicable by a similar evolutionary process. However, to account for today&#39;s animal distribution, evolutionists themselves have had to propose that certain primates have traveled across hundreds of miles of open ocean on huge rafts of matted vegetation torn off in storms.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html#6"><span class="cs92015F65">[6]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Indeed, iguanas have recently been documented traveling hundreds of miles in this manner between islands in the caribbean.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html#7"><span class="cs92015F65">[7]</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible suggests a pattern of post-flood dispersal of animals and humans that accounts for fossil distribution of apes and humans, for example.

Animals, including apes, would have begun spreading out over the earth straight after the flood, whereas the Bible indicates that people refused to do this (Genesis <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen9.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">9:1</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen11.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">11:1-9</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).

However, none of the work being conducted by these researchers has any bearing on the Flood reported in Scripture. I propose that the drowned dwellings in the Black Sea (if they prove to be such) represent post-Flood communities adversely impacted by the rapid rise of sea level associated with the close of the Ice Age. The overflow of the Mediterranean into the Black Sea forced the people, living in the communities adjacent to the small freshwater lake, to migrate to higher ground.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Relatively shallow submerged areas around portions of the Black Sea are proving to be of considerable interest for both marine geologists and archaeologists.

More recently, discoveries have been made of what appear to be the remains of human habitation in almost one hundred feet of water. Several uniformitarian scientists are now claiming that the flooding of the Black Sea several thousand years ago provided the basis of the Flood myth of Genesis as well as that of many other cultures (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-crs/crs-blacksea.html#mcinnis"><span class="cs92015F65">McInnis</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, 1998; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-crs/crs-blacksea.html#ryan-98"><span class="cs92015F65">Ryan and Pitman</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, 1998).

					<span class="cs2C025596">The Genesis Account Versus The Flooding of a Freshwater Lake</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-crs/crs-blacksea.html#ryan-98"><span class="cs92015F65">Ryan and Pitman</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> thesis (1998, p. 57) regarding the flooding of the Black Sea as the basis for the Biblical Flood myth can best be summarized using their own words:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&hellip;what if the myth story is examined in a different light, one that asks if human history was cleaved into a before and after primarily because the inundation was permanent and not temporary? Might a flood that never subsided have expelled a people from their former homeland and forced them to find a new place to live? Might the boat that the survivors built and filled with seed and animals have been not for the purpose of repopulating the earth but for transporting to safety the items vital to a continued subsistence (domesticated plants, animals, and knowledge of the arts)? And what if in addressing such a hypothesis one does not limit the investigation to Mesopotamia but looks beyond its borders?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Ryan and Pitman proposal simply states that communities of humans once lived around the freshwater lake that eventually became the Black Sea. The sea level rise of the Mediterranean, approximately 5,600 years ago, breached the Bosporus Strait and began to fill the freshwater lake with saltwater (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-crs/crs-blacksea.html#ryan-98"><span class="cs92015F65">Ryan and Pitman</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, 1998, p. 157). People living adjacent to the lake observed water levels rising in the range of several feet per hour, and they escaped by either floating on the rising water or attempting to outrun it. The eventual result was the filling of the Black Sea and the dispersion of those peoples to areas across Europe, the Middle and the Far East. This, according to their book, is the basis of the Flood myth among the different cultures.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An obvious problem with the Ryan and Pitman concept is that it is completely different from what Genesis records. They believe that the Flood is a mythological story adapted by the many cultures impacted by the event at the time of its occurrence. Ryan and Pitman (1998, p. 56) stated:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Belief in the flood as an agent of global change has subsided in the century since Louis Agassizs momentous discovery of the Ice Age and the conversions of Buckland and Lyell&hellip; A modern essay on the Genesis story in Western thought says the &quot;diluvial theory came to be seen as what it was: one of the many imaginative but mistaken ventures that have accompanied the development of earth-science.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Statements such as this throughout their book imply that the Biblical account of the Flood is one of mythology which is equal to all the other transcultural accounts of a flood. The Ryan and Pitman version of Noahs Flood is sans everything Scriptural except the water, which they never withdrew from the Black Sea. Anyone who wishes to base his worldview on how scientists interpret Scripture should really appreciate this book.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Ryan and Pitman account completely discounts everything before the Flood. No discussion is provided regarding the Garden of Eden or the first sin. They simply start at what they view as a flood myth which needs to be addressed because it has its basis in so many different cultures. However, they have made a major oversight and I want to offer them another aspect of the flood legend to add to their own. This way they can explain the flood myths and legends of many different cultures, not only locally/regionally, but globally.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">The Flooding of Coastal Environments and the Global Rise in sea level</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ryan and Pitman only appear to address cultures found in association with the Middle East. So, their version of a flood myth would only occur in those cultures which had some direct experience with the event. What about all the other cultures, which had already settled away from this area, and which were not impacted by this event, for example, the native Americans? Why do they have flood legends if they were already in the New World and were not affected by the rise and dispersion of cultures from the Black Sea?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The answer is quite simple, and I offer this up for their use to help them explain why almost every ancient culture of people has some version of a flood legend. Simply stated, they, too, were displaced by a global rise in sea level position associated with the breakdown of the polar ice caps, which occurred just a few thousand years earlier.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Dr. Brian Rucker and I reported on the many evidences of drowned paleo-Indian communities which have been documented along the coast of Florida (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-crs/crs-blacksea.html#rucker"><span class="cs92015F65">Rucker and Froede</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, 1998). These ancient communities were rapidly displaced when the polar ice caps began to disintegrate, and worldwide sea level rose tens of feet in what was probably a decade at the close of the Ice Age. These cultures also developed flood myths to deal with the local flooding. The only problem with this approach is their account of a boat&mdash;one which sounds like the Ark of Genesis. Perhaps they, too, built such a craft to float to the new sea level position? Good thing they knew beforehand to build that boat so that they got the story straight!</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">What About the Submerged Ruins?</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Marine geologist Robert Ballard is exploring the Black Sea in an effort to document the dwellings and structures of folks who were displaced by the rise of the Black Sea thousands of years ago (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-crs/crs-blacksea.html#reed"><span class="cs92015F65">Reed</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, 2000). While this effort is not being done to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; the Ryan and Pitman hypothesis, it is being advanced by the popular press as proof of the flood myth. I predict that all of the work done by Ballard and others will be used to explain away what Scripture accurately records. The local and tranquil flood of the Black Sea will help certain folks sleep better knowing that &ldquo;science&rdquo; can explain away the &ldquo;myths&rdquo; of the Bible.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I propose that the structural ruins and tools discovered by Ballard and others in the Black Sea (if they prove to be of human design and origin) reflect post-Flood cultures which moved into the basin seeking food and a fresh water supply. Their eventual dispersion from these areas followed the end of the Ice Age and the concomitant rise in global sea level position. This is in opposition to the Ryan and Pitman belief that these artifacts reflect the onset of the localized and tranquil flood which inspired its incorporation into Scripture. I believe that the Ryan and Pitman book provides an interesting account of what may have happened to post-Flood communities living adjacent to the freshwater lake when the Mediterranean overflowed and filled the Black Sea.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The submerged ruins and artifacts documented in the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-crs/crs-blacksea.html#rucker"><span class="cs92015F65">Rucker and Froede</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (1998) article can also be used by individuals uncomfortable with the Genesis account to document the flood and dispersion of paleo-Indian cultures living in the new world. These cultures would have developed a flood myth, only a few thousand years earlier from those cultures displaced with the flooding of the Black Sea basin. Thank goodness the flood myth has been solved by &ldquo;science&rdquo; in a way that does not create a conflict. Science and the Bible do not conflict when the Bible totally yields everything to what science dictates.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Synopsis</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">According to Ryan and Pitman, the flooding of a large freshwater lake (the ancestral Black Sea) by the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 5,600 years ago, permanently displaced the human communities living around it. These various groups of people spread away from the Black Sea region, taking with them a flood story which eventually became the flood myth recorded by many different cultures. A serious problem with this approach occurs where Ryan and Pitman fail to follow Scripture or explain how other cultures, not impacted by this event, came up with their own similar story of the global Flood, including a large boat to save a few individuals and the animals, which is faithfully recorded in Genesis.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The entire concept of the flooding of the Black Sea, as the basis of the Genesis Flood story, provides an excellent example where &ldquo;science&rdquo; supersedes the facts of Scripture with the ideas of man. The Ryan and Pitman tale begins with the idea of explaining away the mythological fable of the flood. However, their flood story simply stands on its own merit&mdash;with nothing to compare it to the Biblical account. Ryan and Pitman (1999, p. 16) readily admit this in a reply to a letter written in complaint of the scientific basis for the flood story of the Bible; they stated:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is a stretch to link the catastrophic filling of the Black Seas freshwater lake to the deluge myth recorded in Scripture. The circumstances of this special flooding (one without 40 days and nights of rain, and one that never receded) deserve elaboration for readers curious about prehistory.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&hellip;the belief that this particular flood or any other is the one directly experienced by Noah is an individual decision. It is not a question that can be answered by scientific method.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In following the Ryan and Pitman hypothesis, Rucker and I could just as easily have proposed that the displacement of paleo-Indian cultures living out on the Florida continental shelf adjacent to the smaller Gulf of Mexico, during the close of the Ice Age, lead to the flood stories recorded in native American legends. This suggestion, like that of Ryan and Pitman, fails to acknowledge the accuracy of Scripture over the ever-changing concepts of mankind.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Conclusion</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The discovery of drowned villages in the Black Sea (if additional research proves such) possibly records the rise of sea level following the climax of the Ice Age. Many such post-Flood human communities found themselves displaced from their dwellings with the rapid rise of sea level associated with the close of the Ice Age. The structures that Ballard and others might identify in the Black Sea were not a part of the Genesis Flood; rather, they reflect post-Flood communities living close to a source of food and water.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Marine geologists and oceanographers are just now starting to look for drowned structures associated with displaced people and the rise of sea level. I am sure that many more will be found, especially along coasts impacted by the rapid rise of sea level associated with the close of the Ice Age. Brian Rucker and I have identified several such sites around the Florida coast. Nothing being discovered in the Black Sea defends the Ryan and Pitman flood hypothesis.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Rather it shows that the earth was much different from the present during the Ice Age. Sea level rise at the end of the Ice Age, which was a recent event, did more than raise water levels globally&mdash;it displaced various late ice-age communities.</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="90%" align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse;">

				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Double Creation Stories? A theory has long been advocated that the early chapters of Genesis contain a &ldquo;doublet&rdquo; of creation stories and that these stories, characterized by the distinctive divine names, Elohim and YHWH, are of different origins with two independent, and even opposing, cosmologies. According to this traditional critical theory, the former is the priestly account (P source) of creation from the postexilic period, while the latter is an earlier Yahwistic account (J source). Hence, it is usually assumed that there exist some discrepancies or contradictions between the two accounts. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">[1]</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Recently, however, it has been emphasized by scholars like Alter that whatever their origins may be, &quot;the two accounts are complementary rather than overlapping, each giving a different kind of information about how the world came into being.&quot; According to him, &quot;the two different creation stories,&quot; i.e., the P and J stories, constitute a &ldquo;composite narrative&rdquo; that encompasses &ldquo;divergent perspectives&rdquo; by placing in sequence &quot;two ostensibly contradictory accounts of the same event,&quot; such as two stories of the creation of woman. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html#2"><span class="cs92015F65">[2]</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When one takes a closer look at both stories, it is evident that they are not two &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; versions of the same or similar &ldquo;creation&rdquo; stories, since the theme and purpose of the two are certainly different.

A story without any reference to the sun, the moon and the stars, or the sea is certainly not a true cosmological myth. Genesis 2 and following, therefore, should not be treated as the same literary genre as Genesis 1, which locates the creation of humankind at the grand climax of the creation of the cosmos,<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html#3"><span class="cs92015F65">[3]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> while the former is concerned with the immediate situation of mankind on the earth.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">However, as I recently demonstrated, both chapters do reflect essentially the same cosmology.

Kikawada hence suggests that there are two creations of mankind in Genesis, comparing Genesis 1-2 with the myth of Enki and Ninmah and the &ldquo;Atra-Hasis Epic&rdquo; (I 1-351) (Kikawada 1983; Kikawada and Quinn 1985: 39ff). According to him, Genesis 1 refers to &quot;the first creation of mankind,&quot; while Genesis 2 refers to &quot;the second creation of mankind,&quot; namely the creation of the specific persons <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/adam.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Adam</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/eve.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Eve</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and these two Biblical creation accounts are parallel to each other.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It should be noted, however, that in Genesis those &ldquo;double creation stories&rdquo; deal with the same topic, the origin of humankind (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">&#39;adam</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), and do not necessarily refer to &ldquo;two&rdquo; separate creative actions regarding human creation. The debate is whether the reason for this twofold description is (1) that there were actually two independent creation stories of the same event or (2) that there were actually two separate creation acts or (3) that a technique of narrative discourse was used that recounts one and the same event from two different viewpoints. To this third possibility I now turn.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Discourse Grammar.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html#6"><span class="cs92015F65">[6]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> It has been noted by scholars such as U. Casssuto (1961: 89-92; also Kitchen 1966: 116-17) that Genesis 1 gives a general description of mankind in the framework of the entire creation of the world and Genesis 2 gives a detailed description of humankind and their immediate context on the earth.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html#7"><span class="cs92015F65">[7]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> From a discourse grammatical point of view, this relationship between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 may be explained as a generic-specific relationship (Longacre 1983: 119, 122) and the two constitute a &ldquo;hyponymous&rdquo;<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html#8"><span class="cs92015F65">[8]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> parallelism, so to speak.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This feature might also be explained as a phenomenon of what Grimes calls a &ldquo;scope change&rdquo; in narrative discourse, which is a phenomenon of &quot;zooming in from an overall perspective to a closeup, with a corresponding shift in reference&quot; (1975: 46-47). This is the way I have described the nature of the relationship between the two &ldquo;creation&rdquo; stories of Genesis elsewhere (1985); they have different scopes or viewpoints by which the author or narrator describes one and the same creation of mankind, first with relation to the cosmos, and then with a narrower focus on the man&rsquo;s relationship with the woman, the animals, and the environment in the second story. Therefore, the flow of discourse runs from Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 and following, not vice versa, as assumed by the traditional source critics.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As for <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen2.html#4"><span class="cs92015F65">2:4</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, whose two halves constitute a chiastic parallelism, Wenham takes this verse as serving &quot;both as a title to 2:5-4:26 and as a link with the introduction <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen1.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">1:1-2:3</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html#9"><span class="cs92015F65">[9]</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In another context I have suggested that it serves as a link between the two stories and that this linkage is a kind of transitional technique that according to Parunak points to a surface pattern of repetition or similarity that joins successive textual units together (Tsumura 1985: 48; Purunak 1983).

Sj&quot;berg accepts Lambert&rsquo;s opinion that &quot;there was hardly any influence from that Babylonian text on the Old Testament creation accounts&quot; (1984: 217). Hasel thinks rather that the creation account of Genesis 1 functions as an antimythological polemic in some cases (e.g., with the &quot;<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/sun.html"><span class="cs92015F65">sun</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">,&quot; the &quot;<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/moon.html"><span class="cs92015F65">moon</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">,&quot; and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">tnnm</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (&ldquo;sea monsters&rdquo;?), etc. (1974).

If Evolution is true, one may wonder why the case is not just the reverse! Evolutionary history is supposed to be filled with temporary, intermediate stages of Evolution, from amoeba to man. </span></li><li class="cs893638BA"><span class="csDC4A80">Sufficient fossils.</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> There is a continuing lack of evidence for Evolution despite an enormous number of fossils. Although scientists will continue to discover new varieties of fossil animals and plants, it is generally agreed that the millions of fossils already discovered (and the sediments already explored) provide a reliable indication of which way the evidence is going. That is, there will continue to be little or no fossil evidence found to support Evolutionism. </span></li><li class="cs893638BA"><span class="csDC4A80">Fast strata formation.</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> There is increasing evidence that many sedimentary rocks, which some thought took thousands or millions of years to accumulate, almost certainly were deposited in only months, days, hours, or minutes. </span></li><li class="cs893638BA"><span class="csDC4A80">Rapid coal formation.</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> The old Evolutionary theory about coal forming in swamps is wrong. There is increasing evidence that massive coal deposits were formed in deep flood waters. Various coal layers in the U.S. consist mainly of sheets of tree bark abraded from huge masses of uprooted trees. The bark layers were buried in mud and carbonized into coal. Coal formation is relatively quick when heat is applied. </span></li><li class="cs893638BA"><span class="csDC4A80">Fossilization requires very special conditions.</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> Dinosaur and other fossils could not have formed in the way suggested by most Evolutionary books. Animals almost never fossilize unless they are buried quickly and deeply - before scavengers, bacteria and erosion reduce them to dust. Such conditions are highly unusual. In almost all cases, the very existence of the fossils, in the types and numbers discovered, strongly indicates catastrophic conditions were involved in their <a class="csB4F56505" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/burial.html"><span class="cs777ED152">burial</span></a></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> and preservation. Without such conditions, there seems to be no plausible way to explain their existence. Huge dinosaurs, huge schools of fish, and many diverse animals are found entombed by massive muddy sediments which hardened into rock. Almost all fossils are found in water-laid sediments. </span></li><li class="cs893638BA"><span class="csDC4A80">Wrong order for evolution.</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"> It has been reported that &quot;80 to 85% of Earth&#39;s land surface does not have even 3 geologic periods appearing in &#39;correct&#39; consecutive order&quot; for Evolution. </span></li></ul>

So why do we not find hundreds or even thousands of human fossils in the rock layers regarded as Flood sediments, with perhaps even some human fossils alongside, say, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/dinosaur.html"><span class="cs92015F65">dinosaur</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> fossils?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These are, of course, fair questions that are commonly asked.

However, Scripture (backed up by so much other evidence) is very clear that there was a global <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/deluge.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Flood</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and the pre-Flood people were destroyed, so there must obviously be an explanation for this lack of human fossils. Consequently, we are going to attempt an explanation by exploring possible processes during the Flood and logical deductions from present observations that could help us understand why there are no undisputed human fossils found in Flood strata.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Reported artifacts and skeletons</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are some claims and reports of human artifacts and remains in rock layers that are clearly part of the Flood sediments. However, many of these claims are not adequately documented in any scientific sense, while those few reports that have appeared in the scientific and related literature remain open to question or other interpretations. For example, the book </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts<a class="cs2830DCA9" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#1"><span class="cs92015F65">(1)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> looks like an impressive and voluminous collection of such evidence, but on closer examination many of the artifacts, though puzzling archaeologically, still belong to the post-Flood era, while other reports and claims are either antiquated or sketchy and amateurish.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Often lay scientists claiming to have found human artifacts or fossils have not recorded specific location details, so that professional scientists investigating the claims have had difficulty finding the location from which the sample in question came. ALSO, lay scientists have in the past not kept some of the rock which encloses the fossil or artifact as proof of its </span><span class="csC382D2BB">in situ</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> occurrence. These two oversights have often made it well nigh impossible to reconstruct and/or prove where fossils or artifacts came from, thus rendering such finds virtually useless.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fossilized hammers and supposed human footprints in ancient geological strata, regarded by evolutionists as deposited millions of years before man evolved, but regarded by creationists as Flood deposits, are extremely difficult to document scientifically above reproach and/or with any conclusive finality. (Merely finding rock around an implement does not prove it is pre-Flood.)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For example, it has been claimed that a gold chain was found in black coal.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#2"><span class="cs92015F65">(2)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> However, the artifact evidently was exhibited as a clean gold chain with no coal clinging to it, so we see no evidence that the chain was actually found in the coal, just the claim that it was. While one would never assume any dishonesty on the part of the people concerned, because proper scientific procedures have not been followed the exhibit has proven to be almost useless in convincing a generally skeptical scientific community and apathetic lay public.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thus, should genuine human fossils or artifacts from the time of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/noah.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Noah&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Flood be found, then it is mandatory that proper scientific procedures be followed to document the geological context, in order to guarantee that the scientific significance of such a find is unequivocally demonstrated. Regretfully, of course, the hardened skeptic would still remain unconvinced, but at least such a find may still awaken some in the apathetic public and a few of the more open-minded scientists.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is needed, of course, are actual human bones fossilized </span><span class="csC382D2BB">in situ</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> as an integral part of rock strata that are demonstrably ancient in evolutionary terms, and therefore are usually Flood sediments of the creationist framework for earth history. Yet here is where the real hard unequivocal evidence is lacking and why people ask the question &ldquo;Where are all the human fossils?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We simply cannot point to the report of a human skull found in so-called Tertiary brown coal in Germany, for there is no definitive scientific report available on this object, even though its existence has been verified by the staff of the Mining Academy in Freiberg.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#3"><span class="cs92015F65">(3)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> If it is a coalified human skull, how is it possible to distinguish it from a clever carving in such a way that it becomes conclusive proof? Even if it were demonstrated as genuine, are we sure that the Tertiary brown coal in question was a Flood stratum? In some parts of the world some of the isolated so-called Tertiary sedimentary basins could easily be classified, according to some creationist geological schemes, as post-Flood strata. After all, the early Flood geologists, prior to the advent of Lyellian uniformitarianism and the evolutionary geological time-scale, applied the term &ldquo;Tertiary&rdquo; to those rock strata that they believed to be post-Flood.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The controversial Guadeloupe skeletons are another case in point.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#4"><span class="cs92015F65">(4)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Without wishing to take sides in the debate, and in any case the hard data are still inconclusive either way, the fact remains that even if perchance these skeletons were so-called Miocene, that in and of itself would still not prove that the skeletons were in Flood sediments and therefore represented the remains of pre-Flood people. Being a subdivision of the so-called Tertiary, these Miocene rocks may still be post-Flood sediments and so these Guadeloupe skeletons may still not be human fossils from Noah&#39;s Flood.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Perhaps the fossilized human skeletons that come closest to having been pre-Flood humans buried in Flood strata are those skeletons found at Moab, Utah (USA).<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#5"><span class="cs92015F65">(5)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In a copper mine there, two definitely human skeletons were found in Cretaceous &ldquo;age&rdquo; sandstone (supposedly more than 65 million years old), the bones still joined together naturally and stained green with copper carbonate. While many regard these bones as recently buried, there still remains the remote possibility that they are pre-Flood human &ldquo;fossils&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We can only concur that there is no definite unequivocal evidence of human remains in those rock strata that can definitely be identified as Flood sediments. This realization is at first rather perplexing. But some clues to unraveling this puzzle emerge on investigation.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">The nature of the fossil record</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Let&#39;s begin by considering the nature of the fossil record. Most people don&#39;t realize that in terms of numbers of fossils 95% of the fossil record consists of shallow marine organisms such as corals and shellfish.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#6"><span class="cs92015F65">(6)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Within the remaining 5%, 95% are all the algae and plant/tree fossils, including the vegetation that now makes up the trillions of tonnes of coal, and all the other invertebrate fossils including the insects. Thus the vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/bird.html"><span class="cs92015F65">birds</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and mammals) together make up very little of the fossil record&mdash;in fact, 5% of 5%, which is a mere 0.25% of the entire fossil record. So comparatively speaking there are very, very few amphibian, reptile, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/bird.html"><span class="cs92015F65">bird</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and mammal fossils, yet so much is often made of them. For example, the number of dinosaur skeletons in all the world&#39;s museums (both public and university) totals only about 2,100.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#7"><span class="cs92015F65">(7)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Furthermore, of this 0.25% of the fossil record which is vertebrates, only 1% of that 0.25% (or 0.0025%) are vertebrate fossils that consist of more than a single bone! For example, there&#39;s only one Stegosaurus skull that has been found, and many of the horse species are each represented by only one specimen of one tooth!<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c014.html#8"><span class="cs92015F65">(8)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In any regional area where vertebrate fossils are found, there is a general tendency for these land animals to be higher up in the rock strata sequence on top of the strata containing marine organisms. This has been interpreted by evolutionists as representing the evolutionary sequence of life from marine invertebrates through fish and amphibians to the land-based vertebrates.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">However, this same observation can be more reasonably explained by Flood geologists as due to the order of burial of the different ecological zones of organisms by the Flood waters. For example, shallow marine organisms/ ecological zones would be the first destroyed by the fountains of the great deep breaking open, with the erosional runoff from the land due to the torrential rainfall concurrently burying them. On this basis then we would probably not expect to find human remains in the early Flood strata, which would contain only shallow marine organisms. The fossil record as we understand it at the moment certainly fits with this.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Additionally, the majority of the few mammal fossils in the fossil record are in the so-called Tertiary strata, which most creationist geologists nowadays regard as post-Flood strata. If this is the case, then there really aren&#39;t very many mammal fossils in the late Flood sediments (there are a few mammal fossils in the so-called Mesozoic rocks). Consequently, it&#39;s not only human fossils that are not found in the Flood sediments, but there is a relative lack of other mammal fossils also.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Of course, in the post-Flood era humans would have been able to make the necessary decisions to get away from the local residual catastrophes responsible for the post-Flood (Tertiary) strata, so we wouldn&#39;t expect to find humans fossilized in post-Flood sediments like we find other mammals.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another problem in the fossil record is, as we have already seen, the fragmentary nature of what is often found, which makes identification difficult. For example, &quot;a five million year-old piece of one tooth!(8)</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Destruction of skeletons</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The next question to ask is: Would all the people still alive when the Flood waters finally covered all the land and swept them away be buried and preserved as fossils in the later Flood sediments? Can we assume that there was no destruction of the people&#39;s bodies in the Flood waters and by other processes operating during the Flood and subsequently? Probably not!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The turbulence of the water, even in a local flood, can be horrific, particularly when the fast-moving current picks up not only sand and mud, but large boulders. Under such conditions, human bodies would probably be thrown around like flotsam and would tend to be destroyed by the agitation and abrasion.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But even if human bodies were buried in the later Flood sediments, destruction could still occur subsequently (that is, post-deposition). For example, if ground waters permeating through the sediments (such as sandstone) contain sufficient oxygen, then the oxygen would probably oxidize the organic molecules in the buried bodies and so destroy them. (This could be regarded as a type of weathering.) Likewise, chemically active ground waters could also be capable of dissolving human bones, removing all trace of buried people.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many Flood sediments have also undergone chemical and mineralogical changes due to the temperatures and pressures of burial, plus the presence of the water trapped in between the sediment grains. This process of change, known technically as metamorphism, eventually obliterates many fossils in the original sediments, whether they be fossils of shellfish, corals or mammals, particularly with increasing depth of burial, and higher temperatures and pressures.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yet another process that could destroy buried human bodies would be the intrusion of molten (igneous) rock into the Flood sediments, and through them to the surface to form volcanoes and lava flows. Such processes involve heat intense enough to melt rocks and recrystallize them. As the hot molten rock rises through the sediments, the sediments are often baked by the heat, and again chemical and mineralogical changes occur that obliterate many contained fossils.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All of these factors greatly lengthen the odds of finding a human fossil today.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Differential suspension</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Not only would the turbulence of the sediment-laden Flood waters probably destroy some of the human bodies swept away, but differential suspension in the waters could have made it hard to bury those bodies that survived the turbulence. This is because human bodies when immersed in water tend to bloat, and therefore become lighter and float to the surface. This is what is meant by differential suspension. The human bodies floating on the water surface could therefore for some time be carrion for whatever <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/bird.html"><span class="cs92015F65">birds</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> were still flying around seeking places to land and food to eat. Likewise, marine carnivores still alive in their watery habitat would also devour corpses.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Furthermore, if the bodies floated long enough and were not eaten as carrion, then they would still have tended to either decompose or be battered to destruction on and in the waters before any burial could take place. This could explain why we still don&#39;t find human fossils higher up in the fossil record/geological column, that is, the later Flood sediments.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When we take all these factors into account, it would seem unlikely that many of the people present at the time the Flood waters came could have ended up being fossilized. Even if a handful, perhaps a few thousand, were preserved, when such a small number is distributed through the vast volume of Flood sediments, the chances of one being found at the surface are mathematically very, very low, let alone of being found by a professional scientist who could recognize its significance and document it properly.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Putting all these factors together and assuming that they are all realistic possibilities, then the probability of finding a human fossil in the Flood sediments today would be very, very small. To date, our investigations of the fossil record indicate that there are no human fossils in Flood strata, so perhaps the above explanations could be some of the reasons why this is so.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">God&#39;s purpose for the Flood</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Finally, however, we need to consider the purpose for which God sent the Flood, for this provides yet another reason, and perhaps the main reason, why we do not find any human fossils in the Flood sediments and why we should not expect to find any. In <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html#7"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 6:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> we read that God said He would destroy man, whom He had created from the face of the earth. So perhaps God deliberately made sure that the Flood waters did just that, destroying every trace of man and his artifacts from the pre-Flood world, if this is what He meant by what He had recorded in the Scriptures.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Yes, God did say that He would send a Flood to destroy the beasts of the field and every living thing in whose nostrils was the breath of life also, but yet we find fossils of all the animals, etc. How then can it be that we find animal fossils and not human fossils or artifacts, when God said that He was equally going to destroy the animals </span><span class="csC382D2BB">and</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> man from the face of the earth by the Flood?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Elsewhere in Scripture we learn that as far as God&#39;s judgment of sin is concerned, when God says that He wants the offenders removed, then this means utter destruction. We see this in the case of the children of Israel moving into the Promised Land. They were told to utterly destroy the Canaanites because of their evil and evil practices. God had pronounced judgment on the Canaanites and the Israelites were but His instruments in executing judgment. The fact that they didn&#39;t utterly destroy the Canaanites ended up being a lingering malignant problem, as the Israelites repeatedly lapsed into the sinful practices of the Canaanites who had survived the conquest.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Similarly, we see that God issued the instruction to King Saul to utterly destroy the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/amalekite.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Amalekites</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, again as a judgment on them for their evil (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/1sam15.html"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Samuel 15</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Again, when God meant His judgment to be utter destruction, He meant what He said, and Saul&#39;s disobedience in not carrying through this instruction led to his own downfall.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It would seem to us unloving of God to execute such relentless judgment, but such is God&#39;s <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/abhor.html"><span class="cs92015F65">abhorrence</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of sin that its penalty must be seen for what it is -utter destruction and removal of all trace. If God cannot tolerate sin (His holiness cannot &ldquo;look&rdquo; on sin), then all trace of sin has to be removed in judgment, which necessitates utter destruction. Should human remains have been allowed to survive the Flood as fossils, then there could also have been the possibility of such remains being worshiped and revered.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">However, at least some of the animals became fossilized. Though <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen6.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 6</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> implies that they were affected by the entry of sin into the world, they were not morally accountable. Also, they serve as a witness to God&#39;s judgment at the time of the Flood. In other words, when we look at the fossil record and seem not to see any human fossils, this should remind us how much God hates sin. We should see the fossils as a sober reminder of the penalty of sin and the character of God&#39;s judgment, and as a testimony to the reality of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/noah.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Noah&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Flood and the trustworthiness of the Scriptural record.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/apostle.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Apostle</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/peter.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Peter</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> takes up this theme in <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/2pet3.html"><span class="cs92015F65">2 Peter 3</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. He says that just as God created the world and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/judgmentsofgod.html"><span class="cs92015F65">judged</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the world the first time by the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/deluge.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Flood</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, then so too He is going to keep His word and judge the world the second time by fire. Man therefore should take heed and make peace with his Creator while there is still time, before God comes again as Judge with sudden and swift judgment.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">Conclusions</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As far as we are aware at the present time, there are no indisputable human fossils in the fossil record that we could say belong to the pre-Flood human culture(s). When we endeavor to understand some of the processes that may have occurred during the Flood, and also the real nature of the fossil record, we are not embarrassed by the seeming lack of human fossils.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We don&#39;t have all the explanations as to how the evidence came to be that way, and it may be that in the future we will discover some human fossils. However, there is also much about the fossil record that the evolutionists have a hard time explaining. On the other hand, we should also realize that we don&#39;t have all the answers either, and we never will.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Even though God has left us with evidence for creation and the Flood, the Bible still says that without faith it is impossible to please </span><span class="csC382D2BB">and</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> believe Him (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/heb11.html#6"><span class="cs92015F65">Hebrews 11:6</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Because we weren&#39;t there at the time of the Flood we cannot scientifically prove exactly what happened, so there will always be aspects that will involve our faith. However, it is not blind faith. As we have investigated the evidence, we have seen nothing to contradict what the Bible says about a world Flood. We can be satisfied that there are reasonable explanations, consistent with Scripture, for the seeming lack of human fossils in Flood rocks.</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

				<span class="csCF6BBF71">This situation is true not only for skin color. Generally, whatever feature we may look at, no people group has anything that is essentially different from that possessed by any other.

				<span class="csCF6BBF71">It protects the skin against damage by ultraviolet light from the sun. If you have too little melanin in a very sunny environment, you will easily suffer sunburn and skin cancer. If you have a great deal of melanin, and you live in a country where there is little sunshine, it will be harder for you to get enough vitamin D (which needs sunshine for its production in your body). You may then suffer from vitamin D deficiency, which could cause a bone disorder such as rickets.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We also need to be aware that we are not born with a genetically fixed amount of melanin. Rather, we have a genetically fixed </span><span class="csC382D2BB">potential</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to produce a certain amount, and the amount increases in response to sunlight. For example, you may have noticed that when your Caucasian friends (who spent their time indoors during winter) headed for the beach at the beginning of summer they all had more or less the same pale white skin color.

However, once again we all share these same compounds, and the principles governing their inheritance are similar to those outlined here. Factors other than pigment in the skin may influence the shade perceived by the observer in subtle ways, such as the thickness of the overlying (clear) skin layers, the density and positioning of the blood capillary networks, etc. In fact, &ldquo;melanin,&rdquo; which is produced by cells in the body called melanocytes, consists of two pigments, which also account for hair color. Eumelanin is very dark brown, phaeomelanin is more reddish. People tan when sunlight stimulates eumelanin production. Redheads, who are often unable to develop a protective tan, have a high proportion of phaeomelanin. They have probably inherited a defective gene which makes their pigment cells &quot;unable to respond to normal signals that stimulate eumelanin production.&quot; See P.

We sometimes call them &ldquo;natural disasters,&rdquo; but they are not a surprise to God. Yes, God certainly can control the weather and send deadly storms.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some have concluded that suffering occurs because it is beyond God&#39;s control. This is incorrect. God has indeed established certain laws and principles that govern nature, but he remains sovereign over these laws. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/psa148.html#8"><span class="cs92015F65">Psalm 148:8</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> declares that storms </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">&ldquo;do his bidding.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Concerning Jonah, it was the Lord who </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/jonah1.html#4"><span class="cs92015F65">Jonah 1:4</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> KJV).

Today, God&#39;s creation is too often depersonalized. He is in control, and has His reasons for all kinds of weather, both fair and stormy. </span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">
					<span class="cs2C025596">JOB&#39;S FAMILY KILLED BY A SEVERE STORM</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One biblical example is the story of Job. Severe weather had killed Job&#39;s sheep, his servants, and all ten of his children. As Job suffered further physical affliction, he asked, &quot;Why is there evil in the world?&quot; His friends were not of great help in answering the question. Finally, after much dialogue, God spoke directly to Job out of a whirlwind (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/job38.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Job 38-41</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). The Lord made clear that His control over nature and His ultimate purposes are to be trusted. We simply cannot understand all the details of the divine plan. Job&#39;s testimony demonstrates how trials should bring us closer to God instead of driving us away: </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/job1.html#21"><span class="cs92015F65">Job 1:21</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> KJV). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/job37.html#13"><span class="cs92015F65">Job 37:13</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> declares that God sometimes brings storms to punish people.

					<li class="cs893638BA"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">GEORGE WASHINGTON. In a famous painting, General George Washington is shown crossing the Delaware River on Christmas night 1776. With snow falling, his forces were able to surprise and defeat the enemy. This victory fanned the revolution&#39;s fading embers. Weather continued to play an important role in America&#39;s Revolutionary War. </span></li><li class="cs893638BA"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">DUNKIRK. In June 1940, 400,000 British and French soldiers were trapped on the north coast of France at Dunkirk. The Nazi forces were only ten miles away and could have cornered Allied troops. However, at this time thick fog and clouds settled over the beaches. The English Channel also became unusually calm, and many small boats from England were able to ferry soldiers across to safety. The protective weather pattern lasted nine days while the men were evacuated. The Allied army was thus preserved to fight another day. Winston Churchill called the evacuation of Dunkirk a &ldquo;miracle of deliverance.&rdquo; </span></li><li class="cs893638BA"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">SPANISH ARMADA. Four centuries ago, Philip II of Spain set out to rule the world. His goal was to reunite all of Christianity under the Catholic faith, and also under Spanish control. Philip was a heartless leader who had earlier supported the harsh measures of the Spanish Inquisition. He did not get along well with either Britain or Holland. When the Netherlands declared their independence from Spain in 1588, Philip sailed north with an &ldquo;invincible&rdquo; Armada of 130 warships and 30,000 men. Then, while far from home, bad weather hit the fleet. With no port available the ships were forced to anchor at sea. The smaller British fleet under Sir Francis Drake than harassed the Spanish by releasing flaming &ldquo;tar ships&rdquo; among the anchored fleet. The Spanish Armada fled north through the English Channel and around the coast of Scotland, where continued fierce storms pushed the fleet onto the rocky shores. As the history books used to say, &quot;God blew and they were scattered.&quot; Only half of the original Spanish fleet finally limped back home. The great Spanish sea power had been diminished by the weather, instead of by war. Perhaps a worldwide dictatorship was averted by this defeat of the Spanish Armada. </span></li></ul>

Thus there is no biblical evidence for a slowly evolving atmosphere.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the naturalistic view, however, the earth&#39;s atmosphere is required to have changed drastically over time. Air on the early earth is assumed to have come from volcanic gases and from meteorite bombardment. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some scientists believe the primitive earth had gases somewhat similar to present-day Venus and Mars: carbon dioxide (CO</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), nitrogen (N</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), water vapor (H</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">O), hydrogen (H</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sub>4</sub></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">), and ammonia (NH</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sub>3</sub></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Scientists have no general agreement on which of these gases might have dominated the early atmosphere, and, in fact, engage in considerable debate over the early existence of methane and ammonia. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This supposed early atmosphere is called reducing; it would have supplied electrons to substances and chemically reduced them to other forms. This reducing process often separates molecules into smaller components. Thus, the early atmosphere would actually have broken down any building blocks of life that were present. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Other speculations on the forming of today&#39;s atmosphere are also highly questionable, such as these:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
					<li class="csCDAAB0FD"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Anaerobic (without oxygen) bacteria came to life in the sea. </span></li><li class="csCDAAB0FD"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Blue-green algae evolved and began making oxygen by photosynthesis. A half-billion years ago the oxygen level finally reached its present value. </span></li></ol>
				<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Clearly this speculation is closely connected with the assumed evolution of life. However, geochemical evidence for the assumed early atmosphere theory has added unnecessary complications to our understanding of the earth&#39;s atmosphere. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some &ldquo;old earth&rdquo; creationists have attempted to find divine direction in the evolution of the earth&#39;s atmosphere. They emphasize that blue-green algae came along at just the opportune time, making oxygen in preparation for higher forms of life. They also suggest that early, heavy carbon dioxide concentrations dwindled just in time to avoid runaway greenhouse warming on earth. Thus God directed a slowly changing atmosphere for our eventual benefit. This reasoning is certainly interesting, but these cautions are advised:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
					<li class="csCDAAB0FD"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">If the young-age view is correct, then this compromise with the evolutionary time scale is misleading. </span></li><li class="csCDAAB0FD"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">No general agreement or evidence exists that the atmosphere was once abundant with carbon dioxide, or depleted in oxygen. </span></li><li class="csCDAAB0FD"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Secular scientists usually are not impressed by &ldquo;theistic evolution&rdquo; arguments. The atmosphere did somehow evolve in step with life, they say, regardless of probabilities against it. </span></li><li class="csCDAAB0FD"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">In <a class="csB4F56505" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen1.html#11"><span class="cs777ED152">Genesis 1:11</span></a></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">, land plants and trees are described as the first life on earth.

					<span class="cs2C025596">Catastrophic Plate Tectonics</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The model proposed by Baumgardner begins with a pre-flood super-continent (&ldquo;Let the waters... be gathered together into one place&rdquo; <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen1.html#9"><span class="cs92015F65">Genesis 1:9</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) and dense ocean floor rocks. The process starts with the cold and dense ocean floor beginning to sink into the softer, less dense mantle beneath. The friction from this movement generates heat, especially around the edges, which softens the adjacent mantle material, making it less resistant to the sinking of the ocean floor.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c001.html#14"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>14</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The edges sink faster, dragging the rest of the ocean floor along, in conveyor belt fashion. Faster movement creates more friction and heat in the surrounding mantle, reducing its resistance further and so the ocean floor moves even faster, and so on. At its peak, this thermal runaway instability would have allowed for subduction at rates of meters-per-second. This key concept is called runaway subduction.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The sinking ocean floor would displace mantle material, starting large-scale movement throughout the entire mantle. However, as the ocean floor sank and rapidly subducted adjacent to the pre-flood super-continent&#39;s margins, elsewhere the earth&#39;s crust would be under such tensional stress that it would be torn apart (rifted), breaking up both the pre-flood super-continent and the ocean floor.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thus, crustal spreading zones would rapidly extend along cracks in the ocean floor for some 6,000 miles where the splitting was occurring. Hot mantle material displaced by the subducting slabs would well up, rising to the surface along these spreading zones. On the ocean floor, this hot mantle material would vaporize copious amounts of ocean water, producing a linear geyser of superheated steam along the whole length of the spreading centers (perhaps the &ldquo;<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c010.html"><span class="cs92015F65">fountains of the great deep</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&rdquo;?

This steam would disperse, condensing in the atmosphere to fall as intense global rain (&ldquo;and the flood-gates of heaven were opened&rdquo; Genesis 7:11). This could account for the rain persisting for 40 days and 40 nights (Genesis 7:12).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image75.gif" width="301" height="288" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Baumgardner&#39;s catastrophic plate tectonics global flood model for earth history<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c001.html#15"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>15</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is able to explain more geological data than the conventional plate tectonics model with its many millions of years. For example, rapid subduction of the pre-flood ocean floor into the mantle results in new ocean floor that is dramatically hotter, especially in its upper 60 miles, not just at spreading ridges, but everywhere. Being hotter, the new ocean floor is of lower density and therefore rises 3,000 to 6,000 feet higher than before and implies a dramatic rise in global sea level.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This higher sea level floods the continental surfaces and makes possible the deposition of large areas of sedimentary deposits on top of the normally high-standing continents. The Grand Canyon provides a spectacular window into the amazing layer-cake character of these sediment deposits that in many cases continue uninterrupted for more than 600 miles.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c001.html#16"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>16</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Uniformitarian (&ldquo;slow and gradual&rdquo;) plate tectonics simply cannot account for such thick continental sediment sequences of such vast horizontal extent.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Moreover, the rapid subduction of the cooler pre-flood ocean floor into the mantle would have resulted in increased circulation of viscous fluid (note: plastic, not molten) rock within the mantle. This mantle-flow (i.e., &ldquo;stirring&rdquo; within the mantle) suddenly altered the temperatures at the core-mantle boundary, as the mantle near the core would now be significantly cooler than the adjacent core, and thus convection and heat loss from the core would be greatly accelerated. The model suggests that under these conditions of accelerated convection in the core, rapid geomagnetic reversals would have occurred. These in turn would be expressed on the earth&#39;s surface and recorded in the so-called magnetic stripes.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c001.html#17"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>17</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> However, these would be erratic and locally patchy, laterally and at depth, just as the data indicate,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><sup></sup></span><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c001.html#18"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>18</sup></span></a><span class="csCF6BBF71"> even according to the uniformitarian scientists cited earlier.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This model provides a mechanism that explains how the plates could move relatively quickly (in a matter of a few months) over the mantle and subduct. And it predicts that little or no movement would be measurable between plates today, because the movement would have come almost to a standstill when the entire pre-flood ocean floor was subducted. From this we would also expect the trenches adjacent to subduction zones today to be filled with undisturbed late-flood and post-flood sediments, just as we observe.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image76.gif" width="393" height="220" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Aspects of Baumgardner&#39;s mantle modeling have been independently duplicated and thus verified by others.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c001.html#19"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>19</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Furthermore, Baumgardner&#39;s modeling predicts that because this thermal runaway subduction of cold ocean floor crystal slabs occurred relatively recently, during the flood (about 5,000 or so years ago), then those slabs would not have had sufficient time since to be fully assimilated into the surrounding mantle. So, evidence of the slabs above the mantle-core boundary (to which they sank) should still be found today. Indeed, evidence for such unassimilated relatively cold slabs has been found in seismic studies.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c001.html#20"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>20</sup></span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span><img src="The%20Biblical%20Flood_files/image77.gif" width="500" height="380" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The model also provides a mechanism for retreat of the flood waters. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/psa104.html#6"><span class="cs92015F65">Psalm 104:6-7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> describes the abating of the waters which had stood above the mountains.

On the other hand, catastrophic plate tectonics in the context of the flood can explain how the plates overcame the viscous drag of the earth&#39;s mantle for a short time due to the enormous catastrophic forces at work, followed by a rapid slowing down to present rates.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Continental separation solves apparent geological enigmas.

					<span class="cs2C025596">Conclusion</span></h2>
				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Early skepticism about plate tectonics has largely evaporated because the framework has such great explanatory power. The catastrophic plate tectonics model for the flood not only includes these explanatory elements, but also accounts for widespread evidences of massive flooding and catastrophic geological processes on the continents. Future refinement of the model may also help to explain the order and distribution of fossils observed in the fossil record in the context of the Genesis flood.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible is silent about plate tectonics. Many creationists believe the concept is helpful in explaining earth&#39;s history. Some are still cautious. The idea is quite new, and radical, and much work has yet to be done to flesh out the details. There may even be major modifications to the theory that increase its explanatory power, or future discoveries could cause the model to be abandoned. Such is the nature of scientific progress. Scientific models come and go, &ldquo;But the word of the Lord endures forever&rdquo; (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/1pet1.html#25"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Peter 1:25</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><h2 class="cs778DBFE2">

According to linguist Dr. Charles Taylor, The more natural and literal reading is to have the &ldquo;</span><span class="cs54AE92B1">mountains</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&rdquo; in verse 8 going up and the &quot;</span><span class="cs54AE92B1">valleys</span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&quot; (verse 8) going down. The Septuagint (LXX), a Greek translation done about 250 B.C., Luther&#39;s German translation, which pre-dates the KJV, and French and Italian translations all agree. English translations that convey this meaning include the ASV, RSV, and NASB. See C.V.
