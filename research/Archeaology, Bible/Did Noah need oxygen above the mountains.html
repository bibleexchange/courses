				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Measurements suggest that Everest is currently rising at up to 15 centimeters (six inches) per year. If we extrapolate backwards, taking the rate of rise of 15 cm per year and the current height of Everest (8,848 meters, or 29,028 feet), Everest would have been at sea level only 59,000 years ago. If the current rate of rise is only the tail end of what has been happening in the past, the rise in the past could have been much greater, bringing the origin of Everest to the time of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/noah.html"><span class="cs92015F65">Noah&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Flood.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Creationist scientists currently think that mountains such as the Himalayas were probably built by catastrophic movement of the Earth&#39;s continental plates during and after the Flood. The rate of rise now measured is just the remnant of the processes which occurred much faster in the past.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mountain building occurred as a part of the geologic processes which deepened the oceans to take the waters off the land towards the end of the Flood. Some mountains could have existed before the Flood, but none like the current Himalayas, Alps, or Andes in height. In any case, there is only enough water on all the Earth to cover mountains about 3 kilometers (2 miles) high, if all the ocean basins were raised.</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="240" style="border-collapse:collapse;">

				<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So, if the waters were not 9 kilometers deep, but much less, the question is no longer an issue.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Even if the flood waters were 9 kilometers deep, would Noah and company have had trouble breathing?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Absolutely not. Air pressure is caused by the weight of air above the point where the pressure is experienced. If the water was 9 kilometers deep, then the air that was in that 9 kilometers deep volume of what was atmosphere would have been pushed out and would then have sat above the water at 9 kilometers above the Earth&#39;s surface.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">However, if we assume the worst case scenario of the radius of the Earth increasing by 9 kilometers due to the water, the surface area of the Earth plus water would have been greater than the Earth, so that the weight of air would have been spread over a bigger area so that the pressure would have been less.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How much would the air pressure have been reduced? Less than 0.3%. This is equivalent to standing on top of a 30 meter (100 feet) high building at sea level! There would also have been a negligible effect on the pressure due to changes in the force of gravity (which affects the weight of the air).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is certain, therefore, that those on the Ark would have had no trouble breathing - </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">without</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> oxygen tanks.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Further Reading</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
