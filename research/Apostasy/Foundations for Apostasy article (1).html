			<span class="cs16E84F30">How Did We Get To Where We Are Today?</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In the 1940s and 50s, a foundation was laid that would, in the decades to follow, shake Church structures to the core. In this article, we&#39;ll be looking at the last fifty years and examining the process that brought apostasy to the Church and put it on the road leading toward the New Age Christ. We will begin by looking at the forties. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Forties</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I only want to mention two things about this decade. One is a man and the other is an organization. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">40s: DAVID DU PLESSIS</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In 1947, the First World Pentecostal Conference was held in Zurich, Switzerland. This conference brought into prominence David Du Plessis, &quot;Mr. Pentecost,&quot; who went on to organize three other World Conferences. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Du Plessis participated in the first of six assemblies of the World Council of Churches (Amsterdam, 1948), a council which </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. concluded that men have an obligation to recognize the brotherhood amongst denominations and to recognize all churches alike, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. introduced the idea of worldwide unity to &quot;claim for Christ the whole world and all aspects of life,&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3... and to bring to light the idea that the Kingdom of God was being established upon the earth. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Du Plessis&#39;s involvement in the WCC assembly was not a one time event. In his book and lectures, he went on to promote the WCC&#39;s &quot;Week of Prayer for Christian Unity,&quot; whose theme was &quot;The Unity of the Local Congregation in the Unity of the Universal Church.&quot; The exhortation for the eighth day of prayer went like this: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;As you pray remember that you are a member of the whole Body of Christ and in particular reflect on the need FOR MANIFESTATIONS OF UNITY through Church organizations - denominational boards, church synods, confessional alliances, local and national councils of churches, and especially for the World Council of Churches.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Du Plessis was a watchdog of the pentecostal experience. He said that from 1900-1908, the historic Protestant churches fought the Pentecostal revival and denounced it as from the devil. But by 1950-1958, the climate had changed and the Protestants&#39; attitude had reversed. Du Plessis said that by 1961, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I beheld the results of the change and can declare the Pentecostal revival within the churches is gathering force and speed.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">By 1963, Du Plessis had preached the Pentecostal experience in 45 countries. He was a major player in the ecumenical movement from the pentecostal faction, and became a bridge between Rome and the world of Pentecostalism. In his book, </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Spirit Bade me Go,</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> he states his call by God as being </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;called to labor for better understanding and closer fellowship between the Pentecostal movements, and to bring the Pentecostal message and blessing into the ranks OF ALL THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">40s: LATTER RAIN</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> In Canada, other seeds were being planted that would eventually affect the future direction of the Church as a whole. George and Earnest Hawtin and George Warnock became early leaders in what would become known as the Latter Rain movement. Latter Rain brought with it the belief that one had to have special knowledge, or &quot;gnosis,&quot; to attain the fullness of God. Those who achieved &quot;gnosis&quot; would become the &quot;true seed&quot; who would bring deliverance to the world and establish Christ&#39;s Kingdom on earth. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Fifties</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">50s: MANIFEST SONS</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. William Branham brought the Latter Rain movement to the United States and in the process, it took on a new name: the Manifest Sons of God. Manifest Sons&#39; main penetration was in the Assemblies of God, which eventually judged the doctrine to be heretical. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">50s: FGBFI</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Also in the fifties, Demos Shakarian founded the non-denominational Full Gospel Businessmen&#39;s Fellowship International in fifty countries. The Fellowship hosted a World Convention of Pentecostals in Orlando, Florida, &quot;putting aside . . . &#39;little doctrinal&#39; points.&quot; Catholic keynote speaker Father James Bertalucci watered this compromise by saying, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I want to tell you something, brothers and sisters. When the sleeping giant of Rome comes alive, watch out world. . . . especially in a day and age where we can cooperate and collaborate in winning the world for Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">These statements are examples of the beginnings of ecumenism among the churches. This ecumenism would eventually lead to the setting aside of large portions of doctrine, a move made necessary by such efforts as cooperative world evangelism. Eventually, deeper compromises of doctrine would pave the way for the &quot;new revelations&quot; of the Latter Rain prophets. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Full Gospel fellowship is only one of many organizations I could mention. The important point here is that it and other groups provided an atmosphere in which walls between members of the denominations could be radically broken down during the next decade. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Sixties</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">60s: VATICAN COUNCIL II: A NEW PENTECOST</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. The sixties brought major breakdowns of doctrine in the hearts of individual Christians. During the ecumenical Vatican Council II (1962-1965), the announcement was made that the Catholic Church had entered a &quot;new era as a World Church.&quot; We can now see that the presence at this Council of David Du Plessis and other Protestant observers meant that ecumenism was to play a big part in the world church that the Catholic hierarchy had in mind. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Pope John XXIII had prayed for the Vatican Council in these words: &quot;Renew Thy wonders in this our day as by a new Pentecost,&quot; and in 1966, the Pope&#39;s prayer was answered. The Charismatic Renewal began in the Catholic Church. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The events of this New Pentecost were described in many books of the time. Father Edward D. O&#39;Conner wrote in his book, </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Pentecostal Movement</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The new Pentecostal fire has likewise leaped from one person to another, and thus has gone across the country.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This was a time when the walls of denominationalism started falling at great speed. According to John MacArthur&#39;s </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Charismatics</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;In 1960, Pentecostalism spilled over denominational lines when Episcopal rector Dennis Bennet experienced what he believed was the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gift of tongues. After that, as John Sherrill put it, &quot;THE WALLS CAME TUMBLING DOWN.&quot; The Charismatic movement spread into mainline denominations such as Episcopalian, Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and Lutheran.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">And in </span><span class="cs31B015EA">As The Spirit Leads Us</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Kevin Ranaghan wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Through the charismatic renewal, . . . God is healing breaches and wounds in the body of Christ where they have never been able to be healed before. Walls of separation long dividing people . . . ARE BEGINNING NOW by the action of the Spirit TO CRUMBLE; fear, suspicion, ignorance, and hatred are being dissipated in this rigorous and refreshing breeze. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The newly found areas of relationship between Catholics and Protestants . . . are by no means an insignificant aspect of the renewal we are experiencing. . . . It is no exaggeration to say that the vast majority of Roman Catholics who are receiving the baptism in the Holy Spirit are continually finding mutual love and acceptance with Protestant Pentecostals as brothers and sisters in Christ. In almost every prayer group, and certainly at every day of renewal, conference, or special meeting organized and carried on under the auspices of a Catholic charismatic prayer group, one can find numbers of classical and neo-pentecostal Christians . . . .&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">John Cardinal Suenens wrote in his book, </span><span class="cs31B015EA">A New Pentecost?</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . what we see with our eyes can be considered an awakening the like of which has never been seen before in the history of the Church.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Suenens also made this VERY significant statement: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The drive toward unity among Christians seems irreversible; we may hope that the hour is not far off. The first millennium was, with some exceptions, the era of the undivided Church. The second, from 1054 until now, has seen the Church torn asunder. We are permitted to be confident with hope founded in God and in the progress of theology that the third millennium will see the restoration of full unity and full communion.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This is exactly the situation we find ourselves in today. Through the efforts of David Du Plessis and organizations such as Shakarian&#39;s Full Gospel Businessmen&#39;s Fellowship (FGBF), and within interdenominational prayer meetings, non-threatening situations were provided in which Catholic charismatics, ecumenicals, and non-denominationalists could fellowship &quot;safely&quot; together. It was within these person-to-person settings that controversial and divisive teachings were laid aside, and negative talk about other denominations receded. Controversial and divisive teachings were replaced with &quot;giving one&#39;s testimony&quot; and seeking God&#39;s deeper call for the church, meaning unity. Unity was coming about through a common experience. This growth and type of fellowship gradually became strong enough to begin to break down the denominational mindset of individual Christians. &quot;Renewal&quot; experts from various Protestant denominations and the Catholic Church now met to fertilize the roots of ecumenism. Such strategy meetings naturally led to a much deeper seeking of unity, a growth that moved from the personal level to that of Christian organizations. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">60s: MANIFEST SONS</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Even though William Branham&#39;s Manifest Sons of God movement had earlier been rejected, the root had not been destroyed. All during the time that ecumenism was building, the root remained alive, eventually breaking ground in the late sixties in the Home Circuit churches in Colorado. The movement also bore a new name - the Manchild Company. The expectation of the members of the Manchild Company was for the manifestation of the spiritual Manchild of Revelation 12, a group of people who would BE the corporate Christ, God&#39;s delegated authority on the earth. They believed that as each church submitted to this authority, God would overthrow the governments of the world and establish His millennial reign. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The growth of this spiritual authority was aided during this time by the Shepherding movement, which lessened loyalty to one&#39;s denomination by insisting instead on submission to the charismatic leadership. &quot;Shepherding&quot; placed the &quot;flock&quot; at the mercy of the shepherd. Ecumenism had broken down the boundaries of the denominations, but new boundaries were now set through the rise of what was termed &quot;submission teaching&quot; within the charismatic renewal. The vine sprouting from the roots of the Latter Rain was being trimmed and trained toward the formation of Paul Cain&#39;s Joel&#39;s Army, the corporate incarnation of Christ who would come &quot;TO the Church BEFORE He came FOR it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Also sprouting out of the Latter Rain movement during this period were the &quot;prophets&quot; and their &quot;new revelations&quot;. These made their entry into the charismatic arena through the newly formed Kansas City Fellowship. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Seventies</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">While the sixties birthed a sense of unity in the hearts of individual Christians, the seventies were a time when the non-competitive spirit of co-operation and sharing gathered Christians together into large ecumenical gatherings. The events of this decade further contributed to the breakdown of denominations as independent entities. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">During the 1970s, three major events helped bring about a further merging of Catholics, mainline Protestants, charismatics, and pentecostals that prospered the sense of unity: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. First, Dr. Billy Graham, a big influence on Christians worldwide, received the Catholic International Franciscan Award for &quot;his contribution to true ecumenism.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. The second event was pentecostal healer Kathryn Kuhlman&#39;s audience with Pope Paul. After the meeting, she said, &quot;When I met Pope Paul there was a Oneness.&quot; This &quot;oneness&quot; was carried into and through her interdenominational healing services until her death. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. The third major event was the first international mass rally of Charismatic Catholics and Evangelicals in Pneuma &#39;72, held at Notre Dame University. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">These three events caused great cracks in the walls between denominations, and the shoots from the vine began to flower in the aisles of the Protestant churches. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">70s: COOPERATIVE EVANGELISM</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Suddenly, in the early seventies, a new aspect was added to ecumenism. Meetings were held and agreements were made to institute cooperative evangelism. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In 1973, in what is hailed as David Du Plessis&#39;s major accomplishment, evangelicals and Roman Catholic bishops were linked together to form a North American Crusade Of Cooperative Evangelism. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In the same year, Bill Bright promoted a program, &quot;Key 73 Evangelism,&quot; in which Roman Catholics, Orthodox, ecumenists, evangelicals and charismatics were brought together. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">A year later, the Lausanne Movement for World Evangelism was founded by Billy Graham. Twenty seven hundred evanglicals met in Switzerland to draft a covenant to fulfill the Great Commission by evangelizing the world. Defined as a voluntary network, it sought </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;to encourage churches and groups to take the whole Gospel to the whole world through the whole Church and to do so in a spirit of cooperation and sharing, not of competition.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The non-competitive spirit of co-operation and sharing that was formed in individuals in the sixties was now evolving into a corporate manifestation. In 1975, Du Plessis announced that he would not be satisfied with anything less than full ecumenicity in the whole family of nations. Spiritual renewal would be both charismatic and ecumenical, meaning union with the Catholic Church. And then in 1976, Du Plessis received the Pax Christi Award, &quot;the evidence of his high repute in Roman Catholic circles.&quot; The message was becoming clear. Much fruit could be brought forth through the union of Rome and denominationalism, and this union was being seriously pursued. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">70s: KANSAS CITY CHARISMATIC CONFERENCE</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. The ecumenical non-competitive &quot;spirit of co-operation and sharing&quot; became evident in July 1977 when an ecumenical rally was held in Kansas City. This was the First International Conference that brought together for the first time Christians from the three traditions in the charismatic renewal. Along with Fathers James Bertalucci and Francis McNutt, 50,000 Christians from many different denominational backgrounds met. Catholic Charismatics, Episcopalians, Pentecostal Holiness, Lutherans, Four Square Gospel, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Assemblies of God, United Methodists, Southern Baptists and others from various renewal service committees were present. David Du Plessis&#39; presentation, &quot;All Together: Charismatic and Ecumenical,&quot; captured the essence of the Conference. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Bert Ghezzi, editor of New Covenant magazine, labeled it an historic gathering, and in the October 1977 edition, wrote this in an editorial: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;This conference brought together for the first time Christians from the three traditions in the charismatic renewal - the classical pentecostal, the neo-pentecostal and the Catholic pentecostal. This historic gathering was a first response to a directive word that the Lord spoke at a conference on the Catholic charismatic renewal in 1974. At that time, the Lord expressed his desire to bring the three streams together. . . . a sign of hope for all Christians. . . . The Lord called us all to reach beyond our denominational walls to work and pray agressively for a higher goal - the unification of all Christianity.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">70s: POPE JOHN PAUL II</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Also during the seventies, Pope John Paul II was elected, and in the first 100 words of his inaugural address, he &quot;recognized his sovereign placement&quot; and declared that the year 2000 would &quot;be a year of a great Jubilee.&quot; We will see the importance of this Year of Jubilee later. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">70s: A NEW PROTESTANT REFORMATION</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In his 1979 book </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Emerging Order</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, New Age author Jeremy Rifkin wrote: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;We are in the early stages of a second Protestant Reformation. . . . While Charismatics are generating a potential liberating impulse, the more mainline evangelical movement is beginning to provide the necessary reformulation of theological doctrine that is essential for the creation of a new covenant vision and worldview. . . . If the charismatic and evangelical strains of the new Christian renewal movement come together and unite a liberating energy with a new covenant vision for society, it is possible that a great religious awakening will take place, one potentially powerful enough to incite a second Protestant reformation. . . . emerging between now and the year A.D. 2000.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Rifkin&#39;s predictions began to come true in the next decade. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Eighties.</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The eighties were a time of pulling together into a corporate, united body what had been broken down in the previous two decades - the denominations and the individuals in the denominations. Large non-denominational gatherings became commonplace; one such gathering had 700,000 in attendance. Speakers from Catholicism, mainline Protestant denominations and independent churches broke down the walls even more at the Washington For Jesus Rally in Washington, D.C. Pat Robertson, John Meares, Dr. Bill Bright, James Robinson and Jim Bakker shared the microphone with Catholic Fathers Randall and Bertalucci. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Other large gatherings included the &quot;Jesus &#39;81 Rallies&quot; and Billy Graham&#39;s International conference, &quot;Amsterdam &#39;83,&quot; attended by Pat Robertson, Robert Schuller, Dr. Paul Cho, and Dr. Bill Bright, among others. </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Charisma</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> magazine reported &quot;a shift in attitude and terminology from the world&#39;s leading evangelical,&quot; meaning Graham. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: COALITION ON REVIVAL</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In the Spring of 1984, Reconstructionist Jay Grimstead launched the Coalition on Revival (COR), and its 112-member Steering Committee formed the first draft of COR&#39;s 42 Articles On Historic Christian Doctrine. COR would become a major influence in turning the Church&#39;s thinking toward establishing the Kingdom of God on earth. The COR documents of the Third Congress stated: &quot;The Coalition on Revival was called into existence as a catalyst to help unify and mobilize leadership in the Body of Christ to cause &#39;God&#39;s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.&#39;&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">COR&#39;s 42 Articles were used to form the theological foundation for 17 Worldview Sphere Documents, which stated what COR believed to be basic, Biblical principles which must govern the fields of Law, Government, Economics, Education, Media, the Arts, Science, Medicine and several spheres of ministry such as Evangelism and Discipleship. It&#39;s important to mention that Baptism and eschatology were excluded from the 42 Articles. This omission and a non-argumentative stance greatly contributed to a shift for many from a pre-millennial to a post-millennial worldview. The COR Steering Committee Document worried that </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Church of Jesus Christ has now grown lukewarm and indifferent in pursuing its redemptive priestly ministry and corrective prophetic authority. . . [the Church&#39;s] concerns are more with heaven, the future and escaping from this world [meaning by the rapture] at Christ&#39;s second coming.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Instead of clarifying our hope as Christ&#39;s return alone, COR invited all Christians to help bring the kingdom of God down from heaven through a united effort. True hope in Christ began to shift to a hope that we could establish the kingdom with God&#39;s blessing. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The COR Documents summarized 2,000 years of the Church&#39;s theology from all different denominations, and COR said that the summaries were enthusiastically accepted by theologians from almost every doctrinal position, denomination and many institutions of higher learning. Founder Jay Grimstead said Catholic and Protestant theologians, churches, colleges, and organizations around the world would use them to create their own statements of faith. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The COR Steering Committee ratified the 42 Articles in Aug 1984. Plenary Speaker Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ spoke on &quot;The Great Commission And Our Global Mission Task.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The overall acceptance of the 42 Articles paved the way for the 1994 North American Protestant Church Council and &quot;hope for a doctrinal unity at a world-level hitherto unimagined.&quot; Such a doctrinal unity was now necessary because the denominational churches had been weakened. Not only were the denominations to be torn down and then reassembled into a united Church, but doctrine, too, would suffer the same fate. The doctrine of Christ&#39;s second coming would suffer the most, as a new worldview was being set in place and being accepted by large segments of the now unifying Church. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Foundations%20for%20Apostasy%20article%20(1)_files/image2.jpg" width="798" height="8" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><h1 class="cs35586">

In July, 1986, COR&#39;s Continental Congress on the Christian World View III held a solemn assembly at the Lincoln Memorial. Sixty of COR&#39;s Steering Committee members and 400 church leaders from a broad spectrum of theological viewpoints signed THE MANIFESTO OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. COR&#39;s Crosswinds magazine, Winter 1992, reported: &quot;The Manifesto states where we [COR] believe the Church must stand to fulfill the Great Commission.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Thanks to COR and its Director Jay Grimstead, many members of the interdenominational Christian Right became involved in this unprecedented effort toward &quot;unity&quot; and the sharing of resources through networking. Small group meetings throughout the country continued to promote the signing of the Christian Manifesto by all churches. COR saw its 17 Worldview Documents as a &quot;trumpet call to the Church, to awaken, unite, get holy and then re-establish our country on the Biblical law base on which it once stood.&quot; The documents were seen as &quot;the philosophical and practical nuts and bolts of the coming reformation.&quot; Grimstead said that they provided the base for world-changing, as well as &quot;the practical steps stating how in each sphere of life we can &#39;get God&#39;s will done on earth as it is in heaven.&#39;&quot; It was reported that &quot;approximately 500 Christian leaders from various walks of life and from a wide spectrum of denominations had official input into these documents during that three year period. . . . Many believe these 17 Worldview Documents . . . will help set the Christian agenda for the 21st century.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Grimstead has indicated many times that COR is only one part of a huge network. The groundwork for world reformation is now in progress, waiting to blossom into the Kingdom of God in countries, cities, homes and churches. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: NEW LIFE 2000</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Bill Bright, the Plenary Speaker at COR&#39;s 1988 ratification of the 42 Articles, appears to have gone on to implement the COR agenda. His plan for New Life 2000 includes segmenting the world into &quot;Million Population Target Areas&quot;, taking the gospel to 5 billion people by the year 2000, introducing one billion people to Christ, launching at least one million New Life groups, and helping to plant one million new churches of various denominations. New Life 2000 would bring together leaders from all major Christian denominations, para-church ministries, lay ministries, pastors, businesses, the academic community and the legal world to accomplish its task.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: COOPERATIVE EVANGELISM.</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> In 1988, Evangelicals and Catholics continued to work closely together. Catholic Joseph Cardinal Bernardin presided over the opening of the ecumenical &quot;National Festival of Evangelism&quot; conference, and Dr. Leighton Ford, chairman of the Laussane II meeting in Manila, gave the closing address. Publicity material on the conference stated, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Evangelicals, mainline churches and Catholics consciously combined the themes of unity and evangelism.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The predictions of cooperative evangelism made by members of the Catholic hierarchy in the fifties and sixties were now on their way to fulfillment.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: GLOBAL CONSULTATION ON WORLD EVANGELISM</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In 1986, Jay Gary raised the question of evangelizing the world by the year 2000, and on February 26, 1987, his cohort from Laussane, Thomas Wang, published an article entitled, &quot;By the Year 2000: Is God Trying To Tell Us Something?&quot; The article described eight of the best &quot;gigantic plans for evangelizing the globe.&quot; By the end of 1987, the overwhelming response indicated a great interest from Christian leaders. They were literally saying, &quot;We must forget our differences and all join together to evanglize the world for Christ by the year 2000.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Gary helped coordinate the 1989 Singapore Global Consultation On World Evangelism by AD2000 &amp; Beyond. In his book, he says this conference </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;gathered an international Christian representation. . . . [and] was deliberately inclusive. Great Commission leaders came from Anglican, Ecumenical, Evangelical, Catholic, Charismatic, Third World indigenous, and Pentecostal networks.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The setting aside of &quot;little points of doctrine&quot; practiced in the early sixties had now grown into blatant compromise of the faith, but the only protest during the World Consultation would come from the Latin American contingent. The Latins stated emphatically that including the Catholic evangelistic efforts </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;[went] beyond their historical and Biblical commitment, that Ibero-American Roman Catholicism is to the present day incompatible with our evangelistic vision: Mary more than ever holds the first place in the faith, tradition supercedes the Bible, salvation by works over the work of the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on Calvary, the supreme authority of the Pope, the religious syncretism and some other well known Roman Catholic expressions.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Latins considered Catholics to be their mission field, not their brothers in Christ. It was decided to place a statement about the Catholic participation in the Steering Committee&#39;s &quot;Review &amp; Clarification&quot; statement, and the Catholics remained in the scheme of global evanglism under their plan, &quot;Evangelization 2000.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The results of these Consultation meetings of 315 leaders from 50 countries included the following: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. First, the Consultation gave tremendous impetus to regional and national AD2000 consultations. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. Second, the Consultation fostered an international identity for the AD2000 vision. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. Third, the vision, data, and resources shared in Singapore SET THE AGENDA FOR THE CHURCH until the new century. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">All Christians were now encouraged to participate in AD2000 by: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. attending an international or national congress focusing on world evangelization, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. networking with others in order to get rid of competition among groups and churches, and </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. communicating their own AD2000 programs to their churches or fellowships, and then registering with one of the major ministries serving as clearinghouses for reaching unevangelized cities. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The expected results by the year 2000 are &quot;A Bible in every home, a church for every people.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Steering Committee at the AD2000 Global Consultation decided that, as a follow-up, a Service Office should be formed to aid any group with AD2000 plans. In 1989, that office was opened, with Jay Gary and his wife, Olgy, being named as directors. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: EVANGELIZATION 2000</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Another important group met in July, 1987. The North American Congress On The Holy Spirit was held in New Orleans, with 35,000 Charismatic and Evangelicals attending. A booklet was distributed there entitled, &quot;New Evangelization 2000,&quot; the Catholic plan to evangelize the world by the year 2000. Father Tom Forrest, head of the plan&#39;s implementation, was one of the main speakers. &quot;New Evangelization 2000&quot; calls for a world-wide satellite telecast by the Pope on Christmas Day, 2000, with the hope of reaching 5 billion people. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: CHRISTIAN COALITION</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In the late eighties we saw the founding of the Christian Coalition by Pat Robertson, linking pro-family Catholics and Evangelicals. This &quot;working together&quot; constantly points to the unifying in a common cause of Evangelicals, Catholics and pentecostals. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: MANIFEST SONS</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Meanwhile, the Latter Rain doctrine began to flower again in the mid-eighties, and this time it took hold in the corporate Church because the charismatic experience was now widespread in the denominations. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The restoration of the prophets began. Bill Hamon, the father of the Manifest Sons of God prophets, said at the Florida National Prophets Conference that 10,000 Manifest Sons of God prophets were being raised up. In August of 1987, Charisma magazine reported, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;the 1980&#39;s was the decade of the restoration of the prophets to prepare the way of the Lord and to help equip the saints to MAKE READY A PEOPLE FOR GOD.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Prophet seminars, Prophet schools, Prophet conferences and Prophet gatherings dominated the 1980&#39;s. God would have His &quot;Joel&#39;s Army&quot; and it would be one that would cover the globe. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: MARCH FOR JESUS</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Also in this decade, 15,000 participated in the first March for Jesus, held by Reconstructionists in the United Kingdom. The Marches would eventually become a powerful global force in the continuation of the breaking down of denominational walls and unifying Christians. The Marches became a catalyst in the increase of the consciousness of one global Church. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: REPLACEMENT THEOLOGY</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. During the late eighties, segments of the Church began to identify themselves as &quot;The New Israel.&quot; In the February 1989 edition of the Bridges for Peace &quot;Religion Watch&quot; newsletter, a pro-Israeli organization, editor Clarence Wagner said how he </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;has noticed signs of diminishing support for Israel among charismatics. The change in attitude is due to the influence of &#39;Kingdom Now or Reconstructionist theology among charismatics, which teaches that the church will eventually rule political, social, and economic systems and goes back to the Old Testament as a blueprint for such a society. This theology &#39;sees no significance&#39; in national Israel today, and denies that Israel has a place in God&#39;s plan or His covenants. According to this view, the Old Testament covenants are for the church, the true Israel, and the curses are for Israel.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I mention this here because, according to the new theology, Israel must be removed from the end time scenario as presented in Biblical eschatology. Reconstructionism, Catholicism, the World Council of Churches and the Latter Rain Movement have no room for Israel in their end time plans, because their agendas are the same: to set up the Kingdom of God in every aspect of life. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">80s: TRINITY BROADCASTING NETWORK.</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> In the eighties, Paul Crouch&#39;s Trinity Broadcasting Network began to support Manifest Sons of God/Latter Rain teachers. Through TBN and its now approximately 500 TV stations, these doctrines are being further mixed with charismatic teaching on a global basis. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Heading For The 90s</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Note what has happened up to now: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. In the fifties through the seventies, the denominations and their doctrines were torn down. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. During the eighties, the rubble was put back together in huge ecumenical organizations bent on a united effort to evangelize the world by the year 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. The situation we now have as we look to the nineties is Protestants, Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Charismatics, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox churches walking together, forgetting their differences and joining together to evanglize the world for Christ by the year 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4.Rising up through all are the new revelations of the Manifest Sons of the Latter Rain. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The 90s</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">90s: COALITION ON REVIVIAL</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. COR was now working at international levels. Grimstead attended the &quot;Theological Track&quot; of the AD2000 strategy to reach all people groups in the world with the gospel by the year 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">COR also formed the National Coordinating Council (NCC) in 1990. The NCC was defined as &quot;an informal group of NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERS who have agreed to a National Gameplan for rebuilding society on the Bible by applying COR&#39;s 17 Worldview Documents in a systematic, aggressive way to our major metropolitan areas over the following 20 years.&quot; This plan called for the establishment of 24 Ministry Networking Committees in each major city, which are to function in a coordinated way as a single Spiritual Army under the leadership of local Christian &quot;Elders in the City Gate.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">COR also sent nine Ministry Merge teams to begin this gameplan to gather pastors and to encourage the merger of ministries within their cities, in order to mobilize the local churches. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In May 1993, the COR Church Council Steering Committee &quot;corrected&quot; church doctrine. A letter to COR supporters and readers of Crosswinds Magazine called for a return to a worldview supposedly taught by the &quot;mainstream church&quot; before 1830, as described below: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CORRECTION #1: The Kingdom of God was inaugurated and the King was installed and seated in the First Century AD and we need not wait for the King&#39;s second coming to get the kingdom started here on earth. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CORRECTION #2: Satan was completely defeated by Christ at the Cross and through His resurrection and is therefore no longer the &quot;ruler of this world&quot;. Satan can be stopped from doing anything at any time by Christ and by us Christians if we simply choose to employ the power and authority which was placed into our hands by the King Himself in the first century. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CORRECTION #3: At this moment in history, all humans on earth, whether Jew or Gentile, believer or unbeliever, private person or public official, are obligated to bow their knees to this King Jesus, confess Him as Lord of the universe with their tongues, and submit to His lordship over every aspect of their lives in thought, word and deed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CORRECTION #4: Biblical evangelism according to the Great Commission of Matthew 28:18-20 is not truly accomplished unless that message of Christ&#39;s lordship (from the last point above) is given to the person being evangelized. In that way, they know that any attempt at personal neutrality before King Jesus is sin and treason in this universe. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CORRECTION #5: The words in the Lord&#39;s Prayer stating &quot;Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven&quot; were meant to be prayed with the hope of its fulfillment on earth before Christ&#39;s second coming, when the Christians of any geography decided to band together to help make it happen. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CORRECTION #6: The Bible is the plumb line for all nations, Christian and non-Christian, by which nations are to measure the justice and wisdom of all their laws, governments, procedures and society in general. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The proposals in these corrections had devastating effects on the Church regarding the doctrine of Christ&#39;s second coming as our only hope. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">90s: CATHOLICS/EVANGELICALS TOGETHER</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. On March 30, 1994, a major step in the striving for unity was formalized with the signing of &quot;Catholics and Evangelicals Together&quot;. This new Catholic/Protestant unity was to set a standard for the world. In our newsletter at the time, we wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Catholics, pentecostals and evangelicals have been uniting in unprecedented ways lately, including joining of forces to evangelize the world by the year 2000. But this statement, called &#39;Evangelicals and Catholics Together: The Christian Mission in the Third Millennium,&#39; is no less than a foundation for the apostate church long prophesied in Scripture. This end-time Church will, unlike the Philadelphians of old, refuse to hold fast to God&#39;s word, because it will have denied His name. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The groups declared they affirm &#39;the central beliefs in the resurrection and divinity of Christ&#39; and that &#39;all who accept Christ as Lord and Savior are brothers and sisters in Christ,&#39; but their agreement is based on &#39;no longer hold[ing] each other at theological arms length.&#39; Both communities agreed to &#39;stop . . . aggressive proselytization of each other&#39;s flocks because IT WAS NEITHER THEOLOGICALLY LEGITIMATE NOR A PRUDENT USE OF RESOURCES.&#39; The end result of this united effort is that God&#39;s revealed truth will be laid aside for a socio-political agenda, nullifying the power of His word to save anybody. Only the Vatican has gained a victory here, and what a victory it is! To quote Pauline MacPhearson of the Bold Truth newsletter, &#39;The silly idea that Biblical Christians could minimize their differences for unity without betrayal of fundamental truths is a demon&#39;s illusion&#39; (4/8/94). The literal interpretation of Scripture, inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the life-blood of the one true Church, yet the compromise of God&#39;s word continues. This union of political right-wing evangelicals and the Catholic Church for the purpose of societal problem-solving only weakens further that which Jesus said is spirit and life to us - His word.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">90s: AD2000 and BEGIN</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Meanwhile, Jay Gary advanced his efforts. His AD2000 Global Service Office formed BEGIN, the Bimillennial Global Interaction Network in connection with Celebration 2000. BEGIN was described as </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;a group of concerned world citizens who circulate information and ideas ON CELEBRATING THE YEAR 2000 AS A PLANETARY HOPE. The question which BEGIN seeks to address is: &#39;How can thousands of bi-millennial celebrations of life and civilization truly leave a legacy for the entire human family that will endure the test of time?&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">BEGIN&#39;s Bimillennial Research Report published the latest news of celebrations around the world, and highlighted publications on the bimillennium. The celebrations reported by BEGIN included Christian, secular, New Age and political events on both national and international levels. In His newsletter, Gary wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . We believe the year 2000 offers a historic opportunity for us to celebrate the gift of life together as we enter a new millennium. Therefore, we call for the year 2000 to be celebrated as a golden jubilee. All fields of life, whether business, education, technology, the arts, religion, civic organizations, and government should prepare for a better, more peaceful Third Millennium.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This is a VERY IMPORTANT statement to lay hold of because we will build on it in our third article. Pope John Paul II had said that the year 2000 &quot;will be the year of a great jubilee&quot;, and now Jay Gary was calling the uniting, global Church to this same celebration. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">90s: MANIFEST SONS</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. The Manifest Sons began to find much acceptance in the nineties. The Kansas City Fellowship, now a training center for the prophets, carried their message to thousands in attendance at an Anaheim, California conference entitled, &quot;Holiness Unto The Lord.&quot; Through the syncristic move to &quot;unity&quot; within the corporate Church, the rejection of the Manifest Sons prophets from the 1940s-60s was overcome. The message: &quot;God&#39;s got an Army.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">90s: PAUL CROUCH/LATTER RAIN</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Paul Crouch&#39;s promotion of the Latter Rain teaching is becoming one of the major influences in unifying the Church in this Army. In his MARCH 94 Praise The Lord newsletter, he wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Something BIG is in the air! 1994 is going to be a pivotal year. I can FEEL it - you can feel it - numerous Christian leaders and prophets of the Lord are declaring it! </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;...The Prophet Joel says that in the latter days there will be the most important sign of all - a mighty, worldwide shaking and outpouring of the Holy Spirit! He makes it very clear that this manifestation will be &#39;UPON ALL FLESH.&#39; The beginning of that rain was at Pentecost when Peter stood up and preached to 3,000 converts. But Joel distinguishes the rain into two categories, the FORMER and the LATTER rain. Peter saw the former, and I believe we are in the latter rain. But Partners, GET READY - compared to what is coming, as the old saying goes, we haven&#39;t seen ANYTHING yet! </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Prophet Paul Cain has seen in the Spirit, a last days revival so powerful that hospitals will literally be emptied and people kneeling in public places to receive Christ will become commonplace! Many great Christian leaders, as I said, are feeling the same witness of the Holy Spirit that the wind, fire and rain of revival is on the way and, in a measure, has already begun! Praise the Lord - LET IT RAIN!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">90s: PK-MFJ</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. The denominational walls were down, and huge nets were cast to gather Christians into one unified body. Promise Keepers was started in 1990, and March for Jesus came to this country in 1994, a year after the spirit of joy, laughing and celebration hit the Church full force. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Summary</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">1940s WCC</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. So in the forties, the World Council of Churches </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. reached the conclusion that men have an obligation to recognize all churches alike and to recognize the brotherhood amongst denominations. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. introduced the idea of worldwide unity, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. to &quot;claim for Christ the whole world and all aspects of life.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. and to bring to light that the Kingdom of God was being established upon the earth. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">1940-1990: LATTER RAIN.</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In the forties and fifties, we saw the Latter Rain Movement try to rise through the denominations: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. It would be declared heretical and therefore go underground. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. But through the eighties and nineties, it would succeed in finding a place as it influenced the direction of the corporate Church by subtly introducing its doctrines. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">1960s</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In the sixties, the individual Christian was brought into situations where his denominational doctrine was compromised through prayer meetings and charismatic, non-denominational organizations. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">1970s</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In the seventies, we saw these individual Christians and their leaders brought into larger ecumenical conferences and gatherings to form in them the sense of unity. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">1980s</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. In the eighties, these large gatherings took the form of planning a global effort to evangelize the world by the year 2000 in cooperation with the Catholic Church, through the compromise of doctrine. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs31B015EA">1990s.</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> In the nineties, we saw implementation and mobilization of the global evangelization effort. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Over the last five decades, the more the Church united, the more solid doctrine eroded. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Foundations%20for%20Apostasy%20article%20(1)_files/image4.jpg" width="798" height="8" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><h1 class="cs35586">

Doctrine has been corrupted or set aside through the pursuit of a corporate experience. Through it all, the Latter Rain doctrine first failed and then succeeded in infiltrating the Church by way of the charismatic influence in all the churches. COR brought to the Church the idea of setting up the Kingdom of God before Jesus&#39; return, and the Latter Rain brought the experience of that Kingdom&#39;s establishment by a perfected Church reigning as Christ on earth. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Penetration Of The Latter Rain Doctrine</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Latter Rain doctrine first rose up in the late forties, but was eventually thrown out of the Assemblies of God as heretical. I believe that two factors opened the door for it to make its way back into the organized churches: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. The first major factor was the breakdown of doctrine among the charismatics in the denominations in the mid-60s through interdenominational prayer meetings. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. The second major factor was the Kansas City conference in 1977. That was when the three streams of pentecostalism - the neo-pentecostals, the classical pentecostals and the Catholic pentecostals - united into a powerful force. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This conference was held because of a directive to unite Christianity supposedly received from the Lord during a 1974 Catholic charismatic gathering. With these streams representing one charismatic movement within all the denominations, and through the breakdown of doctrine, the Church became more experience-based than Biblically-based. I believe this situation opened the door for the Latter Rain doctrine to enter again. I&#39;ve found an unbelievable quote from New Age Theosophist and channeler Alice Bailey that perfectly describes our situation of being more experience-based than Biblically-based. Because of her words, I want to make three definite statements which I believe are true. The first statement is this: those taking part in this move are walking in the New Age agenda. The second statement is this: the only working of God within this move is to get people out of it. The third statement is this: Alice Bailey knew EXACTLY what was going to happen in the Church because her New Age spirits are in charge of this thing. She said this, and I believe every word is true: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;What the orthodox theologian and the narrow doctrinaire have to offer no longer satisfies the intelligent seeker or suffices to answer his questions. He is shifting his allegiances into wider and more spiritual areas. He is moving OUT FROM UNDER doctrinal authority AND TO direct personal, spiritual experience AND COMING UNDER the direct authority which contact with Christ and His disciples, the masters, gives&quot; (Externalization Of The Hierarchy).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Isn&#39;t it amazing that Bailey knew exactly what would happen in the Church, and the modern Church doesn&#39;t recognize it? Those people in this &quot;move of God&quot; have moved OUT FROM UNDER doctrinal authority and INTO direct, personal, spiritual experiences that are hard to confirm in the Scriptures as being from God. Look at these words from Rick Joyner in a 1995 editorial in his Morning Star Journal: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Already it has been one of the most extraordinary years I can remember. Things are now happening so fast that by the time you get this letter two months from now, I am wondering how obsolete it will be. I believe I have had more and greater SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES in the these four months than I have during the WHOLE PREVIOUS 25 years of my Christian life. JUST ABOUT EVERYONE I&#39;m close to seems to BE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT, AND EVEN SPECTACULAR, SPIRITUAL ADVANCES. THE ARMY OF GOD IS mobilizing all over the world, and in some places has already begun to march.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The result of the current compromise of God&#39;s word for the sake of personal experience is that thousands upon thousands ARE coming into direct contact with the New Age Christ AND HIS AGENDA!!!!! That will become more clear later in this series. Doctrinal compromise has let in a flood of &quot;new&quot; revelations. These &quot;new revelations&quot; are placing before us a &quot;new&quot; hope as the Church heads toward the end of the age. Scripture says we have only one hope, and we have held to it for 2,000 years: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Ephesians 4:4 &quot;There is one body and one Spirit - just as ye are called in one hope of your calling.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Titus 2:13 &quot;Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our saviour Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">But the more we hear of this &quot;new move of God,&quot; the less we hear of Israel, the tribulation, the reign of antichrist, the return of Christ Jesus as our hope, His second advent to judge the nations, and the rapture of the Church. Loving the promise of His coming is suffering greatly in our day. In a previous article, I mentioned doctrinal &quot;corrections&quot; that COR made, such as </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. WE NEED NOT WAIT for the King&#39;s second coming to get the kingdom started here on earth. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. The words in the Lord&#39;s Prayer stating &quot;Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven&quot; were meant to be prayed with THE HOPE that this condition would happen on earth BEFORE CHRIST&#39;S SECOND COMING whenever the Christians of any geography decided to band together to help make it happen. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">These &quot;corrections&quot; have greatly weakened our hope in Christ alone. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Alan Vincent of the UK said that every city must be shaken by God, and that, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;God HAS to keep His word. It has to happen. Why should God keep saying again and again, &#39;This is what I&#39;m going to do through the seed,&#39; and then Jesus coming in the sudden rapture theory, and spoiling God&#39;s covenant promises to Abraham? IT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE for Jesus to come until these things are fulfilled.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">But Jesus&#39; present ministry as the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit and His second coming IS the fulfilling of God&#39;s promises to Abraham. In Vincent&#39;s eyes, Jesus&#39; rapturing the Church is A THEORY. He has made OUR ONE HOPE OF Jesus&#39; return A THEORY. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">During his January 2, 1995 700 Club program, Pat Robertson was asked: &quot;Explain about the rapture and when it will take place.&quot; He replied, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Well, I think the rapture is going to take place when Jesus Christ comes back again, and He&#39;s going to come back again at the end of some kind of a tribulation or whatever. But, this could be a very short thing. It&#39;s not necessarily going to be a, could be a seven year kind of, you know, unwinding and a confusion in the world. But when it finally hits, it&#39;s going to be dreadful, but right now let&#39;s get the harvest in.&quot;(700 Club,January 2, 1995)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Robertson said the tribulation was &quot;SOME KIND OF a . . . WHATEVER&quot; of unsure duration! A &quot;KIND OF . . . unwinding and a confusion in the world&quot;! It COULD BE a short thing! The one thing that Robertson is sure of is that there will be &quot;a great harvest of souls&quot; for five years, AND THEN God will cleanse the earth of evil, &quot;a judgment on the ungodly who broke His covenant and refuse to follow His ways.&quot; THEN JESUS RETURNS. WHY WOULD HE RETURN!? THERE WOULDN&#39;T BE ANYTHING LEFT TO JUDGE! If all the evil is cleansed from the earth, how can there be a tribulation? Robertson gave his &quot;Biblical Model&quot; on this program in this order: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. A worldwide Revival </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. A great outpouring of God&#39;s Spirit </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. A billion-soul Harvest </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. God&#39;s judgement on the ungodly who would not walk in his ways and who broke His covenant </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">5. THEN some vague, unclarified tribulation described as an unwinding and confusion </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">6. THEN Jesus comes to rapture the Church </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Robertson knows what&#39;s happening globally. Where is the time of Jacob&#39;s trouble in his scenario? How did he become so seemingly ignorant all of a sudden? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Tricia Tillin writes, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Derek Prince gives a brief outline of the events of the Last Days, as he understands it; this follows a familiar pattern, to be found in most restoration writings: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;1. A Latter Rain Revival leading to a vast end-times harvest in which countless millions will be saved; </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;2. Parallel with this, a severe judgement from God on those who resist the revival; and </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;3. as a result of these events, the kingdom will be brought forth on earth - THEN consummated by the personal return of Jesus Christ.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Earl Paulk writes: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;In Matthew 24:14, Jesus clearly says that HE CANNOT RETURN for His Bride UNTIL she has demonstrated the Gospel of the Kingdom to all the nations of the earth. . . . . I can say with the authority of God that CHRIST CANNOT AND WILL NOT COME BACK UNTIL we have demonstrated the Gospel of the Kingdom to the nations of the earth.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In a discussion on the Good Life Program as to whether this is a time of revival or judgment on America, Rodney-Howard Browne ignored the tribulation and predicted great things for America. He said: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But between now and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, WHATEVER THAT IS, I believe, the greatest outpouring of the Spirit of God.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">But Scripture says between now and Jesus&#39; coming is a great tribulation. &quot;The second coming. . .WHATEVER THAT IS?&quot; Doesn&#39;t Browne know? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Francis Frangipane says, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Even now, hell trembles and the heavens watch in awe, for I say to you, once again, the virgin is with child. BEFORE JESUS HIMSELF RETURNS, the last virgin Church shall become pregnant with the promise of God. Out of her travail, the Body of Christ shall come forth, raised to the full stature of its Head, the Lord Jesus. Corporately manifested in holiness, power and love, the Bride of Christ shall arise.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">What is happening to the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ? What&#39;s happened to these men? What&#39;s happening to their followers? And what is happening to our one hope? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Next I want to look at Paul Cain And The second coming. On a Grace Ministries tape, November 1988 called, &quot;My Father&#39;s House,&quot; Paul Cain said he knew why God had poured out His Spirit on all the denominations, and explained what must happen BEFORE the Lord returns to rapture the Church: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;So now we have thousands and even millions of charismatics. . . . Why did God pour out his Spirit on all these charismatics, and all these Catholics and priests and nuns and Episcopals and the Methodists and Baptists? WHY DID HE DO THAT?&quot; [Then he says] &quot;I don&#39;t know what the second coming is to you, . . . but let me tell you he&#39;s coming to YOU, he&#39;s coming TO his Church, he&#39;s coming to abide IN you, to take up his abode IN you.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">[And again he says,] &quot;I want you to know he&#39;s coming TO the Church BEFORE he comes FOR the Church. He&#39;s gonna perfect the Church so the Church can be the Image, BE HIM, and be his representation.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In this talk, Cain defended himself against the charge that he was denying the rapture, but then spoke of Jesus coming again to indwell His Church AS A CORPORATE BODY, with the whole body experiencing Him at the same time. That&#39;s Latter Rain doctrine. Pentecost, to Latter Rain adherents, is a coming of God to the individual - it&#39;s a personal experience. And to them, the Feast of Tabernacles is celebrated when God comes TO the entire Church and fills it with the manifest glory of God. Cain told his audience, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;We are not just looking for glory in God, we want God to be glorified in us. Oh, let God be glorified in us, let this be your intent. Everybody in this room tonight that has the intent to follow through and act accordingly, the Lord says I will truly visit you, and I will make this real to you. The Lord will commit himself to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Then Cain tells us how to follow through and act accordingly so this glory will be MADE REAL to the Church BEFORE Christ returns: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Just dump all that stuff, just dump all that carnal knowledge, and dump some of the stuff we have learned through the years.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Is he saying dump your doctrine and your hope and go for this unbiblical experience? He doesn&#39;t deny the rapture, but moves the experience of the glorification of the Church to BEFORE Christ returns: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;This is the last of the last days. God will pour out his spirit on all flesh. That&#39;s Baptist flesh, Episcopal flesh, Catholic flesh, all kinds of flesh. Even the Pentecostals might get a second blessing.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">But Cain says God is uniting the denominations in order to manifest His glory in it in a visible way BEFORE the return of Christ. THIS is the &quot;second coming&quot; that is rising in the Church and eating away at it because of the Latter Rain influence! Cain said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Let&#39;s do everything according to the Pattern. . . . When this is done, God&#39;s glory appears, God&#39;s anointing appears, God&#39;s authority appears. It wasn&#39;t until Moses had accomplished all these things in that wilderness Tabernacle, and we are in that mystical Tabernacle now, we&#39;re in that stage, that the Glory appeared. . . . You can look . . . for the Glory of God to appear just as soon as our lives and everything are in order.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">If you&#39;ve received &quot;the anointing&quot; in any form, this is what awaits you around the bend. Tricia Tillin said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Glory, in the Latter Rain understanding, is the visible manifestation of the Spirit. Now, in light of the satanic nature of this deception, it is not surprising that deceived Christians are being led to EXPECT A MANIFESTED SPIRIT and not the visible return of the Lord Jesus. I believe the way we are headed is into teaching about the return of the &quot;Lord&quot; to his church, in glory, BEFORE (or perhaps even instead of?) the physical return of Jesus.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Now, please remember that this doctrine, once declared a heresy, has found a place in all the denominations through the charismatic faction in all the churches. Cain says that out of this unity will come an army, Joel&#39;s Army, based on Joel 2: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I told you about . . . this recurring [35 year-old] vision I had. . . . The angel of the Lord said, &#39;You&#39;re standing at the crossroads of life. What do you see?&#39; And I saw a brilliantly lit billboard which reads, &#39;Joel&#39;s Army now in training.&#39; . . . .I believe one day soon Joel&#39;s Army will be in training . . . until it graduates into the stadium . . . . But a right understanding of the plan of God for this generation brings this tremendous inclusion. . . . God&#39;s offering to you, this present generation, a greater privilege than was ever offered any generation at any time from Adam clear down through the millennium.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Paul Cain said this plan of God is for THIS GENERATION - EVERYBODY - ALL DENOMINATIONS - because it is THE plan of God for the &quot;last of the last days.&quot; On a Grace Ministries tape of a talk given by Cain some years ago in Missouri, He told his audience, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I had a vision of you people coming from . . . a circle of maybe a hundred miles and I saw people coming from every major city within that circumference and a great conclave was taking place, and it was the training of Joel&#39;s Army. . . . I believe that people are going to come together by the thousands and train for the Army of the Lord. Wouldn&#39;t that be wonderful? I mean, that&#39;s long overdue.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">When enough pastors and other leaders are trained for the Army of the Lord&quot;, he expects the greatest revival of all time to result. During his talk in Missouri, Cain described his vision for this endtime revival: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;All of the stadiums and all of the ballparks are filled with hundreds of thousands of people. They have hearses lined up, ambulances lined up. They have hundreds of stretcher cases and all that. And there are men standing there in the pulpit, there are women standing there that haven&#39;t had a change of raiment in three days, they haven&#39;t had a drink of water, they haven&#39;t had any food and they&#39;re preaching under the mighty power. &#39;Why, did you see that last night on ABC? Did you see that man levitated? Did you see all those preachers levitated? Did you see that fixed pose? They stood there for 24 hours in a fixed pose, worshiping and praising God, and hundreds of thousands came by and fell on their face and nobody pushed them. And nobody shoved them. They fell under the power of God.&#39; And everybody everywhere is crying, &#39;Oh, this is God! Jesus is Lord!&#39; It seems like the whole world is turning to God.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Recently, Cain spoke at Christ Chapel in Florence, Alabama and again shared the dream he&#39;d received when he was 19 years old. Again, the emphasis was on huge numbers of people in stadiums: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I had a dream that became a recurring dream, and it was about all the stadiums - and we&#39;ve told this hundreds and hundreds of time all across America, all over the world, in fact - and I saw these stadiums and football fields, soccer fields and sports arenas, all of them filled with thousands of people, sometimes over 100,000 in each place&quot; (August 30, 1995, evening session).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Earlier I quoted Cain as saying, &quot;I believe one day soon Joel&#39;s Army will be in training . . . until it graduates into the stadium.&quot; But now, in the Alabama meeting, Cain connected his prediction of stadiums-full of soldiers in his Army of the Lord with the reality of stadiums-full of warriors in the Promise Keepers army. He said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;We call it &#39;the last days ministry,&#39; . . . . I believe we&#39;re ON THE THRESHOLD OF IT. . . . And I know the Lord is coming TO His Church and he&#39;s going to prepare us. . . We&#39;re closer to it than we&#39;ve ever been before. Who would think that there would be A GROUP LIKE PROMISE KEEPERS WHO&#39;D ALREADY BE SETTING THE STAGE AND FILLING STADIUMS with tens of thousands of people, . . . They&#39;ll be over 100,000 in no time, and maybe they already are. I think an event&#39;s already planned that way. So, what if God shows up at just one of those meetings? That could just be the kick-off for &#39;last days ministry.&#39; Think about that. . . . What if 120,000 get together and then the fire comes from heaven and the glory of God. . . .&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Cain was probably referring to the 70 to 100,000 pastors expected at the February 1996 Promise Keepers&#39; meeting in Atlanta, but what if his words came true concerning the PK goal of filling a stadium in each of the fifty states in the year 2000? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In a Promise Keepers gathering in the Detroit Silver Dome stadium in April 1995, founder Bill McCartney, like Cain, spoke of a great army: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;We have a great army that we are assembling. They&#39;re the Christian men of this nation. However, our leadership, our clergy are not uniform. Our clergy are divided. . . . There&#39;s no unity of command. . . . there is tremendous division in our clergy. We have to assume that responsibility. We have to say, &#39;Are we impacting our clergy in a way that&#39;s going to take them and make them all that they have to be in order to lead this army?&#39; Because the shepherds are the ones God&#39;s chosen to lead us out of here&quot; (Promise Keepers Meeting, April 29, 1995, Detroit Silver Dome). </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">[McCartney later continued,] &quot;This gathering in Atlanta should exceed 100,000 clergymen. Why? Because we have many more than that, and every single one of them ought to be there. We can&#39;t have anybody pass up that meeting. If a guy says that he doesn&#39;t want to go, he needs to be able to tell us why he doesn&#39;t want to go. &#39;Why wouldn&#39;t you want to be a part of what God wants to do with His hand-picked leaders?&#39; . . . I think Almighty God is going to rip open the hearts of our leaders. I think He&#39;s going to tear them open. And I think he&#39;s going to put them back together again as one. One leadership. We&#39;ve got to have one leadership, one leadership only. We&#39;ve got to have everybody hitting on all cylinders. There&#39;s only one race. It&#39;s the human race. There&#39;s only one culture. Its Christ before culture. Christ culture - that&#39;s all that there is.&quot; (Promise Keepers Meeting, April 29, 1995, Detroit Silver Dome).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Cain said we are on the THRESHOLD of God&#39;s glory possibly coming upon 100,000 pastors who want to be Promise Keepers. If we read this in conjunction with Francis Frangipane&#39;s new book, &quot;The Days of His Presence,&quot; our concern should increase all the more. In a write-up on the book, Frangipane himself says, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Spirit of the Lord is moving on so many fronts. In just the past ten months we have seen racial reconciliations take place among Southern Baptists in Atlanta; in Memphis, leaders from Pentecostal denominations, once divided along racial lines, are now reunited, while white Evangelical leaders repented with blacks in Chicago. We can truly say the Lord is moving mightily on his people. Mix in the March for Jesus and the 750,000 Promise Keepers, and we are seeing the stage set for what I believe will be the greatest awakening of this century.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Nothing scarey there - Reconciliation - that&#39;s not a scarey thing. What must be pondered is where will they end up? March for Jesus (MFJ) drew 20,000,000 people this year. Promise Keepers is currently drawing 750,000 men. That adds up to 20,750,000 Christians, and Frangipane is saying that these 20,650,000 people are setting the stage for something because of reconciliation between races and between Christians ministers. Frangipane&#39;s description of this next great awakening in his book is quite similar to Paul Cain&#39;s: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;This book chronicles the vision the Lord gave me in 1971. . . . The Holy Spirit REVEALED THE BAPTISM OF GLORY that the Father has prepared for the end of the age.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In an ad for his book, Frangipane writes, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;PRIOR TO Jesus Christ&#39;s physical return, His living presence will companion the church in ever-increasing power. During this time the visible glory of the Lord will rise and appear upon God&#39;s people.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Notice this: God&#39;s visible glory will rise and appear on His people PRIOR to Jesus&#39; return. THAT&#39;S NEW REVELATION! It&#39;s Progressive Theology, it&#39;s Latter Rain teaching, and Frangipane says 20,750,000 members of Christ&#39;s body are being prepared to have the VISIBLE GLORY OF GOD COME ON THEM! This prophetic word says that the Church being glorified and changed to be like Christ Jesus our Lord IS NOT when we see Him face to face, but when we reconcile our differences. Paul Cain said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;You can look . . . for the Glory of God to appear just as soon as our lives and everything are in order.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">What does it take to &quot;get our lives and everything in order&quot;? Look at these two quotes. In the Fall 1993 Promise Keepers magazine, &quot;Men of Action,&quot; we read, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;We believe that we have a God-given mission to unite men who are separated by RACE, geography, culture, DENOMINATION and economics. We are dedicated, then, to addressing the division that has separated the Body of Christ for too long.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Frangipane says we are more than on the verge of this manifestation of glory: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Lord revealed to me He would first unite His church [which both PK and MFJ are dedicated to], reconcile the racial issues in Him [which both PK and MFJ are dedicated to], AND THEN FILL THE CHURCH WITH GLORY! The first two phases of this restoration are well under way! The last phase, the preparation for glory, is at hand. Indeed, in several places manifestations of God&#39;s glory are already occurring.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This revelation states that the first two phases of this restoration ARE underway - IN PROMISE KEEPERS and in the MARCH FOR JESUS. Promise Keepers and March for Jesus are ripe for a visitation by the Latter Rain spirit. Cain said so and so did Frangipane. What makes this dangerous is this: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. Doctrinal differences are being set aside in order to tear down denominational walls for the sake of demonstrating what is being called biblical unity. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. That is the door through which Latter Rain manifestations enter! </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">What these visions depict is the coming forth of a glorified, invincible, unbiblical army of the Manifest Sons of God of the Latter Rain through Promise Keepers and March For Jesus. Having given this example of how the Latter Rain doctrine is penetrating a uniting Church, let&#39;s now move on to the year 2000 to see more aspects of the Latter Rain doctrine and how they are compatible with other philosophies. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Foundations%20for%20Apostasy%20article%20(1)_files/image6.jpg" width="798" height="8" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><h1 class="cs35586">

Some leaders, however, are promising an escalation into world revival, but are cagey about how the transition will take place. Others hint at &#39;something being birthed in the Church&#39; and &#39;God is raising up an Army.&#39; The truth is, the present events and the way they are being handled by leaders point unerringly in the direction of the Latter Rain teaching&quot;(1)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The hints at &quot;something being birthed in the Church&quot; have come from NEW, PROGRESSIVE REVELATIONS built on the Latter Rain foundation. Replacement Theology is the Latter Rain practice of replacing Israel with the Church as the object of Scriptural prophecy, and out of this practice have come the new revelations. One example of Replacement Theology is this prophetic word given at Toronto Airport Vineyard in 1992. In it, Mark Dupont equates Toronto with Jerusalem and the new anointing to a New Pentecost: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Like Jerusalem, Toronto will end up being a sending-out place. It is of God that there are so many internationals in this area. The Lord is going to be sending out many people, filled with His Spirit with strong gifting, vision, and love to the nations on all continents.&quot;(2)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This is one example of Replacement Theology, but let&#39;s look at others in relation to the birth of a child within the Toronto movement. The first thing I want to establish is that a corporate child is being birthed into the Church. In 1994, a MAJOR OLD TESTAMENT PROPHETIC TYPE OF CHRIST was repeatedly presented as a new promise of the coming of a spiritual messiah. The first prophecy we&#39;ll look at is John Wimber&#39;s, in which God told him to go to the nations in what would be A SEASON OF NEW BEGINNINGS. He believes God said, &quot;I&#39;m going to start it all over again. I&#39;m going to pour out my Spirit in your midst like I did in the beginning.&quot; Wimber writes, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I heard myself say: Shall I have this pleasure in my old age? The very words that Sarah laughingly said to herself when she overheard the Lord say she was going to have a son from her 90-year-old womb by her 100-year-old husband (Gen. 18:10). This was a word of life from the Lord, and it touched me deeply.&quot;(3)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">We now want to look at some like-references that show a definite progression, similar to the progressive conception and birth of a child. The first is a PROPHECY PROMISING IMPREGNATION, delivered by Morris Cerullo in a promotional letter for his 1994 London School of Ministry: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . . God has revealed to me revelations . . . of His Spirit, of His endtime, so sacred . . . . You never heard this word preached anywhere. It is Hot, it is sacred, it is Deep! . . . Come away to this place where I poured out My Holy Spirit . . . . I will make you pregnant with My reality. . . The Holy Spirit is the part of God that will manifest the pregnancy in your being. Something great is about to happen to you.&quot;(4)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Cerullo said God instructed him to teach that He &quot;will MAKE YOU PREGNANT with [HIS] REALITY. . . .&quot; through &quot;sacred . . . revelations . . . never heard preached anywhere.&quot;(5) But the Church already has the Spirit indwelling it forever. We don&#39;t need God to impregnate us with His reality. And the simple gospel was once delivered to the saints; we don&#39;t need any new revelations that are Hot, Sacred and Deep, revelations that we never heard before. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The next is a PROPHECY OF THE IMPREGNATION given to Glenn Foster in a night vision in January 1994. In an interview with Pat Robertson, Judson Cornwall said Foster saw them both in a PREGNANT condition. He said that during this night vision, the Lord revealed: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I am now impregnating some of my mature, older ministers with truth. . . . I&#39;m choosing my older men because I can trust them to carry that truth to full gestation and have the patience to raise it up once it is delivered. . . . I will bring forth truth that is not now being taught and you will be part of it.&quot;(6)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This is a significant statement. The Church is being IMPREGNATED with TRUTH NOT NOW TAUGHT that will eventually manifest &quot;something&quot; in this world when it is raised up!(7) God does not impregnate us with NEW TRUTH to manifest &quot;something.&quot; He speaks to us through His word in its proper context. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The next word is a PROPHECY OF FULL GESTATION given by Marilyn Hickey&#39;s husband, Wallace, at a Rodney Howard-Browne meeting aired on TBN in MAY 1994. This rhyming prophecy says that the &quot;child&quot; is growing in the Church: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Spirit in this very hour says, Don&#39;t think you&#39;ve seen it all as you go in the Holy Ghost way. God is new and He&#39;s a growing person as anything that is alive. So you don&#39;t have to work it up or try in your flesh to strive. Just let God be God in you as a child, as a child be. God would will that the whole of everyone in eternity would be like He is, never old, ever young, growing, a growing thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This has to raise some questions. Is the God of Scripture a GROWING THING in us AS A CHILD? NO. Is God a GROWING PERSON as ANYTHING that is alive? NO. Hickey was not prophesying about the God of the Bible. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The next progressive prophecy is the PROPHECY OF THE BIRTH from a brochure entitled, &quot;The Great Intruder,&quot; advertising the 1994 Passion &amp; Fire Conferences held by Jill Austin of Master Potter Ministries: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Prophetically, the child Isaac, which means &#39;Laughter,&#39; is being released in nation after nation as the new wine is being passed.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This prophecy contradicts Hebrews 1:1-2, which tells us, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Christ Jesus our Lord, who fulfilled the type of Isaac by His coming into the world, means &quot;Emmanuel, God with us.&quot; This movement&#39;s child is &quot;Isaac, meaning Laughter,&quot; and &quot;he&quot; is being released into the world as new wine, bringing joy and laughter to the nations. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The last &quot;word of the Lord&quot; we want to look at is a PROPHECY OF THE CORPORATE SON in The Endtime Handmaidens newsletter of October 1994. This revelation shows us that &quot;Sarah&#39;s Child, Isaac,&quot; is a corporate man: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Sarah is a type of the Church. The Church is &#39;withered,&#39; and its womb is dried up in many places, but God is sending a revival of joy to awaken and renew the Church so that she can bring forth the &#39;man-child&#39; of joy, even the army of overcomers who will go forth in the likeness and image of the Lord in these last days.&quot;(8)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Take note of this: the STATED PURPOSE of the laughing revival IS TO BRING FORTH THE &quot;MAN-CHILD&quot; OF JOY THAT WILL SUBDUE THE EARTH. National ministry leaders have now said God would impregnate, has impregnated, has brought that impregnation to full gestation, and has released &quot;the child&quot; into all the nations. But there is NO MENTION in Scripture of such a prophetic utterance after the appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ. Nor does Scripture speak of a release of ANY OTHER SPIRIT but the Holy Spirit, sent ONCE AND FOR ALL at Pentecost to announce the glorification of Christ at the right hand of God and to permanently indwell all believers. This new move is founded on PROGRESSIVE REVELATION, &quot;truths&quot; never heard nor seen before, a typical mark of the Latter Rain Movement. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 2: IN LATTER RAIN, THE FORMATION OF A CORPORATE BODY WILL BE THE SUPPOSED FULFILLMENT OF THE ABRAHAMIC COVENANT </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">We&#39;re all familiar with what Paul wrote in his letters to the Romans and Galatians about what was promised to Abraham - Let&#39;s recap it: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. God spoke promises to Abraham and to his one seed, who is Christ (Gal. 3:16). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. What God promised through Christ was the gospel and the Holy Spirit, which would be offered to all nations (Gal. 3:2). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. Christ is the one who blesses the nations by giving the Holy Spirit to all INDIVIDUALS who believe through the preaching of the PERSONAL gospel (Gal. 3:2). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. This was fulfilled at Pentecost and is ongoing (Acts 2:33). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">5. Those who do not believe in Him are excluded from the blessing and will not inherit the nations when Christ returns. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">But in Latter Rain teaching, the Corporate Seed will supposedly fulfill the Abrahamic Covenant. For example, Latter Rainist Alan Vincent teaches that every city and family on earth is to receive this blessing through the Church&#39;s celebration of Tabernacles. In a taped talk entitled &quot;God&#39;s &#39;Suddenlys,&quot; Vincent&#39;s new revelation brings together Isaac with the Abrahamic covenant and the feasts of Israel. Vincent said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;[God&#39;s] had this on His agenda for millennium, and now you&#39;re privileged to see the fulfillment of all of that the prophets have said. That was true, of course, for the nation of Israel, it was true for the city of Jerusalem, now it&#39;s becoming true for every single city on the face of the earth because God promised through Abraham, He said, &#39;I will, through your seed, WHICH IS THE CHURCH, every family on the face of the earth is going to be blessed.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">And again Vincent said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;God, you promised Abraham, seven full times you repeated it, you swore it by an oath, every time you talked about a covenant, you said &#39;this is the heart of the thing.&#39; And soon as the Spirit comes and starts to shake the city of Jerusalem, Peter says, &#39;Oh, this is what the prophets have talked about!&#39; This is just one city experiencing what every city must experience. Otherwise, God&#39;s the biggest liar there ever was, and of course, that&#39;s impossible. I&#39;m saying that quite shockingly. Beloved, God HAS to keep His word. It has to happen. Why should God keep saying again and again, &#39;This is what I&#39;m going to do through the seed,&#39; and then Jesus coming in the sudden rapture theory, and spoiling God&#39;s covenant promises to Abraham? It&#39;s impossible for Jesus to come until these things are fulfilled.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Vincent then said that God will bless every city on earth and thus fulfill His covenant promise to Abraham. How? BY MOVING THE SEED OF ABRAHAM INTO THE CELEBRATION OF TABERNACLES: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But I tell you what God said to me was, He said, &#39;Alan, I am moving the Church from the Day of Atonement to Tabernacles.&#39; . . . As if the devil could stop him fulfilling His covenant to Abraham. As if the devil could even stop Him from using the Church. . . . [God supposedly told Vincent,] &#39;The Day of Atonement is over and Tabernacles is coming, and I&#39;m getting ready to laugh and I&#39;m getting ready to roar, and I tell you this whole world is going to feel the shaking of that laughter and the power of that roar.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Before we look at the Feast of Tabernacles, I want to summarize what the Latter Rain prophets said up to this point: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. God said there would be a season of New Beginnings; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. these New Beginnings are based on and proliferated by New Revelations; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. the New Revelations are bringing forth a corporate child who is supposedly Abraham&#39;s seed, and through whom every city on the face of the earth will be blessed; and </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. that blessing will be fulfilled through the celebration of a type of Tabernacles in a time of revival, harvest and unity. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 3: THE CELEBRATION OF TABERNACLES IS VITAL TO THE AGENDA OF THE CORPORATE CHILD </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The celebration of the true Feast of Tabernacles is described in Zechariah 14, which places it in its proper time frame - Tabernacles will be celebrated after Jesus returns. This is the HOPE OF THE GOSPEL - Christ&#39;s return - and the current celebrations of Tabernacles have nothing to do with the Church as A NEW ISRAEL in this age. The one verse always tied to this &quot;revival&quot; is &quot;this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then the end shall come&quot; (Matthew 24:14). But what gospel? And what does it do to our hope of Christ&#39;s return leading to the true celebration of Tabernacles in the Millennial kingdom? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In an article in the </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Morning Star Journal,</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> Robin McMillan and Steve Thompson assert that the gospel was foreshadowed in three Old Testament feasts of Israel, based on Exodus 23:15-16: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. The first feast is PASSOVER, and Christ our Passover has been slain; for the saved, Passover has been celebrated. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. The second feast is PENTECOST, which is the descent of the Holy Spirit upon those who believe. But according to McMillan and Thompson, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;PENTECOST IS NOT THE COMPLETE HARVEST. . . . IT IS NOT ENOUGH.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. The third feast is TABERNACLES, of which McMillan and Thompson say, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;There is another realm of spiritual experience typified in scripture by the Feast of Tabernacles. Until we understand and partake of this feast, as we have both Passover and Pentecost, WE WILL NEVER FULFILL OUR DESTINY AND CALLING. We must discover the meaning of the Feast of Tabernacles and &#39;celebrate&#39; it along with Passover and Pentecost. . . . </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;What God did among Jews in Jerusalem, He is going to do among humanity and worldwide. PENTECOST WILL COME TO MATURITY IN THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES.&quot;(9)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">What McMillan and Thompson have done here is to come out from under the authority of Scripture and point to an unbiblical &quot;spiritual experience.&quot; New Age Theosophist Alice Bailey correctly predicted the consequences of trading biblical truth for experience: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;What the orthodox theologian and the narrow doctrinaire have to offer no longer satisfies the intelligent seeker or suffices to answer his questions. He is shifting his allegiances into wider and more spiritual areas. He is moving OUT FROM UNDER doctrinal authority AND TO direct personal, spiritual experience AND COMING UNDER the direct authority which contact with Christ and His disciples, the masters, gives.&quot;(10)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">One last point we must understand is how these writers view Pentecost and Tabernacles. The Latter Rain says that Pentecost is the experience of God at a personal level, which is true. But then they move on to Tabernacles, and say that this Feast is the experience of God by all members of the body at the same time BEFORE CHRIST&#39;S RETURN. But there is no such event foretold in Scripture, especially in the way McMillan and Thompson describe. They write, &quot;There is another realm of spiritual experience typified in scripture by the Feast of Tabernacles.&quot; Notice this: they are not even speaking of Tabernacles, but of &quot;another realm of spiritual experience&quot; that is &quot;TYPIFIED BY the Feast of Tabernacles.&quot; When they speak of Tabernacles, they are really talking about the corporate body sharing &quot;an experience&quot; from &quot;another realm.&quot; That experience is &quot;Christ&quot; coming TO His Church BEFORE He comes FOR His Church. That&#39;s Latter Rain. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 4: THERE ARE THREE ASPECTS OF THE LATTER RAIN&#39;S FEAST OF TABERNACLES THAT SHOW THE CHILD IS ENTERING THE FEAST </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Joy and gladness are part of the celebration of Tabernacles, and through the Laughing Phenomena, we&#39;ve certainly seen plenty of what&#39;s passing for joy. But there are three other aspects of this Feast that we need to note, because they will tie other aspects of this &quot;move&quot; together. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">REVIVAL - This is the Latter Rain&#39;s first aspect of Tabernacles. By &quot;revival&quot;, we&#39;re referring to restoration through signs and wonders, which is how Rodney Howard-Browne defined it. McMillan and Thompson wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The restoration of that which the years have stripped away from God&#39;s people wlll come as a result of the overflowing of new wine and oil! Many people who are experiencing the new wine and oil in this recent outpouring are also experiencing a restoration in their lives! Some have wept deeply as the oil of the Lord has been applied to their wounds. The Lord is accomplishing in minutes or hours that which counseling and psychological approaches have not accomplished in years, as He fills them to overflowing with the Holy Ghost.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">HARVEST - This is the second aspect of Tabernacles. In their article, McMillan and Thompson envision the joy of this great harvest associated with Tabernacles: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The manifestations of joy and spiritual drunkeness . . . . are a witness that He is bringing restoration and hope to people for the LARGEST HARVEST OF SOULS that has ever occurred - the Feast of Ingathering or the Feast of Tabernacles.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">McMillan and Thompson state that Tabernacles is THE KEY to what is happening in the Church: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . our participation in a spiritual celebration of the feast of Tabernacles is the key to God releasing fullness and maturity in the church. It is a feast of joy and release, bringing restoration. It is also a feast of humility, unity and ultimately, the ingathering of many lost people. It is the celebration of the harvest.&quot;(11)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">UNITY - This is the third aspect of Tabernacles. On page 57 of his book, &quot;Weighed and Found Wanting . . . Putting the Toronto Blessing in Context,&quot; Pastor Bill Randles says, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;In 1951, [George Warnock] wrote his book, The Feast of Tabernacles, in which he laid out a specific doctrine for the Latter Rain Movement. He taught that the Church was about to usher in the completion of God&#39;s feasts through perfection of the saints and their dominion over the earth. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Essentially, this Latter Rain teaching implies that the three great annual feasts of the Lord in Israel&#39;s worship (Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles) typify the whole Church Age, beginning with the death of Jesus on the cross, and consummating in &#39;the manifestations of the Sons of God&#39; - the &#39;overcomers&#39; who will become perfected and step into immortality in order to establish the Kingdom of God on earth. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;According to Warnock, this will be accomplished through the restoration of the Church in unity . . .&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">McMillan and Thompson also associate the current drive for unity with the endtime Feast of Tabernacles. They write, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;This same humility enables us to walk in unity with our brothers as well. During the Feast of Tabernacles, all of Israel dwelt in booths, the rich and poor alike. As they left those things which defined their station in life and separated them into different classes, they celebrated the goodness of God in unity, without division.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In Latter Rain, unity is essential to the manifestation of the corporate man-child because God cannot incarnate in a divided body. Now let&#39;s summarize what we have said thus far: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. Revival will result in a unified Church, also called the corporate child; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. &quot;He&quot; is to fulfill the Abrahamic Covenant by going forth, taking the Toronto Blessing to the nations; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. This going forth as a corporate man will bring about the endtime harvest; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. All of this is accomplished through a spiritual experience that typifies the celebration of Tabernacles. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The next thing we&#39;ll look at is the true origin of the Latter Rain Feast of Tabernacles. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 5: THE TRUTH IS THAT THE LATTER RAIN FEAST OF TABERNACLES PARALLELS THE NEW AGE </span><span class="cs31B015EA">AGE OF AQUARIUS</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In her 1985 book, &quot;A Planned Deception: The Staging of a New Age &#39;Messiah&#39;&quot;, Christian writer Constance Cumbey writes about Rev. Ernest Ramsey, an enthusiastic follower of the Alice Bailey and Benjamin Creme teachings. She says that his major report was entitled &quot;An Evolutionary Basis For The Reappearance of the Christ and his Executives, the Masters of Wisdom.&quot; Cumbey writes, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;In his Research Report #2, he tells of something he was led to by a spirit guide - what he terms &#39;Neo-Pentecostalism.&#39; An aberrant branch of Pentecostalism, this is more commonly known as the &#39;Manifest Sons of God.&#39; . . . Ramsey concludes . . . that this is part of the New Age Movement.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Cumbey continues, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The most interesting section of Ramsey&#39;s report dealt with &#39;Neo-pentecostalism.&#39; Ramsey spent a semester at one of the Neo-Pentecostal or Manifest Sons of God seminaries . . . . Already familiar with the Alice Bailey writings, he was amazed to see that there was a branch of Pentecostalism that embraced the same teachings - albeit using sometimes different terminology. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Like those seeking the &#39;Age of Aquarius&#39; these people too were seeking a &#39;New Age.&#39; Like the other New Agers, these people taught that &#39;The Christ&#39; was an anointing - not necessarily one man. They taught that Jesus was a pattern son who was to be a sign of something even greater to come - the &#39;Manifestation of the Sons of God.&#39; They too believed the earth was to be cleansed of evil. And chillingly, like the other New Agers, they believed they were to be &#39;God&#39;s&#39; instruments to do such cleansing. The New Agers believed they were gods. The Manifest Sons of God likewise taught that if one accepted their &#39;new revelation&#39; that they themselves would actually become Christ at the time of the unveiling or manifestation of the Sons of God.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Cumbey continues her eye-opener with this revelation: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Ernest Ramsey excitedly pointed out in his report that [the Manifest Sons] had a teaching which indeed did parallel the Aquarian teaching of the Age of Aquarius - the Old Testament &#39;Year of Jubilee&#39; as well as the &#39;Feast of Tabernacles.&#39; The Year of Jubilee paralleled the redistribution of the world&#39;s wealth. The Feast of Tabernacles was the equivalent of the coming together of the world&#39;s peoples and varied religions under one tent or tabernacle - the equivalent of the New Agers&#39; long-awaited &#39;New World Religion.&#39; . . . .&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">We must not miss this point: the Replacement Theology of the Manifest Sons of the Latter Rain has brought the Age of Aquarius into the Church under the guise of the Feast of Tabernacles and the Year of Jubilee. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">___________ </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(1) Tricia Tillin, Banner Ministries, unpublished research paper, 1994.<br/>(2) Mantle of Praise Ministries, Inc.

She is a world-renowned futurist, speaker, social architect, and prophetic politican, who ran for the vice-presidency in the 1984 presidential election. She is a founder of the Foundation for Conscious Evolution, and is a leader for social and spiritual change. Hubbard is also the author of a host of New Age books, including &quot;The Revelation,&quot; which she channeled from &quot;The Christ.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard&#39;s doctrines are either identical with or similar to those of the Latter Rain. Both Latter Rain and New Age are evolutionary in nature. In Hubbard&#39;s version, man is born a god, and must evolve to a realization of the fact. The corporate body in her philosophy is called HOMO UNIVERSALIS. In the Latter Rain doctrine, man must first receive &quot;Christ&quot; and then mature to the point where he incarnates Him. The corporate body of these men is called the Manifest Sons of God, though they have also been known as Joel&#39;s Army and The Manchild Company. Both the Latter Rain and Hubbard expect their corporate man to be manifested at the end of the age. Here are more New Age-Latter Rain Comparisons, just a few of the many examples in my &quot;Laughing Phenomena&quot; booklet. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs54A12280">NEW REVELATION</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">We&#39;ve already seen the prevalence of new revelations in LATTER RAIN. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard&#39;s Christ: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The text of the New Order of the Future is the Story of Creation. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The first chapter is revealed in the religions of the world, especially the Judeo-Christian which foresaw the future most clearly.

The New Age Christ said there would be a season of New Beginnings, just as with John Wimber&#39;s revelation. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. These New Beginnings are based on and proliferated by New Revelations, just as in the Latter Rain. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. The New Revelations are bringing forth a corporate child who is Abraham&#39;s seed, through whom the earth will be transformed. This is also the same as Latter Rain. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. That transformation will be fulfilled through the celebration of a Planetary Pentecost in a time of revival, harvest and unity, and in Latter Rain teaching, that is the Feast of Tabernacles. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 7: THE CORPORATE MAN WILL EVENTUALLY ENTER THE TIME OF JUBILEE IN THE YEAR 2000. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THREE INFLUENTIAL MEN WHO SUPPORT A YEAR OF JUBILEE AND WHO, TOGETHER, HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO LEAD THE ENTIRE CHURCH OUT OF TABERNACLES AND INTO JUBILEE </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">PAT ROBERTSON AND JUBILEE </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In a 1987 report on Pat Robertson, Constance Cumbey wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Whether there is direct networking or not, it is a fact that the &#39;Year of Jubilee&#39; teachings do show up in Robertson&#39;s work in amazingly similar format to those used both by [Manifest Son teacher] Bill Britton and [the New Age] Synthesis Fellowship. On page 133 of his book in a discussion of what he calls &#39;The Law of Use&#39; Robertson says: &#39;Notwithstanding the sneers of many in the banking community, it may be that God&#39;s way will be the only one open to us - a year of jubilee to straighten out the mess.&#39;&quot;(24)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Cumbey also cited Pat Robertson&#39;s Perspective newsletter from January/February 1981: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . . In a section called &#39;A Radical Proposal to Halt Inflation&#39; Robertson called for an International Year of Jubilee. This was modeled, said Robertson, after the Biblical Year of Jubilee. . . . [which] canceled debts, freed slaves, &#39;and the means of production would be redistributed. . . . If inflation is to be broken, there must be a cancellation of debt - on a worldwide basis.&#39;&quot;(25)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Today, Pat Robertson is also offering conferences on Tabernacles. In the April 1995 Charisma magazine, CBN ran the following ad: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Gain a deeper understanding of Israel, the Church and the end times as the annual Jerusalem celebration &#39;Feast of Tabernacles&#39; comes to CBN Conferences. Featured speakers are Jan Willem van der Hoeven and Johann Luckhoff. July 13-16, 1995.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Judson Cornwall, the man who shared about his &quot;impregnation&quot; with Robertson on the 700 Club, was also a speaker at this conference. As for Johann Luckhoff, he&#39;s the Director of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem [ICEJ] and recently wrote the following in the ICEJ newsletter concerning the Church gathering in Jerusalem to celebrate Tabernacles: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . . The video of last year&#39;s Feast of Tabernacles is already taking the highlights of those celebrations to the ends of the earth.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Pat Robertson is a powerful influence towards Jubilee: he is looking for a major revival and billion-soul harvest, he applauded the laughing revival, he is promoting Tabernacles and he supports a Year of Jubilee. He is a powerful man who can lead part of the Church into Jubilee 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">JAY GARY AND JUBILEE </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Jay Gary is another very influential man, responsible for &quot;The Singapore Global Consultation On World Evangelism - 2000 &amp; Beyond.&quot; Following the Global Consultation, Gary became coordinator of the newly founded Global Service Office which promised to &quot;serve any group that had AD 2000 plans.&quot; He then started his own Celebration 2000 Project and is associated with many global evangelization efforts, three of which are New Life 2000 (Bill Bright&#39;s Campus Crusade For Christ), Evangelization 2000, (Fr. Tom Forrest) and AD2000 Together, (Vinson Synan). Needless to say, there are thousands upon thousands involved in global evangelism. Gary also networks with the March for Jesus organization which drew 20,000,000 marchers last year. Jay Gary sits in a very, very powerful position from which he can influence a large number of Christians across the globe toward the celebration of Jubilee. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In his book, &quot;The Star of 2000,&quot; Jay Gary links together the three great Jewish feasts with a call to the Church to &quot;experience Jesus&#39; Jubilee&quot;: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The annual calendar of Israel was built around three major festivals: Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles. These celebrations in Jerusalem were anything but boring. There was dancing, singing and exuberant celebration before the living God. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Year of Jubilee encompassed these three festivals, only raised to a higher power. The clear call of God across the millennia is that we are invited to come into His presence and feast on Him. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;On the last and greatest day of the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus &quot;stood and said in a loud voice, &#39;If anyone is thirsty, let him come and drink&#39; (John 7:37). Then, as well as today, Jesus calls us to experience His jubilee.&quot;(26)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Because Tabernacles is encompassed by every Jubilee year, the celebrations of the two become one. In fact, Gary says the three feasts, including Tabernacles, are &quot;raised to a higher power&quot; by Jubilee. In Eagle Nest Pastor Clarice Fluitt&#39;s praise of &quot;The Star of 2000,&quot; she declares, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;This is an incredibly prophetic book. Jay Gary has peered into the spirit realm and drawn from God&#39;s secret place. He declares that the church must prepare a celebration, a festival for, about and with Jesus, our honored guest and royal Bridegroom. The Star of 2000 is infused with a biblical revelation of fullness, sonship, maturity, and perfection of the glorious triumphant church - the Feast of Tabernacles.&quot;(27)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">According to Fluitt, Gary&#39;s revelation is a revealed secret &quot;drawn from God.&quot; But the revealed secret of Jay Gary is NEW REVELATION, and it&#39;s also Latter Rain doctrine. &quot;Fullness, sonship, maturity, and perfection of the glorious triumphant church&quot; is the terminology of the Latter Rain. Because of his position, Jay Gary has the awesome potential to shift many more in the Church from Tabernacles into a celebration of Jubilee. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POPE JOHN PAUL II AND JUBILEE </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The call for the Church to celebrate Tabernacles and the Year of Jubilee has slowly increased since the resurgence of the Latter Rain doctrine in the mid-80s. And now we find another religious leader, Pope John Paul II, making the same call through the release of a 72-page papal letter. The letter, entitled &quot;The Coming of the Third Millennium: Preparation for the Jubilee of the Year 2000,&quot; was released on November 10, 1994. In Article 23 of the new document, John Paul writes, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Since the publication of the very first document of my pontificate I have spoken explicitly of the Great Jubilee, suggesting that the time leading up to it be lived as &quot;a new Advent.&quot; This theme has since reappeared many times, and was dwelt upon at length in the encyclical Dominum et Vivificantem. In fact, preparing for the year 2000 has become as it were a hermeneutical key of my pontificate.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">David Crumm of the Detroit Free Press reports that the pope&#39;s plan &quot;calls for many phases of preparation for the jubilee.&quot; Crumm wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. &quot;After years of slow dialogue with many Christian denominations, the pontiff wants to move rapidly to break down barriers between the churches. He wants temporary agreements to allow members to worship together in special jubilee programs. Beyond that, the pope hopes to move quickly toward full communion, in which members of the churches would share worship services.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. &quot;By 1996, the pope wants to publish a humble confession for the sins of his own church over the past 2000 years. Chief among these sins, the pope said, was the church&#39;s use of violence to promote the faith in periods such as the Inquisition in the Middle Ages. . . .&quot;</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. &quot;In 1999, the pope wants leaders of the three faiths that look back to the ancient patriarch Abraham as their founder [Jews, Muslims and Catholics] to join in three meetings.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">So the Pope is moving to reconcile religious connections by the year 2000. Reconciliation is going on in every area of life, and 1996 will most likely be the year of the big push for major reconciliations. The reason for this is to bring about a unity that will prepare people for the experience of Jubilee in the year 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">There is no doubt of the Pope&#39;s influence to call millions into Jubilee 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 8: A LOOK BACK TO HOW TABERNACLES SUPPOSEDLY FULFILLS THE CORPORATE MAN&#39;S DESTINY AND CALLING </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I got a note recently saying that in Latter Rain, all the reconciliation that is going on is considered part of the celebration of the Day of Atonement. But Alan Vincent said that God is &quot;moving the Church from the Day of Atonement to Tabernacles.&quot; This gave me the sense that to the degree that the various areas are reconciled, the Latter Rain church moves proportionately into the Feast of Tabernacles. According to McMillan and Thompson, &quot;we will never fulfill our destiny and calling&quot; until &quot;we understand and partake of this feast [Tabernacles] as we have both Passover and Pentecost, . . We must discover the meaning of the Feast of Tabernacles and &#39;celebrate&#39; it along with Passover and Pentecost. . . . What God did among the Jews in Jerusalem, He is going to do among humanity and worldwide. Pentecost will come to maturity in the Feast of Tabernacles.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">What does that mean: &quot;fulfill our destiny and calling&quot;? McMillan and Thompson say that Pentecost must find its fulfillment in Tabernacles. What is the meaning of that? It&#39;s important to know who they are referring to when they write &quot;we&quot;. Remember, to Latter Rainists, Pentecost is a personal experience of God by each man, while Tabernacles is a corporate experience.THIS MAN, the CORPORATE MAN, is the one who has to fulfill &quot;HIS&quot; destiny by: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. corporately discovering and understanding the meaning of Tabernacles; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. corporately celebrating or partaking in it; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Then whatever happens when the corporate man completes this process will be the fulfillment of &quot;his&quot; destiny and calling. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">So how does Pentecost find its fulfillment in Tabernacles? Let&#39;s say it this way: when everyone has received the same spirit through being harvested or revived by a Pentecost, they &quot;qualify&quot; for Tabernacles. Then when all of those who received the same spirit are brought together and are given the same spirit again as a corporate group, that&#39;s Tabernacles. When Tabernacles is celebrated corporately, the ONE MAN&#39;S destiny and calling are fulfilled. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I want to bring all of this together now and make some final comparisons. First, let&#39;s look at: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">TABERNACLES AND JUBILEE IN THE CURRENT MOVE OF GOD </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">John Wimber said God told him to go the nations because He was going to pour out His Spirit as He did in the beginning - He said it would be a time of New Beginnings. This is an unscriptural second outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This New Beginning is also the Feast of Tabernacles, and Tabernacles has three aspects to it: Unity, Revival and Harvest. More and more, we are hearing of Tabernacles being celebrated in the churches, but there&#39;s more to it than that. A prophetic word given on September 24, 1995 during a conference in Arkansas referred to the celebration of Jubilee: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;A season of jubilee is coming. A bigger place, a more spacious place where there is room for everyone. More room to minister...more resources being released...more time to give...more time to be with the Lord...more power released into the church. Canceled debts, forgiven mistakes, restoration of things and relationships you had thought were lost forever. A fulfilling of earlier dreams and visions. . . . But before my jubilee comes, . . . I&#39;m pouring out my power and releasing strength through a gift of joy. Angels and earthquakes are being sent to open prison doors as my people praise me..rejoice in me...laugh with me..cry out to me... and receive me *in the way I am coming*. Get your heads and hearts up...for a season of jubilee is coming.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The power and the laughing and the joy spoken of in this word is not Jubilee but precedes it - they belong to Tabernacles. But when Jubilee does come, Jesus supposedly said, he must be received &quot;in the way I am coming.&quot; This coming is described in a prophecy by Bill Britton, a Latter Rainist. In her Biblical Discernment Ministries newsletter, Jewel van Merwe quoted Britton&#39;s prophesy from his book, &quot;Eagle Saints Alive&quot;: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I see the great year of Jubilee, when we shall pass through the veil into the very presence of the fullness of God, to be filled with this fullness and go forth proclaiming liberty to all of creation. . . This is the ultimate anointing! This is the fullness of the Spirit! This is the Spirit without measure that Jesus had spoken of in John 3:34, reserved until the end time for His Brethren!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I believe that when the Church reaches this stage, its proposed destiny and calling as a corporate man will be fulfilled in the Manifest Sons of God. The question is, &quot;What is the link that moves the Church from Tabernacles into Jubilee?&quot; The answer to that seems to lie with Jay Gary. Gary has called for &quot;the year 2000 to be celebrated as a Golden Jubilee.&quot; Earlier, I quoted Gary as saying, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The annual calendar of Israel was built around three major festivals: Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles. These celebrations in Jerusalem were anything but boring. There was dancing, singing and exuberant celebration before the living God. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Year of Jubilee encompassed these three festivals, only raised to a higher power. . . . . Then, as well as today, Jesus calls us to experience His Jubilee.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Because Jubilee is Tabernacles, only raised to a higher power, the door is wide open for the Church to march into a Golden Jubilee in the year 2000; the two feasts would mesh together. Gary&#39;s call would be the door for the Church, in the words of Bill Britton, to &quot;pass through the veil into the very Presence of the fullness of God,&quot; or, as in the other prophecy, receive Jesus &quot;in the way [He] is coming&quot; in Jubilee. Not coincidentally, the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem is promoting Tabernacles in churches worldwide, and its Director, Johann Luckhoff, was recently invited as a Distinguished Leader to the AD2000 Global Conference on World Evangelism in Seoul, Korea. What makes this extremely interesting is that Jay Gary was the person who co-ordinated the first GCOWE in 1989, and Luckhoff has written, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;One of the reasons I was invited to Korea was because the organizers of the GCOWE hope to have the next gathering in Jerusalem at the end of this millennium. That should be quite an event!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">He was speaking about Jubilee 2000 and the celebration of Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday. So, the stage seems to be set as we draw near to the year 2000. The final shift in the direction of a united global Church THROUGH TABERNACLES will move it as one unit INTO JUBILEE - its culmination of joy. But there is more to this. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">ROME&#39;S NEW PENTECOST </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In 1966, Pope John XXIII prayed to the Holy Spirit for the success of the Ecumenical Council, Vatican II: &quot;Renew Thy wonders in our day, as by a new Pentecost.&quot; Two years later, the charismatic renewal broke out in the Catholic Church. It seems that everything is being made new. Wimber has his New Beginnings, as does Hubbard, and Rome has a New Pentecost, but none of these are found in Scripture. We&#39;ve said that the three aspects of Wimber&#39;s and Hubbard&#39;s New Beginnings are Revival, Harvest and Unity. Now look at these excerpts from Pope John XXIII&#39;s prayer at Vatican II, because these same three aspects are found in the NEW Pentecost of the Catholic Church: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(REVIVAL) &quot;RENEW Thy wonders in this our day, as by a NEW PENTECOST. Grant to Thy Church that, being of one mind and steadfast in prayer with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and following the lead of blessed Peter, it may advance the reign of our Divine Savior, the reign of truth and justice, the reign of love and peace. Amen.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(HARVEST) &quot;Grant that from this Council ABUNDANT FRUIT MAY RIPEN; that the light and strength of the gospel MAY BE EXTENDED MORE AND MORE IN HUMAN SOCIETY; that the Catholic religion AND ITS ACTIVE MISSIONARY WORKS MAY FLOURISH WITH EVEN GREATER VIGOR, with the happy result that knowledge of the Church&#39;s teaching MAY SPREAD and Christian morality MAY HAVE A SALUTARY INCREASE.</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">(UNITY) &quot;We pray also for those sheep who are NOT NOW OF THE ONE FOLD OF JESUS CHRIST, that even as they glory in THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN, THEY MAY COME AT LAST TO UNITY UNDER THE GOVERNANCE OF THE ONE SHEPHERD.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Who is the ONE FOLD spoken of here in the Pope&#39;s prayer? Rome. Who are those sheep who glory in the name of Christian and are not of the one fold? Protestants. And what did the Pope pray? That &quot;THEY MAY COME AT LAST TO UNITY UNDER THE GOVERNANCE OF THE ONE SHEPHERD.&quot; This is a prayer for unification of the denominations with Rome. In the mid 60s, AFTER the NEW Pentecost had broken out and spread, Leon Cardinal Suenens said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The drive toward unity among Christians seems irreversible; we may hope that the hour is not far off. . . . We are permitted to be confident with hope founded in God and in the progress of theology that the third millennium will see the restoration of full unity and full communion.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">We are seeing the Cardinal&#39;s hope come to fruition in global proportions today. We have seen his &quot;progress of theology&quot;, empowered by the progressive revelations of the Latter Rain, evolve into a manifested unity. Since the NEW Pentecost started, walls have come down in the denominations while association with Rome has steadily increased. Father John Bertalucci said in the 1950s, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I want to tell you something brothers and sisters. When the sleeping giant of Rome comes alive, watch out world. . . . especially in a day and age where we can cooperate and collaborate in winning the world for Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This is THAT DAY, and Rome IS coming alive! Jay Gary has more than a small conversation with the Catholic global evangelization program. And this is the key to unifying everything. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Foundations%20for%20Apostasy%20article%20(1)_files/image10.jpg" width="798" height="8" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><h1 class="cs35586">

He wants temporary agreements to allow members to worship together in special Jubilee programs. Beyond that, the pope hopes to move quickly toward full communion, in which members of the churches would share worship services.&quot; But what does the Pope believe about the Sacrament of Communion? Dave Hunt quotes Vatican II about Communion and the Eucharist: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . in the Eucharist we become PARTAKERS OF THE BODY AND BLOOD of God&#39;s only Son . . . [and] THE PARTAKING OF the Body and Blood of Christ HAS NO LESS EFFECT THAN TO CHANGE US INTO WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Read it again. That is MANIFEST SONS TEACHING! INCARNATION! IMMORTALITY! The Pope wants full unity and communion, and Vatican II says we BECOME WHAT THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST IS - that&#39;s INCARNATION of one new man - physically - indwelt by the Spirit of A NEW Pentecost! The language of the Latter Rain doctrine is not foreign to the Catholic Charismatic Renewal&#39;s New Pentecost. In an article originally published in the March/April 1978 edition of New Covenant magazine and now found in &quot;Good News&quot;, the newsletter for the Catholic Renewal published by the National Service Committee in England (Jan/Feb 1995), we read: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;But something new has happened to us in the charismatic renewal. When we were baptized in the Spirit, we experienced a God who does make a difference. . . . The revelation of Jesus - his words, his actions - is not just a bunch of separate fragments cast out for the winds to carry wherever chance leads them. THERE IS A PLAN TO THIS REVELATION; it builds up TO something. God is not manifesting himself in a random or chaotic way with no ultimate purpose. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;. . . The Body of Christ, the Bride of Christ, The New Temple, The New Israel, and so on. All of them indicate that God&#39;s purpose in manifesting Himself to mankind is to create A CORPORATE REALITY made up of Christians in union with Christ. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Word of life MADE MANIFEST is ultimately, then, this single corporate reality The One new Man.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">What makes this all the more interesting is that Barbara Marx Hubbard&#39;s Christ said to her, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;You have come home to me. The bread and wine hold within them the substance of my new body. The key for you now each day is to breathe deeply in a &#39;birthing experience&#39; of the resurrected body. Then do the communion and experience my body transforming yours. Do this in preparation for the Planetary Birth which will be induced through this experience given to the new disciples of Christ who chose to work together for the Planetary Pentecost, when the Spirit of God is poured out upon all people. This is the purpose of your mission on Earth. All your projects will be reoriented, aligned and empowered as you accept this purpose and put it first. . . . finally.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This is rather disturbing because promotion material for Jerusalem Celebration 2000 planned for February 1996 in celebration of Jesus 2000th birthday in Jerusalem says Pastor Jack Hayford will lead &quot;the whole multitude&quot; to &quot;the shores of the Sea of Galilee for Holy Communion.&quot; It is at this event that &quot;Dr. David Yonggi Cho will speak on miracles and the feeding of the 5,000 amidst a magnificent time of high praise and worship to conclude the five memorable days.&quot; But do you know Hayford&#39;s view on Holy Communion? He apparently has no problem with the Catholic sacrament. Look at this quote taken from the Promise Keepers&#39; book, &quot;Seven Promises of a Promise Keeper,&quot; where he writes about &quot;Redeeming Worship&quot; on page 19: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Redeeming worship centers on the Lord&#39;s Table. Whether your tradition celebrates it as Communion, Eucharist, the Mass, or the Lord&#39;s Supper, we are all called to this centerpiece of Christian worship.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In his book, The Star of 2000, Jay Gary speaks of a proposal made in 1979 by Reformed professor Lew Mudge &quot;that the churches which are still divided should settle their differences as we approach the year 2000 and convene a holy council in that year - the first universal council since A.D. 787.&quot; Exclaiming that this would be &quot;a gift of God&quot; . . . and &quot;the greatest Christian congress in 2,000 years!,&quot; Gary then relates how Lukas Vuscher describes this proposed council: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;On the opening day of the assembly they would all unite in confession of one and the same apostolic faith on the basis of years of thorough preparation. They would declare the divisions between them to be a thing of the past and then join together in celebration of the Eucharist.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In Gary&#39;s video, The Power of 2000, he says, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Really, the final, and probably it&#39;s the most important image of the year 2000 I like to speak of, is Jubilee 2000. This image looks at the year 2000 as a common meal. It looks at, ah, like the ancient Jewish society; it used to start all over again in 50 years. It looks at the year 2000 as a second chance, a second wind, for the Church and for the human planet. It may not be the end of the world (inaudible words), but we can consecrate ourselves and celebrate the goodness of God, for His steadfast love endures forever. Whatever 2000 brings, we all know it&#39;s probably going to be a once in a lifetime experience. It will be the greatest celebration in the history of civilization. And with Columbus, we didn&#39;t know whether to protest or parade, but with Jesus, Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday, we should sound a clear trumpet. His celebration of His birthday will overshadow all previous celebrations of human history, including the bicentennial in the United States and France. You&#39;ll start probably in &#39;96 with the re-creation, the re-enactment of the journey of the magi, continuing up to 2000 and beyond. Up until now, most of the press has just seen the year 2000 as the biggest New Years in a thousand years, but soon we&#39;ll see it as the biggest Christmas in 2000. I think Jesus&#39;, (inaudible words) the Father is so we want to honor the Son that He is calling us to the banquet table. And if we follow, this, this, unpack this mega-image, if we unwrap this birthday gift from heaven, Mission 2000 becomes Meal 2000, Countdown 2000 we fill with Celebration 2000. This is my prayer and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s yours.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The common meal will center around the Eucharist, and this will play an important part in the Jubilee celebrations, as Gary and the Pope indicate. But Jubilee 2000 and the celebration of Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday are vitally tied to the full communion desired by the Pope. We have seen that, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. Jay Gary is leading the evangelical Church into a Jubilee Year in the year 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. Within the first 100 words of his speech after being elected Pope, Pope John Paul II also declared, &quot;the year 2000 will be a year of the Great Jubilee.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">We are fast approaching that year, and full communion and full unity as well. &quot;Christianity&quot; will finally reach the unity it has been seeking. What is crucial here is that both the Pope and Jay Gary are tying the celebration of Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday to Jubilee! Leaning on Catholic rather than Jewish tradition, Jay Gary describes how Jubilee has already been linked to the birth of Christ: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;A tradition developed that the Jubilee began on Christmas Eve with the opening of a sealed golden door in St. Peter&#39;s Basilica. It affirmed that as the pope struck the holy door with a golden hammer, living streams of grace and pardon from Christ, the rock, were released. The inheritance of the fathers was restored to the sons. . . . </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Like the biblical Jubilee year, the coming bimillennial should be a time of reconciliation and celebration before God. This ordinary year, A. D. 2000, needs to be celebrated in an extraordinary way, particularly in light of Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This linkage was furthered in the papal statement on Jubilee issued last November 10th, in which Pope John Paul II suggested that &quot;the time leading up to the [Year of Jubilee] be lived as a new Advent.&quot; He wrote: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The first phase . . . is meant to revive in the Christian people an awareness of the value and meaning of the Jubilee of the Year 2000 in human history. As a commemoration of the birth of Christ, the jubilee is deeply charged with Christological significance. . . .&quot;</span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;A jubilee is always an occasion of special grace, &#39;a day blessed by the Lord.&#39; As has already been noted, it is thus a time of joy. The Jubilee of the Year 2000 is meant to be a great prayer of praise and thanksgiving, especially for the gift of the incarnation of the Son of God and of the redemption which he accomplished.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">JUBILEE AND CHRIST&#39;S 2000TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION WILL BE ONE EVENT </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The various strands of the Latter Rain/New Age scenario for the end of this age have been woven together into an intricate banner announcing the celebration of Tabernacles and Jubilee, centered around communion. But another thread now being added to the design spells out a place name, the city in which the banner must be planted - Jerusalem. One of the gatherings being planned for the Holy City is JERUSALEM CELEBRATION 2000, to be held February 7-11, 1996. Dr. Paul Yonggi Cho, one of the Celebration&#39;s promoters, recently announced that many thousands of delegates would come to Jerusalem &quot;from all over the world.&quot; Robert Schuller, scheduled to pray for the nations during the celebration, said, &quot;Jerusalem Celebration 2000 may go down in the history of Christendom as the most exciting celebration of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ!&quot; According to the promotional material, a host of other speakers will include Jack Hayford (Church on the Way), C. Peter Wagner (co-ordinator of the AD2000 United Prayer Track) and Tom Pelton, who is &quot;founder and president of March for Jesus USA and is the March for Jesus Coordinator for the Americas with responsibility for the entire Western Hemisphere.&quot; These last three men are closely knit with Jay Gary through AD2000 programs. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Sounding much like Pope John Paul II and Jay Gary in his vision for a soon-coming spiritually-united kingdom, Dr. Cho said, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I pray that this spectacular event will bring a renewed love and unity among the peoples of the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">So Christians are going to Jerusalem to begin celebrating Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday, just as Jay Gary has proposed. Others will travel to the Holy City to celebrate Tabernacles which, according to Gary, will be &quot;raised to a higher power&quot; in the Year of Jubilee. And the Pope is headed for Jerusalem in an all-out effort to bring the corporate Church into full communion for Jubilee. The interweaving of these three themes in Jerusalem will center on Jubilee as a celebration of the birth of Christ. Two questions must be asked: Is the manifestation of the Sons of God through Tabernacles being timed to come during Jubilee? And will the city of Jerusalem be prematurely exalted as the dwelling of God? Of this we can be sure: the two events are being tied together. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">If you or people you know have been having a strong change of mind about celebrating Christmas this year, I believe it is Jesus reaching out to His people to turn them away from such celebrations. Why? Because as we get nearer to the year 2000, we may get so caught up in the hype of the celebration of Jesus&#39; bimillennial birthday that we will be led into an experience of the New Age Christ. Let&#39;s see how that is possible. I want to add Hubbard to this, but first I want to make the following point. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 9: THE WHOLE HUMAN FAMILY WILL BE AFFECTED BY JUBILEE 2000/JESUS&#39; 2000TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Latter Rain&#39;s and Gary&#39;s TABERNACLES, the Pope&#39;s and Gary&#39;s JUBILEE and Hubbard&#39;s PLANETARY PENTECOST will, according to each of them, affect not just the Church, but the whole of humanity. Other leaders from various belief systems are saying the same thing. For instance, concerning the celebration of Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday in Jerusalem, Dr. Yonggi Cho wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I pray that this spectacular event will bring a renewed love and unity AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">On his &quot;God&#39;s Suddenlys&quot; tape, Alan Vincent quotes God as saying that, through Tabernacles, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;I&#39;m getting ready to laugh and I&#39;m getting ready to roar, and I tell you this WHOLE WORLD is going to feel the shaking of that laughter and the power of that roar.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">M.

In fact, that is what it&#39;s all about. With all due respect to the traditional millennialists, I think what is meant by the Second Coming is not the bodily return of that one solitary man, but the coming of the mystical body of His True Church; the coming of the spirit of Christ TO EVERYONE, SWEEPING THROUGH THE WORLD. Father, make us like Mary . . . to give birth to Your Son; to give Him to everyone. This is the time of the Second Coming. Whether we like it or not. There&#39;s no alternative except self-annihilation. . . . It is the time of the Second Coming. &#39;Here and now we&#39;re chosen to be, to reveal His grace that all then may see.&#39; It&#39;s either give birth to Jesus or else.

Both have usurped the place of Israel. Both speak of the birthing of a corporate body of people who, having realized Christification, will cleanse the earth of evil and establish a kingdom of peace. Both are declaring a celebration of joy in which the corporate child will come forth. Hopefully, before the final merging of the two, the Church will realize we have lost the simplicity of a Lamb slain for sin.

The PLANETARY BIRTH is a real event in cosmic time. . . . that is really HAPPENING TO US NOW!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Celebration of Jubilee 2000 is a global event that will give birth to a corporate Christ made up of New Age adherents and a deceived Church. Homo Universalis will come forth; the Manifest Sons of God will come forth; the &quot;children of God&quot; will come forth, with the denominations following behind Rome into a Great Jubilee. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 11: WE MUST REALIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING: JUBILEE = PLANETARY PENTECOST </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The following scenario is rather simplistic, but it illustrates how easily every Christian in every denomination can be pointed towards Jubilee: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. Jay Gary will call the participants in global evangelism to Jubilee 2000. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. The Pope will call those he&#39;s unified to celebrate his preannounced Jubilee: Muslims, Catholics, Jews, denominational Christians and other religions of the world. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. Joel&#39;s Army of the Latter Rain will march out of Tabernacles into Jubilee. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. Barbara Marx Hubbard and other New Agers will call their followers into a Planetary Pentecost, where the Spirit is poured out on ALL FLESH. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The celebration of Jubilee, or as Hubbard calls it, The Planetary Pentecost, is setting up the perfect conditions for the simultaneous manifestations of the Latter Rain&#39;s Sons of God and the New Age&#39;s Homo Universalis. Even Pope John Paul II, in Article 23 of his Jubilee document, expresses this expectation: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Since the publication of the very first document of my pontificate I have spoken explicitly of the Great Jubilee, suggesting that the time leading up to it be lived as &#39;a new Advent.&#39; . . . . Despite appearances, humanity continues to await THE REVELATION OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD and lives by THIS HOPE, like a mother in labor, to use the image employed so powerfully by St. Paul in his Letter to the Romans (cf. 8:19-22).&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Pope wants the time leading up to Jubilee to be LIVED AS A NEW ADVENT, and Advent means &quot;a coming or an arrival&quot;. Is John Paul, like Hubbard, asking what in our day is comparable to the birth of Christ? He wrote, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Mary . . . should inspire all who cooperate in the Church&#39;s apostolic mission for the REBIRTH OF HUMANITY. . . &quot;.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">So his hope is not the second coming of Christ in the clouds, but rather the manifestation of the children of God. That&#39;s Latter Rain theology. I&#39;m not suggesting that all of these people, including Jay Gary and the Pope, are Latter Rainist. What I am saying is that the Latter Rain doctrine has subtly influenced and is now controlling the direction of the Church, which as a result is increasingly uniting on a global basis. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">POINT 12: WE NEED TO LOOK AT ONE LAST CELEBRATION: PLANETARY PENTECOST </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Barbara Marx Hubbard&#39;s Christ said we would see the NEW Beginnings. Her Christ also promised an outpouring of the Spirit of God: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Do this [Communion] in preparation for the Planetary Birth which will be induced through the experience given to the new disciples of Christ who choose to work together for a Planetary Pentecost, when the Spirit of God is poured out on all people.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The New Age Christ told Hubbard: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Instant of Co-operation begins, empathy floods the feelings of the whole body of Earth, separateness is overcome, and I appear to all of you at once. I appear to you from within as a voice, and as a vision of yourself as an evolving being. I appear to you from beyond as the light being that I now am. . . . </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;At the moment of cosmic contact, I will appear to you both through inner experience and through external communication on your mass media - the nervous system of the world. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;You will all feel, hear and see my presence at one instant in time, each in your own way.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Christ said he will communicate through external communication. Keeping in mind Earnest Ramsey&#39;s conclusion that Neo-pentecostalism&#39;s Jubilee is the same as the Age of Aquarius, or Hubbard&#39;s Planetary Pentecost, I ask you to consider this: Pope John Paul II is planning to speak by radio or television to 5 billion people of the world during the Jubilee celebration of Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday. What do you suppose will happen if, during his address, he calls for another New Pentecost, or for the Spirit of Jubilee to be poured out? Would Mary inspire the rebirth of humanity to occur? What spirit do you think would respond - Jesus Christ or Hubbard&#39;s Christ? If it were Hubbard&#39;s, then the promise of a Planetary Pentecost resulting in a Planetary Birth by the New Age Christ would be fulfilled. Let me repeat Alice Bailey&#39;s words for you: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;What the orthodox theologian and the narrow doctrinaire have to offer no longer satisfies the intelligent seeker or suffices to answer his questions. He is shifting his allegiances into wider and more spiritual areas. He is moving OUT FROM UNDER doctrinal authority AND TO direct personal, spiritual experience AND COMING UNDER the direct authority which contact with Christ and His disciples, the masters, gives.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Many today are saying the Bride is pregnant and in labor and on her way to the celebration of a birth that Hubbard says is &quot;comparable with the birth of Christ&quot;: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The early Christians had a story to tell: a child was born . . . . Everyone could understand this story, from kings to peasants. Unexpectedly a new question burst forth in my mind. I spoke it out loud. Lifting my voice to the ice-white sky, I demanded to know: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;&#39;What is our story? What in our age is comparable with the birth of Christ?&#39; &quot;I knew it must be one story for all of humankind, for we are all members of one planetary body. . . . </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Then I heard the inner words clearly [from the Christ]: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;&#39;Our story is a birth. It is the birth of humankind as one body. . . . We are one body, born into this universe. GO TELL THE STORY OF OUR BIRTH . .&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Barbara is telling it. The Latter Rain is telling it. Jay Gary is telling it. Pope John Paul II is telling it. Will we tell it, or will we warn the Church that we are headed into a deception and that the tool the adversary is using to deceive is the birth of our Lord and Savior 2000 years ago? There is not much time left to warn. We are only four years from the year 2000. We need to strongly consider the words of Tricia Tillin as we draw near to Christmas 2000: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Very little is being said about the doctrine, origins, purpose and goal of the &#39;new move.&#39; It is my belief that most churches and leaders do not know those things. . . . </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Few people involved in the current events know the origins of the phrases they are using (like Second Pentecost, or Latter Rain); few leaders understand where the concepts they have been taught in conferences, fraternals and elders&#39; meetings have been coming from! Many have never even heard of the Latter Rain, and would deny having anything to do with such doctrine. Yet still they accept the beliefs with which they have been subtly indoctrinated over a period of decades! Ignorance is no excuse, for the teachings are plainly contrary to the Word of God. Leaders, as well as individual Christians, have a responsibility to test supposed new revelations, not to accept and promote them just because they are popular.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Foundations%20for%20Apostasy%20article%20(1)_files/image12.jpg" width="798" height="8" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><h1 class="cs35586">

Unity! Celebration! Joy! Rebirth! Right Relationships! Transformation! The greatest Move of God ever known to the Church! These are the subjects I addressed in my three part series on the surge of Latter Rain and Restorationist unity, harvest and revival currently hitting the Church head on. As I researched the articles, which focused on the &quot;birthing of the corporate child&quot; by the year 2000, I was shocked to see that the various quotations I&#39;d gathered from church leaders also formed a vivid picture of these new moves in the Church. Months later, as I began to research false christs for our Home Page on our Lord&#39;s second coming, I was again taken aback as I discovered that the same Latter Rain/Restorationist agenda was being proposed through the directives and messages of Lord Maitreya, the &quot;Master of All Masters&quot; channeled by New Ager Benjamin Creme. Lord Maitreya is a likely candidate to be the &quot;Lord&quot; of the endtime Apostasy, and may very well manifest himself in some way during the global celebrations scheduled for the year 2000. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Who is Lord Maitreya?</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">New Agers believe that every age has had a teacher who manifested &quot;the Christ&quot;. During the past 2,150 years, they say, we have been in the age of Pisces, the energies of which brought divisions into the world. It is believed that now we are in a transition period, and that the new age of Aquarius will be one of synthesis, an age of unity and oneness. This unity of all things will bring fulfillment to humanity through the realization that man is god. Many believe that this realization will be brought forth under the Aquarian leadership of and through the personal appearance of the Lord Maitreya. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">According to Benjamin Creme and other followers, Lord Maitreya is the Master of All Masters, the head of a spiritual Hierarchy of enlightened men. (Jesus Christ is said to be a member of this Hierarchy, charged with overseeing the Christian religion.) As the World Teacher, Maitreya embodies the &quot;Christ Principle&quot;, and has overshadowed great men of the past, such as Jesus, to give humanity direction on its way to evolutionary fulfillment. It is believed that the time of his reappearance is at hand, and in preparation, he has taken on a personal body and is living in London in an inconspicuous fashion until the time is right. Maitreya&#39;s followers say that at his public appearing, men from all religions will accept him as the particular Anointed One, Messiah or Christ expected by their various faiths. </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Maitreya: Lord Of Joy And Gladness</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">I want to start with one quick comparison between Lord Maitreya and a particular aspect of the present &quot;move of God&quot;, the laughing phenomena. If Maitreya is the Lord of the Apostasy, and if the laughing phenomena known as the &quot;Toronto Blessing&quot; is part of the Apostasy, then we must be able to connect the two. In Volume 1 of </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Maitreya&#39;s Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Benjamin Creme repeats a question asked him in April 1984: &quot;Did Maitreya choose His own name?&quot; Creme&#39;s answer is telling. Maitreya was given his name by his master at his second initiation in Mid-Atlantean times, and his name means, &quot;The Happy One, The One Who brings Joy or Gladness&quot; (p. 33). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The meaning of Maitreya&#39;s name is significant because of the chaos and division in the Church brought on by the controversy over the spiritual source of the &quot;Spirit of Joy&quot;. One prophesy given through Master Potter Ministries says that the source is Jesus, pouring out this spirit through an Old Testament type: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Prophetically, the child Isaac, which means &#39;Laughter,&#39; is being released in nation after nation as the new wine is being passed&quot; (Promotion material, &quot;The Great Intruder,&quot; 1994 Passion &amp; Fire Conferences, Jill Austin of Master Potter Ministries).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">But this prophecy contradicts Hebrews 1:1-2, which tells us, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This new movement&#39;s child is Isaac, meaning &quot;Laughter&quot;, and &quot;he&quot; is being released into the world as new wine, bringing joy and laughter to the nations. So we must ask, is &quot;Isaac&quot; a Christianized term for Lord Maitreya? &quot;He&quot; very well could be. Certainly neither Isaac nor Maitreya is Jesus Christ our Lord.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">

I found that the new Church teachings and the agenda they form are frighteningly similar to Hubbard&#39;s. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In her book, Hubbard refers to the end of World War II as the signal to all men that </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;the Cosmic Child, humanity, could either kill itself by remaining in self-centered consciousness, or instead emancipate itself for universal life&quot; (Hubbard, </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Revelation</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, p. 40).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard expanded that statement on page 131: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The birth pangs reached critical intensity with the explosion of the first atomic bomb in 1945. This was the signal that humanity could destroy its womb or co-create new worlds on Earth and in space. An irreversible birth process began. We could never return to the prenatal period. The Cosmic Child, humanity, had discovered the invisible technologies of creation and destruction. We could not unlearn it. We had to go forward with our birth to become a godlike species, or destroy ourselves in the process of birth.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">She goes on to say that with Hiroshima began </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The next turn on the spiral . . . , revealing the &#39;synergy&#39; . . . The separate parts of humanity . . . coming together to form a whole that is greater than and unpredictable from the sum of its parts. Synergy feels like love, loving one another as ourselves. We are, in fact, one body!&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Revelation</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, p. 40-41).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard then goes on to propose that humanity as a whole must evolve from the race of Homo Sapiens to Homo Universalis: a race of God-men. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Creme says basically the same thing. Maitreya&#39;s coming will result in the human race realizing godhood and being lifted up to its assigned place within the Hierarchy: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;We are entering the &#39;crisis of love.&#39; This is the experience which the human race faces as it enters that period in its evolutionary journey when it will, as a whole, demonstrate the quality of Love and take its place in the Kingdom of Souls, the Esoteric Hierarchy&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 1, p. 154).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Now what about Hubbard&#39;s &quot;signal&quot;? Benjamin Creme, the channeler of Lord Maitreya, said it was his Master that gave this signal. On page 6 of his book, </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Maitreya&#39;s Mission, Vol. 1</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Creme writes that the end of World War II signaled the time of the return of the Masters who guide humanity on its evolutionary journey to fulfillment: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The signal for [Maitreya&#39;s] return was given in 1945 at the end of the war. The Lord Maitreya announced His intention to return once again - not taking over the vehicle of one of His disciples - but to come Himself in His own full physical presence, bringing a large group of His disciples, the Masters of Wisdom, with Him&quot; (p. 6).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Unless we want to believe that two different &quot;Christs&quot; used the same event to give the same signal, we must conclude that Hubbard&#39;s &quot;god-like species, the Cosmic Christ&quot; and Creme&#39;s &quot;evolved human race, the Esoteric Hierarchy&quot;, are one and the same.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Has Humanity Been Holding Back Maitreya&#39;s Reappearance?</span></h3>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Benjamin Creme says, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The only question was when humanity would be ready for the entry of these advanced, and, from our point of view, perfected men. The signal for this return was given in June 1945, at the end of the war, by Maitreya Himself&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 1, p. 6).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Maitreya announced to the rest of the Ascended Masters that he would return to the world with a large group of Masters &quot;at the earliest possible moment, as soon as humanity began to put its house in order.&quot; His return would occur when a measure of peace ensued, when the principle of sharing began to be evident, and &quot;when the principle of goodwill was active, leading to right human relationships&quot; (p. 6). His coming has been delayed on a number of occasions because humanity </span><span class="cs31B015EA">as a whole</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> has not begun to set its house in order. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Barbara Marx Hubbard recognized in her own way the signal given by Lord Maitreya as the time to bring humanity into a corporate birth by &quot;loving one another as ourselves&quot;, and thereby becoming &quot;one body&quot;. Apparently, some in the Church also recognized this signal, and are likewise attempting to put the world&#39;s &quot;house&quot; in order. Along with Lord Maitreya and Hubbard, the Latter Rain and Reconstructionist movements also call for peace, goodwill, and reconciliation leading to right human relationships and the unity of the body, based on &quot;love&quot; rather than truth. Instead of preparing for an endtime tribulation through obedience and striving after holiness, these groups are heading toward celebrations of the year 2000 as a Church united in love and laughter. (See files on this Home Page entitled, </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The &quot;Church&#39;s&quot; Part In Birthing The Corporate Christ</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. This report shows that the agenda and direction of the Church since its absorption of the Latter Rain doctrine is basically the same as Hubbard&#39;s New Age agenda and direction. It&#39;s frightening to realize that thousands upon thousands are following the New Age timetable of Barbara Marx Hubbard as given to her by &quot;the Christ,&quot; who appears to be none other than Maitreya himself. In other words, large segments of the Church are falling gladly into the wide open arms of the New Age Christ.) </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">The Day Of Declaration</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Day of Declaration is the day when Maitreya </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;will leave no doubt that He is the World Teacher. Maitreya will mentally &#39;overshadow&#39; all of humanity simultaneously. Each of us, not only those watching or listening, will hear His words inwardly, telepathically, in our own language. . . . Thus, all will know that the World Teacher is now among us. Maitreya&#39;s open world-wide mission will have begun&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 1, p. 11).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Creme writes that on the Day of Declaration, Maitreya will be seen on television by </span><span class="cs31B015EA">all</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> of humanity through a global satellite hookup. It is then that he will communicate telepathically with the entire world by &quot;overshadowing the minds of all peoples&quot; who &quot;will hear His words inwardly in their own language.&quot; The Christ will communicate &quot;as an outflow of the Christ Principle (the energy which He embodies) through the hearts of all humanity, invoking their intuitive and heartfelt response&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 1, p. 24). Stating that there will also be many healings throughout the world, Creme indicates that this Day of Declaration will be the equivalent of Pentecost: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;This [Day of Declaration] will be a repetition, only now on a world scale, of the true happenings of Pentecost, 2,000 years ago. . . . In celebration of this event, Pentecost will become one of the major festivals of the New World Religion which, eventually, Maitreya will inaugurate&quot; (Ibid.).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard&#39;s Christ also promised such an experience for all humanity: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;You have come home to me. The bread and wine hold within them the substance of my new body. The key for you now each day is to breathe deeply in a &#39;birthing experience&#39; of the resurrected body. Then do the communion and experience my body transforming yours. Do this in preparation for the Planetary Birth which will be induced through this experience given to the new disciples of Christ who chose to work together for the Planetary Pentecost, when the Spirit of God is poured out upon all people. This is the purpose of your mission on Earth. All your projects will be reoriented, aligned and empowered as you accept this purpose and put it first. . . . finally&quot;(</span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Revelation</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, p. 311).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Creme says that Maitreya will overshadow humanity in such a way that all humans will temporarily be open to his message, which would invoke an &quot;intuitive and heartfelt response.&quot; What makes this especially interesting is that Barbaba Marx Hubbard speaks of her Christ in this same way: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Instant of Co-operation begins, empathy floods the feelings of the whole body of Earth, separateness is overcome, and I appear to all of you at once. I appear to you from within as a voice, and as a vision of yourself as an evolving being. I appear to you from beyond as the light being that I now am. . . . </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;At the moment of cosmic contact, I will appear to you both through inner experience and through external communication on your mass media - the nervous system of the world. </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;You will all feel, hear and see my presence at one instant in time, each in your own way.&quot;(</span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Revelation</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, pp.236-237)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard&#39;s mention of the </span><span class="cs31B015EA">separateness of humanity being overcome</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> is another strong similarity between her Christ and Creme&#39;s Maitreya. Maitreya emphasized to Creme that &quot;The crime of separation must be driven from the earth. I affirm that as my purpose&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 1, p. 7). Each of the &quot;Christs&quot; look to the same result of unity: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Creme&#39;s Maitreya: &quot;. . . . the energy to which we give the name Christ Principle is embodied by a great Master: Maitreya, the World Teacher, Who comes as the Avatar for the Aquarian age. His inspiration, stimulus and guidance makes possible the creation of a civilization in which humanity itself manifests the Christ&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 2, p. 68). </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard&#39;s Christ: &quot;I had sensed that the human race was going through a &#39;birth&#39; to the next stage of our evolution. I knew we were at the threshold of a quantum jump through the activation of our collective capacities. . . . I [Hubbard] experienced Christ as a living Presence guiding us through the great transition to universal life. He seemed to be our potential self, the Universal Human that we are to become&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">The Revelation</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, p. 13).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Hubbard&#39;s Christ and Creme&#39;s Maitreya will both communicate telepathically to all humanity through the external media. Hubbard&#39;s Christ will do this on the occasion of a Planetary Pentecost, and Maitreya on the Day of Declaration, likened to Pentecost. Neither Creme nor Hubbard says that his or her &quot;Christ&quot; will actually speak verbally to the world. Maitreya will be </span><span class="cs31B015EA">seen</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> on the satellite broadcast, but communicate telepathically. Both &quot;Christs&quot; (if they indeed be different) greatly desire &quot;separateness&quot; among the human race to be overcome. The similarities are too great to ignore.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Year 2000: Maitreya&#39;s Opportunity?</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Is there such an occasion planned for a global celebration during which a much-loved and well-respected person will address the whole world at one time via television? Yes. Such an event is already in the works, and the united global Church is heavily involved in bringing it about. In his book,</span><span class="cs31B015EA"> The Star Of 2000</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Jay Gary writes, </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;December 25, 2000 will no doubt be celebrated as the most memorable Christmas ever. As early as 1987, the Roman Catholic Church talked about the ten-year preparation needed for a worldwide satellite telecast on Christmas Day in the year 2000. Pope John Paul II or his successor is scheduled to speak to a potential audience of 5 billion people&quot; (p. 49-50).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Before I even saw the similarities between Hubbard&#39;s Christ and Creme&#39;s Lord Maitreya, I wrote the following in my article </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Part Three of The &quot;Church&#39;s&quot; Part In Birthing The Corporate Christ</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. Realizing Maitreya&#39;s agenda makes these words even more disturbing: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;The Christ said he will communicate through external communication. Keeping in mind [New Ager] Earnest Ramsey&#39;s conclusion that Neo-pentecostalism&#39;s Jubilee is the same as the Age of Aquarius, or Hubbard&#39;s Planetary Pentecost, I ask you to consider this: Pope John Paul II is planning to speak by radio or television to 5 billion people of the world during the Jubilee celebration of Jesus&#39; 2000th birthday. What do you suppose will happen if, during his address, he calls for another New Pentecost, or for the Spirit of Jubilee to be poured out? Would Mary inspire the rebirth of humanity to occur? What spirit do you think would respond - Jesus Christ or Hubbard&#39;s Christ? If it were Hubbard&#39;s, then the promise of a Planetary Pentecost resulting in a Planetary Birth [Christification of corporate humanity] by the New Age Christ would be fulfilled.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Through the new &quot;moves of God,&quot; the Church has placed itself in jeopardy by forsaking God&#39;s word for experience. Now we must consider a possible ramification of this blindly seeking after new things: Will Maitreya be standing on the platform with the Pope when the pontiff addresses the world in the year 2000? The scenario is certainly viable, but we will have to wait and see.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">World Communion 2000</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Let me repeat here the words of Hubbard&#39;s Christ regarding Communion: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;You have come home to me. The bread and wine hold within them the substance of my new body. The key for you now each day is to breathe deeply in a &#39;birthing experience&#39; of the resurrected body. Then do the communion and experience my body transforming yours. Do this in preparation for the Planetary Birth which will be induced through this experience given to the new disciples of Christ who chose to work together for the Planetary Pentecost, when the Spirit of God is poured out upon all people.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Communion aspect of Hubbard&#39;s Christ&#39;s plan is also a part of Maitreya&#39;s plans for the future experience of humanity. On page 64 of </span><span class="cs31B015EA">Maitreya&#39;s Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Creme relates another question he was asked: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;If Maitreya can divide His consciousness into thousands of separate areas of attention, is He indeed present at the moment of consecration in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Masses, and does His blessing remain in the consecrated Host which is revered in the Roman Catholic Churches? Or, since the Master Jesus is in charge of the Christian religion, is it rather His presence in this ritual? (May &#39;85)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Creme answered the question in this way: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;It is always the energy and blessing of Maitreya which consecrates the Host at this ritual. This is the most valid and authentic part of the Christian Church service. Of course, the wafer and the wine are not turned into the &#39;body and blood&#39; of the Christ. This is a symbolic act in memory of Him. The energy transmission, however, is indeed real.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">This becomes more interesting with the realization that the Pope has also called for special agreements for common worship services among the denominations as part of his preparations for the Year of Jubilee in the year 2000: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;After years of slow dialogue with many Christian denominations, the pontiff wants to move rapidly to break down barriers between the churches. He wants temporary agreements to allow members to worship together in special jubilee programs. Beyond that, the pope hopes to move quickly toward full communion, in which members of the churches would share worship services.&quot;(David Crumm, The Detroit Free Press, Nov 28, 1994).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The significance of these statements will be readily seen if you read </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The &quot;Church&#39;s&quot; Part In Birthing The Corporate Christ</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">. The connections made, in this three-part series, between the Pope&#39;s and Jay Gary&#39;s Jubilee and Barbara Marx Hubbard&#39;s Planetary Pentecost are only strengthened by the new information on the Day of Declaration predicted by Maitreya. You&#39;ll see that is a perfect match for a Church deceived into following the dictates of the Latter Rain scenario.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Unity: A Necessary Agenda</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">As mentioned before, in a message of immediate concern given through Creme, Maitreya said, &quot;The crime of separation must be driven from this earth. I affirm this as my purpose&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 1, p. 7). Later Creme wrote that &quot;The process of [Maitreya&#39;s] emergence is a gradual one,&quot; and &quot;as we shift into a greater sense of unity, of concern for all, the climate for Maitreya&#39;s complete emergence improves daily&quot; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">Mission</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, Vol. 1, p. 8). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Are men in the Church, by their own creation of &quot;a greater sense of unity,&quot; improving the climate for Maitreya&#39;s complete emergence? Certainly, by trading the truth related in His word for experience, they&#39;re preparing the Church to accept some kind of unscriptural Second Coming. Through our research, we&#39;ve found that the words of New Ager Alice Bailey paint a perfect picture of the road Christianity has taken during the past five years: </span></p><p class="cs7169E63A"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;&#39;What the orthodox theologian and the narrow doctrinaire have to offer no longer satisfies the intelligent seeker or suffices to answer his questions. He is shifting his allegiances into wider and more spiritual areas. He is moving OUT FROM UNDER doctrinal authority AND TO direct personal, spiritual experience AND COMING UNDER the direct authority which contact with Christ and His disciples, the masters, gives.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">As various groups of undiscerning Christians come together in &quot;unity&quot; through the compromise of doctrine, a global &quot;One Church&quot; is taking shape that appears to fit right in with the plans of Hubbard&#39;s Christ and Lord Maitreya.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><h3 class="cs778DBFE2">
			<span class="cs16E84F30">Final Conclusions</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In </span><span class="cs31B015EA">The &quot;Church&#39;s&quot; Part In Birthing The Corporate Christ</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">, we showed that the Church has been redirected toward the Latter Rain doctrine, and is now being directed by it. Through comparisons with New Age teaching, we also pointed out the similarities between Latter Rain and the New Age agenda being promoted by Barbara Marx Hubbard. Adding to this the information in the present article, can it be denied that the &quot;Christ&quot; presented by Barbara Marx Hubbard is none other than Maitreya himself? It stands to reason, then, that we should acknowledge the Church&#39;s rapid approach to the point of being controlled by the New Age Christ, Lord Maitreya. It&#39;s time to stand up and warn our brothers and sisters that it is he, not the true Jesus Christ our Lord, who is waiting for the Church&#39;s celebrations scheduled for the year 2000. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs91EF8B52"><img src="Foundations%20for%20Apostasy%20article%20(1)_files/image14.jpg" width="798" height="8" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="cs35586">
