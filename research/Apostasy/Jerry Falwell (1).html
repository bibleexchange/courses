				<span class="cs60FB60FC">erry Fallwell of the </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Liberty Baptist Church</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> in Virginia has long been in the public eye. For many years, he has produced a national television broadcast &mdash; most recently on the </span><span class="cs542CD919">Cornerstone TV</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> satellite feed out of Pennsylvania.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">I</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">n the 1980&#39;s, Falwell was considered a controversial figure due to his involvement in the </span><span class="csFE6437CE">Moral Majority</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">, a political action group that sought to inculcate conservative values into the American political dialogue. Jerry Falwell has also published a nationally distributed newspaper in the past.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">A</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">s a result of some of his political activities, Falwell ran into some difficulties with the IRS over the use of his 501(c)(3) non-profit tax status. Federal regulations prohibit religious organizations with the federal </span><span class="csFE6437CE">permit</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> being involved in political campagns and other areas that seek to influence public policy. Falwell&#39;s group ultimately acquiesced to the government&#39;s demands and toned down the conservative political rhetoric. By modifying his </span><span class="csFE6437CE">doctrinal</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> stance to maintain his tax deductibility, </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Jerry Falwell</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> joined a long list of Christian leaders that have prostituted themselves in order to maintain their financial viability.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">A</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">s a </span><span class="csFE6437CE">Baptist</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">, Jerry Falwell continues to be immersed in the so-called Judaeo-Christian line of reasoning that </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">the Jews are the chosen people</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> and should thusly be supported by Christians. A couple of years ago, his church presented a check for </span><span class="csEE6740FB">$1.5 million dollars</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> with no strings attached to the government of Israel. This unqualified support for the modern state of Israel has made him a welcome guest in the halls of Israeli government.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">I</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">n 1999, Falwell was deeply involved in a Jewish/Christian conference that again sought to demonstrate unconditional support for Israel. The event was held at the </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Opryland Hotel</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> on February 2, 1999, and 500 Christians led by Jerry and others of like mind. Republican presidential candidates </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Gary Bauer</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> and </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Lamar Alexander</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> showed up as well.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">T</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">he conference invited several West Bank settlers and other Jewish figures. There were no calls whatsoever to convert the Jews to Christianity. It was simply what one writer dubbed &quot;a lovefest.&quot;</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">F</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">alwell parrots the classic </span><span class="csFE6437CE">Rapture Cult</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> dogma that the Jews will be redeemed by God after the church is rapturred &mdash; before the tribulation. In this regard, the reverend has also demonstrated that he is simply another hireling with gigantic blind spot when it comes to prophecy. His political vision is rather myopic as well for he recently referred to </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Al Gore</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> and his wife as &quot;moral, decent people, Christian people.&quot;</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">A</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">t that same gathering, Falwell apologized for remarks he had made 3 weeks earlier in which he stated that </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">the Antichrist will be a Jew</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">. After receiving a considerable degree of Jewish outrage over the statement, Falwell buckled under and renounced his previous statement. There is, of course, no scripture for any of the reverend Jerry&#39;s fabulous pronouncements, but that&#39;s never stopped him before.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">I</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">n the months prior to January 1st, 2000, Falwell jumped on the Y2K money wagon &mdash; marketing a new book, a new video, a new periodical, etc..</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">I</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">t is amazing how a simple speculation concerning the ethnicity of Antichrist received such wide media exposure when the much larger story concerning Falwell&#39;s </span><span class="csFE6437CE">secret alliance</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> with the cult leader </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Sun Myung Moon</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> received almost no public scrutiny. The church of Jesus Christ continues in their ostrich like ways and does not demand any accountability of the idol shepherds that continue to scratch their itching ears.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">I</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">n 1994, Jerry Falwell secretly accepted </span><span class="csEE6740FB">$3.5 million dollars</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> from the </span><span class="cs542CD919">Women&#39;s Federation for World Peace</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">. In an apparent attempt to cover the movement of the funds, the </span><span class="csFE6437CE">WFWP</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">, which is controlled by Sun Myung Moon&#39;s </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Unification Church</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">, moved the slush fund into a non-profit foundation called </span><span class="cs542CD919">The Christian Heritage Foundation</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">T</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">he </span><span class="csFE6437CE">CHF</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> holds the notes on the debt for Falwell&#39;s Liberty University &mdash; which was floundering financially at the time. In January, 1994, shortly before the big &quot;gift&quot; was given to the </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Christian Heritage Foundation</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> (CHF), Falwell went to South Korea with </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Dan Reber </span><span class="cs60FB60FC">of the </span><span class="csFE6437CE">CHF</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> and a man named </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Ron Godwin</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> to meet with the notorious cultist and ask for money. Godwin, by the way, was the </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Executive Director</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> of the Falwell organization the Moral Majority before he accepted a Vice Presidency at the </span><span class="cs542CD919">Washington Times </span><span class="cs60FB60FC">&mdash; which is owned by the Reverend Moon.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">T</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">he Los Angeles Times put an investigative reporter on the trail of Falwell and confirmed that Falwell received the Moon money via the Christian Heritage Foundation. Obviously, they sought to obscure the trail of the funds. But the Falwell/Moon connection doesn&#39;t stop there.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="cs7A19E07E">C</span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">ornerstone Magazine</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> has reported that two years later, </span><span class="cs542CD919">News World Communications,</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> the parent company of the Moon controlled </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Washington Times</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">, loaned Falwell </span><span class="csEE6740FB">$400,000</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> at a very favorable rate of interest.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">F</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">or those that are unaware of the Reverend Moon, he has repeatedly stated that he is greater than </span><span class="cs542CD919">Jesus Christ</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">. Moon says that Christ&#39;s mission was a failure because he left no children &mdash; but not to worry: God sent us the new Messiah in Korean form! Moon claims that his children are the spirit children that Christ was supposed to sire and they will rule the world under his auspices. Moon claims that in the grand scheme of things, Jesus wasn&#39;t even second best to Moon&#39;s &quot;divine parenthood.&quot;</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">M</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">ost simply don&#39;t want to know these facts about big Jerry, or they continue to attack those that tell the truth about the great apostasy. The truth is, the Reverend Jerry Falwell, like most state sanctioned ministries working in lockstep with the New World Order beast, are simply cheap pretenders that continue to enrich themselves as they drag large numbers of tares to their ultimate reckoning at the lake of fire.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p></td></tr>
