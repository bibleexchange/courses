An astonishing 788 pages, </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Billy Graham and His Friends</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> is supported by a staggering 4,400 footnotes!

For example, during an interview with </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Fox New</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">s on January 2nd, 2000, interviewer </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Tony Snow</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> asked Billy Graham &quot;When you get to Heaven, who&#39;s going to speak first, you or God?&quot; Graham replied: &quot;When I get there, I&#39;m sure that Jesus is going to say that he will welcome me. But I think that he&#39;s going to say: &#39;Well done, our good and faithful servant.&#39; Or he may say: &#39;You&#39;re in the wrong place.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">I</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">n fact, in this same interview, Graham claimed he </span><span class="csFE6437CE">couldn&rsquo;t</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> state categorically his guarantee of salvation because he claimed </span><span class="cs542CD919">&quot;I&rsquo;m not Mother Theresa!&quot;</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> This is simply an outrageous admission, for </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Mother Theresa</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> was not even saved as a Christian. She was on record as categorically stating there were </span><span class="csFE6437CE">other ways</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> to heaven besides salvation through </span><span class="csEE6740FB">Jesus Christ</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">. This is simply blasphemous, unbiblical doctrine that is drawn from the well of the False Prophet.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">Y</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">et in internationally televised crusades for the &quot;other&quot; gospel that Billy Graham presents, Graham routinely assures his gullible public that his brand of evangelism will guarantee their arrival in glory with the Lord. There is much more.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">G</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">raham&#39;s soft stance on communism has been extensively covered up in the West. The truth is, Billy has followed the </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">World Council of Churches&#39;</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> lead into world communism. For example, back in 1973, Graham was interviewed in a Tokyo newspaper entitled the </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Mainichi Daily News</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">I</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">n that </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">May 28, 1973</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> edition, he declared &quot;I think communism&#39;s appeal to youth is its structure and promise of a future utopia. Mao Tse-Tung&#39;s eight precepts are basically the same as the Ten Commandments. In fact, if we can&#39;t have the Ten Commandments read in our schools, I&#39;ll settle for Mao&#39;s precepts.&quot;</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">M</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">any people already know that Graham has completely embraced the Catholic Pope, </span><span class="csEE6740FB">John Paul II</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">,</span><span class="csEE6740FB"> </span><span class="cs60FB60FC">as a great Christian leader and his nomination for &quot;the man of the century.&quot; The truth is </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">this same Pope is not even saved</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">, as he has blasphemed the truth of the Gospel by embracing every religious heresy from </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Kali the Hindu death goddess</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> to the </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">voodoo worshipers</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> of Benin, West Africa.</span></p><p class="csB43072D0"><span class="csEE6740FB">B</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">ecause </span><span class="cs542CD919">the False Prophet</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> described in the book of </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Revelation</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> embraces and leads the world to the following of the </span><span class="cs542CD919">Antichrist</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">, anyone that validates the False Prophet is </span><span class="csFE6437CE">just another false prophet</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">. </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Dr. Billy Graham</span><span class="cs60FB60FC"> has plainly demonstrated his true spiritual character with his ecumenical agenda. That powerful, and largely hidden agenda is carefully documented for anyone that cares enough about the truth to seek it out. The notes here don&#39;t even scratch the surface of the truth concerning Billy Graham. A massive amount of documented detail concerning Dr. Graham&#39;s true spiritual agenda is found in the new book </span><span class="cs542CD919">Billy Graham And His Friends - A Hidden Agenda? </span><span class="cs60FB60FC">by </span><span class="csC4AEE8D3">Dr. Cathy Burns</span><span class="cs60FB60FC">. While Graham defenders are outraged at any criticism of the beloved figure, the massive work completely outclasses all Graham proponents with truth.</span></p><p class="csAC3572D0"><span class="cs542CD919">Billy Graham And His Friends</span><span class="cs71C8385E"> </span><span class="cs60FB60FC">is a voluminous work, with almost 800 pages and 4,400 footnotes &mdash; indicating the scope of the documentation surrounding Graham&#39;s hidden ties to New World Order groups and individuals.
