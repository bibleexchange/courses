		<p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csCDDC8C82"><span class="csCF6BBF71">NEWS BRIEF: The Louisiana Masonic Family Web Site has a section entitled, &quot;Famous Masons&quot; In the subsection entitled, &quot;Other Famous Masons&quot;, they report that the Reverend Billy Graham is a Freemason! The Home Page of the Louisiana Masonic Family was:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csE2DF19C1">http://www2.linknet.net/masonic/mig1.htm</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The link entitled, &quot;Famous Masons&quot; is on http://www2.linknet.net/masonic/famous.htm On Page 12 of 15, alphabetically listed, the Reverend Billy Graham </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">was </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">listed!! <br/><br/>Note: This site was hot linked at the time we first posted this article. Masonic sites who list Reverend Graham as a Freemason come and go. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">(The original list was changed and is not available anymore on Internet)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If Reverend Graham is a Freemason as this Louisiana Masonic Family Web Site reported, and we have no reason to doubt it, then we can begin to understand why and how his organization has drifted far, far away from pursuing the true goals of the Fundamental, Bible-believing Christian Churches. These goals were well supported by Reverend Graham in the late 1940&#39;s, as well they should have been, because they were based upon Biblical principle. As Reverend Graham began to drift away from these goals, we in the Fundamental community were terribly dismayed and filled with consternation!! We began to watch the activities of his organization very carefully, and saw, to our greater dismay, that he continued to drift into the camp of apostate churches and New Age organizations! Today, Reverend Graham is cooperating with the Roman Catholic Pope and the Vatican on many issues, he has been seen speaking to the World Council of Churches, and cooperating with other apostate religious leaders. We will document these activities, below.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before we get started, however, we need to reiterate that we found this information on an official Masonic Web Site, not on an anti-Mason Web Site. We cannot conceive that the Louisiana Masonic Family Web Site would print a lie concerning their membership. We urge you to click on these Web addresses that we listed, above, to see this information for yourself. However, we have noticed that several official Masonic Web Sites that used to include Reverend Graham&#39;s name on their membership list have subsequently removed his name. Why would they do this? They undoubtedly took this action because of pressure from the Graham organization.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Therefore, we believe that this Louisiana Masonic Family Web Site might also remove his name from their membership once this news is reported. The only reason we can think of that this kind of pressure might be exerted is the Reverend Graham is not willing that others learn of his membership at this time. Perhaps he feels that Christians of his key constituencies would leave in droves should they learn that he is a Freemason.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In the next article, we shall examine the ramifications of this startling information that Reverend Billy Graham is a Freemason. But, now, we need to examine the things which the Graham organization has done over the years that caused Fundamental Christians to understand, with dismay, that he was moving toward apostasy.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Billy Graham&#39;s Rapid Change of Principles</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I. Billy Graham&#39;s Rapid Changes From His Original Crusade Policies</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is taken from &quot;Billy Graham&#39;s 23 years of Theological Change&quot; by Rev. Charles Emert, 1971.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A. Change Regarding The Apostate World Council of Churches 1. In 1948 Billy Graham was asked, &quot;What do you expect the WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES to do this August when they visit Copenhagen?&quot; He replied, &quot;I believe they are going to NOMINATE THE ANTICHRIST!&quot; [He certainly was against the WCC at that time!] 2. As Early As 1966 He boasted that he attended the WCC assembly in New Delhi in 1961, and he hoped he would attend the 4th assembly in Uppsala, Sweden in 1968 (which he did). He has attended all but two WCC assemblies ever since. This policy continues. Quite a CHANGE!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">B. Change Regarding Sponsorship by Various Councils of Churches 1. In 1952 Billy Graham wrote to Dr. John R. Rice, &quot;... we have NEVER been sponsored by the COUNCIL OF CHURCHES in any city except Shreveport and Greensboro ... both small towns where the majority of ministers are evangelical.&quot; 2. As Early As 1964 Billy Graham&#39;s Columbus, Ohio, crusade was sponsored by the modernistic Columbus area Council of Churches. This policy continues. Quite a CHANGE!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">C. Change Regarding Non-Fundamentalists In Authority or Responsibility 1. In 1955 Billy Graham said to Dr. John R. Rice: &quot;I will NEVER have anybody take a PLACE OF AUTHORITY or RESPONSIBILITY in my campaign who is not SOUND IN THE GREAT FUNDAMENTALS OF THE FAITH.&quot; 2. As Early As 1957 In the New York crusade, Billy Graham had Henry Pitt Van Dusen, President of Union Theological Seminary. take a place of responsibility and authority. U.S. News wrote that Van Dusen&#39;s school was &quot;one of the most LIBERAL and LEFT-WING schools in America.&quot; Yet for all this, they wrote that &quot;Dr. Van Dusen is considered by Graham as a GREAT RELIGIOUS LEADER.&quot; He [Billy Graham] has used other apostates such as Robert J. McCracken, Norman Vincent Peale, and others. This policy continues in his crusades. Quite a CHANGE!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">D. Change Regarding Separation From Those Who Reject Biblical Authority 1. In 1952 and 1958 Billy Graham, in time past made sound statements concerning false doctrine: a. In 1952, He wrote to Bob Jones, Sr., &quot;We have never had a man on our committee that denied the VIRGIN BIRTH, the VICARIOUS ATONEMENT, or the BODILY RESURRECTION.&quot; b. In 1958. He stated in Eternity Magazine: &quot;If a man blatantly denies the DEITY OF CHRIST or that Christ has come in the flesh, we are NOT TO EVEN BID HIM GODSPEED. Thus, the Scriptures teach that we are able to be SEPARATED FROM those who DENY THE DEITY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST ... I am to treat him as an ANTICHRIST and an ENEMY OF THE CROSS.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: We applaud this statement by Graham, as he certainly knows the Scritural teaching regarding the definition of what qualifies as Antichrist teaching, and the commandment to separate yourself and your organization from such teaching and from anyone who teaches such heresy. Therefore, we read, with heavy heart, the next revelation.] 2. As Early As 1963 He had United Methodist Bishop, Gerald B. Kennedy, as his Los Angeles Crusade Chairman. Kennedy wrote in one of his books: &quot;I believe that the testimony of the New Testament, taken as a whole, is AGAINST THE DOCTRINE OF THE DEITY OF JESUS ...&quot; This policy continues. Quite a CHANGE! [Cutting Edge Commentary: If Graham was including in his Crusades a man who publicly denied the Deity of Jesus Christ, as early as 1963, how is it that all Fundamentalist Christians continued to believe in him? The answer is that too many of us knew Graham only from his TV sermons, which contained no error. We assumed his organization would be similarly true to the Bible. We did not look behind the scenes to see the heresy beginning to creep in!]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">E. Change Regarding Encouraging &quot;Converts&quot; to go to Modernistic Churches 1. In 1950 Billy Graham&#39;s secretary, Jerry Bevan, wrote, &quot;Certainly, Dr. Graham does NOT encourage converts to go to Catholic or MODERNISTIC CHURCHES.&quot; 2. As Early As 1957 He sent ... 373 of his New York City decision cards to the apostate Marble Collegiate Church in that city. This trend continues in regard to apostate Protestant churches, Catholic churches, Jewish synagogues, and elsewhere. Quite a CHANGE! [Cutting Edge Commentary: The word &quot;apostate&quot; refers to someone or some organization that once stood for the Truth of the Gospel, but has subsequently abandoned this Truth and is now advocating other positions that are not Biblical Truth. Almost all Mainline Protestant denominations, such as the Methodist, Episcopalian, Congregationalist, to name just a few, at one time were very Fundamental and adopted the same stands we currently adopt. However, over the passage of time, these denominations have drifted away from strictly observing the Fundamental Doctrines and have begun to either compromise their beliefs or deny their previously held beliefs]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">F. Change Regarding Roman Catholicism: 1. In 1964 Billy Graham&#39;s aide, George Edstrom, wrote: &quot;Mr. Graham has NEVER PREACHED IN A CATHOLIC CHURCH, and he does NOT AGREE WITH THEM in the joining of ONE CHURCH. If you heard this, it is nothing but false rumors.&quot; 2. As Early As 1963 [Note that this date is one year earlier than this statement, above] In 1963, Mr. Graham had spoken at the Roman Catholic Belmont (NC) Abbey College. [Cutting Edge Commentary: Denying, in 1964, that Graham had spoken any Catholic Church, when he had, in fact, spoken at Belmont Abbey College the year earlier, does not this qualify as an bold faced lie?!] 3. In 1967 He again spoke at this college at the Institute for Ecumenical Dialogue, receiving his honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (D.H.L.) from them and saying that this was &quot;... a time when PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS could meet together and greet each other as BROTHERS, whereas ten years ago they could not.&quot; At the same time, he stated: &quot;The Gospel that built this school and the gospel that brings me here tonight is still the only way to salvation.&quot; This policy of pro-Roman Catholicism continues. Quite a CHANGE! [Cutting Edge Commentary: We find it almost inconceivable that Graham could equate the True Gospel of Salvation Through Grace ALONE, with the Roman Catholic False Gospel of Salvation through good works, through the Sacraments of the Church, through Baptism, through praying to dead saints, through praying the Rosary, through Indulgences, and through Penance. These vast differences are what caused Martin Luther to break with the Roman Catholic Church and to start the Protestant Movement. Did you know that the very word, Protestant, derived from the word, &quot;Protest&quot; against Rome? Have you forgotten, Mr. Graham, the 8,000,000 million Protestant martyrs at the hands of the Catholic Inquisition, from 1550-1850? When Graham is making these statements, and calling Catholics brothers, he is denying the collective martyrdom of all these valiant Christians who died at the hands of Rome.]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">[The Roman Catholic Church completely fulfills two prophecies. 1) John 16:2-3, &quot;yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.&quot; More than the Roman and Jewish persecutors during the day Jesus spoke these words, the Roman Catholic Church has fulfilled this prophecy. This is exactly what they were doing during the Inquisition, martyring Protestants and then claiming they were doing God service. And, Jesus nails the issue right on the head when He states that the people who do this do not know either the Father or Jesus. 2) Revelation 17:6, &quot;And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.&quot; This &quot;woman&quot; is the religious false harlot, whom Protestant Bible scholars have identified as the Roman Catholic Church for the past 200+ years. Certainly, Rome qualifies here, as well. Reverend Graham slighted every one of these 8,000,000 Christian martyrs when he equated the True Gospel with the Roman Catholic Church. But, if Graham is secretly a Freemason, we know how and why he can make this kind of statement. Remember this about a Freemason: he believes he is following a higher religious truth than is contained within any individual religious organization, including Christianity. Therefore, Graham can preach the Gospel with his lips while guiding his organization toward the Freemasonry ideal of the global Fraternity of Mankind, i.e., the New World Order Religion!! And, he can do this without suffering feelings of remorse and conscience!]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">G. Change Regarding Communism 1. In 1949 Billy Graham said: &quot;Communism is inspired, directed, and motivated, by the Devil himself.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: Graham spoke the Truth here; the question is, did he believe it then, or was he simply following the Dialectic Process at this point? In </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">NEWS1007</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;Thesis x Antithesis = Synthesis -- The Real Flow Of History&quot;, we showed that Freemasonry created Communism so as to provide the world with the needed Antithesis to battle Thesis to produce the Synthesis, which is the New World Order. Read this article carefully. The point is, if Billy Graham were a Mason above the 30th Degree, and he probably was, given his high position of World Evangelist, then he knew that Communism was a loyal ally in the &quot;struggle&quot; to achieve the Synthesis, the New World Order.] 2. As Early As 1959 In Christianity Today, it was reported: &quot;Without elaboration, the evangelist [Graham] said his thinking had undergone some CHANGES ... and he indicated that his attitude toward EASTERN EUROPE is more open.&quot; This policy continues. Quite a CHANGE! 3. In 1982 He visited the Moscow Peace Conference and said: &quot;I saw no evidence of religious persecution in Russia.&quot; This was in spite of his visit to the Siberian Pentecostals staying in the American Embassy. [Cutting Edge Commentary: This was the event which I saw with my own eyes, as I watched on TV, that caused me to begin to doubt Reverend Billy Graham. With my background in history and government, I knew that the Communist Russian Government strictly controlled what Graham saw in Russia, and I knew that the severe persecution of religion and the murder of many Christians, was one of the most well documented tragedies of the 20th Century. Therefore, for Graham to make this statement, I knew he had to either be terribly naive or misled, or that he had to be cooperating with the Communists. Further, I watched carefully over the next days, weeks, and months, to see if the Graham Evangelistic Organization issued a statement of clarification of Graham&#39;s ridiculous remarks, because many times, an official makes a silly remark off the cuff but his office is careful that everyone knows it was a mistake. No such clarification was ever issued. In 1982, I was a full 5 years away from understanding the first thing about the New World Order].</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">II. A SAMPLING OF OTHER UNSCRIPTURAL BELIEFS OR POLICIES OF BILLY GRAHAM A. Communism, Roman Catholicism, and Mohammedanism &quot;In 1948, he said: &#39;The three gravest menaces faced by Orthodox Christianity are Communism, Roman Catholicism, and Mohammedanism.&#39; In 1973, he said that Communist Mao Tse-Tung&#39;s eight precepts are basically the same as the Ten Commandments. In 1973, he praised the Roman Catholic mass as a &#39;very beautiful thing&#39;, and by 1978, he said Muhammed Ali&#39;s beliefs in Islam &#39;are something we all could believe&#39;.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: While this change in statements make no sense on the surface, and absolutely no sense to the Christian whose beliefs on key matters are based upon Eternal Scripture, these changes make absolute sense for a Freemason! A Freemason believes that all religions are equally valid, and it embraces all the &quot;Wisdom&quot; of all the Ancient Mystery Religions. Further, a Mason will look upon Communism as a loyal ally in the drive to create the Synthesis system known as the New World Order!! B. Infant Baptismal Regeneration and Billy Graham &quot;In 1961, Dr. Graham said this of infant baptism: &quot;I do believe that something happens at the baptism of an infant ... I believe that a miracle can happen in these children so that they are regenerated, that is, made Christian through infant baptism.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: Wow, Graham made this kind of heretical statement in 1961? Why did it take us Fundamentalists so long to realize that Graham was an apostate??!! We had on blinders, didn&#39;t we?]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">C. Apostate Leslie Weatherhead On Billy Graham&#39;s Platform In London &quot;In 1966, Dr. Graham said this of infant baptism: &#39;I remember during our London Crusade of 1954, I preached a sermon ... Dr. Leslie Weatherhead sat on the platform that evening and to my surprise commended my sermon.&#39; Dr. Weatherhead was a notorious blasphemer who wrote in his book, The Christian Agnostic, that the Lord Jesus Christ was born an illegitimate child, and that Mary was no virgin, but a temple prostitute.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: This heretical notion that Jesus Christ was born out of wedlock is a common New Age teaching. Some New Age authors have even gone so far as to say that the father was a Roman soldier, and some even say that the soldier was of German descent! I guess the question to ask about this situation, was, why did Graham allow Dr. Weatherhead to even sit on the platform, if Weatherhead was so blatantly a heretic? A speaker allows only dignitaries with whom he agrees to sit on the platform while he is speaking. Just sitting on the platform with Graham signifies that Graham was conferring honor and acceptance on Weatherhead!]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">D. Billy Graham Doesn&#39;t Think The Heathen Are Lost &quot;In 1978, McCall&#39;s Magazine reported Dr. Graham&#39;s &#39;updated&#39; understanding of the way of salvation. &#39;I used to think that pagans in far-off countries were lost -- were going to hell -- if they did not have the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them. I NO LONGER BELIEVE THAT ... I believe there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God -- through nature, for instance -- and plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying yes to God.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: While the Apostle Paul did say, in Romans 1:18-20, that all men have a basic knowledge of God&#39;s existence implanted in their inner consciences, and they can see evidences of God&#39;s existence in nature, Paul is saying all this in connection with the concept that, because of these things, all men are without excuse before God on Judgment Day. Paul&#39;s exact words were, &quot;... so that they are without excuse&quot;. Paul never, ever, said that the pagans do not need the Gospel to be saved, as Graham here is saying. In fact, Paul boldly states just the opposite, in Romans 10:14-15, &quot; How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!&quot; How can the pagans, Paul asks, be saved without a preacher being sent to preach the Gospel to them? Dr. Graham was clearly wrong here; why didn&#39;t we get wise then?]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">E. Billy Graham -- Now Works With Everyone &quot;Once a self-confessed &#39;Bible fundamentalist and separatist&#39;, today Dr. Graham freely associates and fraternizes with &#39;anyone under any label&#39; -- liberal, modernist, charismatic, Catholic. We are not surprised that Dr. Graham is now a friend of the World Council of Churches and the Roman Catholic Church ... In his crusades, Dr. Graham has established a global pattern of cooperative, ecumenical evangelism, allowing liberals, modernists, evangelicals, charismatic, and Roman Catholics to work together, thus accelerating the pace of ecumenical union.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: My beloved Mother was a fervent Graham supporter, and believed that I was totally off base in my complaints. However, in 1994, just months before she died, she called me one night, crying. She said, &quot;David, you were right about Billy Graham being an apostate! I have just been watching his crusade and I was upset from the beginning by seeing Roman Catholic nuns and priests on his platform, sitting behind him. When he gave his standard invitation to come down to accept Jesus Christ as Savior, he then said, &#39;And if you are Roman Catholic, I want you to come down to renew your vows.&#39; &quot; Mom well knew that there is no salvation within Roman Catholic doctrine, and from that moment on stayed completely away from any association with Billy Graham and his organization. But, Dr. Graham has always been ecumenical, because his crusades have always encouraged the advance support work from all Protestant churches in the area in which he is going to have his crusade! And, he has sent follow-up cards to all Protestant churches after his crusade. Lately, he has been including the Roman Catholic Church in this effort. Therefore, Dr. Graham has always promoted Ecumenicism.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Ecumenical Movement seeks to unite all churches of all denominations, even though many of these churches hold different doctrines, some them of very important doctrines. Basically, these churches unite, &quot;agreeing to disagree&quot; on doctrinal matters, emphasizing matters on which they can agree. Therefore, churches who believe in the Deity of Jesus Christ and Salvation only through him, are uniting with churches who deny these doctrines! This is the Ecumenical Movement today! These churches are ignoring Jesus&#39; commandments to &quot;Come out of her [the false system], my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.&quot; Or, they have forgotten Paul&#39;s warning of associating with non-believers, &quot;Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?&quot; Truly, when a church who holds to the traditional doctrines of the Christian faith, joins with a church who denies some or much of this faith, that church is being &quot;unequally yoked&quot; with an infidel organization, an organization of &quot;Belial&quot;, who is equated with Satan or Antichrist! -- Holman Bible Dictionary Online --</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Furthermore, New Age authors make no bones about the fact that they see the Ecumenical Movement as being the main tool to bring Christian churches into the planned global New World Order Religion. Listen to the way in which Master D.K. describes the planned Ecumenical Movement, speaking through Alice Bailey, in the book, &quot;The Externalisation of the Hierarchy&quot;. &quot;Eventually, there will appear the Church Universal, and its definite outlines will appear towards the end of this century. This Church will be nurtured into activity by the Christ and His disciples ... when the true second coming has been accomplished. No date for the advent do I set, but the time will not be long. The Christian church, in its many branches, can serve as a St. John the Baptist, as a voice crying in the wilderness, and as a nucleus through which world illumination may be accomplished ... Its work is intended to be the holding of a broad platform. The church must show a wide tolerance, and teach no revolutionary doctrines or cling to any reactionary ideas ... The prime work of the church is to teach, and teach ceaselessly, preserving the outer appearance in order to reach the many who are accustomed to church usages ... the sacraments must be mystically interpreted ...&quot; -- Page 510-511.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Did you fully understand what the demon, Master D.K., has just revealed? Eventually, the global church of the Christ -- Antichrist -- , which he has called the Church Universal, will arise toward the &quot;end of this century&quot;. But, first, the Christian Church must serve as a preparatory force to change the old, &quot;reactionary&quot; church, which has promoted &quot;revolutionary doctrines&quot; into a new, combined church which holds forth a &quot;broad platform&quot; that shows a &quot;wide tolerance&quot;. However, while this change is going on, the Christian Churches must &quot;preserve their outer appearance&quot; in order to deceive those who need to still believe they are serving Jesus Christ!! Does this not fully explain the current Ecumenical Movement? It holds forth a &quot;broad platform&quot; and shows a &quot;wide tolerance&quot; while still pretending to be Christian! And, as Master D.K. so eloquently states, the ultimate aim is to produce the Church Universal of the Christ -- Antichrist.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This section, quoted above, makes me think of several Scriptures which speak directly to this terrible situation facing us today, embodied in the Ecumenical Movement. 1) Jesus warns, in Matthew 7:13-14, &quot;Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life ...&quot; The &quot;broad&quot; way which Jesus stated leads to Hell is the same &quot;broad platform&quot; of which Master D.K. speaks, above. This &quot;broad&quot; road means that anyone can believe and practice anything, and still will think it will lead them to Heaven. This is precisely the belief of the Freemasons, of which Billy Graham is a part. They believe that all religions are equally valid, and that all roads lead to Heaven. The main enemy is the Fundamentalist Christian who insists upon following the &quot;narrow way&quot; that leads to eternal life! 2) Jesus warned that, in the Last Days, religious deception would be unparalleled. a) Matthew 24:4, &quot;Take heed that no man deceive you.&quot; b) Matthew 24:10, &quot;And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.&quot; Isn&#39;t this precisely the effect which the Ecumenical Movement has had upon the Christian Church? Beginning in 1910, when the National Council of Churches was founded, many &quot;religious leaders&quot; became offended at the simple, profound, and miraculous Truth of the Gospel, and they began to hatefully attack those leaders who held to these Truths. But, these &quot;false prophets&quot; persisted, and have led many away from the Gospel, deceiving them tremendously. They have paved the way for the coming Antichrist, just as John the Baptist paved the way for Jesus Christ. Master D.K. knew whereof he spoke. c) Matthew 24:24, &quot;For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&quot; This deception would become more clever and more persuasive, until the only ones who are NOT deceived are those who are the Elect of God, those who are truly Born Again! We are at this point right now!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Finally, did you notice Master D.K.&#39;s assertion that the &quot;sacraments must be mystically interpreted&quot;? When he is speaking of the &quot;sacraments&quot; he is including the whole of Scripture, as well. Thus it is that the entire Bible has been &quot;mystically interpreted&quot;. Go into any New Age bookstore and you will discover books about Jesus&#39; &quot;Lost Years&quot;, or about His &quot;Secret Teachings&quot;, or about the revelations of the &quot;Akashic record&quot;. These are all systematic efforts to &quot;mystically&quot; reinterpret Scripture, so the New Ager now has a mystical answer for every valid doctrine of Scripture. This is unparalleled deception, and its very existence is proof we are living in the Last Days.]</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">F. Billy Graham -- Enthusiastic Friend of Rome &quot;Dr. Graham is an ardent admirer and supporter of the Pope with whom he has regular and warm liaison ... On another occasion, he said that he believed the Pope to be &#39;God&#39;s instrument for revival in our generation&#39; ... It is now &#39;normal&#39; for Roman Catholic nuns and priests to support Billy Graham Crusades by training counsellors for, and being personally involved in, the crusades.&quot; [Cutting Edge Commentary: In </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">NEWS1052</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, &quot;Seminar Notes: House of Theosophy, 8/18/91&quot;, we reveal that the New World Order Plan has chosen the Roman Catholic Pope to be its head religious leader of the Church Universal of Antichrist! This leadership post places the Roman Catholic Pope as the False Prophet of Revelation 13:11-18. And naming the Pope to this position is consistent with the prophecy of Revelation 13:11 that he will have &quot;two horns like a lamb&quot;, meaning that he will present himself to a believing world as a Christian leader. Most non-Fundamentalist people today believe the Pope is a Christian. Billy Graham certainly aids and abets this false perception, doesn&#39;t he? Therefore, Billy Graham is helping Revelation 13:11 to be literally fulfilled, isn&#39;t he? And, if Graham is aiding the False Prophet, then his activities are aiding Antichrist, as well.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">G. Billy Graham&#39;s &quot;Converts&quot; Sent Back To Their Unbiblical Churches &quot; &#39;Converts at Billy Graham Crusades are sent to &#39;churches of their choice&#39; without any sort of spiritual distinction. This results in their being sent to liberal-modernist churches, as well as Roman Catholic churches; newborn babes are being fed with DOCTRINAL POISON.&quot; Another Fundamentalist author, E.L. Bynum, states in his pamphlet, &quot;Why We Cannot Support The Billy Graham Crusade&quot;: &quot;But as a matter of conscience, we cannot endorse the ministry of Billy Graham, nor can we cooperate in a Billy Graham Crusade. Our reasons are based upon the World of God!! We cannot remain silent when this ministry of compromise is being used to destroy the very foundations of the Christian faith. There is a reason why apostates and carnal religious leaders are so enthusiastic about their support of Billy Graham. Billy Graham is pumping warm blood into the dead ecumenical movement and helping to build the coming one world church. When the ecumenical liberals hit a snag in bringing about organic union of the denominations, they saw in Billy Graham an opportunity to break down the stubborn bars of separation, through the medium of evangelism. It is working quite well for them.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I had never thought of the fact that Billy Graham began his popular evangelistic ministry at just the time when the liberal churches were beginning to lose so many members that they were afraid of going out of existence. Graham&#39;s ministry has truly infused new lifeblood into these dying liberal churches.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At this point, we must reiterate that we do not find much fault with what Billy Graham SAYS during his sermons. He does preach the True Gospel message, and we are sure that many, many people have been truly saved during his Crusades. However, we do find much to fault him for the liberal, modernistic, and apostate people and organizations with which he constantly associates and supports. And, when his organization sends a brand new baby Christian to one of these apostate churches for follow-up training, that baby Christian will certainly be quickly turned into a good New World Order Christian, quite capable of supporting Antichrist when he arises!!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The fact that we now have been told by the Louisiana Masonic Family that Billy Graham is a Freemason, we see yet another sign that the End of the Age is upon us. Graham is possibly a counterfeit Christian, probably the best ever. Does he not know that he is fulfilling the Biblical prophecies of unparalleled religious deception, deception so good that even the Elect would be deceived were it not for the power of the Holy Spirit revealing the Truth to the true believers? We need to really pray for Billy Graham and everyone in his organization!!</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">* This information taken from &quot;Billy Graham&#39;s Repaid Change of Principles&quot;, by Rev.
