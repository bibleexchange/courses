		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This man, undoubtedly the greatest of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> divines, and perhaps, after <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02084a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">St. Augustine</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, the most perseveringly followed by his disciples of any Western writer on theology, was born at Noyon in Picardy, France, 10 July, 1509, and died at Geneva, 27 May, 1564. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A generation divided him from <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Luther</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, whom he never met. By birth, education, and temper these two protagonists of the reforming movement were strongly contrasted. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Luther</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> was a Saxon peasant, his father a miner; Calvin sprang from the French middle-class, and his father, an attorney, had purchased the freedom of the City of Noyon, where he practised civil and canon law. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Luther</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> entered the Order of Augustinian Hermits, took a monk&#39;s vows, was made a priest and incurred much odium by marrying a nun. Calvin never was ordained in the Catholic Church; his training was chiefly in law and the humanities; he took no vows. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Luther&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> eloquence made him popular by its force, humour, rudeness, and vulgar style. Calvin spoke to the learned at all times, even when preaching before multitudes. His manner is classical; he reasons on system; he has little humour; instead of striking with a cudgel he uses the weapons of a deadly logic and persuades by a teacher&#39;s authority, not by a demagogue&#39;s calling of names. He writes French as well as <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Luther</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> writes German, and like him has been reckoned a pioneer in the modern development of his native tongue. Lastly, if we term the doctor of Wittenberg a mystic, we may sum up Calvin as a scholastic; he gives articulate expression to the principles which <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Luther</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> had stormily thrown out upon the world in his vehement pamphleteering; and the &quot;Institutes&quot; as they were left by their author have remained ever since the standard of orthodox <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> belief in all the Churches known as <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12710a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">&quot;Reformed.&quot;</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> His French disciples called their sect &quot;the religion&quot;; such it has proved to be outside the Roman world. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The family name, spelt in many ways, was Cauvin latinized according to the custom of the age as Calvinus. For some unknown reason the Reformer is commonly called Ma&icirc;tre Jean C. His mother, Jeanne Le Franc, born in the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03209c.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Diocese of Cambrai</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, is mentioned as &quot;beautiful and devout&quot;; she took her little son to various shrines and brought him up a good Catholic. On the father&#39;s side, his ancestors were seafaring men. His grandfather settled at Pont l&#39;Ev&ecirc;que near Paris, and had two sons who became locksmiths; the third was Gerard, who turned procurator at Noyon, and there his four sons and two daughters saw the light. He lived in the Place au Bl&eacute; (Cornmarket). Noyon, a bishop&#39;s see, had long been a fief of the powerful old family of Hangest, who treated it as their personal property. But an everlasting quarrel, in which the city took part, went on between the bishop and the chapter. Charles de Hangest, nephew of the too well-known Georges d&#39;Amboise, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01691a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Archbishop</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of Rouen, surrendered the bishopric in 1525 to his own nephew John, becoming his vicar-general. John kept up the battle with his canons until the Parliament of Paris intervened, upon which he went to Rome, and at last died in Paris in 1577. This prelate had <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> kinsfolk; he is charged with having fostered heresy which in those years was beginning to raise its head among the French. Clerical dissensions, at all events, allowed the new doctrines a promising field; and the Calvins were more or less infected by them before 1530. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gerard&#39;s four sons were made clerics and held <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02473c.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">benefices</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> at a tender age. The Reformer was given one when a boy of twelve, he became Cur&eacute; of Saint-Martin de Marteville in the Vermandois in 1527, and of Pont l&#39;Eveque in 1529. Three of the boys attended the local Coll&egrave;ge des Capettes, and there John proved himself an apt scholar. But his people were intimate with greater folk, the de Montmor, a branch of the line of Hangest, which led to his accompanying some of their children to Paris in 1523, when his mother was probably dead and his father had married again. The latter died in 1531, under <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05678a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">excommunication</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> from the chapter for not sending in his accounts. The old man&#39;s illness, not his lack of honesty, was, we are told, the cause. Yet his son Charles, nettled by the censure, drew towards the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> doctrines. He was accused in 1534 of denying the Catholic dogma of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05572c.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Eucharist</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and died out of the Church in 1536; his body was publicly gibbeted as that of a recusant. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Meanwhile, young John was going through his own trials at the University of Paris, the dean or syndic of which, Noel B&eacute;dier, had stood up against <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05510b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Erasmus</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and bore hard upon <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09114b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Le F&egrave;vre d&#39;Etaples</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (Stapulensis), celebrated for his translation of the Bible into French. Calvin, a &quot;martinet&quot;, or oppidan, in the Coll&egrave;ege de la Marche, made this man&#39;s acquaintance (he was from Picardy) and may have glanced into his Latin commentary on St. Paul, dated 1512, which Doumergue considers the first <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> book emanating from a French pen. Another influence tending the same way was that of Corderius, Calvin&#39;s tutor, to whom he dedicated afterwards his annotation of I Thessalonians, remarking, &quot;if there be any good thing in what I have published, I owe it to you&quot;. Corderius had an excellent Latin style, his life was austere, and his &quot;Colloquies&quot; earned him enduring fame. But he fell under suspicion of heresy, and by Calvin&#39;s aid took refuge in Geneva, where he died September 1564. A third herald of the &quot;New Learning&quot; was George Cop, physician to <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06207a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Francis I</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, in whose house Calvin found a welcome and gave ear to the religious discussions which Cop favoured. And a fourth was Pierre-Robert d&#39;Olivet of Noyon, who also translated the Scriptures, our youthful man of letters, his nephew, writing (in 1535) a Latin preface to the Old Testament and a French one -- his first appearance as a native author -- to the New Testament. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">By 1527, when no more than eighteen, Calvin&#39;s educatlon was complete in its main lines. He had learned to be a humanist and a reformer. The &quot;sudden conversion&quot; to a spiritual life in 1529, of which he speaks, must not be taken quite literally. He had never been an ardent Catholic; but the stories told at one time of his ill-regulated conduct have no foundation; and by a very natural process he went over to the side on which his family were taking their stand. In 1528 he inscribed himself at Orl&eacute;ans as a law student, made friends with Francis Daniel, and then went for a year to Bourges, where he began preaching in private. Margaret d&#39;Angoul&ecirc;me, sister of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06207a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Francis I</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and Duchess of Berry, was living there with many heterodox Germans about her. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">He is found again at Paris in 1531. Wolmar had taught him Greek at Bourges; from Vatable he learned Hebrew; and he entertained some relations with the erudite Budaeus. About this date he printed a commentary on Seneca&#39;s &quot;De Clementi&acirc;&quot;. It was merely an exercise in scholarship, having no political significance. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06207a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Francis I</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> was, indeed, handling <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestants</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> severely, and Calvin, now Doctor of Law at Orl&eacute;ans, composed, so the story runs, an oration on <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Christian</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> philosophy which Nicholas Cop delivered on All Saints&#39; Day, 1532, both writer and speaker having to take instant flight from pursuit by the royal inquisitors. This legend has been rejected by modern critics. Calvin spent some time, however, with Canon du Tillet at Angoul&ecirc;me under a feigned designation. In May, 1534, he went to Noyon, gave up his <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02473c.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">benefice</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and, it is said, was imprisoned. But he got away to Nerac in Bearn, the residence of the Duchess Margaret, and there again encountered Le F&egrave;vre, whose French Bible had been condemned by the Sorbonne to the flames. His next visit to Paris fell out during a violent campaign of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Lutherans</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> against the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10006a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Mass</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, which brought on reprisals, Etienne de la Forge and others were burnt in the Place de Gr&egrave;ve; and Calvin accompanied by du Tillet, escaped -- though not without adventures -- to Metz and Strasburg. In the latter city Bucer reigned supreme. The leading reformers dictated laws from the pulpit to their adherents, and this journey proved a decisive one for the French humanist, who, though by nature timid and shy, committed himself to a war on paper with his own sovereign. The famous letter to <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06207a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Francis I</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is dated 23 August, 1535. It served as a prologue to the &quot;Institutes&quot;, of which the first edition came out in March, 1536, not in French but in Latin. Calvin&#39;s apology for lecturing the king was, that placards denouncing the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestants</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> as rebels had been posted up all over the realm. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06207a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Francis I</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> did not read these pages, but if he had done so he would have discovered in them a plea, not for toleration, which the Reformer utterly scorned, but for doing away with Catholicism in favour of the new gospel. There could be only one true Church, said the young theologian, therefore kings ought to make an utter end of popery. (For an account of the &quot;Institutes&quot; see <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03198a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">C</span><span class="cs7960FE30">ALVINISM.</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) The second edition belongs to 1539, the first French translation to 1541; the final Latin, as revised by its author, is of 1559; but that in common use, dated 1560, has additions by his disciples. &quot;It was more <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">God&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> work than mine&quot;, said Calvin, who took for his motto </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Omnia ad Dei gloriam&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and in allusion to the change he had undergone in 1529 assumed for his device a hand stretched out from a burning heart. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A much disputed chapter in Calvin&#39;s biography is the visit which he was long thought to have paid at Ferraro to the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Duchess Ren&eacute;e, daughter of Louis XII. Many stories clustered about his journey, now given up by the best-informed writers. All we know for certain is that the Reformer, after settling his family affairs and bringing over two of his brothers and sisters to the views he had adopted undertook, in consequence of the war between <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03625a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Charles V</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06207a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Francis I</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, to reach Bale by way of Geneva, in July, 1536. At Geneva the Swiss preacher Fare, then looking for help in his propaganda, besought him with such vehemence to stay and teach theology that, as Calvin himself relates, he was terrified into submission. We are not accustomed to fancy the austere prophet so easily frightened. But as a student and recluse new to public responsibilities, he may well have hesitated before plunging into the troubled waters of Geneva, then at their stormiest period. No portrait of him belonging to this time is extant. Later he is represented as of middle height, with bent shoulders, piercing eyes, and a large forehead; his hair was of an auburn tinge. Study and fasting occasioned the severe headaches from which he suffered continually. In private life he was cheerful but sensitive, not to say overbearing, his friends treated him with delicate consideration. His habits were simple; he cared nothing for wealth, and he never allowed himself a holiday. His correspondence, of which 4271 letters remain, turns chiefly on doctrinal subjects. Yet his strong, reserved character told on all with whom he came in contact; Geneva submitted to his theocratic rule, and the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12710a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Reformed Churches</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> accepted his teaching as though it were <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07790a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">infallible</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Such was the stranger whom Farel recommended to his fellow <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestants</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, &quot;this Frenchman&quot;, chosen to lecture on the Bible in a city divided against itself. Geneva had about 15,000 inhabitants. Its bishop had long been its prince limited, however, by popular privileges. The vidomne, or mayor, was the Count of Savoy, and to his family the bishopric seemed a property which, from 1450, they bestowed on their younger children. John of Savoy, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07650a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">illegitimate</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> son of the previous bishop, sold his rights to the duke, who was head of the clan, and died in 1519 at Pignerol. Jean de la Baume, last of its ecclesiastical princes, abandoned the city, which received <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> teachers from Berne in 1519 and from Fribourg in 1526. In 1527 the arms of Savoy were torn down; in 1530 the Catholic party underwent defeat, and Geneva became independent. It had two councils, but the final verdict on public measures rested with the people. These appointed Farel, a convert of Le Fevre, as their preacher in 1534. A discussion between the two Churches from 30 May to 24 June, 1535 ended in victory for the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestants</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The altars were desecrated, the sacred images broken, the Mass done away with. Bernese troops entered and &quot;the Gospel&quot; was accepted, 21 May, 1536. This implied persecution of Catholics by the councils which acted both as Church and State. Priests were thrown into prison; citizens were fined for not attending sermons. At Z&uuml;rich, Basle, and Berne the same laws were established. Toleration did not enter into the ideas of the time. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But though Calvin had not introduced this legislation, it was mainly by his influence that in January, 1537 the &quot;articles&quot; were voted which insisted on communion four times a year, set spies on delinquents, established a moral censorship, and punished the unruly with <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05678a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">excommunication</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. There was to be a children&#39;s catechism, which he drew up; it ranks among his best writings. The city now broke into &quot;jurants&quot; and &quot;nonjurors&quot; for many would not swear to the &quot;articles&quot;; indeed, they never were completely accepted. Questions had arisen with Berne touching points that Calvin judged to be indifferent. He made a figure in the debates at Lausanne defending the freedom of Geneva. But disorders ensued at home, where recusancy was yet rife; in 1538 the council exiled Farel, Calvin, and the blind evangelist, Couraud. The Reformer went to Strasburg, became the guest of Capito and Bucer, and in 1539 was explaining the New Testament to French refugees at fifty two florins a year. Cardinal Sadolet had addressed an open letter to the Genevans, which their exile now answered. Sadolet urged that schism was a crime; Calvin replied that the Roman Church was corrupt. He gained applause by his keen debating powers at Hagenau, Worms, and Ratisbon. But he complains of his poverty and ill-health, which did not prevent him from marrying at this time Idelette de Bure, the widow of an Anabaptist whom he had converted. Nothing more is known of this lady, except that she brought him a son who died almost at birth in 1542, and that her own death took place in 1549. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After some negotiation Ami Perrin, commissioner for Geneva, persuaded Calvin to return. He did so, not very willingly, on 13 September, 1541. His entry was modest enough. The church constitution now recognized &quot;pastors, doctors, elders, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04647c.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">deacons</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot; but supreme power was given to the magistrate. Ministers had the spiritual weapon of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">God&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> word; the consistory never, as such, wielded the secular arm Preachers, led by Calvin, and the councils, instigated by his opponents, came frequently into collision. Yet the ordinances of 1541 were maintained; the clergy, assisted by lay elders, governed despotically and in detail the actions of every citizen. A presbyterian Sparta might be seen at Geneva; it set an example to later Puritans, who did all in their power to imitate its discipline. The pattern held up was that of the Old Testament, although <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Christians</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> were supposed to enjoy Gospel liberty. In November, 1552, the Council declared that Calvin&#39;s &quot;Institutes&quot; were a &quot;holy doctrine which no man might speak against.&quot; Thus the State issued dogmatic decrees, the force of which had been anticipated earlier, as when Jacques Gouet was imprisoned on charges of impiety in June, 1547, and after severe torture was beheaded in July. Some of the accusations brought against the unhappy young man were frivolous, others doubtful. What share, if any, Calvin took in this judgment is not easy to ascertain. The execution of however must be laid at his door; it has given greater offence by far than the banishment of Castellio or the penalties inflicted on Bolsec -- moderate men opposed to extreme views in discipline and doctrine, who fell under suspicion as reactionary. The Reformer did not shrink from his self-appointed task. Within five years fifty-eight sentences of death and seventy-six of exile, besides numerous committals of the most eminent citizens to prison, took place in Geneva. The iron yoke could not be shaken off. In 1555, under Ami Perrin, a sort of revolt was attempted. No blood was shed, but Perrin lost the day, and Calvin&#39;s theocracy triumphed. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;I am more deeply <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13506d.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">scandalized</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;, wrote Gibbon &quot;at the single execution of Servetus than at the hecatombs which have blazed in the autos-da-f&eacute; of Spain and Portugal&quot;. He ascribes the enmity of Calvin to personal malice and perhaps envy. The facts of the case are pretty well ascertained. Born in 1511, perhaps at Tudela, Michael Served y Reves studied at Toulouse and was present in Bologna at the coronation of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03625a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Charles V</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. He travelled in Germany and brought out in 1531 at Hagenau his treatise &quot;De Trinitatis Erroribus&quot;, a strong Unitarian work which made much commotion among the more orthodox Reformers. He met Calvin and disputed with him at Paris in 1534, became corrector of the press at Lyons; gave attention to medicine, discovered the lesser circulation of the blood, and entered into a fatal correspondence with the dictator of Geneva touching a new volume &quot;Christianismi Restitutio,&quot; which he intended to publish. In 1546 the exchange of letters ceased. The Reformer called Servetus arrogant (he had dared to criticize the &quot;Institutes&quot; in marginal glosses), and uttered the significant menace, &quot;If he comes here and I have any authority, I will never let him leave the place alive.&quot; The &quot;Restitutio&quot; appeared in 1553. Calvin at once had its author delated to the Dominican inquisitor Ory at Lyons, sending on to him the man&#39;s letters of 1545-46 and these glosses. Hereupon the Spaniard was imprisoned at Vienne, but he escaped by friendly connivance, and was burnt there only in effigy. Some extraordinary fascination drew him to Geneva, from which he intended to pass the Alps. He arrived on 13 August, 1553. The next day Calvin, who had remarked him at the sermon, got his critic arrested, the preacher&#39;s own secretary coming forward to accuse him. Calvin drew up forty articles of charge under three heads, concerning the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06612a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">nature of God</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, infant baptism, and the attack which Servetus had ventured on his own teaching. The council hesitated before taking a deadly decision, but the dictator, reinforced by Farel, drove them on. In prison the culprit suffered much and loudly complained. The Bernese and other Swiss voted for some indefinite penalty. But to Calvin his power in Geneva seemed lost, while the stigma of heresy; as he insisted, would cling to all <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestants</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> if this innovator were not put to death. &quot;Let the world see&quot; Bullinger counselled him, &quot;that Geneva wills the glory of Christ.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Accordingly, sentence was pronounced 26 October, 1553, of burning at the stake. &quot;Tomorrow he dies,&quot; wrote Calvin to Farel. When the deed was done, the Reformer alleged that he had been anxious to mitigate the punishment, but of this fact no record appears in the documents. He disputed with Servetus on the day of execution and saw the end. A defence and apology next year received the adhesion of the Genevan ministers. Melanchthon, who had taken deep umbrage at the blasphemies of the Spanish Unitarian, strongly approved in well-known words. But a group that included Castellio published at Basle in 1554 a pamphlet with the title, &quot;Should heretics be persecuted?&quot; It is considered the first plea for toleration in modern times. Beza replied by an argument for the affirmative, couched in violent terms; and Calvin, whose favorite disciple he was, translated it into French in 1559. The dialogue, &quot;Vaticanus&quot;, written against the &quot;Pope of Geneva&quot; by Castellio, did not get into print until 1612. Freedom of opinion, as Gibbon remarks, &quot;was the consequence rather than the design of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12700b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Reformation</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another victim to his fiery zeal was Gentile, one of an Italian sect in Geneva, which also numbered among its adherents Alciati and Gribaldo. As more or less Unitarian in their views, they were required to sign a confession drawn up by Calvin in 1558. Gentile subscribed it reluctantly, but in the upshot he was condemned and imprisoned as a perjurer. He escaped only to be twice incarcerated at Berne, where in 1566, he was beheaded. Calvin&#39;s impassioned polemic against these Italians betrays fear of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14113a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Socinianism</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> which was to lay waste his vineyard. Politically he leaned on the French refugees, now abounding in the city, and more than equal in energy -- if not in numbers -- to the older native factions. Opposition died out. His continual preaching, represented by 2300 sermons extant in the manuscripts and a vast correspondence, gave to the Reformer an influence without example in his closing years. He wrote to Edward VI, helped in revising the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02678c.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Book of Common Prayer</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and intervened between the rival English parties abroad during the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09766a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Marian</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> period.

His censure of the conspiracy of Amboise in 1560 does him honour. One great literary institution founded by him, the College, afterwards the University, of Geneva, flourished exceedingly. The students were mostly French. When Beza was rector it had nearly 1500 students of various grades. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Geneva now sent out pastors to the French congregations and was looked upon as the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Protestant</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Rome.

The Puritans in England were also descendants of the French theologian. His dislike of theatres, dancing and the amenities of society was fully shared by them. The town on Lake Leman was described as without crime and destitute of amusements. Calvin declaimed against the &quot;Libertines&quot;, but there is no evidence that any such people had a footing inside its walls The cold, hard, but upright disposition characteristic of the <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12710a.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Reformed Churches</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, less genial than that derived from <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438b.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Luther</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, is due entirely to their founder himself.

A. Froude, &quot;moral sins were treated as crimes to be punished by the magistrate.&quot; The Bible was a code of law, administered by the clergy. Down to his dying day Calvin preached and taught. By no means an aged man, he was worn out in these frequent controversies. On 25 April, 1564, he made his will, leaving 225 French crowns, of which he bequeathed ten to his college, ten to the poor, and the remainder to his nephews and nieces. His last letter was addressed to Farel. He was buried without pomp, in a spot which is not now ascertainable. In the year 1900 a monument of expiation was erected to Servetus in the Place Champel.
