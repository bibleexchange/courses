			<span class="cs6971AFD4">Information on Secret Mark</span></h2>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In 1958, Morton Smith found a letter of Clement of Alexandria at the Mar Saba monastary near the city of Jerusalem. The Secret Gospel of Mark is known only from the references in this letter.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Although there has been some controversy over the letter, today it is generally agreed that the letter is authentic correspondence written by Clement. In his introduction in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Complete Gospels</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, Stephen Patterson notes: &quot;The handwriting can be dated to around 1750. Smith published the letter in 1973. Early discussion of it was marred by accusations of forgery and fraud, no doubt owing in part to its controversial comments. Today, however, there is almost unanimous agreement among Clementine scholars that the letter is authentic.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Stephen Patterson gives this account of the passages noted by Clement: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csB42E70E1">The first passage is a story of how Jesus miraculously raises a young man (</span><span class="cs7B9ACCE5">neaniskos</span><span class="csB42E70E1">) who has recently died, at the behest of his bereaved sister. According to Clement, the story was added to Mark between verses 10:34 and 10:35. The story bears a striking resemblance to the raising of Lazarus in the Gospel of John (John 11:1-44). However, since it shows none of the typical marks of Johannine redaction which so strongly color the story about Lazarus, it is unlikely that the Secret Mark story is directly dependent upon its Johannine parallel. For its part, the version of the story from Secret Mark has its own peculiarities not found in John, such as the initiation of the young man into the &quot;mystery of God&#39;s domain.&quot; The basic story, however, probably derives from the common stock of miracle stories available to both Mark and John, or their sources.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csB42E70E1">The second fragment is extremely brief, but nonetheless interesting. First, it mentions Salome, who appears in the New Testament elsewhere only in Mark (see 15:40; 16:1). Secondly, when placed in the slot where Clement indicates it occurs in Secret Mark (between 10:46a: &quot;Then they came to Jericho,&quot; and 10:46b: &quot;As he was leaving Jericho...&quot;) it fills a well-known hole in the Markan narrative. The stop in Jericho now seems, in light of the Secret Gospel, at least a little less futile.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is debate over the relationship between Secret Mark and canonical Mark: was Clement correct to regard Secret Mark as an expansion of canonical Mark? F. F. Bruce writes, &quot;The &#39;secret&#39; character of the additional sayings is the most obvious Gnosticizing feature. . . . [Clement and contemporaries] were willing to treat acceptable expansions as belonging to a second edition produced by Mark after his alleged coming from Rome to Alexandria, but those expansions which were manifestly Gnostic were ascribed to the school of Carpocrates.&quot; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, p. 165-166) Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz state (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Historical Jesus</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, p. 47): &quot;the majority of exegetes regard the Secret Gospel as a Gnostic revision of the canonical Mark composed in the second century. This is supported by an emphasis on its &#39;secret&#39; character and its use in Carpocratian circles, which evidently employed it to legitimate particular liturgical customs. Merkel explains the linguistic form of the pericope as a retelling of John 11 which borrows language from all four Gospels.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">On the other hand, Helmut Koester and J.D. Crossan think that canonical Mark is derived from Secret Mark by elimination of these passages. Helmut Koester writes: &quot;It is immediately evident that this story shows many similarities with the story of the raising of Lazarus in John 11. That it is, in fact, the same story is evident in the emphasis upon the love between Jesus and the man who was raised by him (cf. John 11:3, 5, 35-36), expressed twice in the additions of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Secret Mark</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Both stories are also located in Bethany. But it is impossible that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Secret Mark</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is dependent upon John 11. In its version of the story, there are no traces of the rather extensive Johannine redaction (proper names, motif of the delay of Jesus&#39; travel, measurement of space and time, discourses of Jesus with his disciples and with Martha and Mary). As to its form, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Secret Mark</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> represents a stage of development of the story that corresponds to the source used by John. The author evidently still had access to the free tradition of stories about Jesus, or perhaps to some older written collection of miracle stories.&quot; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Ancient Christian Gospels</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, p. 296) Another interesting point is that Salome is named without explanation in canonical Mark 15:40, 16:1. Clement of Alexandria quotes a reference from the Secret Gospel of Mark to &quot;his mother and Salome,&quot; which may indicate the existence of stories including Salome in pre-canonical Mark.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Then there is the question of the relationship of Secret Mark to the original Gospel of Mark: was Secret Mark the original gospel, or was Secret Mark an expansion of the original gospel of Mark? Koester believes that Secret Mark is an expansion of the original Mark, and this makes for at least three different editions of Mark: original Mark, Secret Mark, and canonical Mark. In </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Other Gospels</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, Ron Cameron takes a position similar to the one held by Koester: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csB42E70E1">Most of all, the discovery of the </span><span class="cs7B9ACCE5">Secret Gospel of Mark</span><span class="csB42E70E1"> has made us privy to new and unparalleled information about the various editions of the Gospel of Mark, and has brought to our attention the widespread esoteric tradition among the earliest believers in Jesus. . . the canonical (or &quot;public&quot;) Gospel of Mark appears to be an abridgment of the </span><span class="cs7B9ACCE5">Secret Gospel of Mark</span><span class="csB42E70E1">. The first edition of Mark, which was written ca. 70 C.E., is no longer extant. The </span><span class="cs7B9ACCE5">Secret Gospel of Mark</span><span class="csB42E70E1"> was probably composed around the beginning of the second century, most likely in Syria. Sometime thereafter our present edition of Mark, with only vestiges of the secret tradition still visible (Mark 4:11; 9:25-27; 10:21, 32, 38-39; 12:32-34; 14:51-52), took shape.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Above we noted that Salome is mentioned in Secret Mark, and it is noteworthy that Salome is absent in the lists of women who went to the tomb in Matthew and Luke; it is possible that Matthew and Luke relied on a version of Mark without any mention of Salome. Thus, Secret Mark may be an important witness to the textual history of the Gospel of Mark.</span></p><h1 class="cs550128D4">
			<span class="cs75A07D5F"> Letter of Clement of Alexandria on Secret Mark</span></h1>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Translated by Morton Smith. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">From the letters of the most holy Clement, the author of the Stromateis. To Theodore. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You did well in silencing the unspeakable teachings of the Carpocrations. For these are the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;wandering stars&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> referred to in the prophecy, who wander from the narrow road of the commandments into a boundless abyss of the carnal and bodily sins. For, priding themselves in knowledge, as they say, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;of the deep things of Satan&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, they do not know that they are casting themselves away into </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;the nether world of the darkness&quot; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">of falsity, and boasting that they are free, they have become slaves of servile desires. Such men are to be opposed in all ways and altogether. For, even if they should say something true, one who loves the truth should not, even so, agree with them. For not all true things are the truth, nor should that truth which merely seems true according to human opinions be preferred to the true truth, that according to the faith. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now of the things they keep saying about the divinely inspired Gospel according to Mark, some are altogether falsifications, and others, even if they do contain some true elements, nevertheless are not reported truly. For the true things, being mixed with inventions, are falsified, so that, as the saying goes, even the salt loses its savor. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As for Mark, then, during Peter&#39;s stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord&#39;s doings, not, however, declaring all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but selecting what he thought most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria, bringing both his own notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book the things suitable to whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he composed a more spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. Nevertheless, he yet did not divulge the things not to be uttered, nor did he write down the hierophantic teaching of the Lord, but to the stories already written he added yet others and, moreover, brought in certain sayings of which he knew the interpretation would, as a mystagogue, lead the hearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils. Thus, in sum, he prepared matters, neither grudgingly nor incautiously, in my opinion, and, dying, he left his composition to the church in 1, verso Alexandria, where it even yet is most carefully guarded, being read only to those who are being initiated into the great mysteries. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But since the foul demons are always devising destruction for the race of men, Carpocrates, instructed by them and using deceitful arts, so enslaved a certain presbyter of the church in Alexandria that he got from him a copy of the secret Gospel, which he both interpreted according to his blasphemous and carnal doctrine and, moreover, polluted, mixing with the spotless and holy words utterly shameless lies. From this mixture is drawn off the teaching of the Carpocratians. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To them, therefore, as I said above, one must never give way; nor, when they put forward their falsifications, should one concede that the secret Gospel is by Mark, but should even deny it on oath. For, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Not all true things are to be said to all men&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. For this reason the Wisdom of God, through Solomon, advises, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Answer the fool from his folly&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, teaching that the light of the truth should be hidden from those who are mentally blind. Again it says, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;From him who has not shall be taken away&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Let the fool walk in darkness&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But we are </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;children of Light&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, having been illuminated by </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;the dayspring&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of the spirit of the Lord </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;from on high&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Where the Spirit of the Lord is&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, it says, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;there is liberty&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, for </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;All things are pure to the pure&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To you, therefore, I shall not hesitate to answer the questions you have asked, refuting the falsifications by the very words of the Gospel. For example, after </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;And they were in the road going up to Jerusalem&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and what follows, until </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;After three days he shall arise&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, the secret Gospel brings the following material word for word: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, &#39;Son of David, have mercy on me.&#39; But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightaway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb, they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich.

			<span class="csFF5D0528"> A Letter Attributed to Clement of Alexandria</span></h3>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To Theodore. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You did well in silencing the unspeakable teachings of the Carpocrations. For these are &quot;wandering stars&quot; referred to in the prophecy, who wander from the narrow road of the commandments into a boundless abyss of the carnal and bodily sins. For, priding themselves in knowledge, as they say, &quot;of the deep things of Satan, they do not know that they are casting themselves away into &quot;the netherworld of the darkness&quot; of falseness, and boasting that they are free, they have become slaves of servile desires. Such men are to be opposed in all ways and alltogether. For, even if they should say something true, one who loves the truth should not, even so, agree with them. For not all true things are the truth, nor should that truth which merely seems true according to human opinions be prefered to the true truth, that according to the faith. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now of the things they keep saying about the divinely inspired Gospel according to Mark, some are altogether falsifications, and others, even if they do contain some true elements, nevertheless are not reported truely. For the true things being mixed with inventions, are falsified , so that, as the saying goes, even the salt loses its savor. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As for Mark, then, during Peter`s stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord`s doings, not, however, declaring all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but selecting what he thought most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria, bringing both his own notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former books the things suitable to whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he composed a more spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. Nevertheless, he yet did not divulge the things not to be uttered, nor did he write down the hierophantic teaching of the Lord, but to the stories already written he added yet others and, moreover, brought in certain sayings of which he knew the interpretation would, as a mystagogue , lead the hearers into the innermost sanctuary of truth hidden by seven veils. Thus, in sum, he prepared matters, neither grudgingly nor incautionously, in my opinion, and, dying, he left his composition to the church in 1, verso Alexandria, where it even yet is most carefully guarded, being read only to those who are being initated into the great mysteries. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">But since the foul demons are always devising destruction for the race of men, Carpocrates, instructed by them and using deceitful arts, so enslaved a certain presbyter of the church in Alexandria that he got from him a copy of the secret Gospel, which he both interpreted according to his blasphemous and carnal doctrine and, moreover, polluted, mixing with the spotless and holy words utterly shameless lies. From this mixture is withdrawn off the teaching of the Carpocratians. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To them, therefore, as I said above, one must never give way ; nor, when they put forward their falsifications, should one concede that the secret Gospel is by Mark, but should even deny it on oath. For, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;For not all true things are to be said to all men&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. For this reason the Wisdom of God, through Solomon, advises, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Answer the fool with his folly,&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> , teaching that the light of the truth should be hidden from those who are mentally blind. Again it says, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;From him who has not shall be taken away&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Let the fool walk in darkness&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But we are </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;children of Light&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> having been illuminated by </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;the dayspring&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of the spirit of the Lord </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;from on high&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Where the Spirit of the Lord is&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> , it says, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;there is liberty&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, for </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;All things are pure to the pure&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To you, therefore, I shall not hesitate to answer the questions you have asked, refuting the falsifications by the very words of the Gospel. For example, after </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;And they were in the road going up to Jerusalem&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and what follows, until </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;After three days he shall arise&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, the secret Gospel brings the following material word for word: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, &quot;son of David, have mercy on me&quot;. But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered , went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus thaught him the mystery of the Kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And these words follow the text, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;And James and John come to him&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and all that section.

		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In Mark 14:51-52, a young man in a linen cloth is seized during Jesus&#39; arrest, but he escapes at the cost of his clothing. This passage seems to have little to do with the rest of the narrative, and it has given cause to various interpretations. Often it is suggested that the young man is Mark himself. Some commentators believe that the boy was a stranger, who lived near the garden and, after being awakened, ran out, half-dressed, to see what all the noise was about (vv. 46-49).<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Gospel_of_Mark#cite_note-2#cite_note-2"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>[3]</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> W.L.

For this particular passage, there are also parallel passages in both Matthew and Luke, but they don&#39;t use &quot;neaniskos&quot;. (In Mt 28:2, it is &quot;an angel of the Lord&quot; dressed in white that appears and, in Lk 24:4, there are </span><span class="csC382D2BB">two</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &quot;men&quot; [the Greek word is &quot;andres&quot;]). Thus, it is also possible that all three of these occurrences of &quot;neaniskos&quot; in Mark and in Secret Mark are related somehow; perhaps the same editor was at work on all three. The proponents of Secret Mark as a forgery, on the other hand, suggest that Secret Mark was created based on Mark 14:51 and 16:5.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4">

What precedes the story is the third prediction of the Passion/Crucifixion (Mark 10:32-34). And what follows next is the story of the Sons of Zebedee (Mark 10:35-45), where baptism is mentioned explicitly. James and John ask Christ for positions of higher honor once Jesus is an earthly ruler. Jesus responds,</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs1DA2E76">&quot;You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?&quot; (Mark 10:38)</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Here baptism is clearly seen as a symbol of Jesus&#39; coming crucifixion, and this is widely accepted by Christian commentators.<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Gospel_of_Mark#cite_note-39#cite_note-39"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>[40]</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> This understanding of baptism seems to be based on the teachings of Paul, according to whom, those who &quot;were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death&quot; (Romans 6:3). Among the Synoptic gospels, only Mark mentions baptism in this passage;<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Gospel_of_Mark#cite_note-40#cite_note-40"><span class="cs92015F65"><sup>[41]</sup></span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> thus the interests of the author of Secret Mark parallel those of the author of Mark, which also parallel the teachings of Paul.</span></p><h3 class="cs550128D4">

To Theodore: </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">02 You did well silencing the unspeakable teachings of the Carpocratians. <br/>03 For they are the prophesied wandering stars. From the narrow road of the commandments <br/>04 they are wandering into a boundless abyss of carnal and bodily sins. <br/>05 For having been puffed up in knowledge - as they call it - of the depths of Satan, they fail to notice <br/>06 that they are throwing themselves down into the darkness of dark lies. And having boasted <br/>07 that they are free, they have become slaves of servile desires. With these people, then, it is <br/>08 necessary to check them constantly and in everything. For even if they say something true, still <br/>09 the lover of the truth should not agree with them. For not all true things are truth. <br/>10 One must not value what human opinion considers truth more than the <br/>11 true truth, which is recognized through faith. Now, concerning their babblings about the divinely <br/>12 inspired Gospel according to Mark: some are wholly false while others, even if partly true, <br/>13 are still not completely true. The true parts, because they have been mixed <br/>14 with invented stories are debased so that, as the saying goes, even the <br/>15 salt loses its flavor. As for Mark then, during the time when Peter was in Rome, <br/>16 he wrote up the deeds of the Lord, not actually recording everything, nor <br/>17 hinting at the mysteries, but instead picking out the things he thought would <br/>18 increase the faith of those being taught. Then, when Peter was martyred, Mark went <br/>19 to Alexandria, bringing both his knowledge and the things he remembered hearing from Peter. <br/>20 From what he brought, he supplemented his first book with the appropriate items <br/>21 about knowledge for those who are making progress. He arranged a more spiritual <br/>22 gospel for the use of those being perfected. Nevertheless, he did not reveal the things <br/>23 which are not to be discussed. He did not write out the hierophantic instruction of the <br/>24 Lord, but added other deeds to the ones he had already written. Then, he <br/>25 added certain sayings, the interpretation of which he knew would initiate the hearers <br/>26 into the innermost sanctuary of the truth which has been hidden seven times. This is the way <br/>27 he prepared them, in my opinion, not ungrudgingly or unguardedly. And <br/>28 when he died, he left his writing to the church in </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.historian.net/secretmark2.htm"><span class="csB956BC15"><img src="Information%20on%20Secret%20Mark.doc&archaeology_files/image1.jpg" width="93" height="140" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></a></span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csA7555675">Page 2</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA7555675">01 Alexandria, where it is even now still extremely carefully guarded, being read <br/>02 only to those who have been initiated into the greatest mysteries. The miserable <br/>03 demons, however, are always devising destruction for the human race. <br/>04 After being taught by them and using their deceptive arts, Carpocrates <br/>05 was able to enslave some elder from the church in Alexandria <br/>06 and get the written part of the secret gospel from him. And he <br/>07 interpreted it according to his blasphemous and carnal opinion. Still <br/>08 he defiles it, mixing with the most undefiled and holy narratives the most <br/>09 shameless lies. The teaching of the Carpocratians is derived from this mixture. <br/>10 Therefore, one must never yield to them, just as I said before. Also, one must not concede <br/>11 to them that the secret gospel is from Mark, when they put forth their lies. <br/>12 Rather one must deny it, even with an oath. For one does not have to speak <br/>13 the whole truth to everyone. For this reason the wisdom of God declares through Solomon, <br/>14 &quot;Answer the fool from his folly,&quot; teaching that, from people whose minds are blinded, <br/>15 the light of the truth must be concealed. At once, she (Wisdom) <br/>16 says, &quot;From the one who has not, it will be taken,&quot; and, &quot;Let the fool go in darkness.&quot; <br/>17 But we are the children of light, who have been illuminated in the rising of the heights of the <br/>18 spirit of the Lord. &quot;Where the spirit of the Lord is,&quot; she says, &quot;there is freedom.&quot; For all <br/>19 things are pure to those who are pure. So I will not hesitate to answer the questions for you, <br/>20 exposing their lies from the actual words of the gospel. <br/>21 At any rate, after the part, &quot;They were going up on the road to Jerusalem&quot; and the following things <br/>22 until, &quot;after three days he will arise,&quot; it takes up according to the text: <br/>23</span><span class="csD5FB87F7"> </span><span class="csFB842875">&quot;And they went to Bethany and there was a woman whose brother had died. <br/>24 And coming up to him, she prostrated herself before Jesus and said to him, &#39;Son of David, <br/>25 have mercy on me.&#39; But the disciples rebuked her.

The cities of the Galilee were very Hellenized while the Jewish population was centered in the rural farms and villages.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Many of Jesus sayings and aphorisms recall the imagery of the farming community of his childhood such as the &quot;sowing and reaping&quot; metaphors. It was the custom of villagers of the Galilee to join in the harvests to make extra income. Whether it be the &quot;lilies of the fields&quot; or the sparrows who neather &quot;reap nor sow,&quot; Jesus&#39; teachings paint a vivid picture of this agrarian rural community. Galileans were generally looked down upon by Judeans much like the people of rural farming communities in the American South by industrial northerners. The Aramaic dialect of Galileans was also noticeable by Judeans and another subject of derision. Galileans had a tendency to &quot;drop their alefs&quot; similar to the manner of dropping H&#39;s in Cockney English. This tendency is preserved in the Latinization of the name of Jesus&#39; friend Alazar whom Jesus probably called `Lazar, hence &quot;Lazarus.&quot; (Photo.

The association of John with the Jordan may have had a connection with the connection recognized by his followers with Elijah (see II Kings 2) and John&#39;s habit of clothing himself like Elijah (II Kings 1:8; Mt. 3:4; Mk 1:6).

The Gospels make it clear that Jesus as the prophecied Bar Nash was not accepted by those with whom he grew up. He launched his ministry in the synagogue at Nazareth by reading the scroll of Isaiah and claiming that he was the fulfillment of the prophecy (Luke 4: 16-30). After this incident, Jesus left Nazareth and went to Capernaum. It is very possible that Jesus had spent time in Capernaum during his childhood. His uncle Zebediya (Zebedee) owned a rather lucrative fishing business there in partnership with Jonah, the father of Simon Peter and Andrew. Zebedee&#39;s own two sons, Ya&#39;akov and Yohanon (James, the &quot;greater&quot; and John) also worked in this business. Two other cousins of Jesus, Mattityahu (Matthew) and Ya&#39;akov (James, the &quot;less&quot;), the sons of Alphaeus/Clopas (brother of Jesus&#39; father Joseph) also resided at Capernaum. The village lies on the northwestern shore of Lake Gennesaret. It was a bustling fishing port as well as a toll collecting station on the caravan route from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast. The picture above is one of the excavated 1</span><span class="cs16E84F30"><sup>st</sup></span><span class="cs16E84F30"> century main streets through the city upon which Jesus would have walked (Photo.

And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch as there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. And when they could not come nigh unto him because of the press, they uncovered the roof where he was; and when they had broken it up, they lay down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">The residential section of the ancient town of Capernaum was excavated under the direction of Virgilio Corbo in 1968. These private houses (Insula II) lie between two parallel east to west streets and a broader street (&quot;main street&quot;) between them. The houses are arranged around courtyards where ovens and grinding stones indicate bread was made. The walls of the houses are of the typical black basalt that is characteristic of the area. Mortared with mud and pebbles, the houses were one story with stairways that led to the roofs. It was in just such a house where the healing incident of Mark 2:1-5 had taken place. (Photo.

It is significant to me that he served in this capacity for 18 years until 36 CE. when Pilate himself was recalled, coinciding with the downfall and trial of Sejanus. High Priests came and went like the husbands of some movie stars, rarely serving more than 3 years. Caiaphas had probably worked out a good relationship with Valerius Gratus, Pilate&rsquo;s predecessor, who himself served for eleven years in contrast to the normal 3 year terms of service. I do not believe that it is a coincidence that the unprecedented long terms of Gratus, Pilatus and Caiaphas coincide with the career of Lucius Aelias Sejanus. Judea may not have been considered a &quot;plum&quot; appointment because of the harsh surroundings but the opportunity for accumulating fortunes from graft and corruption was high. It is obvious that Caiaphas was &quot;their man&quot; in the Temple with access to the treasury as head of the party of the Sadducees and to all of the ancillary trade and commercial enterprises that surrounded the Temple. There were somewhere between 300,000 to 400,000 pilgrims in Jerusalem and surrounding areas for the temple services of Passover, each carrying a purse. Money changing, the selling of sacrificial animals, the money coming to the treasury from Jews all over the Roman world and hundreds of enterprises associated with the Temple were all being siphoned to enrich Sejanus, the prefect and the High Priest and his Sadducee cronies beyond the dreams of avarice. When Jesus entered the Temple early in the year 30 and condemned these practices, overturning money changers&rsquo; tables, it sealed his death warrant. Joseph Caiaphas, as High Priest and head of the collaborating Sadducees, who controlled these commercial enterprises, had a great thing going for himself and his Roman cronies, Gratus and Sejanus in Rome and later Pilatus and Sejanus.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Matthew 24:1-2 </span><span class="cs302D6F02">Jesus left and was going away from the temple when his disciples came to him to show him the temple&#39;s buildings. &quot;Yes, &quot; he said, &quot;You may well look at all these.

There is in Jerusalem, by the Sheep Gate, a pool with five porches; in the Hebrew language it is called Bethzatha. A large crowd of sick people were lying on the porches, the blind, the lame and the paralyzed. They were waiting for the water to move because every now and then an angel of the Lord went down into the pool and stirred up the water. The first sick person to go into the water after the water was stirred up was healed from whatever disease he had. A man was there who had been sick for thirty eight years. Jesus saw him lying there, and he knew that the man had been sick for such a long time; so he said to him, &quot;Do you want to get well?&quot; The sick man answered, &quot;Sir, I don&#39;t have anyone to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up; while I am trying to get in, somebody else gets there first.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Get up, pick up your mat and walk.&quot; Immediately, the man got well; he picked up his mat, and walked.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Modern excavations began at the Pool of Bethesda in 1878 by the White Fathers.

This is a location that Jesus frequently used to conduct healings. (Photo.

It is one of the sites, familiar to Jesus, that remains today much as it was in his time, perhaps with the very same olive trees. There are eight olive trees in the garden which some botanists clain to be 3,000 years old. It is here within the shadow of this very olive tree where Jesus was arrested by temple guards and taken to the house of Caiaphas. (Photo.

It must be possible to see the loculus from the outside (John 20:5) and it must permit several persons to stand inside (Luke 24:1-4). The loculus where the body lay should be low rather than elevated (as in the traditional tomb) to allow Peter&#39;s &quot;stooping down&quot; (Luke 24:12).</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><img src="Information%20on%20Secret%20Mark.doc&archaeology_files/image6.jpg" width="417" height="261" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Luke 24: 50-51 </span><span class="cs302D6F02">Then he led them out of the city as far as Bethany, where he raised his hands and blessed them.
