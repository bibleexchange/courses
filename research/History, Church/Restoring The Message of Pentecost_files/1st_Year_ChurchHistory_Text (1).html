These are not just man&rsquo;s divisions of Church history, but these are God&rsquo;s divisions that He has given to us in His Word. &nbsp;The Book of Revelation describes seven Churches in Asia. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Revelation 1:11&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csC382D2BB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">These seven Churches are described individually from Revelation 2:1 to Revelation 3:22. &nbsp;These seven Churches describe and parallel the seven periods of the history of the Church. &nbsp;They are a prophetic overview of the entire history of the church from the first century AD until the current period of time today. &nbsp;It is important to note that these periods do tend to overlap one another and that elements from all the church periods can be found in each individual period. With this being sad, each period has a distinct and dominant &lsquo;personality.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The key to understanding the meaning of these seven Churches is to compare the events of the seven periods of the Church to the description given in the book of Revelation of these seven Churches. &nbsp;These chapters in the book of Revelation will be the key texts that will be used in our study of Church history. &nbsp;Each of these seven churches corresponds to a distinct period in history. &nbsp;As we begin to study each church description in the Bible and compare it to the events that took place in the history of that period you will begin to understand how these seven churches represent seven distinct periods in the history of the Church. &nbsp;As we continue our study, this will become clearer to you. &nbsp;Each of these church names has a corresponding meaning. &nbsp;The meaning of the names describes that period as a whole. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The following is a list of the seven periods with their corresponding church name and the meaning of that name. &nbsp;There is also a description of events that mark the beginning and ending of the period with the corresponding dates. &nbsp;You will not be required to memorize these dates; they are only given for the benefit of your personal study. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFA651B7F"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1.

(Revelation 2:1-7) &nbsp;Jesus admonishes this Church that they have left their first love. The Apostolic period is the first period of the early Church. The early Church lacked a missionary vision. &nbsp;There was no effort to go into all the world and preach the Gospel. &nbsp;This Church period left their first love of the souls of men. &nbsp;God would allow persecution to come to cause the church to spread the Gospel.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.
