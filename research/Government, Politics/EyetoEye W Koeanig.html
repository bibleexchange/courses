The opening of the conference on October 30, 1991, coincided with the formation of &ldquo;the Perfect Storm.&rdquo; This was the record breaking storm which produced 100 foot high waves and heavily damaged President Bush&rsquo;s home at Kennebunkport , Maine . Headlines of USA Today on Nov 1, 1991, had the stories of the storm and the Madrid Conference side by side. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs16E84F30">Round Six of the Bilateral Peace Talks</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> &mdash; In June of 1992 Yitzhak Rabin was elected the new Prime Minister of Israel. We immediately insisted that he come to Washington , D.C. and meet with Yasser Arafat. The day that meeting began, August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew slammed into Florida with winds of 177 miles per hour. The damage done amounted to over $30 billion &mdash; the most costly hurricane in U.S. History to that point in time. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs16E84F30">Arafat at the United Nations</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> &mdash; In September of 1998 Yasser Arafat was invited to speak to a special session of the United Nations that was held in New York. President Clinton arranged a meeting with him to put pressure on Israel . During that meeting, Hurricane Georges (Gulf Coast) caused over $6 billion in damage. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs16E84F30">Arafat and a Palestinian State</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> &mdash; With our encouragement, Arafat announced that he was going to proclaim a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999. Even though President Clinton later persuaded Arafat to postpone the declaration to at least December, on the very day the proclamation was to have been made (May 3rd in the U.S.; May 4th in Israel), the most powerful tornado in U.S. history tore through Oklahoma City with wind speeds of 316 miles per hour, destroying over 2,000 homes.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs16E84F30">The Camp David Summit</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> &mdash; From July 11 through July 24 in the summer of 2000, President Clinton hosted a summit conference between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Clinton pressured Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to surrender the heartland of Israel . During these precise dates, a major heat wave struck the South Central U.S. and fires broke out in our Western states. At one point, there were over 50 active fires consuming over 500,000 acres before the end of the month. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs16E84F30">White House Ramadan Celebration</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> &mdash; On Thursday evening, November 7, 2002, President Bush hosted a dinner at the White House to honor the Muslim religious holiday called Ramadan. In his speech that evening, the President said: <br/></span><span class="cs16E84F30">&ldquo;. . . this season commemorates the revelation of God&rsquo;s word in the holy Koran to the prophet Muhammad. Today this word inspires faithful Muslims to lead lives of honesty and integrity and compassion . . .</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs16E84F30">We see in Islam a religion that traces its origins back to God&rsquo;s call on Abraham . . .&rdquo; </span><span class="csEF2D250D"> Two days later a total of 88 tornados hit Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Ohio, and Penns.. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs16E84F30">The Middle East Peace Plan</span><span class="csEF2D250D">&mdash;April 30, 2003, U.S. Amb. Daniel Kurtzer presented the &ldquo;Road Map&rdquo; peace plan to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. It was a plan formulated by an ungodly coalition called &ldquo;the Quartet.&rdquo; This group was made up of Russia , the European Union, the United Nations, and the US . It called for Israel to surrender Gaza and its heartland of Judea and Samaria to the Palestinians. On May 3rd Secretary of State Colin Powell departed for the Middle East for talks to implement the plan. On May 4th Secretary Powell met with terrorist leader Hafez Assad of Syria and made a commitment to him to include the surrender of the Golan Heights in the peace plan. That day a swarm of tornados began tearing apart the Central United States . Over the next 7 days, there was a total of 412 tornados &mdash; the largest cluster ever observed by NOAA since it began its record keeping in 1950. The previous record had been 177 in 1999. <br/><br/>In summary, between October 1991 and November 2004, the United States experienced: <br/>* 9 of the 10 largest insurance events in U.S. history. <br/>* 9 of the 10 greatest natural disasters as ranked by FEMA relief costs. <br/>* 5 of the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history <br/>* 3 of the 4 largest tornado swarms in U.S. history. <br/></span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">All of which were linked to our attempts to pressure Israel into either dividing up its land or surrendering part of its capital city of Jerusalem . </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">The world would laugh and call these coincidences, but Christians don&rsquo;t believe in coincidence. God is sovereign. He is in control. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">The most recent chaotic event in Israel was the forced withdrawal of all Jews from Gaza . It began on August 7, 2005 and continued through the 22nd, as nearly 9,000 Israelis were uprooted from their land and homes. Many had been in the area for as long as 35 years. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">It was a heart-wrenching event to watch women and children manhandled, synagogues violated, torah scrolls desecrated, houses bulldozed, graves dug up, and farms destroyed. Entire Jewish communities were forcibly removed from land which God has given to the Jewish people as an everlasting possession (Psalm 105:8-11). </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">And while this travesty was taking place, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice began applying more pressure with the following statement: &ldquo;Everyone empathizes with what the Israelis are facing . . . but it cannot be Gaza only.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">What was the supernatural response from God? The withdrawal ended on August 22nd, and ON THE VERY NEXT DAY, the government of Bermuda announced that a tropical depression had formed off its coast. Dubbed &ldquo;Katrina,&rdquo; the storm quickly developed into the most powerful hurricane in modern history. It slammed into New Orleans and the Mississippi coast seven days later on the 29th. The hurricane disrupted 25% of our crude oil production and destroyed our nation&rsquo;s largest port (the 5th largest in the world in terms of tonnage). It is also interesting to note that the hurricane hit just three days before New Orleans &mdash; which I often refer to as another &ldquo; Sin City USA &rdquo; &mdash; was scheduled to host an ungodly event that had come to be called &ldquo;The Gay Mardi Gras.&rdquo; The theme this year was to be &ldquo;Jazz and Jezebels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">The previous year the event drew 125,000 revelers who proudly flaunted their perversion publicly in a parade that featured the bizarre. Incredibly, this event was sponsored by a group that has named itself &ldquo;Southern Decadence.&rdquo; When I think of New Orleans I think of occult practices, particularly voodoo. Stereotype or not, this is what readily comes to mind. The city is also infamous for its high murder rate and its rampant political corruption. Coincidence? </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Some of those &ldquo;obvious connections&rdquo; or eerie similarities between Katrina and the evacuation of Gush Katif, including parallels in events, names and numbers: </span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F71A1C8"><span class="csEF2D250D">Close to 10,000 Jews were expelled from their homes in the Gaza Strip and parts of Northern Samaria . Mere days after this tragic event, WorldNetDaily cited several experts who were projecting Katrina&rsquo;s death toll to be close to 10,000, an eerie similarity to the total number of those expelled in Israel (the actual death toll was slightly less than 2,000). </span></li><li class="cs1F71A1C8"><span class="csEF2D250D">America &rsquo;s population ratio to Israel is about 50:1. Ten thousand Jews who lost their Gaza homes is the equivalent of about 500,000 Americans who have been reported to have been displaced as a result of Katrina. </span></li><li class="cs1F71A1C8"><span class="csEF2D250D">&nbsp;Gaza &rsquo;s Jewish communities were located in Israel &rsquo;s southern coastal region; America &rsquo;s southern coastal region was hit by Katrina. </span></li><li class="cs1F71A1C8"><span class="csEF2D250D">Katrina, written in Hebrew, has a numerical equivalent of 374, according to a biblical numbering system upheld by all traditional Jewish authorities. Two relevant passages in the Torah share the exact numerical equivalent: &ldquo;They have done you evil&rdquo; (Genesis 50:17) and &ldquo;The sea upon land&rdquo; (Exodus 14:15). </span></li><li class="cs1F71A1C8"><span class="csEF2D250D">&nbsp;Bush, from Texas , and Rice, from Alabama , were the most vocal U.S. backers of the Gaza evacuation. Hurricane Katrina hit the states in between Texas and Alabama - - Louisiana and Mississippi . </span></li><li class="cs1F71A1C8"><span class="csEF2D250D">Similarity in scenes: Many residents of Jewish Gaza climbed to their rooftops to escape the threat of expulsion, while residents of the Gulf Coast climbed on their own rooftops to protect themselves from the rising waters. </span></li><li class="cs1F71A1C8"><span class="csEF2D250D">Gush Katif was an important agricultural area for Israel , providing the Jewish state with 70 percent of its produce. A New Orleans port that exported much of the Midwest &rsquo;s agricultural production was destroyed by Katrina. <br/></span></li></ul>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Why is the Bush Administration so willing to ignore recent history in pursuit of the elusive prospect of peace in the Middle East ? <br/><br/></span><span class="cs16E84F30">CURTAIN UP</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> <br/></span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Speaking of President Bush, many are asking why such a committed Evangelical would put such inordinate pressure on Israel . More and more, people are asking, &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t President Bush see the prophetic significance of end time Israel ?&rdquo; Dr. David R. Reagan recently put that question to Bill Koenig when he interviewed him. His response was very illuminating. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Koenig pointed out that President Bush was raised in the Episcopal Church and in recent years has attended the Methodist Church . Although there are pastors in both of these churches who recognize the prophetic significance of modern Israel </span><span class="csF11E374">, the vast majority of the spiritual leaders</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> in both churches (and especially those on the national level) believe in Replacement Theology. This is the theology that says God washed His hands of the Jewish people in the First Century and replaced Israel with the Church. They therefore see no prophetic significance to the re-establishment of Israel . Koenig stated that within the Bush Administration the President is not the only victim of this erroneous theology. He is surrounded by godly people who have also grown up spiritually in Replacement churches. So, even though these people may respect the Judaic roots of their faith, they have no appreciation for the prophetic significance of modern day Israel . I guess it&rsquo;s just another case of the blind leading the blind. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">For instance, consider that one article stated that &ldquo; Annapolis may well bring us closer to what European Union foreign policy Chief Javier Solana is saying is doable within nine months, referring to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians that would birth a Palestinian state on Israel &#39;s covenant lands&hellip;&rdquo; (italics mine). <br/>I do not believe that it is mere coincidence that such verbiage has been used in connection with issues involving God&rsquo;s holy land. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Blogger Michael Mickey of The Rapture Alert recently postulated that the United States could be sitting on a cataclysmic time bomb. <br/>In a widely read post from last week, Mickey wrote: </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">As the United States prepares for its upcoming Middle East peace conference to be held in Annapolis, God is, in my opinion, drawing our attention to the fact that He is keeping a close eye on developments concerning this most blessed of nations lending an ear to Israel&#39;s enemies and, in fact, providing them with support to obtain portions of Israel&#39;s God-given covenant lands. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">How is God drawing the attention of those willing to see the spiritual connotations of events transpiring in the world around us as Annapolis draws near, potentially placing our nation in great peril of coming up on the curse side of God&#39;s promise of blessing and curse recorded in Genesis 12:3? He&#39;s drawing our eyes toward Yellowstone - - and dramatically so of late, in my opinion. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">The Independent recently unveiled an article on its site entitled &quot;Yellowstone: The Time Bomb Under America.&quot; <br/>The opening lines of the article are anything but comforting, reading as follows:</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">&lsquo;Deep beneath Yellowstone National Park lies a vast super-volcano which, if it blew up, could devastate much of the US . Recently, it&#39;s been a bit too restless for comfort.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Too restless for comfort indeed when we consider that Annapolis may well bring us closer to what European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is saying is &lsquo;doable&rsquo; within nine months, referring to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians that would birth a Palestinian state on Israel&#39;s covenant lands! <br/><br/></span><span class="cs2C025596">Conclusions? <br/></span><span class="csEF2D250D">Trying to find the United States of America in Bible prophecy is like looking for a needle in a haystack. May Yellowstone be an answer as to why? I&#39;m not sure but the last paragraph of the Independent&#39;s article certainly doesn&#39;t close the door on that being a possibility: </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">&lsquo;And what if the ground at Yellowstone does not start to go down? Well, these calderas, he admits, occasionally they burp. Let&#39;s hope the park&#39;s belly-ache resolves itself &ndash; such a &quot;burp&quot; would shake half of the planet. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">In spite of God&#39;s clear warning provided in Genesis 12:3 that He will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse her, the United States, potentially within a year of a peace deal coming into existence that may well lead to the prophesied cries of &lsquo;peace and safety&rsquo; foretold in 1st Thessalonians 5:3, is casting God&#39;s Word aside in spite of many Christian leaders and Jewish rabbis publicly warning against the United States helping Israel make what Bible prophecy clearly demonstrates to us is the equivalent of a covenant with hell is anything but wise! </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">A major eruption at Yellowstone in modern times would be devastating. It would obliterate the national park and nearby communities, spread ground-glass-like volcanic ash from the Pacific coast to the Midwest , and cause worldwide weather changes from the airborne dust and gases, according to Smith, who described the potential effects in detail in his book Windows into the Earth, published in 2000. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">A modern full-force Yellowstone eruption could kill millions, directly and indirectly, and would make every volcano in recorded human history look minor by comparison. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">God is on His throne. He is in control. He cannot be mocked. He will not tolerate the division of His holy land. Nor will He tolerate gross immorality that mocks everything that is moral and decent. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">God loves our nation. He has blessed us more than any other nation. His Word says that to those to whom much is given, much is expected (Luke 12:47-48). His Word also says He disciplines those whom He loves (Hebrews 12:7). </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Another thing His Word makes clear is that when He sends discipline, the fundamental purpose is never to punish. Instead, the purpose is to call us to repentance so that we might be saved. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Here&rsquo;s how the prophet Isaiah expressed it: &ldquo;When the earth experiences Your judgments, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness&rdquo; (Isaiah 26:9b). </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">We as a nation have set our jaw against God. We are tempting Him to move us from judgment to destruction. Our God is so merciful. He is patiently sending us one wake-up call after another because He never pours out His wrath without warning.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csEF2D250D">Make no mistake, a wake-up call from God is on the horizon. It is imperative that when that call comes we don&rsquo;t simply roll over and hit the snooze button - - again. </span></p></body>
