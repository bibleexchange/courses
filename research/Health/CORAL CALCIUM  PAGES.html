He gave me a bottle of coral calcium and said to take six tabs a day and I&#39;m thinking YEAH RIGHT another pill just like everybody elses &quot;THE BEST&quot;. I told my brother I can&#39;t take calcium it makes my joints hurt worse. OH MY THANK YOU JOE, within three days I was outside pushing the wheelbarrel. &nbsp;&nbsp;After about two weeks I was able to go off a lot of my meds, and start the CMO. There is a life outside the Dr. office and a bed. This is now August 15th I don&#39;t rely on drugs and narcotics thanks to ... Products my doctors are astounded and willing to learn.

I gave him a bottle of Coral Calcium. &nbsp;&nbsp;He opened it, took 9 capsules right then at 5pm. He took 9 more Saturday morning and evening, 9 more again Sunday morning &amp; evening. And, again he took 9 on Monday morning. When we saw him at 2pm Monday, he was a completely different person. totally out of PAIN, laughing, jovial, in a good mood. &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, &quot;Coral Calcium is a fantastic product, and is doing some things he has never seen before in any other calcium product that he has personally used. &nbsp;... Coral Calcium is VERY bio-available because of the Calcium from Sango Coral, [contains an organic composition IDENTICAL to that of a human skeleton &amp; other trace minerals essential to human life]. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;George LeGrande, OK</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I was in a lot &nbsp;of pain in my shoulders from lifting gallon paint cans over my head at work, putting them on shelves &amp; taking them down.

My foot caught in a machine which pushed it backwards and messed up the muscles, tendons and ligaments on the top of my foot. This caused me to have a cast put on and to walk with crutches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later I went back to the Dr. and he was amazed how my foot had healed in a weeks time. &nbsp;I had been taking 9 Coral Calcium a day since it happened and 6 Bio-MSM. All the black &amp; blue is gone. &nbsp;The Doctor said it should be still there. &nbsp;He was also amazed that I had enough strength in my foot in just a week. I told him about the Coral Calcium and he told me I was the third person who had been taking Coral Calcium. &nbsp;He is interested in learning more about Coral Calcium. &nbsp;Tina Mumma, Chambersburg,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">PA</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I would love to share some testimonies with you. &nbsp;My husband, Mark, had heal spurs when we attended the conference in May. &nbsp;I heard Robert Barefoot speak and after the session, I went out of the room to speak with him to ask him about Mark&#39;s condition. &nbsp;He told me to have Mark take 6 Coral Calcium&#39;s per day and in 3-6 months he would see tremendous results. &nbsp;Guess what???? &nbsp;Now Mark is completely PAIN FREE!!!!! &nbsp;Mark had been to the doctor. &nbsp;The doctor had him taking steroids (which caused him to gain weight), and also the doctor had him taking liquid calcium. &nbsp;After taking these prescriptions, the pain would come right back. &nbsp;The alternative was going to be surgery. &nbsp;THANK GOD we went to conference and heard about Coral Calcium. &nbsp;It certainly saved Mark from a lot of unnecessary pain and time off from work. &nbsp;We are very grateful for Coral Calcium!!!!!

He told me to keep doing what ever I was doing then because it was working. &nbsp;I gave him the info on Coral Calcium and will see what he has to say on my next visit. Thank you, Lynn M.

Between Jan and June of 2000 both had started to bother me again to the point I could see more surgery in my future. I got relief on the first day I started Coral Calcium. By the third day the pain was gone. I continue to take Coral Calcium and continue to be pain free. IT&#39;S THAT SIMPLE. &nbsp;People shouldn&#39;t be such skeptics and be more open minded about things they haven&#39;t tried.

His Parkinson disease was so bad, they had to bring his food to him in bed and help him eat. &nbsp;He had restless leg syndrome for 30 years with shooting pains down his leg bones, and constantly plagued with kidney stones. &nbsp;In 2 weeks his pain was gone. &nbsp;He hasn&#39;t had any stones and his Parkinson&#39;s is all but gone. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t see him shake at all in the 2 1/2 hours we were there!!!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; Another man, Gary, 53 years old and disabled with crippling arthritis, dementia, and bi-polar. &nbsp;He showed us his hand surgery in his left palm. &nbsp;He had been taking it 100 days. &nbsp;In 2 weeks, no pain. &nbsp;At the 5 the bottle he woke up one day and was calm and has remained happy and calm since!!!

The other problem was that I was having a hard time walking up stairs. It was just very difficult. I had to use a railing to pull myself, or press on the top of my right leg as I was taking a step with that leg. I had asked for prayer at my church, but also know that sometimes God tells us what &nbsp;we need to do and there is a pathway of healing. So one morning a couple of weeks ago I asked God to tell me what I needed to be healed. I felt that He said calcium into my spirit. I had tried their calcium products and had been reading that many calcium products do not absorb, and they didn&#39;t seem to be helping me at all. So I got on the internet and typed calcium in the search box. I came across the information for Coral Calcium and began to read it. I needed to buy some calcium again, so I decided to order the Coral Calcium and try it. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;It came in a couple of days and I began to put it in my protein shake that I have once a day. (I opened the capsules and poured it into the blender on the top of my &nbsp;drink mixture). I was using three a day. As I told you, when I would go &nbsp;to bed at night my hips would hurt and I would turn over and over trying to get comfortable. So, about 4 or 5 days after I had started taking it, &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; I began to notice that I was generally feeling more energy, and best of &nbsp;all the pain in my hips started going away. I now go to bed and don&#39;t &nbsp;have to think about that anymore. I don&#39;t name anything that comes upon &nbsp;me, because I want to be impressed with God - that He is my healer, and &nbsp;I don&#39;t want to be taken up with reciting what the doctor said I have,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">because every disease that tries to attach itself to me is subject to &nbsp;change by the One who created me. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; Now, I am going to start using the body cleansing products and will begin taking the Body Balance. One more thing. My husband and I had started watching our diet closer and he was doing great. He, as usual had lost 12 pounds and I had lost about 6. But now, since I have been taking the Coral Calcium, I don&#39;t have that ravenous hunger that I had before.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Darlette Enders, AR</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Since using coral calcium, I have eliminated the pain I&#39;ve had in my shoulder, arm and wrist for the past 2-3 years. &nbsp;Prior to coral calcium I had tried chiropractic, massage therapy, ultra-sound, etc. &nbsp;Nothing worked permanently, EXCEPT coral calcium! &nbsp;Also, our dog was also experiencing crippling knee pain. &nbsp;He&#39;s only 2 years old and his doc suggested surgery. I now have him on (4) capsules of coral calcium a day, and guess what? &nbsp;NO MORE LIMPING, or PAIN!!! &nbsp;Kim has been on coral calcium for as long as I have. When I told Bob Barefoot that we were having a baby he suggested we sprinkle some coral calcium on his baby food. &nbsp;I told him Tristan is breast fed only. &nbsp;He said, &quot;Great! Then he&#39;ll get his from his mom.&quot; &nbsp;We have opted to NOT vaccinate Tristan. He has been around other children with colds, fever and the such. &nbsp;He has NOT been sick yet! Your other point is a good one... &nbsp;In addition to the health benefits of coral calcium, there is a HUGE market for it. &nbsp;I can build a business on this one product alone. &nbsp;In fact, I sold (7) bottles last Friday alone. One more point before I close. &nbsp;EVERY person who I have given or sold coral calcium to that had elevated blood-pressure, had it normalize within days. Bob S.

I am 22 years old with 3 small children. I fell into a deep depression living with daily pain and chronic fatigue. &nbsp;When I went back to the doctor this last time, he told me that my fibro was progressing to the next stage. &nbsp;He put me on muscle relaxers (Calonzepam &amp; Amtriptalene). &nbsp;My first day on these medications I was in bed all day and hallucinating. &nbsp;I decided to take control of my life. &nbsp;I started taking Coral Calcium, Enzymes, Gentle Body Cleanse, and Bio-MSM. &nbsp;Since then I have witnessed miracles. &nbsp;I have gone off all my day time meds. &nbsp;And I feel like I have a new body and restored hope. &nbsp;I cried for 3 days from joy these products have brought me. &nbsp;I took my 30 pound 1 year old and threw him in the air and cried out with joy, &quot;Look Mommy&#39;s back!&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Missy Helm, &nbsp;&nbsp;Mercersburg,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">PA, &nbsp;10-31-00</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Our new &quot;miracle&quot; mineral, Coral Calcium has another &quot;Doggy Testimonial&quot;!

I gave him a bottle of Coral Calcium. &nbsp;&nbsp;He opened it, took 9 capsules right then at 5pm. He took 9 more Saturday morning and evening, 9 more again Sunday morning &amp; evening. And, again he took 9 on Monday morning. When we saw him at 2pm Monday, he was a completely different person. totally out of PAIN, laughing, jovial, in a good mood. &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, &quot;Coral Calcium is a fantastic product, and is doing some things he has never seen before in any other calcium product that he has personally used. &nbsp;... Coral Calcium is VERY bio-available because of the Calcium from Sango Coral, [contains an organic composition IDENTICAL to that of a human skeleton &amp; other trace minerals essential to human life]. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;George LeGrande, OK</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I was in a lot &nbsp;of pain in my shoulders from lifting gallon paint cans over my head at work, putting them on shelves &amp; taking them down.

My foot caught in a machine which pushed it backwards and messed up the muscles, tendons and ligaments on the top of my foot. This caused me to have a cast put on and to walk with crutches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later I went back to the Dr. and he was amazed how my foot had healed in a weeks time. &nbsp;I had been taking 9 Coral Calcium a day since it happened and 6 Bio-MSM. All the black &amp; blue is gone. &nbsp;The Doctor said it should be still there. &nbsp;He was also amazed that I had enough strength in my foot in just a week. I told him about the Coral Calcium and he told me I was the third person who had been taking Coral Calcium. &nbsp;He is interested in learning more about Coral Calcium. &nbsp;Tina Mumma, Chambersburg,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">PA</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I would love to share some testimonies with you. &nbsp;My husband, Mark, had heal spurs when we attended the conference in May. &nbsp;I heard Robert Barefoot speak and after the session, I went out of the room to speak with him to ask him about Mark&#39;s condition. &nbsp;He told me to have Mark take 6 Coral Calcium&#39;s per day and in 3-6 months he would see tremendous results. &nbsp;Guess what???? &nbsp;Now Mark is completely PAIN FREE!!!!! &nbsp;Mark had been to the doctor. &nbsp;The doctor had him taking steroids (which caused him to gain weight), and also the doctor had him taking liquid calcium. &nbsp;After taking these prescriptions, the pain would come right back. &nbsp;The alternative was going to be surgery. &nbsp;THANK GOD we went to conference and heard about Coral Calcium. &nbsp;It certainly saved Mark from a lot of unnecessary pain and time off from work. &nbsp;We are very grateful for Coral Calcium!!!!!

Between Jan and June of 2000 both had started to bother me again to the point I could see more surgery in my future. I got relief on the first day I started Coral Calcium. By the third day the pain was gone. I continue to take Coral Calcium and continue to be pain free.
