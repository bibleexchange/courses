Many women, in fact, consume less than half of the daily recommended amount of calcium. The National Academy of Sciences and the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommend daily calcium intakes of 1000-1200 mg/day for adult men and women. Fortunately, calcium-fortified foods and calcium supplements can fill the gap, ensuring that the daily calcium requirement is met.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Did you know that 7 out of every 10 women have osteoporosis whether they know it or not. &nbsp;So we must be sure we get lots of calcium. &nbsp;Start while you are young to KEEP your bones healthy, start today and reverse unhealthy bone density. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All Calcium Supplements Are Not Created Equal</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All forms of calcium are NOT created equal! &nbsp;Calcium lactate, calcium phosphate -- plaster, calcium carbonate -- like chalk -- 5% absorbable in 20 hours. &nbsp;Makes good plant fertilizer, but not the best for human bodies. &nbsp;In most 1000 mg calcium capsules , &nbsp;600 mg is calcium carbonate and is absolutely unusable. That form is unacceptable. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The calcium in supplements needs to be easily absorbed by the body. You can be sure of this if the tablet dissolves almost entirely in a small glass of warm water or vinegar within 30 minutes. Also read the label to determine the actual amount of calcium in the supplement, which is usually referred to as elemental calcium.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An inadequate supply of calcium is thought to play a significant role in contributing to the development of osteoporosis. Many published studies show that low calcium intakes are associated with low bone mass, rapid bone loss, and high fracture rates</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Associated Press reported on a study released by the New England Journal of Medicine that older people can reduce the risk of broken bones by fifty percent by taking calcium and vitamin D supplements. Researchers from Tufts University stated that these supplements decrease the rate of bone turnover - the breaking down and rebuilding cycle - and has a positive effect on bone density.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">People have been taking Coral Calcium around the world for years.

The one you want is Okinawa Coral Calcium. He explained that the Okinawa Coral Calcium comes from two sources. It could be coral that was washed up on to the beaches of the islands, or in can be coral removed from the sea bed. The Coral Calcium that is found on the beaches is fossilized coral and has lost a lot of its strength over the years. It is recommend that you take Coral Calcium 1, because it comes from the sea bed which has the same nutrients that is found in the living coral. Why is this important? Because the content of Coral to Magnesium is 2 to 1. Exactly what your body needs.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Others do not have our certified marine grade, potency, our added Vitamin D, magnesium, absorbability, and price!
