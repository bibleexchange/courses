		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">You will need a broiler pan or a pan with a wire rack; oven, cooking spray and a spatula. The ingredients you will need are ground beef patties, salt, pepper and garlic salt. Season the patties with salt, pepper and garlic. Preheat the oven to broil. Spray the broil pan with your cooking spray and then place the patties on the pan. Put the pan on the oven on the top rack. Broil for four to five minutes. Turn the patties over and broil the other side for four to five minutes. And that is how to make hamburgers in the oven.<br/></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5">----------------------------------</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">one and a half lb lean ground beef two tablespoons finely chopped onion two tablespoons drained Old El Paso chopped green chiles eight slices pepper Jack cheese, 2x1x1/4 inch (about four oz) four kaiser rolls, split a quarter cup Old El Paso taco sauce or Old El Paso Thick &#39;n Chunky salsa</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Prepare as follows:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">1.

When hot, oil the grate lightly. In an appropriately sized bowl, mix the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, hickory seasoning, salt and pepper until everything well blended together. Hand shape between 8 and 10 balls, and then flatten them into patties for grilling. On half of the patties (4-5), distribute the onions, the mushrooms, the chopped ham and the cheddar cheese. Cover the piles with the remaining patties, making certain to enclose the filling and to tightly seal the patties together. Grill the 4-5 patties for somewhere between 8 and 10 minutes on each side, or until the cheese in the middle has melted and the burger is well done.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">Marinated Hamburgers</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">The ingredients you&#39;ll need:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">3 T.
