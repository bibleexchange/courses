            leaving their clothes, wedding rings, eye glasses and shoes in 
            crumpled piles. Mass confusion hits while vehicles suddenly unmanned 
            veer out of control, fires erupt and hysteria breaks out as the 
            living stare in disbelief and fear at the empty places where their 
            loved ones were just seconds before. This is the rapture that God 
            has planned as the first sign to begin the unraveling of the end of 
            time.”

            width=100 align=right border=0>Newspaper headlines are predicted to 
            read: “Millions Mysteriously Vanish!” “All Children Have

            “Planes Crash, Trains Wreck As Pilots and Engineers Disappear!” It 
            has been reported that some at American Airlines are worried about 
            this, so they want at least one non-Christian pilot aboard each 
            flight — just in case! 
            <P>The Bible certainly does teach the exciting truth that Jesus 
            Christ will return for His people. Jesus Himself said, “I will come 
            again, and receive you to myself” (John 14:3). I fully believe these 
            words, and long to be ready for that great day. 
            <P><IMG height=170 alt="" hspace=8 
            src="Adventist Review The Left Behind Deception_files/book.jpg" 
            width=115 align=left border=0>Without a doubt, the most quoted 
            passage in the Bible now being used to support the idea of a Rapture 
            is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. Countless Christians know it by 
            heart, and it is cited in <I>LEFT BEHIND: The Movie. </I>Paul wrote 
            that believers in Jesus Christ will someday be “caught up…in the 
            clouds, to meet the Lord in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:17). How 
            wonderful! This will be no imaginary, “Beam me up, Scotty,” event as 
            in the television series <I>Star Trek</I>. On the contrary, it will 
            be very real, and no space suits or oxygen masks will be needed. 
            While I do believe in the return of Jesus, and that believers will 
            someday be “caught up,” there are still some major issues of 
            interpretation I want to examine. The first concerns <I>the 
            timing</I> of our being “caught up,” and the second has to do with 
            <I>the nature</I> of the event itself. 
            <P>Let me explain. According to <I>Left Behind, </I>the return of 
            Jesus Christ actually takes place in two distinct phases. First, 
            Jesus returns silently and secretly, unnoticed by the world. At that 
            moment Christians will be “caught up,” or raptured, which is 
            interpreted as the <I>sudden vanishing</I> of millions of people all 
            over the globe. The rest of mankind, having been left behind, are 
            then ushered into a “seven-year period called the Tribulation” 
            (<I>The Tribulation Force, </I>inside cover, second book in the 
            <I>Left Behind</I> series). During the Tribulation, the Antichrist 
            rises to enforce his deadly mark. At the end of the seven years, 
            Jesus returns visibly before the eyes of all, an event referred to 
            as Christ’s Second Coming

            Thus, according to <I>Left Behind</I>, Jesus first comes silently to 
            rapture away true believers, and then, seven years later, He comes 
            visibly at the very end of the world. With minor variations, this 
            sequence is now accepted by millions of Bible-believing Christians 
            as an accurate picture of end-time events. 
            <P>There are three primary pillars that stand out in this teaching, 
            and it is safe to say that the entire <I>Left Behind </I>house rests 
            firmly on top of each of them. 
            <P><B><I>Pillar 1 </I></B>– The Rapture, when the Church is “caught 
            up” (1 Thessalonians 4:17), does <I>not </I>take place at the 
            visible Second Coming of Jesus Christ, but seven years before it. 
            <P><B><I>Pillar 2</I> </B>– Those who miss the Rapture will have a 
            <I>second chance </I>during the seven years of Tribulation to be 
            saved. 
            <P><B><I>Pillar 3</I></B><I> </I>– The true Church of today will 
            <I>escape the Tribulation</I> and will <I>not</I> have to face the 
            Antichrist and the Mark. 
            <P>Before we go any further, allow me to list three logical 
            alternatives, thus clarifying the issues. 
            <P><B><I>Alternative 1</I></B> – The Rapture, when the Church is 
            “caught up” (1 Thessalonians 4:17), <I>does</I> take place at the 
            visible Second Coming of Jesus Christ at the end of world. 
            <P><B><I>Alternative 2</I></B> – Those who are not ready for the 
            catching up of true believers at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ 
            will have <I>no second chance</I> to be saved. 
            <P><B><I>Alternative 3 </I></B>– The Church of today will <I>go 
            through </I>Earth’s final period of Tribulation and therefore must 
            overcome the Antichrist and the Mark in order to be ready for 
            Christ’s Second Coming. 
            <P>Can you see how serious these issues are? Which view is right — 
            The three pillars of<I> Left Behind,</I> or these three logical 
            alternatives? <I>What does the Bible really say? </I>
            <P>Let’s start with Pillar 1 — The Rapture does <I>not</I> take 
            place at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. As I have already 
            mentioned, the most widely quoted passage about the Rapture is found 
            in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. There Paul wrote, “We which are alive and 
            remain shall be caught up.” Although the word “rapture” doesn’t 
            appear anywhere in the Bible, the idea comes from those two words 
            “caught up.” A simple comparison of verse 17 with verse 15, which 
            says, “We which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord,” 
            makes it very clear that believers will be “caught up” at “the 
            coming of the Lord.” Here is the key issue — <I>At which coming of 
            the Lord? </I>Will believers be caught up at a silent and invisible 
            coming of the Lord, before the Tribulation, as taught in <I>Left 
            Behind </I>or will believers be caught up at the highly visible 
            “Glorious Appearing” of Jesus Christ at the end of the world? Before 
            we read the entire context, it is important to realize that Paul 
            uses a very specific Greek word for “coming” in verse 15. The word 
            is “parousia,” which you can find in any concordance. You may find 
            this a little hard to believe, but a whole lot rides on that one 
            word. If you are a high-tech person, click “Save,” and store that 
            word in your mental computer, for we will come back to it.

 -->Have 
            you ever driven down a highway without realizing how fast you were 
            going, and then, when you finally looked down at your speedometer, 
            you said to yourself, “I’m going too fast and must slow down!”? This 
            is what we need to do when it comes to our study of 1 Thessalonians 
            4. We must slow down and take a full look. As we do, we will 
            discover truth that is not only clear, but also shocking. In fact, 
            the implications are nothing short of cataclysmic. Right in between 
            verses 15 and 17, Paul wrote, “For the Lord himself shall descend 
            from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with 
            the trump [or trumpet] of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise 
            first” (1 Thessalonians 4:16). <I>Left Behind</I> describes this 
            event as silent and secret, yet doesn’t it seem rather loud and 
            visible? There is a shout, a voice, and a trumpet. Have you ever 
            heard of a silent trumpet? Some people have even called 1 
            Thessalonians 4:16 the noisiest verse in the Bible! 
            <P>Now let’s put verses 16 and 17 together: “The Lord himself shall 
            descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, 
            and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. 
            Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with 
            them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we 
            ever be with the Lord.” Honestly, do you see anything in these words 
            about <I>vanishing Christians</I> prior to the Tribulation? Does 
            “caught up” necessarily mean “disappear without a trace”? At the end 
            of His earthly life, Jesus Christ was also “taken up,” (Acts 1:9), 
            but this doesn’t mean He disappeared, leaving His clothes on earth. 
            Instead, in full view of His wondering disciples, <I>“while they 
            beheld</I>, he was taken up; and a cloud received Him out of their 
            sight” (Acts 1:9). Just as Christ’s ascension was highly visible, 
            even so do Paul’s words about a shout, a voice, a trumpet, a 
            resurrection, and believers being “caught up” into the clouds seem 
            quite visible. That is, if we take them literally. 
            <P>Let’s return to 1 Thessalonians and take a look at the entire 
            context: “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a 
            shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: 
            and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and 
            remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet 
            the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 
            Wherefore comfort one another with these words. But of the times and 
            the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For 
            yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as <I>a 
            thief in the night. </I>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; 
            then sudden destruction will come upon them, as travail upon a woman 
            with child, and they shall not escape.” (4:16–5:3, emphasis added). 
            <P>Paul said this tremendous “day of the Lord” will finally arrive 
            like “a thief in the night.” The producers of <I>Left Behind</I> 
            interpret this to mean that Jesus will come like a <I>silent</I> 
            thief to steal believers out of this world before the seven years of 
            Tribulation — then driverless cars will crash, pilotless planes will 
            collide, and babies will be found missing from their cribs. After 
            this the Antichrist will rise, the Mark of the Beast will come, and 
            people will yet have a second chance to be saved. The popular 
            Christian film, <I>A Thief in the Night, </I>which is similar to 
            <I>LEFT BEHIND: The Movie, </I>also presents this perspective. Yet 
            is this really what Paul is saying? 
            <P>Again, let’s slow down and take a closer look at our Biblical 
            speedometers. Paul wrote, “You yourselves know perfectly that the 
            day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. For when they 
            shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon 
            them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape” 
            (1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3).<I> Do you see what Paul is really saying? 
            </I>Jesus’ coming as a “thief in the night” does not mean He will 
            come quietly and invisibly to steal believers out of this world, as 
            is taught in <I>Left Behind. </I>Rather, it means He will come 
            unexpectedly, bringing “sudden destruction” upon the unsaved. 
            <I>Thus it is not a secret coming, but only a sudden one. </I>And 
            what about the unprepared being given a second chance to be saved? 
            Paul clearly answered this question when he wrote, <I>“They shall 
            not escape”&nbsp; </I>(verse 3). 
            <P>Therefore, upon the closest examination, the most widely quoted 
            passage in the Bible used to support the <I>Left Behind </I>idea of 
            a silent return of Jesus Christ, of vanishing Christians, and of 
            people being given a second chance during a subsequent period of 
            Tribulation, <I>doesn’t really say this at all!</I> Paul said Jesus 
            will literally <I>come down from heaven </I>with a noisy shout, a 
            loud voice, and with the blast of a trumpet. This awesome and 
            tremendous “day of the Lord” will come unexpectedly upon all the 
            lost like a thief in the night, resulting in their <I>“sudden 
            </I>destruction.” The apostle Peter also wrote about this same 
            return of Jesus Christ as a thief: “But the day of the Lord will 
            come as <I>a thief in the night, in the which </I>the heavens shall 
            pass away with <I>a great noise, </I>and the elements shall melt 
            with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein 
            shall be burned up” (2 Peter 3:10, emphasis added). According to 
            Peter, the return of Jesus as a thief is definitely not a silent and 
            secret event before any seven-year period of Tribulation. Rather, 
            this day arrives suddenly, with “a great noise,” and is clearly 
            associated with the end of the world! A major crack is starting to 
            form in Pillar 1. 
            <P><IMG height=199 alt="" 
            src="Adventist Review The Left Behind Deception_files/globe.jpg" 
            width=200 align=right border=0>Now let’s go back to that mysterious 
            Greek word, “parousia.” There is absolutely no doubt that Paul used 
            this word to describe the coming of Jesus at which believers will be 
            “caught up” (1 Thessalonians 4:15–17). This same Greek word is also 
            used in a sizzling apocalyptic message given by Jesus Christ Himself 
            in Matthew 24, so we need to take a look at it. On a certain 
            momentous day, “And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, his 
            disciples came unto him privately, saying, ‘Tell us, when shall 
            these things be? and what shall be the sign of <I>thy coming, 
            </I>and of <I>the end of the world?’” </I>(Matthew 24:3, emphasis 
            added). The Greek word there in verse 3 for “coming” is “parousia.” 
            The disciples associated this “coming,” or “parousia,“ with “the end 
            of the world,” and they were anxious to know more about it. 
            <P>The immediate response of Jesus was: “Take heed that no man 
            deceive you” (Matthew 24:4). The forcefulness of this thought should 
            hit us like a hurricane! Why? Because it clearly implies that when 
            it comes to this exact topic of the “coming” or “parousia” of Jesus 
            Christ and the end of the world, there is going to be a great deal 
            of deception whirling around. And what is even more dramatic is that 
            Jesus raised His “Don’t Be Deceived” warning flag <I>four times 
            </I>in this single sermon (Matthew 24: 4, 5, 11, 24). One gets the 
            idea that last-day delusions would someday sweep over planet Earth 
            like a massive tidal wave. The only way to avoid being swept away in 
            this swirling sea of falsehood is to pay close attention to the 
            words of Jesus Christ. 
            <P>Our Lord continued, “For there shall arise false Christs and 
            false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch 
            that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect” 
            (Matthew 24:24). Here Jesus said Satan’s delusions will eventually 
            become so subtle and powerful that only “the elect” will come 
            through unscathed. But who are “the elect”? Based on the context, 
            they must be a group of people who know Jesus Christ and the Bible 
            so well that the devil can’t mislead them. Verse 31 also tells us 
            that “the elect” are people who are ready for the return of Jesus 
            Christ. 
            <P>Immediately after warning about tricky false prophets and 
            deception, Jesus Christ said, “Wherefore if they say unto you, 
            Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the 
            <I>secret</I> chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh 
            out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the 
            coming of the Son of man be” (Matthew 24:26, 27, emphasis added). 
            Here Jesus draws a razor-sharp contrast between false views of His 
            return and the truth. When it comes to false views, don’t miss that 
            little word “secret.” Jesus plainly warned that people will 
            mistakenly “say” His coming will be in “secret.” In fact, based on 
            the context, we discover that this will be one of those powerful 
            delusions which only God’s faithful elect will avoid. So how should 
            we respond when people say Jesus’ coming will be in secret? Christ’s 
            answer is stunning. Jesus said, <I>“Believe it not”</I>! Why? 
            Because “as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even 
            unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” 
            <P>Far from being a secret event, the return of Jesus Christ will be 
            like the brilliant flashing of millions of lightning bolts blazing 
            across the sky. Can you guess what awesome Greek word Matthew used 
            for “coming” in verse 27? It is <I>“parousia,” </I>and this 
            mega-important word is the exact same word Paul used in 1 
            Thessalonians 4:15–17 in his description of that coming of Jesus at 
            which believers will be raptured or “caught up”! In many Hollywood 
            action films, certain files are labeled “Top Secret,” yet when it 
            comes to Bible truth about the “coming,” or “parousia” of Jesus 
            Christ, this return will be <I>anything but secret. </I>The crack in 
            Pillar 1 is getting bigger. 
            <P>Paul plainly said that the Rapture would take place at the 
            “coming” or “parousia” of Jesus Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:15–17). 
            Jesus Himself said His “coming” or “parousia” will be like the 
            brilliant flashing of electrically-charged bolts of lightning 
            hurtling across the sky. The disciples associated this very same 
            awesome “coming” or “parousia” with “the end of the world,” and they 
            asked Jesus what the major “sign” of this “coming” would be (Matthew 
            24:3). After warning about “secret” coming ideas and deception, 
            Jesus finally answered this exact question by lifting the curtain of 
            history and fully unveiling what His high-powered and 
            super-cataclysmic “coming” or “parousia” will really be like: “And 
            then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then 
            shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son 
            of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 
            And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and 
            they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one 
            end of heaven to the other” (Matthew 24:30, 31). 
            <P>This high-impact description of Christ’s return contains an even 
            Bigger Bang than the highly-speculative evolutionary Big Bang 
            theory. The “coming” or “parousia” of Jesus Christ, <I>at which 
            believers will be “caught up,” </I>will be unmistakably 
            <I>visible</I> to “all the tribes of the earth.” The amazed masses 
            of mankind will literally <I>“see </I>the Son of man coming in the 
            clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” Certainly no one will 
            miss it, and no one will wake up the next day wondering where all 
            the Christians went. On that great day, all the unsaved will 
            “mourn.” Why? Not because their loved ones have vanished into thin 
            air, but because Jesus Christ has <I>suddenly come</I>, and now 
            their life of sinning and partying is over. And once again, this 
            will be a very noisy and loud event that will include the echoing 
            of&nbsp; “a great sound of a trumpet” throughout the sky. When that 
            booming blast is heard, billions of shining angels will descend and 
            circle the globe to <I>“gather together </I>his elect from the four 
            winds.” Thus, true believers will be “caught up” into the air. Now 
            don’t miss it. These are the very same elements Paul wrote about in 
            1 Thessalonians 4:17! 
            <P>In <I>both</I> Matthew 24:30, 31, and in 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 
            17, we read about clouds, noise, a trumpet, a gathering together, 
            and believers being transported up into the air. Any concordance 
            will show you that <I>both</I> passages refer to the “coming” or 
            “parousia” of Jesus Christ. In Matthew 24:27, 30, 31, this “coming” 
            or “parousia” <I>unmistakably</I> applies to Christ’s “Glorious 
            Appearing.” As we are to be “caught up together,” let’s put these 
            shocking pieces together. The conclusion is inescapable, 
            unalterable, and irrefutable. True believers will be “caught up” or 
            “raptured” at the loud, climactic, highly-visible, and 
            ultra-glorious Second Coming of Jesus Christ! 
            <P>This book is like a race car whose engine is just beginning to 
            rev up. We have a lot more to cover, so let’s keep going. In Matthew 
            24, after describing His “Glorious Appearing,” Jesus continued: “But 
            of <I>that day </I>and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of 
            heaven, but my Father only. But as the days of Noe were, so shall 
            also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were 
            before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving 
            in marriage, until the day that Noe entered the ark, And knew not 
            until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the 
            coming of the Son of man be. <I>Then</I> shall two be in the field; 
            the one shall be taken and the other left. Two women shall be 
            grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken and the other left. 
            Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But 
            know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch 
            the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have 
            suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for 
            in such an hour as you think not, the Son of man cometh” (Matthew 
            24:36–44, emphasis added). 
            <P>Here Jesus Christ paralleled His return with the sudden descent 
            of billions of tons of water upon the lost in Noah’s day. Those 
            ancient people thought Noah was a crazy old man, until “the flood 
            came, and took them all away; so shall also <I>the coming </I>of the 
            Son of man be” (Matthew 24:39, emphasis added). Can you guess what 
            Greek word is used here again for “coming?” Don’t take my word for 
            it, but look it up yourself in your own concordance. It is 
            <I>“parousia,” </I>which, as we have already proven, clearly applies 
            to the visible “Glorious Appearing” of Jesus Christ. Now notice, 
            <I>immediately</I> after the word “parousia” is used in verse 39, 
            Jesus continued: “THEN shall two be in the field; the one shall be 
            taken and the other left (emphasis added).” This is probably the 
            second most quoted passage in the Bible now being used to support 
            the <I>Left Behind </I>idea of a silent Rapture prior to the 
            Tribulation. Supposedly, when this verse is fulfilled, those who are 
            “taken” will vanish without a trace, leaving only their clothes, 
            shoes, false teeth and wedding rings, while those who are “left” 
            will have to endure the Tribulation, facing the Antichrist and the 
            Mark. But is this really what Jesus Christ is saying? 
            <P>The correct answer to this question will not come by depending on 
            the interpretations of others. Actually, it is never safe to lean 
            wholly on any man. Christians should never be taught to rely 
            completely on Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, or any other popular 
            teacher, including Steve Wohlberg. We should all open our own 
            Bibles, pick up our own concordances, and find out for ourselves 
            what is truth. If you are willing to do this, then this is what you 
            will most definitely find — believers will be “taken” (verse 40) at 
            the “coming” or “parousia” (verse 39) which the Bible clearly 
            applies to the loud, highly-visible, and ultra-glorious Second 
            Coming of Jesus Christ at the end of the world (Matthew 24:3, 27, 
            30, 31, 39)! 
            <P>Jesus basically said, “It will be just like Noah’s day” (verses 
            37–39). Now think about it. Did Noah and his family vanish before 
            the flood? No, they walked visibly into the ark. And what about 
            those who were <I>left behind </I>after the door of the ark was 
            shut? Did they have a second chance? No again. How were they left? 
            <I>They were left dead; they did not escape. </I>After saying, “the 
            flood came, and took them all away,” Jesus made His power-packed 
            point, “so shall also the coming [“parousia”] of the Son of man be” 
            (verse 39). And then, without a break, Christ said, “<I>Then</I> 
            shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken and the other 
            left” (verse 40). Upon careful analysis, these words leave no room 
            for the continuing lives of <I>Left Behind’s </I>Rayford Steele and 
            Buck Williams during the Tribulation after the Rapture. Why not? 
            Because those who are “taken” are taken up at the “coming” or 
            “parousia,” which applies to the final Second Coming of Jesus 
            Christ! 
            <P>Immediately after saying, “One shall be taken and the other 
            left,” the King of the Universe then compared His Second Coming to 
            the sudden arrival of a midnight thief, just like Paul did in 1 
            Thessalonians 5:2, 3. Jesus said: “But know this, if the goodman of 
            the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would 
            have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 
            Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as you think not, 
            the Son of man cometh” (Matthew 24:43, 44). To “watch” doesn’t mean 
            spending endless hours in front of the television set, nor does it 
            mean watching popular movies about the end times that may take 
            detours away from the straight truth. Rather, it means to <I>watch 
            out for deception! </I>
            <P>Matthew 24 and 1 Thessalonians 4 and 5 fit together just as 
            perfectly as Adam and Eve before they sinned. Both describe a noisy, 
            loud, highly visible, trumpet-blasting and ultra-glorious return of 
            Jesus Christ in the clouds. Both describe believers being caught up 
            and transported into the air. Both declare this day will come with 
            thief-like suddenness upon all sleeping sinners. In Noah‘s day, when 
            billions of tons of water came crashing down, there were no second 
            chances for those outside the ark. Paul said the lost “shall not 
            escape.” And both Paul and Matthew use the exact same Greek word to 
            describe this great, tremendous, and awesomely powerful “day of the 
            Lord.” Simply look in your concordance. That word is “parousia,” 
            which clearly refers to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. True 
            believers are urged to watch, be ready, and to avoid all subtle, 
            satanic deceptions. 
            <P>What about the Rapture taking place “in a moment, in the 
            twinkling of an eye”? This is probably the third most quoted passage 
            in the Bible now being used to support the idea of vanishing 
            Christians prior to the Tribulation. We have previously slowed down 
            to look at our Biblical speedometers, yet this time we must come to 
            a screeching halt. Paul wrote, “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We 
            shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. In a moment, in 
            the twinkling of an eye, <I>at the last trump: for the trumpet shall 
            sound, </I>and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall 
            be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51, 52, emphasis added). Is Paul 
            saying that believers will mysteriously vanish from the earth prior 
            to the Tribulation, while their loved ones blink? Not at all! He is 
            saying that the dead will be raised and our bodies will be changed 
            “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.” But <I>when</I> will this 
            “moment” take place? Paul’s answer is clear. It will occur <I>“at 
            the last trump,” </I>when “the trumpet shall sound,” that is, at the 
            end of the world. This is that very same “great sound of a trumpet” 
            Jesus said would be heard at His Second Coming (Matthew 24:31)! 
            Pillar 1 is cracking and crumbling. 
            <P>As we have previously noted, Pillar 2 supporting the <I>Left 
            Behind </I>house is the theory that those who miss the Rapture will 
            have a <I>second chance</I> to be saved during the Tribulation. If 
            you think about it, this idea can be dangerous. Some might 
            rationalize, “If the Rapture really takes place, then I’ll know for 
            sure God is real. It may be tough, but I can still join the 
            Tribulation Force during the seven years. Even if that Antichrist 
            guy tries to kill me, I will still resist the Mark!” While the 
            fostering of this foolish attitude is not the intent of <I>Left 
            Behind</I>, people can easily adopt this “let’s wait and see” 
            position, <I>putting off their decision to follow Jesus Christ. 
            </I>But Paul wrote that all who are not fully on the Lord’s side 
            when believers are “caught up…shall not escape” (1 Thessalonians 
            4:17; 5:3), and there were no second chances in Noah’s day. After 
            the door of the ark closed, all desperate attempts to get inside 
            were useless. Therefore Pillar 2 is becoming like a man diagnosed 
            with cancer — it has very serious problems. 
            <P>If Pillars 1 and 2 supporting the <I>Left Behind</I> house are 
            wrong, and if the logical alternative about the Church being “caught 
            up” at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ is right, then this means 
            that the Church of today is destined to go through the Tribulation, 
            rather than disappearing before it arrives. Yet Christians often 
            resist this conclusion with the argument, “God wouldn’t allow us to 
            go through the Tribulation because He loves us too much!” But think 
            about it. Does He love us any more than He would love the 
            Tribulation Force after the Rapture? Obviously not. Then why would 
            He allow them to go through such a period? Could it be that the 
            doctrine of <I>escaping tribulation </I>is really only catering to 
            our middle-class American tendencies? We like comfort and hate to go 
            through trials, and we can hardly bear it when our TV-dinner 
            lifestyle is threatened. Yet historically, God’s people have gone 
            through intense suffering. All of the disciples of Jesus, except for 
            John, were cruelly murdered. Thousands of the early Christians were 
            literally torn to shreds by wild dogs and lions inside the Coliseum. 
            Millions of others were horribly tortured by the Inquisition and 
            burned to ashes during the Dark Ages. Believers in Russia and China 
            have suffered terribly under Communism, and yet American Christians 
            say, “God wouldn’t allow us go through the Tribulation”! 
            <P>When it comes to this topic of “tribulation,” once again, 
            concordances can come in handy. If you look up the word, 
            “tribulation,” in a <I>Strong’s</I> or <I>Young’s Concordance</I>, 
            you may be shocked to discover that almost every reference describes 
            <I>the suffering of believers. </I>Jesus told His followers, “In the 
            world ye shall have <I>tribulation” </I>(John 16:33). Paul told his 
            early Christian converts, “…we must through much <I>tribulation</I> 
            enter the kingdom of God” (Acts 14:22). Paul wrote to the Church at 
            Thessalonica, “…we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God 
            for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and 
            <I>tribulations </I>that you endure” (2 Thessalonians 1:4). On the 
            lonely isle of Patmos, John was our “brother and companion in 
            <I>tribulation”</I> (Revelation 1:9). Jesus told His Church in 
            Smyrna, “I know thy works, and <I>tribulation” </I>(Revelation 2:9). 
            In the light of these Scriptures, the idea of Christians<I> escaping 
            tribulation</I> seems like fantasy and illusion. 
            <P>Some Christians might respond by saying, “Yes, but those verses 
            are talking about ‘tribulation,’ not <I>‘the </I>Tribulation.’ ” But 
            think about it. If the majority of the Bible’s “tribulation texts” 
            refer to what believers <I>go through, </I>why would God’s Word 
            suddenly shift gears by teaching that <I>“the </I>Tribulation” is 
            something believers will <I>not </I>go through? Even in <I>Left 
            Behind</I>, there are Christians who do go through <I>“the 
            </I>Tribulation” (the Tribulation Force), therefore the thought of 
            Christians going through this period is really not so strange. 
            <P><IMG height=212 alt=""

            width=200 align=left border=0>Many Christians also argue, “If the 
            Church is going through the Tribulation, then why isn’t the Church 
            mentioned after Revelation 4?” Let’s take a closer look. In 
            Revelation 4:1, John was told to “come up hither.” People conclude 
            this represents the Rapture and they think the Church isn’t 
            mentioned anymore. First of all, John did not actually go to heaven 
            in Revelation 4:1, he was simply taken up <I>in a vision, </I>while 
            his toes were still on Patmos. Secondly, the Church <I>is</I> on 
            earth after Revelation 4. How do we know this? Because the Bible 
            says the Antichrist will make “war with <I>the saints</I>” (13:7), 
            then we read about “<I>the faith of the saints” </I>(13:10), and 
            then, during the Mark of the Beast crisis, Revelation refers to 
            “<I>the saints” </I>who keep <I>“the faith of Jesus” </I>(14:12). 
            Some might respond by saying, “Yes, but those are the Tribulation 
            saints after the Rapture, not the Church.” But consider this. Paul 
            wrote his New Testament letters to the “churches of the saints” (1 
            Corinthians 14:33). What does this tell us? It tells us that 
            wherever there are saints, <I>there is the Church! </I>Even if the 
            saints mentioned in Revelation 13 and 14 are only the Tribulation 
            saints after the Rapture, wouldn’t they, as sincere believers in 
            Jesus Christ, <I>still be the Church?</I> 
            <P><I>Left Behind </I>teaches that the Church will not be here for 
            Armageddon. Is this true? The word “Armageddon” occurs in Revelation 
            16:16, which is the great chapter about the falling of the seven 
            last plagues. Right before verse 16, <I>during</I> the time of the 
            seven last plagues, Jesus Christ thunders, “Behold, I come as a 
            thief. Blessed is he that watches and keeps his garments, lest he 
            walk naked and they see his shame. And he gathered them together 
            into a place called in the Hebrew tongue, Armageddon” (Revelation 
            16:15, 16). Did you catch that? Who is Jesus talking to? To the 
            Church! At the time of verse 15, <I>while</I> the seven plagues are 
            falling, which is definitely <I>during</I> the Tribulation, and 
            right before the battle of Armageddon, Jesus Christ has not yet come 
            as a thief! Therefore He must come like a thief <I>at Armageddon, 
            after</I> the Tribulation, and this must be the time when He comes 
            to gather His Church. 
            <P>Like a good Commanding Officer, Paul urged the soldiers of the 
            cross, “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that you 
            may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to 
            stand” (Ephesians 6:13). How can we stand in “the evil day” if we 
            have previously disappeared? Jesus Christ also said, “But he that 
            shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved” (Matthew 24:13). 
            So how long must we endure? <I>To the end</I>. Yet Christ will be 
            with us, that’s why He promised, “I am with you alway, even unto the 
            end of the world” (Matthew 28:20). We can trust Him in this. 
            <P>If everything in this book is true, then what about “the seven 
            years”? The concept of a seven-year period of Tribulation is 
            actually the underlying foundation of the entire <I>Left Behind 
            </I>scenario. Remember, the theory is that first the Rapture takes 
            place, and then comes the seven years of Tribulation. Book Two of 
            the <I>Left Behind </I>novels declares, “The disappearances have 
            ushered in the seven-year period of Tribulation” (<I>The Tribulation 
            Force</I>, inside cover). Book Three reveals, “...the seven-year 
            Tribulation is nearing the end of its first quarter...” (Nicolae, 
            inside cover). Book Six tells us, “It’s the midpoint of the 
            seven-year Tribulation” (<I>The Indwelling,</I> inside cover). Book 
            Eight begins with “...the dawn of the second half of the seven-year 
            Tribulation...” (<I>The Mark</I>, inside cover). Thus this New York 
            Times and Wall Street Journal best-selling series of Christian 
            books, now being endorsed by well-respected Church leaders 
            nationwide, is built completely around this seven-year framework. 
            <P>The Great Granddaddy Bible Text for the entire seven-year 
            Tribulation theory is Daniel 9:27. This passage is the very first 
            verse quoted in <I>LEFT BEHIND: The Movie. </I>Here is what it says: 
            “And he shall confirm the covenant with many for <I>one week,</I> 
            and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice…to cease.” 
            A day in prophecy represents a year (Numbers 14:34, Ezekiel 4:6), 
            thus this famous period of “one week” actually represents seven 
            years. Millions are now applying this to a future seven-year period 
            of Tribulation. “He” is interpreted to be the Antichrist who will 
            make a covenant with the Jews during the Tribulation. Book 6 of the 
            <I>Left Behind </I>novels is called <I>Assassins. </I>The subtitle 
            reads, “Assignment: Jerusalem, Target: Antichrist.” Its focus is 
            “the half-way point of the Global Community’s seven-year protection 
            agreement with Israel” (p. 302). 
            <P>According to <I>Left Behind, </I>immediately after the Rapture, 
            the Antichrist will make this “seven-year protection agreement with 
            Israel.” Yet I wonder how he could accomplish this so quickly right 
            after the Rapture, for wouldn’t he need some time to rise to power? 
            An intrinsic part of this story is the theory that, during the 
            Tribulation, the Jewish temple will be rebuilt and animal sacrifices 
            will be resumed (more on this later). Supposedly, half-way into the 
            Tribulation, the Antichrist will break his “protection agreement” 
            with the Jews and stop the sacrifices, thereby causing them “to 
            cease.” This is how millions of Christians today are now 
            interpreting Daniel 9:27. 
            <P>What many don’t realize is that there is another reasonable 
            interpretation that is quite different. Not only does this alternate 
            view have a great deal of Biblical support, but it has also been 
            taught in the past by many credible Bible scholars who have written 
            respected commentaries which are now in the libraries of pastors 
            across America. One example is the world-famous <I>Matthew Henry’s 
            Bible Commentary. </I>Shockingly, this commentary doesn’t apply 
            Daniel 9:27 to the Antichrist at all, nor does it apply the “one 
            week” to a seven-year period of Tribulation after the Rapture. 
            Rather, it applies it <I>to Jesus Christ, </I>who, after three and 
            one-half years of loving ministry, died “in the midst of the week,” 
            which ultimately caused all animal sacrifices to cease! 
            <P>Here’s the quotation from Matthew Henry’s famous commentary: “By 
            offering himself a sacrifice once and for all he [Jesus] shall put 
            an end to all Levitical sacrifices” (<I>Matthew Henry’s Commentary 
            on the Whole Bible,</I> Vol. IV — Isaiah to Malachi, Complete 
            Edition. New York: Fleming H. Revell Co., 1712, Notes on Daniel 
            9:27, p. 1095). Another excellent Bible commentary written by the 
            well known British Methodist, Adam Clarke, says, “This confirmation 
            of the covenant must take in the ministry of John the Baptist with 
            that of our Lord, comprehending the term of seven years, during the 
            whole of which he might well be said to confirm or ratify the new 
            covenant with mankind” (<I>The Holy Bible with a commentary and 
            critical notes</I> by Adam Clarke, Vol. IV — Isaiah to Malachi. New 
            York: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, Notes on Daniel 9:27, p. 602). 
            Here’s one more from the much-respected <I>Jamieson, Fausset and 
            Brown Commentary</I>: “He shall confirm the covenant — Christ. The 
            confirmation of the covenant is assigned to Him” (Rev. Robert 
            Jamieson, Rev. A. R. Fausset. and Rev. David Brown, <I>A Commentary 
            Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible, </I>Complete Edition. 
            Hartford, CT: S.S. Scranton Co., Notes on Daniel 9:27, p. 641). All 
            of these commentaries are now available electronically on the World 
            Wide Web, so you can easily check these references yourself. 
            <P>Which view is right — the one put forth in <I>Left Behind, </I>or 
            the one described in those old dusty commentaries? Does Daniel 9:27 
            apply to a future seven year period of Tribulation, or was it 
            fulfilled by Jesus Christ 2000 years ago? The only way to find out 
            is by taking a careful look at Daniel 9:27 itself. God’s Word says, 
            “And he shall confirm the <I>covenant</I> with <I>many.” </I>Now 
            take a look at this. Jesus Christ Himself said, “For this is my 
            blood of the new <I>covenant,</I> which is shed for <I>many” 
            </I>(Matthew 26:28, New King James version). Behold a perfect fit! 
            Both use the words “covenant” and “many.” Popular teaching says the 
            Antichrist will make a covenant or “protection agreement” with the 
            Jews and then break it after three and one-half years, yet the Bible 
            actually says, “He shall <I>confirm</I> the covenant with many 
            <I>for one week.” </I>Thus “He” is to <I>confirm</I> the covenant 
            for the full seven years, not break it! And it is not simply “a 
            covenant,” as is commonly understood. No! It is <I>“the 
            covenant”</I> which applies to the New Covenant. Our Lord Jesus 
            Christ is the one by whom <I>“the covenant,…was confirmed”</I> 
            (Galatians 3:17; see also Romans 15:8). In “the midst of the week,” 
            after three and one-half years, Jesus gave His life for us, “causing 
            the sacrifice to cease.” He was the final sacrifice. No more 
            sacrifices are to be offered. Period. (Hebrews 10:12). 
            <P>In my other book, <I>Exploding the Israel Deception,</I> Chapter 
            5 is called “The 70th Week of Daniel Delusion” (see the back of this 
            book for details). There I give many more solid reasons why Daniel 
            9:27 doesn’t apply to the Antichrist at all, but to Jesus Christ 
            alone. The fact is, the entire <I>Left Behind </I>idea of a 
            seven-year period of Tribulation after the Rapture is a grand 
            illusion, a massive mega-myth. It may even go down in history as the 
            Greatest Evangelical Misinterpretation of All Time! The whole 
            concept is like a gigantic bubble. Once Daniel 9:27 is correctly 
            understood, and the sharply-pointed pin of truth is inserted, “Pop! 
            goes the seven years!” 
            <P>I want to conclude this chapter by talking about Pillar 3 which 
            now supports the <I>Left Behind </I>house — The Church of today will 
            <I>escape the Tribulation</I> and will <I>not</I> have to face the 
            Antichrist and the Mark of the Beast. This is the Big One, and it is 
            right here that emotions fly and reason vanishes just as quickly as 
            those disappearing people in <I>LEFT BEHIND: The Movie.</I> Why? The 
            answer is simple. If Pillar 3 is false, and if the Church will not 
            be “caught up” until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, then this 
            obviously means that the Church must <I>first</I> pass through 
            Earth’s final period of Tribulation, and will have to face the 
            Antichrist and the Mark. Many Christians fear such a conclusion, and 
            this is why, many times, underneath the attempt to maintain the 
            doctrine of a Pre-Tribulation <I>Secret </I>Rapture, there often 
            lurks a <I>secret</I> fear of having to face the Mark of the Beast. 
            <P>This reminds me of the tragic deaths of 118 crewmen inside the 
            giant Russian nuclear submarine, Kursk. On Saturday, August 12, 
            2000, way out in the icy waters of the Barents Sea, east-northeast 
            of Moscow, something went terribly wrong. An explosion took place, 
            which was followed by another. The “catastrophe developed at 
            lightning speed,” (<I>Newsweek,</I> Nov. 6, 2000. p. 43) and the 
            doomed sub quickly sank to the bottom of the ocean. <I>Newsweek</I> 
            ran a story on this called, “A Cry From the Deep.” Twenty-three 
            Russians survived the initial blasts and flooding. A letter was 
            later found by deep-sea divers inside a pocket of one of the 
            corpses. The note said, “There are 23 people here....None of us can 
            get to the surface” (<I>Newsweek,</I> Nov. 6, 2000. p. 43). Because 
            help didn’t come quickly enough, they all died. As I have thought 
            about this, I can imagine the <I>feeling of fear</I> in the hearts 
            of those Russian sailors deep down below the calm surface of the 
            water. 
            <P>Fear also lurks below the doctrine of a Pre-Tribulation Rapture. 
            Deep down underneath the surface of many arguments, lies a hidden 
            fear of having to face the Mark of the Beast. This fear may be 
            unconscious, yet often it is there, though it need not be. True 
            Christians can learn a lesson from popular bumper stickers which 
            say, “Fear No Evil.” We don’t need to be afraid. We can trust in 
            Jesus Christ, for hasn’t He promised, “Lo, I am with you alway, even 
            unto the end of the world”? (Matthew 28:20). If the fictitious 
            Tribulation Force in the <I>Left Behind </I>novels can overcome the 
            Antichrist and the Mark of the Beast, <I>then so can we!</I> Yet 
            Christians <I>do</I> fear the Mark, and this fear often prevents 
            them from even reasonably examining the clear Scriptural evidence in 
            favor of a Post-Tribulation gathering of the Church to Christ. And 
            thus, sadly, the Pre-Tribulation Rapture idea has become The Great 
            Evangelical Escape Clause for the Avoidance of the Mark of the 
            Beast! And for those who must have it that way, no amount of 
            Biblical evidence will convince them. Like a triple-bolted door in 
            downtown New York, they are simply closed to the facts. 
            <P>The result? <I>Truth is left behind.</I>
