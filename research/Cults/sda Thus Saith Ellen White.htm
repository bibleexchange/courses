<P>Mrs. White penned a multitude of regulations which she expected faithful 
Adventists to follow. While most Seventh-day Adventists today are unaware of all 
these rules, there are a few who endeavor to follow them all. As you will see, 
many of these restrictions are extreme and go <I>far beyond</I> the Word of God.

<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Do not use drugs</FONT></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"You should <B>avoid the use of drugs</B> and carefully observe 
  the laws of health. If you regard your life you should eat plain food, 
  prepared in the simplest manner, and take more physical exercise. Each member 
  of the family needs the benefits of health reform. <B>But drugging should be 
  forever abandoned</B>; for while it does not cure any malady, it enfeebles the 
  system, making it more susceptible to disease." (<I>Testimonies</I>, vol. 5, 
  p. 311) 
  <P><B>"Drug medication, as it is generally practiced, is a curse</B>. Educate 
  away from drugs. Use them less and less..." <I>Counsels on Health</I>, p. 261

<P>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Quinine is forbidden</FONT></H3>
<P>Quinine, an alkaloid derived principally from the bark of the Cinchona tree, 
is an efficient antipyretic and is used to reduce fever in many diseases. It was 
the only known remedy for malaria until the development in recent years of 
synthetic drugs. Mrs. White placed quinine in the same category as the poisonous 
mercury: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Mercury, calomel, and <B>quinine</B> have brought their amount of 
  wretchedness, which the day of God alone will fully reveal." <I>Spiritual 
  Gifts</I>, Vol. 4A, p. 139 </BLOCKQUOTE>Sadly, some Adventists took her 
seriously and forbid those who were suffering from Malaria from using quinine. 
Her son W.C. White wrote the following in a letter: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"One time while we were in Australia, a brother who had been 
  acting as a missionary in the islands, told mother of the sickness and death 
  of his first-born son. He was seriously afflicted with malaria, and his father 
  was advised to give him quinine, <B>but in view of the counsel in the 
  testimonies to avoid the use of quinine he refused to administer it, and his 
  son died.</B>" (--W. C. White letter, September 10, 1935) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Homeopathic remedies outlawed</FONT></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"In their practice, the physicians should seek more and more to 
  lessen the use of drugs instead of increasing it. When Dr. A came to the 
  Health Retreat, she laid aside her knowledge and practice of hygiene, and 
  administered the little <B>homeopathic</B> doses for almost every ailment. 
  <B>This was against the light God had given</B>. Thus our people, who had been 
  taught to avoid drugs in almost every form, were receiving a different 
  education. I was obliged to tell her that this practice of depending upon 
  medicine, whether in large or small doses, was not in accordance with the 
  principles of health reform." (<I>Manuscript Releases</I> Vol. 13, p. 177) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Do not go to physicians</FONT></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"If any among us are sick, <B>let us not dishonor God by applying 
  to earthly physicians</B>, but apply to the God of Israel. If we follow his 
  directions (James 5:14, 15) the sick will be healed. God's promise cannot 
  fail. Have faith in God, and trust wholly in him, that when Christ who is our 
  life shall appear we may appear with him in glory." (<I>To Those who are 
  Receiving the Seal of the Living God</I>, January 31, 1849) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>NOTE: Mrs. White later reversed herself and went to see physicians quite 
regularly. The SDA church later developed a substantial medical ministry that 
employed many physicians. Hopefully no one followed her early counsel, which was 
obviously not inspired.

<BLOCKQUOTE>"You should be teaching your children. You should be instructing

  are studying how to get something good to eat. You place upon your tables

  fed with the very things that will excite their animal passions, and then you 
  come to meeting and ask God to bless and save your children. <B>How high do 
  your prayers go?</B>" (<I>Testimonies</I>, Vol. 2, p. 362, 1870) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>More Restricted Foods</FONT></H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Children are allowed to eat <B>flesh meats, spices, butter, 
  cheese, pork, rich pastry, and condiments</B> generally. They are also allowed 
  to eat irregularly and <B>between meals</B> of unhealthful food. These things 
  do their work of deranging the stomach, exciting the nerves to unnatural 
  action, and enfeebling the intellect. Parents do not realize that they are 
  sowing the seed which will bring forth disease and death." 
  (<I>Testimonies</I>, vol. 3, p. 136) 
  <P>"Let not any of our ministers set an <B>evil example in the eating of 
  flesh-meat</B>. Let them and their families live up to the light of health 
  reform. Let not our ministers animalize their own nature and the nature of 
  their children."(<I>Spalding and Magan</I>, p. 211) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>NOTE: 
Although she <A href="http://ellenwhiteexposed.com/contra6.htm">ate meat most of 
her life</A>, Mrs. White spent much of her life advocating a pure vegetarian 
diet. Mrs. White prohibited meat eating and allowed for a limited use of eggs, 
milk, and butter. This diet is health-promoting, but it goes far beyond the 
Biblical standard. Jesus left "us an example, that ye should follow his steps". 
(1 Pet. 2:21). How did Jesus eat? 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Clean Meats</B> - Jesus ate Lamb at the Passover supper. (Luke 22:15) 
  <LI><B>Fish</B> - Jesus fed thousands of people with fish. (Matt. 14:19) 
  <LI><B>Eggs</B> - Jesus called eggs a "good gift" for children. (Luke 
  11:12,13) 
  <LI><B>Butter</B> - Jesus ate butter. (Isa. 7:15) </LI></UL>
<P>In 1902, Mrs. White said that the people of God would soon need to stop 
eating dairy products and eggs (see <I>Testimonies</I>, vol. 7, p. 135). It may 
be good that very few followed her advice, because vitamin B12 is only available 
from animal products. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause severe health problems. 
<P>Recently scientists have discovered the importance of Omega-3 fatty acids, 
which are found in fish, meat, and eggs. Omega-3 fatty acids play an important 
role in the proper function of the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous 
functions. Omega-3 fatty acids are very difficult to obtain from a purely 
vegetarian diet. One of these acids, DHA, is important for mental and visual 
function. DHA is found in red meat, animal organ meats, and eggs--all of which 
Mrs. White frowned upon. 
<P>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Desserts are out</FONT></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"It is better to let sweet things alone. <B>Let alone those sweet 
  dessert dishes that are placed on the table</B>. You do not need them. You 
  want a clear mind to think after God's order." (<I>Counsels on Diet</I>, p. 
  328) 
  <P>"Many understand how to make different kinds of cakes, but cake is not the 
  best food to be placed upon the table. Sweet cakes, sweet puddings, and 
  custards will disorder the digestive organs; and why should we tempt those who 
  surround the table by placing such articles before them?" (<I>Youth 
  Instructor</I>, May 31, 1894) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Infants Only to Eat 2 or 3 Times a 
Day!</FONT></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Infants should be allowed only plain food … partaken of at 
  regular periods, not oftener than three times a day, and two meals would be 
  better than three." (<I>Counsels on Diets and Foods</I>, p. 229) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Stop Using Baking Soda</FONT></H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The use of soda or baking powder in bread making is harmful and 
  unnecessary. Soda causes inflammation of the stomach and often poisons the 
  entire system." (<I>Ministry of Healing</I>, p. 300) </BLOCKQUOTE>NOTE: Baking 
soda and powder are simply sodium bicarbonate. Its mode of action in bread 
mainly is to release carbon dioxide gas which produces bubbles and causes the 
dough to rise. This leaves behind sodium which is a component of common table 
salt. The carbon dioxide of course would disappear long before the bread is 
eaten and even if it got into the stomach it is completely harmless. Are we 
really expected to believe that these two harmless substances (especially in 
such small quantities!) can cause inflammation of the stomach and poisoning of 
the entire system? (Dr. Gregory Hunt, <I>Beware This Cult</I>, chap. 10) 
<P>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Vinegar causes many evils (even in salad 
dressing)</FONT></H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The <B>salads are prepared with oil and vinegar</B>, fermentation 
  takes place in the stomach, and the food does not digest, but decays or 
  putrefies. As a consequence the blood is not nourished, but becomes filled 
  with impurities, and liver and kidney difficulty appear. Heart disturbances, 
  inflammation, and many evils are the result of such kind of treatment, and not 
  only are the bodies affected, but the morals, the religious life, are 
  affected."--Letter 9, 1887, <I>Manuscript Releases</I> vol. 2, p. 143-144. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Coffee and Tea are forbidden</FONT></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I saw that the stewards of the Lord have no duty to help those 
  persons who persist in using tobacco, <B>tea, and coffee</B>." Testimonies, 
  vol. 1, p. 224 </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Mustard, pepper, pickles, and cinnamon 
prohibited</FONT></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>Mustard, pepper, spices, pickles</B>, and other things of a 
  like character, irritate the stomach and make the blood feverish and impure." 
  (<I>Ministry of Healing</I>, p. 325) 
  <P>"The mince pies and the <B>pickles</B>, which should <B>never find a place 
  in any human stomach</B>, will give a miserable quality of blood." 
  (<I>Testimonies</I>, vol. 2, p. 368) 
  <P>"Parents who have taught their children to eat unhealthful, stimulating 
  food, all their lives, until the taste is perverted, and they crave clay, 
  slate pencils, burned coffee, tea grounds, <B>cinnamon</B>, cloves, and 
  spices, cannot claim that the appetite demands what the system requires."

  <P>"I was told by my Guide: 'Look ye, and behold the idolatry of My people, to

<BLOCKQUOTE>"They do not blush to witness the exposure of the almost naked 
  limbs. But the limbs thoroughly dressed with warm pants shock their modesty. 
  Such opposition to the pants, which are positively modest, and which protect 
  the limbs from exposure and chilliness, should be supported by sensible 
  reason." (<I>Health Reformer</I>, May 1, 1872) 
  <P>"We cannot, if we would, conceal the fact that women have feet and limbs 
  that were made for use. But in regard to the exposure, this is on the other 
  side of the question. We have traveled extensively the past twenty-five years, 
  and have been eye-witnesses to many <B>indecent exposures of the limbs</B>. 
  But the most common exposure is seen upon the streets in light snow, or wet 
  and mud. Both hands are required to elevate the dress, that it may clear the 
  wet and filth. It is a common thing to see the <B>dress raised one-half of a 
  yard [18 inches/50 cm]</B>, <B>exposing an almost unclad ankle to the sight of 
  gentlemen</B>, but no one seems to blush at this immodest exposure. No one's 
  sensitive modesty seems shocked for the reason that this is customary. It is 
  fashion, and for this reason it is endured. <B>No outcry of immodesty is 
  heard, although it is so in the fullest sense."</B> (Ibid.) 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>NOTE: The Bible teaches modesty in dress, but does not dictate 
that the extremities should be clothed at all times. An examination of Scripture 
will reveal that people worked outside in the fields and on the lakes without 
their extremities covered. Saul prophesied naked, and God even told Isaiah to 
walk around naked for three years: 
<UL>
  <LI>"I am very dark, but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of 
  Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. Do not gaze at me because <B>I am 
  swarthy, because the sun has scorched me</B>. My mother's sons were angry with 
  me, they made me keeper of the vineyards..." Song of Solomon 1:5,6 
  <P></P>
  <LI>That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, 'It is the Lord!' When Simon 
  Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his clothes, for he was 
  <B>stripped for work</B>, and sprang into the sea." John 21:7 
  <P></P>
  <LI>"And he too <B>stripped off his clothes</B>, and he too prophesied before 
  Samuel, and lay <B>naked</B> all that day and all that night. Hence it is 
  said, 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'" 1 Sam. 19:24 
  <P></P>
  <LI>"At that time the LORD had spoken by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, 'Go, 
  and loose the sackcloth from your loins and take off your shoes from your 
  feet,' and he had done so, walking <B>naked</B> and barefoot--the LORD said, 
  'As my servant Isaiah has walked <B>naked</B> and barefoot for three years as 
  a sign...so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians captives...naked 
  and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.'" Isa 20:2-4

Biblical requirement. The Bible tells us that wealthy people attending church 
services in the New Testament wore gold rings (see James 2:2). When the 
"prodigal son" returned from his wanderings, his father, who represented God, 
put a ring on his finger (Luke 15:22). If Jesus was opposed to the wearing of 
rings, why would He represent His Father as putting a ring upon His child?

condemns impurity of thought and action, it never mentions masturbation as a 
sin, much less an abomination. An abomination is a sin which carries the death 
penalty. The Bible lists the sexual abominations in Leviticus 18: 
<UL>
  <LI>Adultery 
  <LI>Homosexuality 
  <LI>Bestiality 
  <LI>Incest </LI></UL>Masturbation is noticeably absent from this list of 
abominations. Once again Mrs. White exceeded the morality of the Bible and took 
it upon herself to elevate masturbation up into the category of abomination. For

  enough for God's holy time to <B>let their beards remain unshaven</B>, their

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I was shown that Sabbathkeeping Adventists <B>should not engage

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I have received letters questioning me in regard to the proper 
  attitude to be taken by a person offering prayer to the Sovereign of the 
  universe. <B>Where have our brethren obtained the idea that they should stand 
  upon their feet when praying to God? One who has been educated for about five 
  years in Battle Creek was asked to lead in prayer before Sister White should 
  speak to the people. But as I beheld him standing upright upon his feet while 
  his lips were about to open in prayer to God, my soul was stirred within me to 
  give him an open rebuke. Calling him by name, I said, 'Get down upon your 
  knees.' This is the proper position always."</B> (Selected Messages, Vol. 2,

<H2><FONT face=arial color=#d01010>Conclusion</FONT></H2>
<P>Some people look at the high standards advocated in Mrs. White's writings and 
ask, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"How could someone with such high standards be a false prophet?" 
</BLOCKQUOTE>The answer is that it is just as much an error to hold the standard 
<I><B>too high</B></I> as it is to hold the standard too low. Solomon once said, 

<CENTER><FONT face=arial color=#dd0077 size=+1><B>Do not be overly 
righteous</B></FONT> Eccl. 7:16 NKJV </CENTER>
<P>There are two paths that lead away from the truth. One leads to immorality, 
the other to fanaticism. The Bible warns us about straying into either of these 
paths: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Let your eyes look straight ahead, and your eyelids look right 
  before you. Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be 
  established. <FONT color=#ff0000>Do not turn to the right or the 
  left</FONT>.</B> Prov. 4:25-27 NKJV </BLOCKQUOTE>Extremes should be avoided 
because they tend to lead people <I>away</I> from God. Let us compare the two 
extremes that lead <I>away</I> from the truth:

<P>The fact that Mrs. White held up high standards is no proof that she was a 
prophet of God. The Prophet Mohammed held up some high standards in the Quran. 
Was he a prophet of God? 
<P>High standards do not equate to righteousness. The Pharisees held up high 
standards and they were condemned by Christ for their wickedness. <B>It is just 
as wrong to go beyond the Word of God and place unnecessary restrictions upon 
people as it is to fail to meet the requirements of God.</B>
