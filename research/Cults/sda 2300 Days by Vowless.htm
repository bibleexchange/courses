      Burrows Ltd., Eliot Street, New Plymouth. —8301.<BR>Published 1933</P>

      <P><B>Note by Editor:</B> This study will show the true Biblical 
      fulfillment of Daniel chapter 8. Vowless, shows that the 2300 days have no 
      future fulfillment to 1844, as claimed by Ellen G. White and the 
      Seventh-day Adventist Church.<I> </I>This is an excellent study to those 
      that have been misled on the true meaning of this prophecy by the 
      Seventh-day Adventist Church. I would like for those that read this study 
      to read and re-read Daniel chapter 8, and get a good understanding of what 
      the beasts represent and that it does not have a future fulfillment in 
      1844 and has nothing to do with chapter 9 of Daniel.</P>
      <P>The real issue is that Daniel 8:14 is misinterpreted and misapplied by 
      Adventists. The factual context is the little horn is attacking the saints 
      and polluting the sanctuary but Adventist through their "Sanctuary 
      Doctrine" have the saints polluting the sanctuary and God judging not the 
      little horn or unbelievers but the saints of all things. The result is 
      SDA's feeling very insecure with a dysfunctional view of their God to live 
      with. If it wasn’t enough that Satan is accusing us, God is investigating 
      us to judge us.</P>

      <P>Many Seventh Day Adventists have wondered and asked me "why, their 
      pastors would not give me a hearing when they knew of my resignation from 
      their church through my not being able to accept there teachings of the 
      2,300 days. Some of the members have asked their pastors in their churches 
      why they have not given me a church hearing, that, if they were right upon 
      the prophecy they should correct me once and for all, and if I were right, 
      then, it was time they knew it; but those pastors would never consent to 
      such a hearing nor even to a private hearing with me. However, when those 
      conscientious seekers for truth read this study, I trust that with fervent 
      prayer they will seek and study carefully, and when they come to see the 
      awful errors of the teachings of their elders, may the Lord convict them, 
      as He has convicted me to enlighten others of the truth, and thus escape 
      from the entangled web of false doctrine.</P>

      <P>We read in the eighth chapter of Daniel of a vision to this effect: 
      —</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And I saw in a vision, and it came to pass, when I saw, that I 
      was' at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw 
      in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood 
      before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; 
      but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so 
      that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could 
      deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became 
      great.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west on 
      the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had 
      a notable horn between his eyes.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen 
      standing before the river, ran unto him in the fury of his power.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and<B> </B>he was moved 
      with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and 
      there was no power in the ram to stand before<B> </B>him, but he cast him 
      down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could 
      deliver the ram out of his hand.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"Therefore the be-goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, 
      the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the 
      four winds of heaven.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed 
      exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the 
      pleasant land.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down 
      some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon 
them.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by 
      him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was 
      cast down.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of 
      transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced 
      and prospered.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that 
      certain saint which spake: How long shall be the vision concerning the 
      daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the 
      sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And he said unto me: Unto two thousand and three hundred days 
      then, shall the sanctuary he cleansed."— Daniel 8:2-14.</P>
      <P>There is no prophecy in the Bible that is given to man without a key to 
      open it and understand the meaning thereof. This is one prophecy of few 
      that is explained by the heavenly messenger himself, therefore we have a 
      vision here and its heavenly interpretation all given in the one 
      chapter.</P>
      <P>In all symbolic prophecies we find beasts representing universal 
      kingdoms or nations of some great international influence. And horns are 
      given to represent kings of smaller nations. And we find this so very 
      plainly given in this chapter that nothing is left for conjecture or 
      doubt, for in the heavenly interpretation we read as follows; —</P>
      <P>"The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and 
      Persia.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>And the rough goat is the king of Grecia, and the great horn that 
      is between his eyes is the first king.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms 
      shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors 
      are come to the full a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark 
      sentences, shall stand up.</P>
      <P><SPAN

      <P>Daniel is here shown two universal kingdoms that were to follow in the

      <P>Firstly Media Persia who was to be followed by Grecia. These two 
      universal kingdoms are the only ones given in this chapter for there are

      we will finally see.</P>
      <P>If it was to be understood that Rome represented "the little horn," 
      then, we would have to depart from the scriptural interpretations of

      <P>After twelve years of conquests and tyranny Alexander died a drunkard's 
      death leaving no successor to the throne. Thus did the great horn become 
      broken. Much jealousy arose between those who were seeking for the throne, 
      causing riots and bloodshed until Grecia was finally divided into four 
      kingdoms: Thrace, under Lysimichus; Egypt, under Ptolemy Soter .Macedonia,

      <P>Continuing the prophecy further we read: "And out of one of them came 
      forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great, toward the South, toward 
      the east, and toward the pleasant land." Daniel 8: 9.</P>
      <P>The " little horn " came out of where? The prophecy says OUT OF ONE OF 
      THEM," meaning out of one of the four horns. And what were the four horns 
      referred to? There is no denying that the horns referred to were the four 
      horns or kingdoms that arose out of the divisions of the he-goat, namely, 
      Thrace, Egypt, Macedonia, and Syria.</P>
      <P>From these plain facts of the prophecy no unbiased Bible student would 
      deny that this "little horn" came out from one of the four divisions or 
      horns named, thus a little kingdom was to arise out of one of these four 
      which were still parts of the he-goat, Grecia. <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">Therefore, the " little horn or king, or kingdom, would 
      STILL BE A PART OF THE ORIGINAL HE-GOAT OR GRECIA</SPAN>.</P>
      <P>I have before me the standard works of Seventh Day Adventists including 
      "Daniel and Revelation," by Uriah Smith. Here, this writer goes to pages 
      of explanation in an effort to try to prove that the "little horn " 
      represents Rome; which has been shown is contrary to every rule of 
      interpretation of the prophecy. He works hard in trying to show that 
      because Rome conquered Macedonia which is one of the kingdoms that came 
      out of Alexander's kingdom, that Rome therefore, came out of Macedonia. It 
      would be just as right to say that because France, under Napoleon, 
      conquered Germany, therefore, France came out of Germany. Or later, that 
      Germany came out of Alsace-Lorraine because she conquered both provinces. 
      For one to write pages of explanation endeavoring to make<B> </B>it appear 
      that Rome came out of Macedonia because she conquered that country shows 
      to what limits men will go to bolster up some creed that they believe in. 
      Any school child will tell you that Rome came out of Italy and from 
      nowhere else.</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Those Bible students of prophecy who are 
      willing to put aside all creeds and who are willing to be led by God's

      errors of Seventh Day Adventists.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>Now turning to the Book of Maccabees we read the following:</P>
      <P>Now it came to pass after that Alexander, the son of Philip the 
      Macedonian, who first<B> </B>reigned in Greece, coming out of the land of 
      Cethim, had overthrown Darius, king of the Persians and Medes:</P>
      <P>"He fought many battles and took the strongholds of all and slew the 
      kings of the earth.</P>
      <P>"And he went through even to the ends of the earth and took the spoils 
      of many nations. And the earth was quiet before him.</P>
      <P>"And he gathered a power and a very strong army: and his heart was 
      exalted and lifted up.</P>
      <P>"And he subdued countries of nations and princes; and they became 
      tributaries to him.</P>
      <P>"And after these things, he fell down upon his bed and knew that he 
      should die.</P>
      <P>"And he called his servants the nobles that were brought up with him 
      from his youth: and he divided his kingdom among them while he was yet 
      alive.</P>
      <P>"And Alexander reigned twelve years: and he died.</P>
      <P>"And his servants made themselves kings everyone in his place.</P>
      <P>"And they all put crowns upon themselves after his death, and their 
      sons after them many years : and evils were multiplied in the earth.</P>
      <P>"And there came out of them a wicked root, Antiochus, the Illustrious, 
      the son of king Antiochus, who had been a hostage at Rome: and he reigned 
      in the hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks." 
      1Maccabees 1:1-11. </P>
      <P>Josephus has the following to say: "And that from them (the four horns 
      of the goat) there should arise a certain king that should overcome our 
      nation, and should take away our political government and should spoil the 
      temple, and forbid the sacrifice to be offered for three years' time…. And 
      indeed it came so to pass that our nation suffered these things under 
      Antiochus Epiphanes, according to Daniel's vision. " — <I>Antiquities,</I> 
      Book 10; chapter XI.</P>
      <P>I know that Seventh Day Adventists will say that neither the book of 
      Maccabees not Josephus is inspired. I will grant that; but no one will 
      deny that Maccabees is authentic history.</P>
      <P>Josephus says of himself, "I have translated the Antiquities out of our 
      sacred books, which I easily could do, since I was a Priest by birth, and 
      have studied that philosophy which is contained in those 
      writings."......... Moreover, when the city of Jerusalem was taken by 
      force, Titus Caesar persuaded me frequently to take whatever I would of 
      the ruins of my country, and said that he gave me leave so to do; but when 
      my country was destroyed, I thought nothing else to be of any value which 
      I could take and keep as a comfort under my calamities; so I made this 
      request to Titus, that,<B> </B>my family might have their liberty; I had 
      also the holy books by Titus's concession."— Life of Josephus, written by 
      himself. Whiston's Josephus, page 35- It is also written that the "holy 
      books" referred to were the whole of the Old Testament.</P>
      <P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">So Josephus not only had access to the 
      Scriptures as a priest but actually owned them at the destruction of 
      Jerusalem. And so, Josephus is recognized as the greatest Jewish historian 
      that ever lived.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Uriah Smith in his "Daniel and Revelation" quotes from Josephus and 
      from Maccabees often enough when it suits him, as also did Mrs. White copy 
      nearly all the apocrypha into her books.</P>
      <P>Now let us come back to our prophecy of the "little horn."</P>
      <P>Rollin's Ancient History referring to Antiochus Epiphanes being the 
      fulfillment of the prophecy, says: "No prophecy was ever fulfilled in so 
      clear, so perfectly and so indisputable a manner."</P>
      <P>Talking of Antiochus Epiphanes in "Art. Seleucid Dynasty," the 
      Encyclopedia Britannica, vol. 24, page 605, says: "…..he is doubtless the 
      monarch described in the psuedo prophetic chapters of Daniel."</P>
      <P>A most full account of the doings of Antiochus Epiphanes, and the 
      cleansing of the sanctuary, in the fulfilling of the prophecy is given in 
      Historians History of the world, vol. 2, pages 140-156.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><A name=ExceedingGreat><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">"EXCEEDING GREAT"</SPAN></A><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red"><O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>Studying further we read: "Out of one of them came forth a "little 
      horn" which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, 
      and toward the pleasant land." Daniel 8:9.</P>
      <P>Having discovered the "little born," the next phrase to discover is 
      exceeding great."</P>
      <P>Here, Seventh Day Adventists again try to bring Rome into the prophecy 
      this way: the ram or Media-Persia became "great," and the he-goat or 
      Grecia became "very great" as kingdoms, but the "little horn" became 
      "exceeding great," therefore "It" must become a greater empire than either 
      Medo-Persia or Grecia, and as Rome was the next universal kingdom and the 
      greatest of all kingdoms, must be the fulfilling of the prophecy of the 
      "little horn" which waxed "exceeding great."</P>
      <P>If we would let God's spirit guide us in the interpretation we would 
      read the full phrase that is in question, and not cut off any of it. In 
      doing so, we would understand that "out of one of them came forth a little 
      horn, which waxed exceeding great TOWARD the south, TOWARD the east and 
      TOWARD THE PLEASANT LAND," and not to be a greater kingdom than either 
      Medo-Persia or Grecia.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><SPAN style="COLOR: red">"IN 
      THE LATTER TIME OF THEIR KINGDOM"<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>Another stated fact of the prophecy which must not be overlooked is as 
      follows: "And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors 
      are come to the full a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark 
      sentences, shall stand up." Daniel 8: 21-22.</P>
      <P>"In the latter time of their (four horns) kingdom."</P>
      <P>Therefore, before the end of these four kingdoms or divisions of 
      Grecia, and before Rome comes into history as a universal kingdom, this 
      "little horn" was to rise. These four kingdoms out of Alexander's kingdom 
      must be still ruling as kingdoms when this "little horn " was to come, 
      this is a<I> </I>prominent fact in the prophecy.</P>
      <P>The first of these four kings began to reign in the year B. C. 306 and 
      continued till 65 B. C. And Antiochus Epiphanes reigned from 175 B. C. to 
      164 B. C. Therefore he did reign in the latter times of their kingdoms</P>

      <P>The next important expression to study is the fact that the prophecy 
      says, "Out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding 
      great toward the SOUTH and toward the EAST, and toward the PLEASANT LAND." 
      Daniel 8 9.</P>

      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">As 
      Given by the Prophecy<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></I></P>
      <P>I have on the chart here the four horns take the same place as the four 
      heads of the leopard, beast of Daniel 7:9. The four kingdoms were Egypt, 
      Thrace, Macedonia, and Syria; and out of one them comes forth a "little 
      horn," Antiochus Epiphanes;" (in the chart I have rather a long horn with 
      the idea of showing more plainly the direction taken in its warfare). 
      According to the prophecy the "little horn " was to first go to the 
      SOUTH.</P>
      <P>"And the kingdom was established before Antiochus: and he had a mind to 
      reign over the land of Egypt, that he might reign over two kingdoms. And 
      he entered Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants and 
      horsemen and a great number of ships: and he made war against Ptolemee, 
      king of Egypt; but Ptolemee was afraid at his presence and fled, and 
      many<B> </B>were wounded unto death. And he took the strong cities in the 
      land of Egypt and he took the spoils of the land of Egypt." Maccabees 
      1:17-19<B>.<O:P> </O:P></B></P>
      <P>Thus did Antiochus Epiphanes wax GREAT TOWARD THE SOUTH— to Egypt in 
      the 143rd year (of the kingdom of Grecia).</P>
      <P>The next direction was TOWARD THE EAST. (Persia)<BR>"And he was greatly 
      perplexed in mind and purposed to go into Persia and to take tributes of 
      the countries and to gather much money."</P>
      <P>"So the king took half the army that remained and went forth from 
      Antioch, the chief city of his kingdom, in the 147th year and he passed 
      over the river Euphrates and went through the higher countries." Maccabees 
      3: 31-37. Again Antiochus fulfills the prophecy.</P>
      <P>The last direction which is TOWARD THE PLEASANT LAND, I shall fully 
      explain after showing another fulfillment of the prophecy which comes in 
      here.</P>

      style="COLOR: red">THE POLLUTING OF THE SANCTUARY</SPAN></A><SPAN

      <P>During a period which was to begin sometime after "his rising" and 
      before his ultimate end it is said "And it waxed great, even to the host 
      of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the 
      ground, and tramped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the 
      prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the 
      place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against 
      the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth 
      to the ground, and it practiced and prospered." Daniel 8:10-12.</P>
      <P>Certainly he could not do these things after he came to his end, 
      therefore it must be done during his reign. We shall now study Antiochus's 
      attitude toward the sanctuary, the host, and stars. (The host of heaven 
      would be God's people and the stars would be the leaders of that host, 
      such as the priests).</P>
      <P>"And after Antiochus had ravaged Egypt in the hundred and forty-third 
      year,<SPAN style="COLOR: red"> </SPAN>he returned and went up against 
      Israel. And he went up to Jerusalem with a great multitude. And he proudly 
      entered into the sanctuary and took away the golden altar and the 
      Candlestick of light and all the vessels thereof and the table of 
      proposition (showbread) and the pouring vessels and the vials and the 
      little mortars of gold and the vail and the crowns and the golden 
      ornaments that were before<B> </B>the temple and he broke them all in 
      pieces. And he took the silver and gold and the precious vessels and he 
      took the hidden treasures which he found. And when he had taken all away 
      he departed into his own country."</P>
      <P>"And king Antiochus wrote to all his kingdom that all the people should 
      be one and every one should leave his own law. And all nations consented 
      according to the word of king Antiochus. And many of Israel consented to 
      his service: and they sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath. And 
      the king sent letters by the hands of messengers to Jerusalem and to all 
      the cities of Judah: that they should follow the law of the nations of the 
      earth, and should forbid holocausts and sacrifices and atonements to be 
      made in the temple of God. And should prohibit the sabbath and the 
      festival days, to be celebrated. And he commanded the holy places to be 
      profaned and the holy temple of Israel. And he commanded altars to be 
      built, and temples, and idols, and swine's flesh to be immolated 
      (sacrificed), and unclean beasts." I Maccabees I: 2I-24: 43-30.</P>
      <P>On the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred and 
      forty-fifth year, king Antiochus set up the abominable idol of desolation 
      upon the altar of God. And they built altars throughout all the cities of 
      Judah round about. And they burnt incense and sacrificed at the door of 
      the houses and in the streets. And they cut in pieces and burnt with fire 
      the books of the law of God. And every one with whom the books of the 
      testaments of the Lord were found and whosoever observed the law of the 
      Lord, they put to death, according to the edict of the king." I Maccabees 
      1:57-60.</P>
      <P>Thus and very much more did Antiochus Epiphanes do in this direction in 
      the fulfilling of the prophecy.</P>
      <P>I have quoted freely from the Book of Maccabees which no one will deny 
      is authentic history, and Josephus verifies it all in his volumes.</P>
      <P>"It was after this abolition of the practices of the true religion that 
      Antiochus Epiphanes set up the (first) "abomination of desolation," on the 
      altar of burnt offering, in the shape of an altar to the Olympian Zeus. 
      This and further persecution of the Jews who adhered to their religion 
      brought hostilities against those who loyally refused to give up their 
      creed. The struggle went on for some time, till Judas completely defeated 
      the troops of Antiochus's regent Lysias, became master of almost the whole 
      country; and restored the daily sacrifices." (Eadie's Biblical 
      Encyclopedia, page 36.</P>
      <P>"The chief fury of Antiochus's (Epiphanes) impetuous rage was directed 
      against the Jews in evident from the fact that, whilst a general edict was 
      published, condemning to death or torture all those who refused to worship 
      the idols, a special decree was promulgated, by which it was made death to 
      offer sacrifices to the God of Israel, observe the sabbath, practice 
      circumcision, or indeed to conform in the smallest degree to the precepts 
      of the Mosaic Law<I>." </I>(<I>History for ready reference,</I> vol.

      intended by this somewhat odd expression, namely, the transformation, 
      (abomination of desolation) by Antiochus Epiphanes, of the sacred temple 
      at Jerusalem to a heathen one.<SPAN

      <P>"A roya<B>l </B>decree (issued by king Antiochus Epiphanes) proclaimed 
      the abolition of the Jewish mode of worship; sabbath and festivals were 
      not to be observed; circumcision was not to be performed the sacred books 
      were to be surrendered ; and the Jews were compelled to offer sacrifices 
      to the idols that had been erected." (The Jewish Encyclopaedia, vol. 1,

      <P>While such tyranny was over-riding the Jews, Mattathias, a strong and 
      noble priest stood up in defiance of the king: and though he had to flee, 
      he had many followers but before he could strengthen his men for the 
      purpose of defeating Antiochus, he died, and the leadership fell to his 
      third son, Judas Maccabees, who was thoughtfully strong and was determined 
      to crush the villain who was devastating God's holy people and sanctuary. 
      While Judas was strengthening his band —Antiochus had left the country to 
      carry on his warfare against Persia. But when the news of Judas's rising 
      and his followers, he swore to avenge himself upon all the Jews, and so 
      divided his army sending half his men toward Judah to crush the Jews under 
      the leadership of Lysias his chief counselor.</P>
      <P>"Then Lysias chose Ptolomee, the son of Dorymenus, and Nicanor, and 
      Georgias, mighty men of the king's friends. And he sent with them forty 
      thousand men and seven thousand horsemen, to go into the land of Judah and 
      to destroy it according to the king's orders. So they went forth with all 
      their power and came and pitched near Emmaus in the plain country." I 
      Maccabees 3: 38-40.</P>
      <P>"And Judas and his brethren saw that the evils were multiplied and that 
      the armies approached to their borders; and they knew the orders of the 
      king had given to destroy the people and utterly abolish them. And they 
      said every man to his neighbor:" Let us raise up the low condition of our 
      people and let us fight for our people and our sanctuary. And the assembly 
      was gathered that they might be ready for battle.</P>
      <P>"And after this Judas appointed captains over the people, over 
      thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</P>
      <P>"So they removed the camp and pitched on the south side of Emmaus. And 
      Judas said: "Gird yourselves and be valiant men and be ready against the 
      morning, that you may fight with these nations that are assembled against 
      us to destroy us and our sanctuary. For it is better for us to die in 
      battle than to see the evils of our nation and of the holies." I Maccabees 
      3: 42-44.</P>
      <P>The next day they came confronted with six thousand of Georgias's army. 
      "And Judas said to the men that were with him: "Fear ye not their 
      multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault. Remember in what manner 
      our fathers were saved in the Red Sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with a 
      great army."</P>
      <P>"And they joined battle and the Gentiles were routed and fled into the 
      plain. But all the hindermost of them fell by the sword. And they pursued 
      them as far as Gezoron, and even to the plains of Idumea and to Azotus and 
      Jamnia. And there fell of them to the number of three thousand men and 
      Judas returned again with his army that followed him.</P>
      <P>"And when Georgias saw that his men were put to flight and that they 
      had set fire to the camp ; for the smoke was seen declared what was done. 
      And when they had seen this, they were seized with a great fear, seeing at 
      the same time Judas and his army in the plain ready to fight. So they all 
      fled away into the land of the stranger.</P>
      <P>"So Israel had a great deliverance that day.</P>
      <P>"And such of the strangers that escaped went up and told Lysias all 
      that had happened. And when he heard these things, he was amazed and 
      discouraged; because things had not succeeded in Israel according to his 
      mind and as the King bad commanded." I Maccabees 4: 8, 9, 14-16, 20-22,<B> 
      </B>25-27.</P>
      <P>The following year Lysias took an army of sixty-five thousand men and 
      marched again upon the Jews only to be defeated once more by Judah and his 
      men.</P>

      style="COLOR: red"><O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>Now King Antiochus was in Ecbatana when he heard the news And swelling 
      with anger he thought to revenge upon the Jews the injury done by them 
      that had put him to flight. And therefore he commanded his chariot to be 
      driven without stopping in the journey, the judgment of heaven urging him 
      forward, because he had spoken so proudly, that he would come to Jerusalem 
      and make it a common burying-place of the Jews.</P>
      <P>"But the Lord, the God of Israel, that seeth all things, struck him 
      with an incurable and invisible plague. For as soon as he ended these 
      words, a dreadful pain in his bowels came upon him and bitter torments of 
      the inner parts.</P>
      <P>"And indeed very justly seeing he had tormented the bowels of others 
      with many and new torments, albeit he by no means ceased from his 
      malice.</P>
      <P>"Moreover being filled with pride, breathing out fire in his anger 
      against the Jews and commanding the matter to be hastened, it happened as 
      he was going with violence that he fell from his chariot, so that his 
      limbs were much pained by a grievous bruising of the body.</P>
      <P>"Thus he that seemed to himself to command even the waves of the sea, 
      being proud above the condition of men, and to weigh the heights of the 
      mountains in a balance, now being cast down to the ground, was carried in 
      a litter, bearing witness to the manifest power of God in himself.</P>
      <P>"So that worms swarmed out of the body of this man, and whilst he lived 
      in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell off and the filthiness of his smell was 
      noisome to the army.</P>
      <P>"And the man that thought a little before he could reach to the stars 
      of<B> </B>heaven, no man could endure to carry, for the intolerable 
      stench. And by this means, being brought from his great pride, he began to 
      come to the knowledge of himself, being admonished by the scourge of God, 
      his pains increasing every moment.</P>
      <P>"And when he himself could not now abide his own stench, he spoke thus: 
      "It is just to be subject to God and that a mortal man should not equal 
      himself to God."</P>
      <P>"Then this wicked man prayed to the Lord, of whom he was not like to 
      obtain mercy.</P>
      <P>"Thus the murderer and blasphemer, being grievously struck, as he 
      himself had treated others, died a miserable death in a strange country 
      among the mountains." 2 Maccabees 9: 13, 28.</P>
      <P>Thus has Antiochus Epiphanes thoroughly fulfilled the prophecy in every 
      letter up to this point (and further as we go). After going south, then 
      east, we find that he did wax exceeding great toward the pleasant 
land.</P>
      <P>The manner, and unusual death of Antiochus by the scourge of God 
      remarkably fulfilled another statement in the prophecy to the letter: "He 
      be shall be broken without a hand." Daniel 8:25.</P>

      <P>Here again we shall view the standard works of Seventh Day Adventists. 
      Here we have an illustration taken from "Daniel and Revelation" and one 
      glance at this should be quite sufficient to convince any unbiased Bible 
      student, that the application of Rome to this prophecy is being forced 
      against all the principals laid down by God in the studying of the 
      prophecies. Instead of the "little horn " coming out of one of the four 
      horns of Alexander's Empire, their interpretation brings it away from the 
      west (Italy) and when it reaches the Macedonian horn, <B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">"it"</SPAN></B> or Rome blends Macedonia in with 
      <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">"it."</SPAN></B> This is quite opposite the 
      prophecy — where it says that the little horn " was to come out of one of 
      them.</P>
      <P>God, who created all things, and who is perfect in all things, would 
      never give us an imperfect illustration of a beast, as Uriah Smith tries 
      to give us by grafting in a horn from a foreign source into the head of 
      the goat and out again. All horns of the animal kingdom originate within 
      the animal; and in other words "it comes out of the beast." Uriah Smith is 
      therefore contrary to the natural order of things. Anyone knows that Rome 
      did not come out of Macedonia, but out of Italy over 400 years B. C.</P>
      <P>Again it will be noticed from Uriah Smith's illustration that when the 
      Roman horn leaves Macedonia it goes EAST toward Syria, whereas the 
      prophecy says that it would first go SOUTH. The Roman horn then goes SOUTH 
      to Judea, whereas the prophecy says that it would go East. And again, Rome 
      goes further SOUTH to Egypt, whereas the prophecy says that the "little, 
      horn" would then go to the PLEASANT LAND (which is a westerly 
      direction).</P>
      <P>Again it will be noticed that the Roman horn goes on its march to 
      Syria, 65 B. C.; to Judea, 63 B .C.; and to Egypt 30 B. C., that is, AFTER 
      THESE KINGDOMS OF THE FOUR HORNS HAVE COME TO THEIR END. For they came to 
      their end in 65 B. C. when Rome came over and conquered them as a 
      universal kingdom. Whereas the prophecy distinctly says that "IN</P>
      <P>THE LATTER TIME OF THEIR KINGDOM — IN THE LATTER TIME OF THE REIGN</P>
      <P>OF THE FOUR HORNS, would this "little horn" rise up AND NOT AFTER THEY 
      HAD COME TO THEIR END.</P>
      <P>The statement in verse 17 for "at the time of the end shall be the 
      vision" does not apply to the time of the end of the world's history as 
      taught by S.D.A.'s for this applies to no other time than the time of the 
      end of the Jewish nation; before it becomes subject to Rome which fits 
      with every detail of the prophecy. This fact must not be overlooked that 
      this prophecy or vision was given to Daniel 553 B. C.</P>
      <P>Antiochus Epiphanes fulfilled all this prophecy in every detail, and it 
      is nothing short of rank dishonesty to teach or try to teach that Rome was 
      the fulfillment of this prophecy. Paul said that "in the latter times some 
      would be speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a 
      hot iron." — and ALL TO SUSTAIN A <I>CREED.<O:P> </O:P></I></P>

      style="COLOR: red">"THE WORD DAYS"</SPAN></A><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red"><O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>The next most interesting part of this prophecy to be dealt with is the 
      2,300 DAYS more especially as Seventh Day Adventists claim that this 
      period of time extended to and ended in October 22, 1844.</P>
      <P>The prophecy reads as follows: "Then I heard one saint speaking and 
      another saint said unto<B> </B>that certain saint which spake, How long 
      shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression 
      of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under 
      foot?" Daniel 8: 13.</P>
      <P><B>The question here asked is</B>—how long shall such desolation by 
      Antiochus be allowed to continue, and how long shall the sanctuary be 
      polluted by such abomination of worship as set up by Antiochus, and how 
      long shall the daily sacrifice be abolished there being two sacrifices per 
      day-one in the evening and one in the morning.</P>
      <P><B>The answer is</B> "unto two thousand and three hundred days; then 
      shall the sanctuary be cleansed." — verse 14.</P>
      <P>No doubt it will absolutely astonish Seventh Day Adventists to know 
      that the word "days" is not in the original, and hence the "day for a year 
      " cannot justly be applied to this text; here again there is no such 
      prophecy as 2,300 years extending to 1844, for the word "day" does not 
      appear at all.</P>
      <P>The Hebrew word for day is "yom," and this word is translated in the 
      Old Testament 1,153 times. And the Hebrew word for days is "yamin" and 
      this, Word is translated in the Old Testament 657 times. Further, the word 
      "yom" is found 6 times in the Book of Daniel, and the word "yarnin" is 
      found 25 times in thc same book, making 31 times in all — BUT NEITHER OF 
      THESE WORDS APPEAR IN Daniel 8 : 14.</P>
      <P>SURELY GOD'S MIND IS NOT THAT SMALL HE HAS TO RELY UPON A SECT OF 
      PEOPLE TO CORRECT HIS VISIONS OR PROPHECIES AND TO SAY WHAT HE MEANT. IF 
      GOD INTENDED THE PROPHECY TO MEAN YEARS, HE ALONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT 
      WORD TO HAVE USED AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO.</P>
      <P>So the word "days" in Daniel 8:14 is not a translation but an 
      INTERPRETATION for the word "days" is used to interpret two Hebrew Words 
      "ereb" meaning "evening;" and "boqer" meaning "morning," as given by the 
      following translators; —</P>
      <P>"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and 
      mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."- R.V. and A.S.V.</P>
      <P>"And he said unto him, Unto two thousand and three hundred 
      evening-morning — then shall the sanctuary be vindicated."-Rotherham.</P>
      <P>"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand three hundred evenings and 
      mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."-Moulton.</P>
      <P>"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and 
      mornings; then shall the sanctuary be victorious."-Jewish Translation. 
      Masoretic Text.</P>
      <P>"And he replied to him, For two thousand three hundred 
      evening-mornings, after which the sanctuary will be sanctified." —Farrar 
      Fenton.</P>
      <P>"And he said unto me, Till evening-morning two thousand and three 
      hundred, then is the holy place declared right."-Young.</P>
      <P>Some will say, is that not the same, "the evening and the morning were 
      the first day?" <B>No</B>, it is not the same, for the main question asked 
      is how long would the sacrifices be abolished: and the angel answers by 
      giving the number of sacrifices and there were two sacrifices per day. As 
      the translators have supplied the word sacrifices in verses 11, 12 and 13, 
      so should they have rendered the correct translation and applied the word 
      "sacrifices" in verse 14, and we would have the true meaning, thus: "Unto 
      two thousand three hundred <SPAN style="COLOR: red">evening and morning 
      sacrifices,</SPAN> then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."</P>
      <P>There are two wrong translations in this text which I shall explain 
      later, after my<B> </B>dealing with the sacrifices that were 
abolished.</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Some Seventh Day Adventists may take exception 
      to my stating that the word "days" is wrongly translated, by saying that 
      if a word here and one there is wrongly translated, how can we be sure of 
      any being correct.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>But my method of going back to the original Hebrew for the more correct 
      translation is the method also used by S.D.A.'s when it serves their 
      purpose of proving some of their teachings. We all know that to translate 
      one set of writings into another language it is often difficult to give an 
      exact literal translation of every single word for it often happens that 
      the word expressing one particular shade of meaning does not exist in the 
      other language, and a phrase or sentence has to express as near as 
      possible the same meaning; hence, this is the difficulty often met up with 
      by Bible translators.</P>

      <P>Having fully explained the abolition of the sacrifices by Antiochus and 
      of Judas's triumphant rise to victory for the cause of God, we will again 
      take up his career from then on : —</P>
      <P>"Then Judas and his brethren said: Behold our enemies are discomforted 
      let us go up now to cleanse the holy places and to repair them.</P>
      <P>"Then Judas appointed men to fight against them that were in the castle 
      till they had cleansed the holy places. And he chose priests without 
      blemish whose will was set upon the law of God. And they cleansed the holy 
      places and took away the stones that had been defiled into an unclean 
      place." I Maccabees 4: 36-41-43.</P>
      <P>"And they set the loaves upon the table and hung up the vails and 
      finished all the works that they had begun to make and they rose before 
      the morning of the five and twentieth day of the ninth month (which is the 
      month of Casleu) in the hundred and forty-eighth year. And they offered 
      sacrifices according to the law upon the new altar of holocausts which 
      they had made.</P>
      <P>"And Judas and his brethren and all the church of Israel decreed, that 
      the day of the dedication of the altar should be kept in its seasons from 
      year to year, for eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month 
      of Casleu with joy and gladness." I Maccabees 4: 51, 53, 59.</P>
      <P>Here is another statement from Josephus : —</P>
      <P>"When, therefore, the generals of Antiochus's armies had been beaten so 
      often, Judas assembled the people together, and told them that after these 
      many victories which God had given them, they ought to go up to 
      Jerusalem<B> </B>and purify<B> </B>the temple (cleanse the sanctuary) and 
      offer the appointed sacrifices…..When, therefore, he had carefully purged 
      (cleansed) it, and had brought in new vessels, the candlesticks, the table 
      (of shewbread), and the altar (of incense), which were made of gold, he 
      hung up the vails at the gates, and added doors to them;<SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red"> </SPAN>he also took down the altar (of burnt offering) 
      and built a new one of stones that he had gathered together, and not of 
      such as were hewn with iron tools. So on the twenty-fifth day of the month 
      Casleu, which the Macedonians called Apellus, they lighted the lamps that 
      were on the candlesticks and offered incense upon the altar (of incense), 
      and lay loaves of bread upon the table of (shewbread), and offered burnt 
      offerings upon the new altar (of burnt offerings)…..And this DESOI.ATION 
      CAME TO PASS ACCORDING TO THE PROPHFCY OF DANIEL, WHICH WAS GIVEN 408 
      YEARS, BEFORE, FOR HE DECLARED THAT THE MACEDONIANS WOULD DISSOLVE THE 
      WORSHIP (FOR SOME TIME)…..AND FROM THAT TIME TO THIS WE CELEBRATE THIS 
      FESTIVAL AND CALL IT LIGHTS."—<I>Antiquities of Jews,</I> Book 7.</P>

      style="COLOR: red"><O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>Again, the word "cleanse" should not be used with the same strength as 
      S.D.A.'s put upon it. The authorized version's marginal reading is 
      "justified."</P>
      <P>Barnes makes this comment: "In the form here used (niphal), it means to 
      he declared just; to be justified or vindicated, and, as applied to the 
      temple or sanctuary, to be vindicated from violence or injury, that is, to 
      be cleansed."</P>
      <P>In the Danish and Swedish Bibles it is translated shall have its right 
      again."</P>
      <P>Doubtless the real meaning is 'vindicated" as it is given by Genesis; 
      also given by Dr. Young; and Dr. Leipshutt, who is employed by the 
      Federation of Churches also gives it the same meaning.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><SPAN

      NUMBER 2,300"<O:P> </O:P></A></SPAN></P>
      <P>Now the next important part of this prophecy to be considered is the 
      number 2,300 which no doubt is a numerical error according to the earliest 
      versions which give the number to be 2,200.</P>
      <P>When Jesus was on earth He used the original which gave the rendering 
      2,200 the same rendering as is also given by the older copies of the Book 
      of Daniel, noticed by the translator of the Vulgate, Jerome. While the 
      Septuagint gives the number 2,400.</P>
      <P>Now Jesus who " knew the end from the beginning," read 2,200 and he 
      WOULD KNOW that the Septuagint would give 2,400, and that Our, DAY 
      TRANSLATIONS would give 2,300.</P>
      <P>When He was at the feast of the dedication, which is "the feast of 
      lights" set up by Judas to be held ever year in honour of the cleansing of 
      the sanctuary; WOULD HE NOT HAVE PASSED SOME COMMENT upon this if it 
      carried ANY significance at all (for He had much to say about the keeping 
      of the commandments for He knew that they would be tampered with), but He 
      never said anything whatever regarding it, for it had already been 
      fulfilled and there was no more to it.</P>
      <P>However, I shall outline the fulfilling of the prophecy to the actual 
      number of' sacrifices that were abolished.</P>
      <P>"On the fifteenth day, of the month Casleu, in the one hundred and 
      forty-fifth year, king Antiochus set up the abominable idol of desolation 
      upon tile altar of God."- I Maccabees I:57.</P>
      <P>On that day Antiochus put all end to the Jewish evening and morning 
      sacrifices; but Judas "……. arose before the morning on the five and 
      twentieth day of the ninth month (which is the month Casleu) in the 
      hundredth and forty-eighth year. And they offered sacrifices according to 
      the law upon the new altar of holocausts which they had made." —1 
      Maccabees 4 : 52, 53.</P>
      <P>The Jewish religious year was counted by the moons, each new moon was 
      the beginning of a new month, and they counted the number of days in the 
      month to be 29 in one and 30 in the next respectively. The year contained 
      12 months Of 354 days, and ever third year they added an extra month of 29 
      days to equalize it with the solar year.</P>
      <P>Now we have from the 15th day of Casleu 145<SUP>th</SUP> year to 
      25<SUP>th</SUP> of Casleu, 148<SUP>th</SUP> year.</P>
      <P>It will have been noticed that the sacrifices were offered up on the 
      25<SUP>th</SUP> of Casleu, 148<SUP>th</SUP> year, therefore those 
      sacrifices could not be counted, for the number given is of the sacrifices 
      abolished and they would end on 24<SUP>th</SUP> of' Casleu 
      148<SUP>th</SUP> year; so we have :—</P>

      DANIEL'S VISION, AND WHAT HE WROTE YEARS BEFORE, THEY CAME TO PASS."</P>

      <P>As the reverend pastors would not come near to study with me upon the 
      "2,300 days"—I know that since I have put this study into print, they will 
      use the same old method, upon their members of throwing soft soap in their 
      eyes, in order to blind them to the true facts.</P>
      <P>Again I challenge them to produce the original word for "days" in Dan. 
      8:14.</P>
      <P>Again I challenge them to produce the original of the number "2,300" in 
      Dan. 8 : 14-</P>
      <P>Again I challenge them upon the whole prophecy of Daniel 8:1-27.</P>
      <P>"Howl, ye shepherds, and cry: and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye 
      principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your 
      dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant 
vessel.</P>
      <P>"And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the, 
      flock to escape.</P>
      <P>"A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the principal of 
      the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture."

      </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>From "The Narrow Way" newsletter January 1995, Titled Daniel 8:14 
      Revisited. "(Some versions say 2300 days; a few say 2400 days. Jerome, the 
      church father who translated the Latin Vulgate Bible preferred the 2200 
      days. We don't have the original book of Daniel, only copies of it, so we 
      don't know whether 2200, 2300, or 2400 is what Daniel actually wrote.) The 
      eight copies of the book of Daniel found in the Dead Sea Scrolls are the 
      oldest copies we have, so probably the most accurate. In all eight copies, 
      the number is torn out and missing, which seems like an extreme 
      coincidence or an act of deception. Did that number really wear out of all 
      eight copies? I doubt it. Did the Essenes tear it out of all eight copies 
      for some reason? I doubt it. Did the Dead Sea Scrolls for nearly 50 years 
      tear it out? I don't know. Why would they?" (The Third Millennium page 308 
      by Paul Meier.)</P>
      <P>"The allegations by Paul Meier are worth looking into. Could it be that 
      those, who discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls and who came into possession of 
      these copies of the book of Daniel, were so locked in on the prevailing 
      opinions centered around "2300 days" that they would go to the extent of 
      altering 8 copies? </P>
      <P>If Daniel really wrote 2200, an interesting thing happens. Since there 
      is both an evening and a morning sacrifice in one day, <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN class=590050800-04082003>which the 
      daily temple services would be suspended by the pagans. If so, 1100 days 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>(two sacrifices per day) </FONT></SPAN></FONT>then 
      2200 evenings and mornings, are in reality 1100 days or three years and 5 
      days. </P>
      <P>Judas Maccabees went up to Mount Sion three years (after Antiochus' 
      destruction) to start the cleansing of the sanctuary. They could have 
      completed their work by the 21st of the month (exactly 1100 days) in time 
      to offer their sacrifice on the new altar by the 25th of December." (See 
      1st Mach. 4:25)</P>
