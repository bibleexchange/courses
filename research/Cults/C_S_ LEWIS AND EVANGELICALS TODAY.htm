      known as Jack, is extremely popular with evangelicals today. Most 
      Christian bookstores feature the writings of Lewis without a word of 
      warning.</P>
      <P>A <I>Christianity Today</I> reader’s poll in 1998 rated Lewis the most 
      influential evangelical writer. The December 2005 edition of 
      <I>Christianity Today</I> features C.S. Lewis on the cover and almost 
      every article is devoted to the man, including the effusive cover story 
      entitled, “C.S. Lewis Superstar.” In an article commemorating the 100th 
      anniversary of Lewis’s birth, J.I. Packer called him “our patron saint” 
      and said that Lewis ”has come to be the Aquinas, the Augustine, and the 
      Aesop of contemporary Evangelicalism” (“Still Surprised by Lewis,” 
      <I>Christianity Today</I>, Sept. 7, 1998).</P>
      <P>Though Lewis died in 1963, sales of his books had risen to two million 
      a year by 1977 and have increased 125% since 2001.</P>
      <P>In its April 23, 2001, issue, <I>Christianity Today</I> again praised 
      C.S. Lewis in an article titled “Myth Matters.” Lewis, called “the 20th 
      century’s greatest Christian apologist,” wrote several mythical works, 
      such as <I>The Chronicles of Narnia</I>, which C<I>hristianity Today</I> 
      recommends in the most glowing terms, claiming that “Christ came not to 
      put an end to myth but to take all that is most essential in the myth up 
      into himself and make it real.” I don’t know what to say to this except 
      that it is complete nonsense. In his <I>Chronicles</I>, Lewis depicts 
      Jesus Christ as a lion named Aslan who is slain on a stone table. 
      <I>Christianity Today</I> says, “In Aslan, Christ is made tangible, 
      knowable, real.” As if we can know Jesus Christ best through a fable that 
      is vaguely and inaccurately based on biblical themes and intermingled with 
      paganism.</P>
      <P><B>WAS C.S. LEWIS A STRONG BIBLE BELIEVER?</B></P>
      <P>Was C.S. Lewis a strong Bible believer? By no means, as even 
      <I>Christianity Today</I> admits. “Clive Staples Lewis was anything but a 
      classic evangelical, socially or theologically. He smoked cigarettes and a 
      pipe, and he regularly visited pubs to drink beer with friends. Though he 
      shared basic Christian beliefs with evangelicals, he didn’t subscribe to 
      biblical inerrancy or penal substitution. He believed in purgatory and 
      baptismal regeneration” (“C.S. Lewis Superstar,” <I>Christianity 
      Today</I>, Dec. 2005).</P>
      <P>Lewis believed in prayers for the dead. In <I>Letters to Malcolm</I>, 
      he wrote, “Of course I pray for the dead. The action is so spontaneous, so 
      all but inevitable, that only the most compulsive theological case against 
      it would deter men. And I hardly know how the rest of my prayers would 
      survive if those for the dead were forbidden” (p. 109). He believed in 
      purgatory. In <I>Letters to Malcolm</I>, he wrote” “I believe in 
      Purgatory. ... The right view returns magnificently in Newman’s 
      Dream.&nbsp; There if I remember rightly, the saved soul, at the very foot 
      of the throne, begs to be taken away and cleansed. It cannot bear for a 
      moment longer ‘with its darkness to affront that light’. ... Our souls 
      demand Purgatory, don’t they?” (pp. 110-111). Lewis confessed his sins 
      regularly to a priest and was given the Catholic sacrament of last rites 
      on July 16, 1963 (Roger Lancelyn Green and Walter Hooper, <I>C.S. Lewis: A 
      Biography</I>, 1974, pp. 198, 301). Lewis denied the total depravity of 
      man and the substitutionary blood atonement of Christ. He believed in 
      theistic evolution and rejected the Bible as the infallible Word of God. 
      He taught that hell is a state of mind: “And every state of mind, left to 
      itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own 
      mind--is, in the end, Hell” (Lewis, <I>The Great Divorce</I>, p. 65). D. 
      Martin Lloyd-Jones warned that C.S. Lewis had a defective view of 
      salvation and was an opponent of the substitutionary and penal view of the 
      atonement (<I>Christianity Today</I>, Dec. 20, 1963). In a letter to the 
      editor of <I>Christianity Today</I>, Feb. 28, 1964, Dr. W. Wesley Shrader, 
      First Baptist Church, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, warned that “C.S. Lewis ... 
      would never embrace the (literal-infallible) view of the Bible” (<I>F.B.F. 
      News Bulletin</I>, Fundamental Baptist Fellowship, March 4, 1984).</P>
      <P>Lewis lived for 30 years with Janie Moore, a woman 25 years his senior 
      to whom he was not married. The relationship with the married woman began 
      when Lewis was still a student at Oxford. Moore was separated from her 
      husband. Lewis confessed to his brother Arthur that he was in love with 
      Mrs. Moore, the mother of one of his friends who was killed in World War 
      I. The relationship was definitely sexual in nature. See Alan Jacobs, 
      <I>The Narnian: The Life and Imagination of C.S. Lewis</I>, pp. 82, 94. At 
      age 58, Lewis married Joy Gresham, an American woman who pursued a 
      relationship with Lewis even while she was still married to another man. 
      According to two of Lewis’s friends, Gresham’s husband divorced her on the 
      grounds of desertion (Roger Lancelyn Green &amp; Walter Hooper, <I>Light 
      on C.S. Lewis</I>), though it also true that he, in turn, married his 
      Joy’s cousin.</P>
      <P>In the book <I>A Severe Mercy</I> by Sheldon VanAuken, a personal 
      letter is reproduced on page 191 in which Lewis suggests to VanAuken that 
      upon his next visit to England that the two of them “must have some good, 
      long talks together and perhaps we shall both get high.” We have no way to 
      know exactly what this means, but we do know that Lewis drank beer, wine, 
      and whiskey on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Lewis never gave up his unholy fascination with paganism. On a visit to 
      Greece with his wife in 1960, Lewis made the following strange, unbiblical 
      statement:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“I had some ado to prevent Joy (and myself) from lapsing into 
        paganism in Attica! AT DAPHNI IT WAS HARD NOT TO PRAY TO APOLLO THE 
        HEALER. BUT SOMEHOW ONE DIDN’T FEEL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY WRONG--WOULD 
        HAVE ONLY BEEN ADDRESSING CHRIST <I>SUB SPECIE</I> <I>APOLLONIUS</I>” 
        (C.S. Lewis to Chad Walsh, May 23, 1960, cited from George Sayer, 
        <I>Jack: A Life of C.S. Lewis</I>, 1994, p. 378). </DD></DL>
      <P>What a blasphemous statement! Christ is not worshipped under the image 
      of pagan gods. And we must remember that this was written at the end of 
      Lewis’ life, and long after his “conversion” to Christ.</P>
      <P>Lewis claimed that followers of pagan religions can be saved without 
      personal faith in Jesus Christ: “But the truth is God has not told us what 
      His arrangements about the other people are. ... There are people who do 
      not accept the full Christian doctrine about Christ but who are so 
      strongly attracted by Him that they are His in a much deeper sense than 
      they themselves understand. There are people in other religions who are 
      being led by God’s secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their 
      religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to 
      Christ without knowing it. For example a Buddhist of good will may be led 
      to concentrate more and more on the Buddhist teaching about mercy and to 
      leave in the background (though he might still say he believed) the 
      Buddhist teaching on certain points. Many of the good Pagans long before 
      Christ’s birth may have been in this position” (C.S. Lewis, <I>Mere 
      Christianity</I>, HarperSanFrancisco edition, 2001, pp. 64, 208, 209).</P>
      <P>Lewis believed that Jonah and Job were not historical books. In his 
      article “Modern Theology and Biblical Criticism,” Lewis said: “... Jonah, 
      a tale with as few even pretended historical attachments as Job, grotesque 
      in incident and surely not without a distinct, though of course edifying, 
      vein of typically Jewish humor” (“Modern Theology and Biblical Criticism,” 
      <I>Christian Reflections</I>, edited by Walter Hooper, Eerdmans).</P>
      <P><B>LEWIS NEVER GAVE A CLEAR BIBLICAL TESTIMONY OF THE NEW BIRTH AND 
      SAID THAT FAITH IN THE BLOOD OF CHRIST IS UNNECESSARY</B></P>
      <P>C.S. Lewis went to some length to describe his views of salvation in 
      <I>Mere Christianity</I> and in his spiritual autobiography, <I>Surprised 
      by Joy</I>. In neither book did he give a clear biblical testimony of the 
      new birth.</P>
      <P>As for faith in the blood of Christ, Lewis said that it is not an 
      essential part of Christianity. He taught that it does not matter how one 
      defines the atonement, and he himself did not believe in the 
      substitutionary blood atonement. In <I>Mere Christianity </I>he made the 
      following statement:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“You can say that Christ died for our sins. You may say that the 
        Father has forgiven us because Christ has done for us what we ought to 
        have done. You may say that we are washed in the blood of the Lamb. You 
        may say that Christ has defeated death. They are all true. IF ANY OF 
        THEM DO NOT APPEAL TO YOU, LEAVE IT ALONE AND GET ON WITH THE FORMULA 
        THAT DOES. And, whatever you do, do not start quarrelling with other 
        people because they use a different formula from years” (<I>Mere 
        Christianity</I>, HarperSanFrancisco edition, 2001, p. 182). </DD></DL>
      <P>This is rank heresy. Lewis wrongly claimed that it does not matter if a 
      person believes that he is washed in Christ’s blood, that this is a mere 
      “formula” that can be accepted or rejected at one’s pleasure. He said that 
      it is just as well to believe that “the Father has forgiven us because 
      Christ has done for us what we ought to have done.” That is a bloodless 
      salvation through Christ’s life rather than through His Cross, which, 
      according to the Bible is no salvation at all. The “blood” is mentioned 
      more than 90 times in the New Testament, and that is no accident. “And 
      almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding 
      of blood is no remission” (Heb. 9:22). If Jesus had lived a perfect life 
      in our place and died a bloodless death in our place, we would not be 
      saved.</P>
      <P>Lewis said, “The central Christian belief is that Christ’s death has 
      somehow put us right with God and given us a fresh start. Theories as to 
      how it did this are another matter. ... Any theories we build up as to how 
      Christ’s death did all of this are, in my view, quite secondary...” 
      (<I>Mere Christianity</I>, HarperSanFrancisco edition, 2001, pp. 54, 55, 
      56).</P>
      <P>This is unscriptural teaching. God has revealed exactly what Christ did 
      and what the atonement means. It is not a matter of theorizing or 
      believing one “formula” over against another. The Bible says our salvation 
      is a matter of a propitiation, a ransom, whereby our sins were washed away 
      by Christ’s bloody death, which was offered as a payment to satisfy God’s 
      holy Law.</P>
      <P>Lewis never mentions the doctrine of propitiation, but propitiation was 
      a necessary part of our salvation and the propitiation was made by blood. 
      “Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, 
      to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, 
      through the forbearance of God” (Rom. 3:25). Propitiation means 
      satisfaction; covering; the fulfillment of a demand. It refers to God’s 
      estimation of Christ’s sacrifice. God is fully satisfied by what Jesus 
      Christ did on the Cross. The penalty for His broken law by man’s sin has 
      been fully satisfied (Rom. 3:24-25; 1 Jn. 2:2; Heb. 2:17; Isa. 5:11). The 
      Greek word translated “propitiation” in Rom. 3:25 is also translated 
      “mercy seat” in Heb. 9:5. The mercy seat perfectly covered the law which 
      was contained in the Ark (Ex. 25:17, 21). This symbolizes 
      propitiation--Christ covering the demands of God’s law. That it is the 
      blood of Christ which satisfied this demand and put away our sins was 
      depicted on the Day of Atonement when blood was sprinkled on the mercy 
      seat by the high priest (Lev. 16:11-17).</P>
      <P>Through Christ’s blood we have eternal redemption. “Neither by the 
      blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into 
      the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us” (Heb. 
9:12).</P>
      <P>Through Christ’s blood we can enter into the presence of God. “Having 
      therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of 
      Jesus” (Heb. 10:19).</P>
      <P>This is not a theory or a formula. It is the Word of God, and if one 
      does not like it or believe it, he cannot be saved.</P>
      <P>In <I>Mere Christianity</I>, Lewis claims that the Christ-life is 
      spread to men through baptism, belief, and the Lord’s Supper. This is a 
      false gospel of faith plus works. He says, “There are three things that 
      spread the Christ-life to us: baptism, belief, and that mysterious action 
      which different Christians call by different names--Holy Communion, the 
      Mass, the Lord’s Supper. ... I am not saying anything about which of these 
      things is the most essential. My Methodist friend would like me to say 
      more about belief and less (in proportion) about the other two. But I am 
      not going into that” (<I>Mere Christianity</I>, p. 61). [Note that he 
      includes the Catholic Mass in his list of the various names by which holy 
      communion are known, failing to acknowledge to his readers that the Mass 
      is an entirely different thing than the simple Lord’s Supper of the New 
      Testament.]</P>
      <P>It is not a Methodist we should listen to but the Bible itself, and the 
      Bible says that salvation is by the grace of Christ alone through faith in 
      Christ alone without works, that works are important but they follow after 
      salvation and are the product of salvation rather than the means of it. 
      The difference between saying that salvation is by faith without works and 
      that works follow and saying that salvation is by faith with works or 
      faith plus works is the difference between a true gospel and a false one. 
      “Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 
      But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the 
      ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness” (Rom. 4:3-4). “For by 
      grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the 
      gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his 
      workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath 
      before ordained that we should walk in them” (Eph. 2:8-10).</P>
      <P>I have read several of C.S. Lewis’s books and dozens of his articles 
      and several biographies about him, and I have never seen a clear teaching 
      on the new birth or a clear biblical testimony that he was born again. 
      This should be cause for the deepest concern.</P>
      <P><B>WHY IS LEWIS SO POPULAR WITH EVANGELICALS TODAY?</B></P>
      <P>In light of his lack of clear scriptural salvation testimony, his 
      heresies, his worldliness, and the massive pagan influences in his work, 
      why are evangelicals today so enamored with C.S. Lewis? I believe the 
      following are some of the chief reasons:</P>
      <P><B>FIRST, NEW EVANGELICALS LOVE C.S. LEWIS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
      CHARACTERIZED BY A PRIDE OF INTELLECT AND LEWIS WAS DEFINITELY AN 
      INTELLECTUAL</B>. He had almost a photographic memory and had a triple 
      first at Oxford in Philosophy, Classics, and English. He was one of the 
      greatest experts of that day in English literature and occupied the first 
      Chair in Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge University. 
      Since New Evangelicals almost worship intellectualism (a spirit that the 
      late David Otis Fuller called “scholarolatry”), it is no surprise that 
      they would look upon the famous intellectual C.S. Lewis as a patron 
      saint.</P>
      <P><B>SECOND, NEW EVANGELICALS LOVE C.S. LEWIS BECAUSE OF HIS ECUMENICAL 
      THINKING AND HIS REFUSAL TO PRACTICE SEPARATION</B>. This has been 
      admitted by <I>Christianity Today</I>. “Lewis’s … concentration on the 
      main doctrines of the church coincided with evangelicals’ concern to avoid 
      ecclesiastical separatism” (<I>Christianity Today</I>, Oct. 25, 1993). CT 
      therefore admits that C.S. Lewis is popular to Evangelicals today because, 
      like them, he despised biblical separation.</P>
      <P>C.S. Lewis was, in fact, very ecumenical. The following is an overview 
      of his ecumenical philosophy and his influence on present-day ecumenical 
      movement:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“Lewis was firmly ecumenical, though he distanced himself from 
        outright liberalism. In his preface to <I>Mere Christianity</I>, Lewis 
        states that his aim is to present ‘an agreed, or common, or central or 
        mere Christianity.’ So he aims to concentrate on the doctrines that he 
        believes are common to all forms of Christianity--including Roman 
        Catholicism. It is no surprise that he submitted parts of the book to 
        four clergymen for criticism--an Anglican, a Methodist, a Presbyterian, 
        and a Roman Catholic! He hopes that the book will make it clear why all 
        Christians ‘ought to be reunited,’ but warns that it should not be seen 
        as an alternative to the creeds of existing denominations. He likens the 
        ‘mere Christianity’ that he describes in the book to a hall from which 
        various rooms lead off. These rooms are the various Christian 
        traditions. And just as when you enter a house you do not stay in the 
        hall but enter a room, so when you become a Christian you should join a 
        particular Christian tradition. Lewis believes that it is not too 
        important which room you enter. It will be right for some to enter the 
        door marked ‘Roman Catholicism’ as it will for others to enter other 
        doors. Whichever room you enter, says Lewis, the important thing is that 
        you be convinced that it is the right one for you. And, he says, ‘When 
        you have reached your own room, be kind to those who have chosen 
        different doors.’<BR><BR>
        <DD>“Mention should also be made of Lewis’ views of the sacraments. The 
        sacraments ‘spread the Christ life to us’ (<I>Mere Christianity</I>, 
        book 2, chapter 5). In his <I>Letters to Malcolm</I> Lewis states that 
        he does not want to ‘unsettle in the mind of any Christian, whatever his 
        denomination, the concepts--for him traditional--by which he finds it 
        profitable to represent to himself what is happening when he receives 
        the bread and wine’ of the Lord’s Supper. What happens in the Lord’s 
        Supper is a mystery, and so the Roman Catholic conception of the bread 
        and wine becoming the actual body and blood of Christ might be just as 
        valid as the Protestant view of the Lord’s Supper as a memorial 
        (<I>Letters to Malcolm</I>, chapter 19). ...<BR><BR>
        <DD>“This enigma of C.S. Lewis was no more than a slight bemusement to 
        me until recently three things changed my bemusement into 
        bewilderment.<BR><BR>
        <DD>“In March 1994 the Evangelicals and Catholics Together movement 
        produced its first document. This was a programatic document entitled 
        <I>Evangelicals and Catholics Together: The Christian Mission in the 
        Third Millennium</I>. It was rightly said at the time that this document 
        represented ‘a betrayal of the Reformation.’ I saw no connection between 
        this and C.S. Lewis until a couple of years later when the symposium 
        <I>Evangelicals and Catholics Together: Working Towards a Common 
        Mission</I> was published. In his contribution to the book, Charles 
        Colson--the Evangelical ‘prime mover’ behind ECT--tells us that C.S. 
        Lewis was a major influence which led him to form the movement (Billy 
        Graham was another!). In fact Colson says that Evangelicals and 
        Catholics Together seeks to continue the legacy of C.S. Lewis by 
        focusing on the core beliefs of all true Christians (<I>Common 
        Mission</I>, p. 36). The enigma took on a more foreboding 
        aspect.<BR><BR>“The enigma darkened further when just last year (after 
        becoming connected to the Internet at the end of 1996) I discovered, 
        quite by accident, that C.S. Lewis is just as popular amongst Roman 
        Catholics as he is amongst Evangelicals. Perhaps I should have known 
        this already, but it had never struck me before.<BR><BR>“The third shock 
        came last autumn when I read that <I>Christianity Today</I>--reputed to 
        be the leading evangelical magazine in the USA--had conducted a poll 
        amongst its readers to discover whom they considered the most 
        influential theological writers of the twentieth century. You will have 
        already guessed that C.S. Lewis came out on top!<BR><BR>“After these 
        three things it came as no surprise to me this year to find that C.S. 
        Lewis has exerted a major influence on the <I>Alpha</I> course, and that 
        it quotes or refers to him almost ad nauseum. Could not the <I>Alpha</I> 
        course be renamed the ‘Mere Christianity’ course? ...<BR><BR>“In 
        conclusion, I offer the following reflection. If it is true to say that 
        ‘you are what you eat,’ then it is also true to say that ‘a Christian is 
        what he hears and reads’ since this is how he gets his spiritual food. 
        Thus <STRONG>if Christians are brought up on a diet of C.S. Lewis, it 
        should not surprise us to find they are seeking ‘to continue the legacy 
        of C.S. Lewis.</STRONG>’ The apostle Paul said, ‘A little leaven 
        leaveneth the whole lump’ (Gal. 5:9--the whole passage is relevant to 
        the present context); thus <B>IF EVANGELICALS READ AND APPLAUD SUCH 
        BOOKS AS <I>MERE CHRISTIANITY</I></B><B> IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE 
        IF WE FIND THEM ‘WORKING TOWARDS A COMMON MISSION’ WITH THE ENEMIES OF 
        THE GOSPEL. THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT HE READS, 
        AND THOSE IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY (PASTORS, TEACHERS, PARENTS) SHOULD 
        BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT THEY RECOMMEND OTHERS TO READ</B>” (Dr. Tony 
        Baxter, “The Enigma of C.S. Lewis,” <I>CRN Journal</I>, Winter 1998, 
        Christian Research Network, Colchester, United Kingdom, p. 30; Baxter 
        works for the Protestant Truth Society as a Wycliffe Preacher). </DD></DL>
      <P>In April 1998, Mormon professor Robert Millet spoke at Wheaton College 
      on the topic of C.S. Lewis. In a recent issue of <I>Christianity 
      Today,</I> Millet, dean of Brigham Young University, is quoted as saying 
      that C.S. Lewis “is so well received by Latter-day Saints [Mormons] 
      because of his broad and inclusive vision of Christianity” (John W. 
      Kennedy, “Southern Baptists Take Up the Mormon Challenge,” <I>Christianity 
      Today</I>, June 15, 1998, p. 30).</P>
      <P><B>THIRD, NEW EVANGELICALS LOVE C.S. LEWIS BECAUSE OF THEIR SHARED 
      FASCINATION FOR OR AND SYMPATHY WITH ROME</B>. Today’s evangelicals have 
      given us “Evangelicals and Rome Together” and even those who do not go 
      that far usually speak of Rome’s errors in soft, congenial terms rather 
      than labeling it the blasphemous, antichrist institution that it is and 
      that Protestants and Baptists of old plainly called it. As we have seen, 
      C.S. Lewis considered the Roman Catholic Church one of the acceptable 
      “rooms” in the house of Christianity and longed for unity between 
      Protestantism and Romanism. Lewis believed in prayers to the dead and 
      purgatory.</P>
      <P>Some of Lewis’s closest friends were Roman Catholics. J.R. Tolkien of 
      <I>Lord of the Rings</I> fame is one example. Tolkien and Lewis were very 
      close and spent countless hours together. Lewis credited Tolkien with 
      having a large role in his “conversion.” Lewis was also heavily influenced 
      by the Roman Catholic writer G.K. Chesterton. When asked what Christian 
      writers had helped him, Lewis remarked in 1963, six months before he died, 
      “The contemporary book that has helped me the most is Chesterton’s <I>The 
      Everlasting Man</I>” (<I>God in the Dock</I>, edited by Walter Hooper, 
      1970, p. 260).</P>
      <P>Lewis carried on a warm correspondence in Latin with Catholic priest 
      Don Giovanni Calabria of Italy over their shared “concern for the 
      reunification of the Christian churches” (<I>The Narnian</I>, Alan Jacobs, 
      pp. 249, 250). Calabria was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1988.</P>
      <P>In 1943, Lewis gave a talk on “Christian Apologetics” for a group of 
      priests in Wales (<I>The Narnian</I>, p. 229).</P>
      <P>From the 1940s to the end of his life, Lewis’s spiritual advisor was a 
      Catholic priest named Walter Adams (<I>The Narnian</I>, p. 224). It was to 
      this priest that Lewis confessed his sins.</P>
      <P>Roman Catholics love C.S. Lewis as much as evangelicals. His books are 
      typically found in Catholic bookstores. Michael Coren, a Roman Catholic, 
      wrote a biography of Lewis entitled “C.S. Lewis: The Man Who Created 
      Narnia.” The Catholic news agency Zenit asked Coren, “What do Catholics 
      need to know about C.S. Lewis?” He replied: “They should know he wasn’t a 
      Catholic, but that doesn't mean he wouldn’t have become one eventually. G. 
      K. Chesterton became a Catholic in 1922 but had really been one for 20 
      years. ... Lewis was born in Belfast, in sectarian Northern Ireland, so he 
      was raised anti-Catholic like most Protestant children there. He was a man 
      of his background but HIS VIEWS WERE VERY CATHOLIC: HE BELIEVED IN 
      PURGATORY, BELIEVED IN THE SACRAMENTS, WENT TO CONFESSION” (“The Subtle 
      Magic of C.S. Lewis’ Narnia: Michael Coren’s Perspective as the New Movie 
      Looms,” Zenit, Dec. 7, 2005).</P>
      <P>Evangelicalism’s love affair with C.S. Lewis is evidence of its deep 
      spiritual compromise and lack of sound doctrinal discernment.</P>
