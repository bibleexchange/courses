            <P>I think it is hardly possible to exaggerate the importance of 
            Ellen G. White's "Great Controversy" and the role it has played in 
            the Seventh-day Adventist theology. The book is the cornerstone of 
            Adventist eschatology, much cherished by orthodox Seventh-day 
            Adventists. When I was a Seventh-day Adventist, I remember we all 
            anxiously turned to its pages to find out how "it will all really 
            end". Nothing settled eschatological disagreements on Saturday 
            mornings like a good quote from the pages of Ellen White's "Great 
            Controversy". Ellen White herself values the work highly, while 
            claiming direct divine inspiration for its content, as her own 
            statements indicate: </P>
            <UL>
              <LI>"The book <EM>The Great Controversy</EM>, I appreciate above 
              silver or gold, and I greatly desire that it shall come before 
              people. <STRONG>While writing the manuscript of 
              </STRONG><EM><STRONG>The Great Controversy</STRONG></EM><STRONG>, 
              I was often conscious of the presence of the angels of 
              God</STRONG>. And many times <STRONG>the scenes</STRONG> about 
              which I was writing were <STRONG>presented to me anew in 
              visions</STRONG> of the night, so that they were <STRONG>fresh and 
              vivid</STRONG> in my mind."<SUP>1</SUP> 
              <LI>"<STRONG>God gave me the light contained in 
              </STRONG><EM><STRONG>The Great Controversy</STRONG></EM> and 
              Patriarchs and Prophets and this light was needed to arouse the 
              people to prepare for the great day of God, which is just before 
              us. <STRONG>These books contain God's direct appeal to the 
              people</STRONG>."<SUP>2</SUP> 
              <LI>"<STRONG>Through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the 
              scenes of the long-continued conflict between good and evil have 
              been opened to the writer of these pages</STRONG> [<EM>The Great 
              Controversy</EM>]."<SUP>3</SUP> 
              <LI>"As <STRONG>the Spirit of God has opened to my mind</STRONG> 
              the great truths of His Word, and <STRONG>the scenes of the past 
              and the future</STRONG>, I have been bidden to make known to 
              others that which has thus been revealed - to trace the history of 
              the controversy in past ages..."<SUP>4</SUP> </LI></UL>
            <P>It is clear that Ellen White claimed that her book <EM>The Great 
            Controversy</EM> was written under the guidance of i) 
            <STRONG>God</STRONG>, ii) <STRONG>Holy Spirit</STRONG>, and iii) 
            <STRONG>angels of God</STRONG>. She claims that this guidance was 
            manifested in her visions, in which the scenes of the past were 
            presented to her exactly as they happened, so that "they were fresh 
            and vivid" in her mind while she wrote the book.</P>
            <P>As a Seventh-day Adventist, I believed her claims. All of them. I 
            read <EM>The Great Controversy</EM> almost daily; its pages soon 
            became black from underlining all statements that I considered 
            important (which was most!). It was only after leaving Adventism 
            that I was able to objectively restudy Ellen White's work, 
            specifically her <EM>Great Controversy</EM>. <STRONG>To my shock, I 
            discovered a confused, distorted, inaccurate, and biased image of 
            history, a far outcry from the myth of "Sister White's" inspired 
            visions that many Adventists are fed by their church!</STRONG></P>
            <P><STRONG>It is in this article that I share some of my discoveries 
            (tip of the iceberg!) about Ellen White's </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Great 
            Controversy</STRONG></EM><STRONG> and her visions, focussing on her 
            "inspired" account of Martin Luther's early life. In what follows, I 
            will examine Ellen White's treatment of two important events in 
            Martin Luther's life: his entrance to a cloister, and his journey to 
            Rome.</STRONG></P>
            <P>Look at the <STRONG>facts</STRONG> and judge for yourself whether 
            Ellen G. White's claims are true!</P>

              <LI>
              <P align=left>"While one day examining the books in the library of 
              the university, Luther discovered a Latin Bible. Such a book he 
              had never before seen. He was ignorant even of its existence. He 
              had heard portions of the Gospels and Epistles, which were read to 
              the people at public worship, and he supposed that these were the 
              entire Bible. Now, for the first time, <STRONG>he looked upon the 
              whole of God's word</STRONG>. With mingled awe and wonder he 
              turned the sacred pages; with quickened pulse and throbbing heart 
              he read for himself the words of life, pausing now and then to 
              exclaim: "O that God would give me such a book for myself!"--<I> 
              Ibid., </I>b. 2, ch. 2. Angels of heaven were by his side, and 
              rays of light from the throne of God revealed the treasures of 
              truth to his understanding. He had ever feared to offend God, but 
              now the deep conviction of his condition as a sinner took hold 
              upon him as never before. <STRONG>An earnest desire to be free 
              from sin and to find peace with God led him at last to enter a 
              cloister and devote himself to a monastic 
              life</STRONG>."<SUP>5</SUP> </P></LI></UL>
            <P>Clearly, Ellen White's view is that Martin Luther, through an 
            illuminating Bible study, became convinced of sin and desired to 
            find peace with God, he entered a cloister.</P>

            <P>This is the first instance in the chapter that Ellen G. White 
            shows she does not have a clue. <FONT size=3><STRONG>Martin Luther 
            himself tells a very different story of his own entrance into the

              It is found in his table talk of July 16, 1539, thirty four years 
              after the event. He remarked almost causally that fourteen days 
              earlier had been the anniversary of the day he had been caught in 
              a storm near Stotternheim, a village near Erfurt. In his terror 
              before lightning, he cried out, "Help, St. Anne, I will become a 
              monk."</STRONG>... Shorly after taking his vow, he regretted 
              it..."<SUP>7</SUP></FONT> </LI></UL>
            <P>Ronald H. Bainton, specialist in Reformation history and perhaps 
            the best known biographer of Martin Luther, says:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>"<STRONG>The immediate occasion of his resolve to enter the 
              cloister was the unexpected encounter with death on that sultry 
              July day in 1505.</STRONG> He was then twenty-one and a student at 
              the University of Erfurt. As he returned to school after a visit 
              with his parents, <STRONG>sudden lightning struck him to 
              earth</STRONG>. In that single flash he was the denouement of the 
              drame of existence. There was God the all-terrible, Christ the 
              inexplorable, and all the leering fiends springing from their 
              lurking places in pond and wood that with sardonic cachinnations 
              they might seize his shock of curdy hair and bolt him to into 
              hell. It was no wonder that he cried out to his father saint, 
              patroness of miners, <STRONG>"St. Anne help me! I will become a 
              monk."</STRONG>"<SUP>8</SUP> </LI></UL>
            <P>Martin Luther himself testifies that he entered the cloister 
            because he made a vow to St. Anne, a Catholic saint, in a moment 
            when he feared for his life, not as a result of Bible study as Ellen 
            White says. If Luther enterered the monanstery as a result of an 
            enlightening Bible study, why did he cry out to <EM>Saint 
            Anne</EM>?</P>

            <P>Ellen G. White devotes a couple of pages to Martin Luther's visit 
            to Rome early on his life. She describes Luther's experience at the

            story</STRONG>: </P>
            <UL>
              <LI>"By a recent decretal an indulgence had been promised by the 
              pope to all who should ascend upon their knees 'Pilate's 
              staircase,' said to have been descended by our Saviour on leaving 
              the Roman judgment hall and to have been miraculously conveyed 
              from Jerusalem to Rome. <STRONG>Luther was one devoutly climbing 
              these steps, when suddenly a voice like thunder seemed to say to 
              him: 'The just shall live by faith.' Romans 1:17. He sprang to his 
              feet and hastened from the place in shame and horror. That text 
              never lost its power upon his soul. From that time he saw more 
              clearly than ever before the fallacy of trusting to human works 
              for salvation, and the necessity of constant faith in the merits 
              of Christ. His eyes had been opened, and were never again to be 
              closed, to the delusions of the papacy.</STRONG>"<SUP>9</SUP> 
            </LI></UL>
            <P>Let us be sure that we understand what Ellen White's vision 
            revealed. Upon his visit to Rome, Martin Luther was climbing 
            Pilate's stairs. Suddenly, a heavenly voice spoke to him, 
            proclaiming the justification by faith, as stated in Romans 1:17. 
            This made a very deep impression upon Luther's mind. He ran from the 
            place in "shame and horror". His eyes were forever opened "to the 
            delusions of the papacy".</P>

            </STRONG></P>
            <P>Again, "Sister White" blundered. <STRONG>Martin Luther himself 
            gives us a very different story, in volume 51 of his works, of what 
            happened when he was climbing Pilate's stairs!</STRONG> <STRONG>In 
            Luther own words, he did not hear any heavenly voice, but he 
            exclaimed "Who knows whether it is 
            so?"</STRONG><SUP>10</SUP><STRONG>!</STRONG></P>
            <P align=left>Roland H. Bainton and Richard Marius summarize:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P align=left>"<STRONG>At the top Luther raised himself and 
              exclaimed, not as the legend would have it, 'The just shall live 
              by faith!' - he was not yet that far advanced. What he said was, 
              'Who knows whether it is so?'</STRONG>"<SUP>11</SUP> </P>
              <LI>
              <P align=left>"He [Luther] hoped to release the soul of his 
              grandfather from purgatory. <STRONG>At the top Luther stood up and 
              asked himself a question: "Who can know if it is 
              so?'</STRONG>"<SUP>12</SUP>. </P></LI></UL>
            <P>Moreover, were Luther's eyes "opened, ...never again to be closed 
            to the delusions of the papacy", as Ellen claims? Roland H. Bainton 
            makes an interesting remark about <STRONG>Luther's spiritual search 
            after his return from Rome</STRONG>:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>"<STRONG>Luther probed every resource of contemporary 
              Catholicism... He sought at the same time to explore other ways, 
              and Catholicism had much more to offer.</STRONG>"<SUP>13</SUP> 
              </LI></UL>
            <P>Martin Brecht, the leading Lutheran scholar remarks in his nearly 
            impeccable biography of Luther:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>"...there were the riches of grace in which he participated in 
              Rome, and because of them <STRONG>the positive impression 
              predominated. Only later did the critical and completely negative 
              evaluation of Roman experiences occur.</STRONG> But even then he 
              would not have missed them."<SUP>14</SUP> </LI></UL>
            <P>We see that Luther's experience in Rome clearly did not turn him 
            completely against the papacy. Rather, overall, it was more positive 
            than negative. After his return from Rome, Luther still probed many 
            resources of Catholicism! When in Rome, no heavenly voice spoke to 
            him. Rather, his own doubting mind made him exclaim "Who knows 
            whether it is so!". </P>
            <P>Notice that Ellen White links Luther's discovery of justification 
            by faith in Romans 1:17, his inner turning point, with experience at 
            the top of Pilate's stairs. <STRONG>We know that Luther journeyed to 
            Rome in November 1510</STRONG><SUP>15</SUP>.<STRONG> However, 
            according to Martin Luther, his new understanding of Romans 1:17 
            happened in 1518-9, in his own words, when the text became "the open 
            gate to paradise"!</STRONG><SUP>16 </SUP><FONT color=#ff0000>Ellen 
            G. White missed the most important turning point in Luther's life by 
            nearly a decade</FONT>, placing it in a time when Luther still had a 
            completely Catholic understanding of salvation (he understood 
            righteousness by faith as <EM>both</EM> justification and 
            sanctification, much as orthodox Adventists and modern Catholics 
            understand it today).</P>
            <P><STRONG>Could Ellen G. White be more wrong? Notice, in her 
            account, how she pretends to have been there, describing Luther's 
            inner emotions of "shame and horror". What a "visionary"! She simply 
            plagiarized legends about Luther's life that were popular in her own 
            time, and peddled them in the name of God as sure inspired accounts 
            given through "fresh and vivid" 
            visions!</STRONG><SUP><STRONG>17</STRONG></SUP></P>
