      <P align=center><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#ff0000 size=6>The 
      Sabbath is Friday?!!!</FONT></I></P>
      <P align=center><FONT face="Century Gothic"><B>Bill Hohmann</B><SPAN 
      class=828123821-08062006> </SPAN></FONT><BR><FONT face="Century Gothic" 
      size=2><A 
      href="mailto:wmhohmann@peoplepc.com">wmhohmann@peoplepc.com</A></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">An interesting phenomena occurs regarding 
      those who are recruited into and indoctrinated by cults. Through a 
      carefully orchestrated process of conditioning, the individual surrenders 
      their critical thinking skills, for such individualistic behavior is not 
      tolerated within the ‘groupthink’ mentality of the organization. The 
      individual surrenders individuality in favor of the group dynamic; the 
      group is more important than the individual; the individual surrenders 
      their personal identity in favor of the group identity. The individual’s 
      existence becomes tied to the group’s existence. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">The instruction of Paul to "prove all 
      things" is subconsciously relegated to proving what they were taught by 
      the cult, and any idea of examining evidence to the contrary is strongly 
      discouraged.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">In this light, those religious cults that 
      are legalistic in nature that insist on keeping the Sabbath have a 
      particular problem which is rarely, if ever, addressed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">When one who has been indoctrinated by 
      these cults is exposed to this concept regarding the keeping of the 
      Sabbath, cognitive dissonance is created, causing confusion in the 
      individual. The individual finds themselves unable to reconcile the 
      situation, usually resulting in the individual striking out verbally 
      against the one who planted the seed of cognitive dissonance, even as the 
      religious leaders did when they were confronted by Christ performing a 
      miracle on the Sabbath that could only be attributed to God but was 
      perceived by them to violate the Sabbath command, making Jesus Christ a 
      sinner as a result in their minds. Instead of confirming the truth of the 
      situation, they chose instead to ignore truth and fell back on their 
      reliance in Moses and the law, all the while vilifying Jesus with all 
      manner of verbal vitriol.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">Jesus related to his followers that such 
      behavior on the part of those who reject the truth would be directed to 
      them also, even as they had persecuted the prophets of old.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">This aspect of the Sabbath that creates 
      this cognitive dissonance with its resultant inability to resolve the 
      conflict is this:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">If one travels east to the United States 
      from Israel, paying attention to the sun setting at the end of one’s sixth 
      day, this person would find themselves keeping the Sabbath on what we call 
      Friday in the United States.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">When confronted with this truth, those who 
      have been brain-washed into believing they are required to keep the 
      Sabbath are unable to comprehend this simple truth. To them, there is only 
      one Sabbath of God, and the observance of any other day is in direct 
      violation of the word and will of God. When confronted with the truth that 
      the Sabbath can exist on two separate days in one week where both days are 
      valid, they are unable to resolve the conflict. How can there be one true 
      Sabbath that can fall on two days?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">As a result, the Sabbatarians resort to all 
      sorts of explanations in order to continue justifying their belief in 
      keeping the Sabbath on what we call Saturday, while verbally attacking the 
      one who would dare question their sacred belief.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">Yet the truth of the matter is inescapable, 
      regardless of the rationalizations created to spin away the 
      truth.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">One rationalization is that the person 
      passed over the international dateline in the process, and that person 
      failed to adjust their days accordingly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">Yet the scriptures do not address the 
      international dateline. Scripture addresses the setting of the sun at the 
      end of the sixth day, and for one who travels east instead of west to the 
      United States will find themselves observing the Sabbath on Friday, 
      approximately 14 hours earlier than it begins in Israel, as contrasted to 
      keeping the Sabbath approximately 10 hours after it begins in Israel, 
      should one travel west from Israel. To insist on adjusting the calculation 
      of one’s Sabbath based upon the international dateline is not 
      Biblical.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">What is interesting regarding this line of 
      reasoning is that the placement of the international dateline was an 
      arbitrary decision. If those who made this determination had decided 
      instead to place the international dateline in the middle of the Atlantic, 
      thus separating the "old" world from the "new", these same adherents to 
      the Sabbath would be insisting vehemently that people observe the Sabbath 
      24 hours earlier than they do now.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">Was the international dateline placed in 
      the Pacific by people perceived by Sabbath keepers as being Godly men who 
      were also Sabbath keepers? Not likely. Yet the Sabbath keepers "agree" 
      with this determination, thereby demonstrating they keep the Sabbath when 
      they do not based upon a command of God so much as they do as a matter of 
      consensus.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">Some Sabbatarian groups insist that keeping 
      Sunday, the first day of the week is to worship the sun-god and is Pagan. 
      Yet point out to a Sabbath keeper that to one who travels east to the 
      United States from Israel, they are worshiping on the first day of the 
      week also.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">So why are there no Sabbath keepers keeping 
      Friday as the Sabbath? The only reason is that it is a matter of 
      consensus. Do people have the right to change or alter what God commands 
      through consensus? No. This is what the post-exilic Rabbis did with much 
      of the law, and Jesus upbraided them for it, telling them that they had 
      made the word of God of no effect through their traditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">The tradition among Sabbath keepers in the 
      United States is to keep the Sabbath based on traveling west from 
      Israel.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">Is there confusion here? 
      Absolutely.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">Is God the author of confusion? Absolutely 
      not.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">The resolution to the cognitive dissonance 
      is simple; God never commanded anyone other than Israel to observe the 
      Sabbath, and Israel was a nation occupying the land of Israel; a specific 
      people located in a specific location.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">If an Israelite found him or herself 
      outside the confines of Israel when the Passover occurred, they were not 
      able to keep the Passover. A second Passover that occurred a month later 
      was allowed so that those who were gone from Israel could keep it if they 
      had returned before the second Passover.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Century Gothic">If one could not keep the Passover outside 
      of Israel, then why do people believe they can observe the Sabbath outside 
      of Israel? It isn’t possible on a round earth unless one insists we live 
      on a flat earth.</FONT></P>
