            width=61 align=left vspace=3 border=0>he announcement flashed across 
            wires in newsrooms across the country: Barnes &amp; Noble.com 
            announced that <I>Glorious Appearing</I> by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. 
            Jenkins, the last book in the <A href="http://www.leftbehind.com/" 
            target=_blank><B><I>Left Behind</I></B></A> series, recently was the 
            number-one fiction bestseller overall at Barnes &amp; Noble.com. 
            Barnes &amp; Noble retail stores and Barnes &amp; Noble.com sold 
            more than 48,000 copies of <I>Glorious Appearing</I> in just the 
            first week of its release on March 30th. 
            <P>Such news is apparent justification for this claim: "Barnes &amp; 
            Noble expects <I>Glorious Appearing</I> to be among the top ten 
            books of 2004." 
            <P>In the face of such an onslaught--2 million copies of the last 
            <I>Left Behind</I> book have been printed and already sold, 
            publisher Tyndale House says--it's possible for many to believe that 
            there is just one, and only one, way to look at Bible prophecies, 
            and that is LaHaye and Jenkins' dispensationalist theory that says 
            Christians will vanish from the earth in a "secret rapture" before a 
            multi-year period of tribulation.

            width=220 align=left border=0></A>However, Steve Wohlberg, an 
            Adventist pastor in Templeton, California, and Destiny Image, a 
            major Christian publisher in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, have teamed 
            up to offer a contrasting view. His book, End-Time Delusions, was 
            released on March 31. 
            <P>"I've been a Christian for 24 years, and not only am I interested 
            in the first coming of Jesus, which is when He came and died for my 
            sins, but in His second coming, when He will come to take us home," 
            Wohlberg, senior pastor of Templeton Hills Seventh-day Adventist 
            Church, said in a telephone interview. 
            <P>"I felt compelled by the Lord to write a book that will deal with 
            these issues of the Second Coming, the timing of the Second Coming 
            and misinterpretations about the rapture. I see the release of the 
            last Left Behind book, and the interest being generated right now 
            about this, as an opportunity to speak to this generation about the 
            subject of Bible truth and Bible prophecy at this particular time."

            width=200 align=right border=0></A>The much-touted "appearing" of 
            the last <I>Left Behind</I> book hits North American culture at a 
            time when Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" has captivated 
            the general public. Millions have flocked to the motion picture 
            depicting the suffering and death of Jesus; television networks have 
            revived old "mini-series" about Christ's life; and NBC Television is 
            reported to have commissioned "Revelation," a mini-series about 
            focusing on a scientist and a nun each confronting the end of the 
            world. 
            <P>All this media interest in Christian topics, along with a genuine 
            concern about what the Bible really says about Jesus' return, 
            motivated the new book, Wohlberg said. However, the volume isn't 
            designed merely as a critique of the LaHaye/Jenkins mega-best 
            sellers.

            width=200 align=right useMap=#map2 border=0>The book "doesn't just 
            point out error, it clarifies truth," Wohlberg said. "It's also a 
            book that is centered in Jesus Christ, so its goal is to bring 
            people to Christ, to reveal God's love, to lift up the Cross and to 
            help people be ready for the Second Coming. One of the big problems 
            with the Left Behind series is that, according to their view, the 
            Second Coming of Jesus is not something that we should be waiting 
            for; we're supposed to wait for the rapture, which gets us out of 
            here. Therefore, the whole message of Revelation concerning the 
            Beast and the Mark of the Beast and the Second Coming, according to 
            <I>Left Behind</I>, does not apply to us." 
            <P>But Seventh-day Adventists and other Christians who take the 
            historicist view of Bible prophecy know that this message is 
            applicable. <I>End-Time Delusions</I> helps explain these concepts 
            in clear, unambiguous language. 
            <P>"When compared with solid biblical facts, has truth been 'left 
            behind' as well?" asks Wohlberg. "The entire <I>Left Behind</I> 
            scenario is built upon the concept of a nightmarish 'seven-year 
            tribulation' supposedly predicted to follow a 'secret rapture,' or 
            the vanishing of Christians worldwide. The fact is there is no 
            passage anywhere in the Bible that specifically mentions 'seven 
            years of tribulation.' The entire concept is based on the 
            speculative interpretation of one verse - Daniel 9:27." 
            <P><FONT color=#864224 size=4><B>A Willing Dissenter</B></FONT> 
            <BR>While Wohlberg's book is finding an audience--<I>The Washington 
            Times</I> newspaper quoted him as a dissenter from the 
            LaHaye/Jenkins hypothesis in its front page story on Glorious 
            Appearing--the fact that the last <I>Left Behind</I> book has 
            already sold 2 million copies means that people are looking for 
            something, according to Angel Manuel Rodríguez, director of the 
            Biblical Research Institute, based at the General Conference in 
            Silver Spring, Maryland. 
            <P>"There's no doubt that there is in Western society serious 
            concern about the future. We enjoy the present but we really are 
            creatures of the future," Rodríguez explained in an interview. 
            However, such an interest "could be exploited and misused," as in 
            the case of the <I>Left Behind</I> books, he added. 
            <P>"The study of Bible prophecy has shown this to be the case. This 
            dispensationalist view provides hope to many, many people and they 
            find it meaningful. But feelings are not enough to determine a 
            commitment to a particular vision of the future," he said. 
            <P>Of <I>Left Behind</I>, Rodríguez says, "You have to say it's a 
            distorted vision of what God is going to provide and it distracts 
            [readers] from properly preparing for what is really coming. It's 
            more than a distortion, it's a substitute for the real Christian 
            hope that takes us victoriously through the tribulation." 
            <P>Author and pastor Steve Wohlberg hopes his book will help 
            Christians rightly understand the future. "In a sense, <I>Left 
            Behind</I> is spiritual fast food," he said. "To build on the rock 
            means to receive Christ and build deeply upon His words rather than 
            simply accepted 'sand' or 'fluff.' When the storm hits, those who 
            are fast food, junk-food Christians will be blown away. Those 
            studying deeply the real word are getting the right diet. They're 
            eating pure truth and building their characters so they'll be able 
            to stand in the crisis and not be blown away."
