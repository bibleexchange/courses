		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Roman Catholic actor Jim Caviezel was featured on the platform at the second night of the Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade, which lasted from Nov. 18-21, 2004. Caviezel starred as &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; in Mel Gibson&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs619CFE26">The Passion of the Christ</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">. He says he prayed to St. Genesius of Arles and St. Anthony of Padua for help in his acting career. He has visited Medjugorje to witness the site where Mary allegedly appeared to six young people. Caviezel said, &ldquo;This film is something that I believe was made by Mary for her Son.&rdquo; Caviezel prayed the Rosary to Mary every day during the filming. Is it that Graham believes Caviezel&rsquo;s gospel, or is it that Caviezel believes Graham&rsquo;s gospel, or is it that the biblical truth that two must be agreed before they walk together is no longer in force today? What confusion and open disobedience!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB0E2188C">BILLY GRAHAM SAYS HIS GOAL IS NOT TO LEAD ROMAN </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB0E2188C">CATHOLICS OUT OF CATHOLICISM</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">In his 1997 autobiography, </span><span class="cs619CFE26">Just As I Am</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">, Graham said his goal was not to lead people out of Roman Catholicism: &ldquo;MY GOAL, I ALWAYS MADE CLEAR, WAS NOT TO PREACH AGAINST CATHOLIC BELIEFS OR TO PROSELYTIZE PEOPLE who were already committed to Christ within the Catholic Church. Rather, it was to proclaim the gospel to all those who had never truly committed their lives to Christ&rdquo; (Graham, </span><span class="cs619CFE26">Just As I Am</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">, p. 357).&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">BILLY GRAHAM THINKS THE POPE IS AN EVANGELIST AND MORAL LEADER</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In 1979 Graham called Pope John Paul II &ldquo;the moral leader of the world&rdquo; (Religious News Service, Sept. 27, 1979). He also said that John Paul II &ldquo;is almost an evangelist because he calls to people to turn to Christ, to turn to Christianity&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Star</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, June 26, 1979, reprinted in the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Australian Beacon</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, August 1979, p. 1). In an interview with </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Saturday Evening Post (</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jan-Feb. 1980), Graham described the visit of John Paul II to America with these words: &ldquo;The pope came as a statesman and a pastor, but I believe he also sees himself coming as an evangelist ... The pope sought to speak to the spiritual hunger of our age in the same way Christians throughout the centuries have spoken to the spiritual yearnings of every age--by pointing people to Christ.&rdquo; In a lengthy article about the Pope in 1980, Graham praised the Pope as a &ldquo;bridge builder&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;Pope John Paul II has emerged as the greatest religious leader of the modern world, and one of the greatest moral and spiritual leaders of the century&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Saturday Evening Post</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, Jan.-Feb. 1980). After visiting the Pope in 1981, Graham said, &ldquo;We had a spiritual time&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Christianity Today</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, Feb. 6, 1981, p. 88). Graham made the following statement about the Pope&rsquo;s address in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1983: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you--that was just about as straight an evangelical address as I&rsquo;ve ever heard.

I no longer believe that. &hellip; I believe that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God&mdash;through nature, for instance&mdash;and plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
