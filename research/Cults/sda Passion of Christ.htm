            <EM>The Passion of the Christ </EM>has captivated America and the 
            world. Yet in an age of increasing devilishly subtle deceptions, 
            <STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Amazing Facts</FONT> urges you to turn

            <P class=section1>I believe Mr. Gibson's motives in making the film 
            may have been noble, but as with all Hollywood portrayals of Bible 
            stories, there are several elements <FONT color=#ff0000><B>where 
            creative license and exaggeration wander from the biblical 
            reality.</B></FONT> I still firmly believe there is not now, or ever 
            will be, an actor or a movie that can truthfully portray the 
            magnificent, divine person of Jesus. Indeed, any attempt will 
            ultimately only lower our concept of who He really was, and is. "To 
            whom then will ye liken God? Or what likeness will ye compare unto 
            him?" (Isaiah 40:18). <STRONG style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><A

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was said above about 
      the log-jam in Doug Batchelor's eyes also applies to William Johnsson, 
      Editor of the Adventist Review. Johnsson agrees with Newsweek that there 
      were places that did not agree with the Gospel account, and then points to 
      the Gospels, "<B><FONT color=#ff0000>to interpret Jesus suffering and 
      death for him." </FONT></B>And then on another page he promotes EGW's 
      fictional book, <I><B>The Passion of Love </B></I>to the public and says, 
      <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>"Desire of Ages is a vibrant and <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>biblically faithful commentary </FONT>detailing the last 
      hours of Jesus Christ's life."</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is 
      Johnsson also so Bible illiterate that he cannot recognize the additions 
      and contradictions of the Gospels in EGW's book? He says that Desire of 
      Ages&nbsp; is "<B>biblically faithful commentary dealing with the last 
      hours of Christ's life</B>."&nbsp; If he knows better, then this is 
      hypocrisy and deceit.&nbsp; We all know what Jesus said about liars and 
      hypocrites. </FONT></P>

            <P>Second, the movie offers Mel Gibson's interpretation of the 
            Passion. The Newsweek cover story pointed out several places where 
            the movie deviates from the Gospel accounts. For example, Gibson has 
            Mary Magdalene trying to get help from Roman soldiers when Jesus is 
            taken away to be tried by the priests. <FONT color=#ff0000><B>You

      <P>Recently, Seventh-day Adventist leaders have criticized Mel Gibson's 
      movie, "<A href="http://www.passionofchrist.com/" target=_new>The Passion 
      of the Christ</A>," for a supposed lack of Biblical accuracy. In the March 
      2004 <I>Adventist Review</I> article, "The Sufferings of Jesus," editor 
      William Johnsson notes, "I prefer to let Matthew, Mark, Luke and John 
      interpret Jesus' sufferings and death for me." </P>
      <P>Samuele Bacchiocchi, in his infamous "Endtime Issues Newsletter" 
      (#112), writes: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>"What I saw is hundred times worse than the most negative reviews I 
        read. From a biblical perspective, the movie contains numerous glaring 
        errors designed to promote the Catholic view of the Passion..."

      <P>Therefore, since Adventist leaders suddenly seem to have acquired a 
      great interest in stories about Jesus matching the Biblical record with 
      exactness, we decided to compare their prophet's writings about Jesus with 
      the Bible to see if Ellen White can meet the same standard held out for 
      Mel Gibson. </P>

      <H3><FONT face=arial color=#f00090 size=+2>Ellen White's "Passion" not 
      Biblical</FONT></H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 686) - "<B>His form swayed as if He were about to 
        fall</B>. Upon reaching the garden, the disciples looked anxiously for 
        His usual place of retirement, that their Master might rest. Every step 
        that He now took was with labored effort. <B>He groaned aloud, as if 
        suffering under the pressure of a terrible burden. Twice His companions 
        supported Him</B>, or He would have fallen to the earth." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about Jesus staggering and groaning as 
        He walked through Gethsemane or needing the disciples to prop Him up. 
        </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 694) - "The sleeping disciples had been suddenly 
        awakened by the light surrounding the Saviour. They saw the angel 
        bending over their prostrate Master. They saw him lift <B>the Saviour's 
        head upon his bosom, and point toward heaven. They heard his voice</B>, 
        like sweetest music, speaking words of comfort and hope." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says an angel strengthened Jesus (Luke 22:43), but 
        says nothing about the angel holding Christ upon his bosom, or the 
        disciples hearing him speak. </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 694) - "No traces of His recent agony were visible 
        as Jesus stepped forth to meet His betrayer. Standing in advance of His 
        disciples He said, "Whom seek ye?" They answered, "Jesus of Nazareth." 
        Jesus replied, "I am He." As these words were spoken, <B>the angel who 
        had lately ministered to Jesus moved between Him and the mob. A divine 
        light illuminated the Saviour's face, and a dovelike form overshadowed 
        Him</B>. In the presence of this divine glory, the murderous throng 
        could not stand for a moment. They staggered back. Priests, elders, 
        soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to the ground. The angel 
        withdrew, and the light faded away." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about a supernatural intervention by an 
        angel, a divine light, or a dovelike form. The Bible merely says, "As 
        soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and 
        fell to the ground." (John 18:6) </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 704) - "But as Caiaphas now looked upon the 
        prisoner, he was <B>struck with admiration</B> for His noble and 
        dignified bearing. A <B>conviction</B> came over him that this Man was 
        akin to God. The next instant he scornfully banished the thought." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about Caiaphas admiring Jesus or being 
        convicted. </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 708) - "The words of Christ startled the high 
        priest. The thought that there was to be a resurrection of the dead, 
        when all would stand at the bar of God, to be rewarded according to 
        their works, was a thought of terror to Caiaphas. He did not wish to 
        believe that in future he would receive sentence according to his works. 
        <B>There rushed before his mind as a panorama the scenes of the final 
        judgment</B>. For a moment he saw the fearful spectacle of the graves 
        giving up their dead, with the secrets he had hoped were forever hidden. 
        For a moment he felt as if standing before the eternal Judge, whose eye, 
        which sees all things, was reading his soul, bringing to light mysteries 
        supposed to be hidden with the dead. </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about Caiaphas being startled or having 
        a vision of the future judgment. </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 711) - "The disciple John, upon entering the 
        judgment hall, <B>did not try to conceal the fact that he was a follower 
        of Jesus</B>." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about whether or not John tried to 
        conceal himself. </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 713) - "On <B>the very spot</B> where Jesus had 
        poured out His soul in agony to His Father, Peter fell upon his face, 
        and wished that he might die." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about Peter weeping on the exact same 
        spot where Jesus had wept. </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 722) - "Eagerly <B>grasping the robe of 
        Caiaphas</B>, he [Judas] implored him to release Jesus, declaring that 
        He had done nothing worthy of death." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about Judas grabbing the robe of 
        Caiaphas and begging for Jesus' life. </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 722) - "Judas now <B>cast himself at the feet of 
        Jesus, acknowledging Him to be the Son of God, and entreating Him to 
        deliver Himself</B>. The Saviour did not reproach His betrayer. He knew 
        that Judas did not repent; his confession was forced from his guilty 
        soul by an awful sense of condemnation and a looking for of judgment, 
        but he felt no deep, heartbreaking grief that he had betrayed the 
        spotless Son of God, and denied the Holy One of Israel. Yet Jesus spoke 
        no word of condemnation. <B>He looked pityingly upon Judas, and said, 
        For this hour came I into the world</B>. A murmur of surprise ran 
        through the assembly. With amazement they beheld the forbearance of 
        Christ toward His betrayer. Again there swept over them the conviction 
        that this Man was more than mortal. But if He was the Son of God, they 
        questioned, why did He not free Himself from His bonds and triumph over 
        His accusers? Judas saw that his entreaties were in vain, and <B>he 
        rushed from the hall exclaiming, It is too late! It is too late!</B>" 
        </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing of such an encounter between Judas and 
        Christ in the judgment hall. There is no mention of them having any 
        contact or any conversation, nor is there any record of Judas running 
        from the hall yelling. </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 732) - "In answer to Christ's prayer, the wife of 
        Pilate had been <B>visited by an angel from heaven</B>, and in a dream 
        <B>she had beheld the Saviour and conversed with Him</B>. Pilate's wife 
        was not a Jew, but as she looked upon Jesus in her dream, she had no 
        doubt of His character or mission. She knew Him to be the Prince of God. 
        She saw Him on trial in the judgment hall. She saw the hands tightly 
        bound as the hands of a criminal. She saw Herod and his soldiers doing 
        their dreadful work. She heard the priests and rulers, filled with envy 
        and malice, madly accusing. She heard the words, "We have a law, and by 
        our law He ought to die." She saw Pilate give Jesus to the scourging, 
        after he had declared, "I find no fault in Him." She heard the 
        condemnation pronounced by Pilate, and saw him give Christ up to His 
        murderers. She saw the cross uplifted on Calvary. She saw the earth 
        wrapped in darkness, and heard the mysterious cry, "It is finished." 
        Still another scene met her gaze. <B>She saw Christ seated upon the 
        great white cloud</B>, while the earth reeled in space, and His 
        murderers fled from the presence of His glory. With a cry of horror she 
        awoke, and at once wrote to Pilate words of warning." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing of an angel visiting Pilate's wife. Nor 
        does it say she conversed with Christ in her dream, nor does it say she 
        saw a vision of the cross or the Second Coming of Christ. The Bible only 
        says that she "suffered many things this day in a dream because of him." 
        (Matt. 27:19) </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 739) - "Looking upon the smitten Lamb of God, the 
        Jews had cried, 'His blood be on us, and on our children.' That awful 
        cry ascended to the throne of God. <B>That sentence, pronounced upon 
        themselves, was written in heaven. That prayer was heard. The blood of 
        the Son of God was upon their children and their children's children, a 
        perpetual curse</B>." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about the Jews being cursed for their 
        sin. In fact, Christ later prayed upon the cross, "Father forgive them, 
        for they know not what they do." </P>
        <P>ELLEN WHITE: (DA 748) - "<B>And Satan with his angels, in human form, 
        was present at the cross</B>. The archfiend and his hosts were 
        co-operating with the priests and rulers." </P>
        <P>BIBLE: The Bible says nothing about Satan and his angels taking human 
        form and being present at the cross. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3><FONT face=arial color=#f00090>Conclusion</FONT></H3>
      <P>We have seen numerous examples of how Ellen White's version of the 
      Passion adds to what the Bible says. So where did Ellen White get her 
      version of the Passion? From heavenly visions? No, not exactly. SDA 
      researcher Dr. Fred Veltman determined that Ellen White used 23 books, 
      including works of fiction, when writing <I>Desire of Ages</I>. To examine 
      that evidence in more detail, <A
