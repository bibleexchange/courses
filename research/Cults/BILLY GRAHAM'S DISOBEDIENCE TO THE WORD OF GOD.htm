        <DD>“And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said 
        to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that

      <P>I have been warning about Billy Graham’s compromise for decades, and it 
      is a very difficult thing to do. He is one of the most popular men in the 
      world. He is universally acclaimed as a wonderful Christian and a great 
      evangelist. When you say something critical of Billy Graham, many people 
      consider it equal to blasphemy against Almighty God!</P>
      <P>The Lord knows, if I thought I could fulfill my obligations before God 
      as a preacher of His Word and still keep my mouth shut about the Billy 
      Grahams of our day, I would do it in a heartbeat! I am convinced that this 
      is not possible, though, and by God’s grace I would rather please Him than 
      man.</P>
      <P>In February 1997, I published an article in <I>O Timoth</I>y magazine 
      about <A 
      href="http://www.wayoflife.org/fbns/fbns/fbns376.html(EmptyReference!)">Jerry 
      Falwell’s support of Billy Graham</A>. We noted that a watershed of sorts 
      had occurred at Falwell’s Liberty University, in that the 1997 
      commencement speaker was Dr. Billy Graham, the foremost spokesman for the 
      New Evangelical movement. The announcement in the <I>National Liberty 
      Journal</I> stated:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“It is befitting that Dr. Graham will speak at Liberty’s 1997 
        Commencement, since his grandson, William Franklin (Will) Graham IV, 
        will be among the graduating seniors. (Another grandson, Roy Graham, is 
        a freshman at Liberty.) ... Dr. Falwell said, ‘This will be Dr. Graham’s 
        first visit to Liberty. THIS COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS WILL NO DOUBT BE 
        REMEMBERED HISTORICALLY IN THE NEXT CENTURY AS ONE OF LIBERTY’S HIGH 
        DAYS. I am grateful that Dr. Graham is taking time from his busy 
        schedule to grace us with his presence” (emphasis added) (<I>National 
        Liberty Journal</I>, December 1996, pp. 1, 17). </DD></DL>
      <P>The <I>National Liberty Journal</I> did not give one word of warning 
      about Graham breaking down the walls of biblical separation between sound 
      churches and apostate churches in this generation. There was not one word 
      of warning about Graham sending thousands of converts back into Roman 
      Catholic and modernistic churches that preach false gospels.</P>
      <P>Independent Baptist preachers who are affiliate with Liberty University 
      are leading fundamental Baptists right into the arms of the devil’s 
      ecumenical movement.</P>
      <P>In the February 1997 <I>O Timothy</I> article, I agreed with the 
      <I>National Liberty Journal </I>that it was befitting for Graham to speak 
      at Liberty University, because though Dr. Falwell and his church and 
      school claim to be fundamental Baptists, for many years they had been 
      sliding into the New Evangelical camp. Today they are firmly entrenched in 
      that unscriptural position. To openly praise and support Billy Graham is 
      irrefutable evidence of this.</P>
      <P>The February 1997 article was also published via the Fundamental 
      Baptist Information Service by e-mail over the Internet, and in turn it 
      was sent out to a Baptist news group. Many of the responses we received 
      from that public posting were very negative. In reading these, I was 
      impressed anew at the ignorance that is rampant even in the staunchest 
      Bible-believing circles. Many of those who responded were completely 
      ignorant of the fact that Billy Graham has sent multitudes of converts 
      back to the Roman Catholic Church or that he praises Christ-denying 
      Modernists. These things were not done in the dark, yet many Christians 
      are entirely ignorant of them.</P>
      <P>A chief cause for this ignorance is cowardice in the pulpits. Too many 
      Christian “ministers” are belly-serving cowards. Their goal is to go with 
      the flow and to make people feel good about themselves rather than to 
      preach the truth regardless of the cost. The Bible describes these men as 
      “dumb dogs” (Isaiah 56:10). What good is a watchdog that will not bark? If 
      ever there were an hour in which preachers need to lift the voice against 
      the error that is on every side, it is today, but what we have are dumb 
      dogs.</P>
      <P>In the article on Falwell supporting Graham, we mentioned a number of 
      things of which Dr. Graham is guilty. Following is the documentation to 
      each of these charges.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>BILLY GRAHAM ACCEPTS DEGREES FROM CATHOLIC COLLEGES AND SAYS THE 
      CATHOLIC GOSPEL IS THE SAME AS HIS OWN</P>
      <P>On Nov. 21, 1967, an honorary degree was conferred on Graham by the 
      Catholic priests who run Belmont Abbey College, North Carolina, during an 
      Institute for Ecumenical Dialogue. <I>The Gastonia Gazette</I> 
      reported:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“After receiving the honorary degree of doctor of humane letters 
        (D.H.L.) from the Abbey, Graham noted the significance of the 
        occasion--’a time when Protestants and Catholics could meet together and 
        greet each other as brothers, whereas 10 years ago they could not,’ he 
        said.<BR><BR>
        <DD>“The evangelist’s first sermon at a Catholic institution was at the 
        Abbey, in 1963, and his return Tuesday was the climax to this week’s 
        Institute for Ecumenic Dialogue, a program sponsored in part by the 
        Abbey and designed to promote understanding among Catholic and 
        Protestant clergymen of the Gaston-Mecklenburg area.<BR><BR>
        <DD>“Graham, freshly returned from his Japanese Crusade, said he ‘knew 
        of no greater honor a North Carolina preacher, reared just a few miles 
        from here, could have than to be presented with this degree. I’m not 
        sure but what this could start me being called “Father Graham,”’ he 
        facetiously added.<BR><BR>
        <DD>“Graham said... ‘Finally, the way of salvation has not changed. I 
        know how the ending of the book will be. THE GOSPEL THAT BUILT THIS 
        SCHOOL AND THE GOSPEL THAT BRINGS ME HERE TONIGHT IS STILL THE WAY TO 
        SALVATION” (“Belmont Abbey Confers Honorary Degree,” Paul Smith, 
        <I>Gazette</I> staff reporter, <I>The Gastonia Gazette</I>, Gastonia, 
        North Carolina, Nov. 22, 1967). </DD></DL>
      <P>This is simply amazing. Does Billy Graham really believe that the 
      sacramental grace-works gospel that built Belmont Abbey is the way of 
      salvation? If so, why does Graham preach that salvation is by grace alone 
      through faith alone without works or sacraments? Why does he remain a 
      Baptist rather than joining the Catholic Church? On the other hand, if 
      Graham does not believe Rome’s gospel is true, why did he say what he 
      does? Why does he fellowship with Rome? The evangelist tries to have it 
      both ways, but it is impossible. This is why Graham has been called “Mr. 
      Facing Both Ways”!</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM HAS TURNED THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS OVER TO APOSTATE 
      CHURCHES</B></P>
      <P>The evidence for this is overwhelming. We have documented this 
      extensively in our 354-page book <I>Evangelicals and Rome </I>(Way of Life 
      Literature, P.O. Box 610368, Port Huron, MI 48061). As early as Sept. 21, 
      1957, Graham said in an interview with the <I>San Francisco News</I>, 
      “Anyone who makes a decision at our meetings is seen later and referred to 
      a local clergyman, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish.” In 1983, <I>The 
      Florida Catholic</I> (Sept. 2, 1983) reported of the Orlando crusade: 
      “Names of Catholics who had made decisions for Christ were provided at 
      that meeting by Rick Marshall of the Graham organization.” The report said 
      the names of 600 people had been turned over to the Catholic Church. In 
      1984, at the Vancouver, British Columbia crusade, the vice-chairman of the 
      organizing committee, David Cline of Bringhouse United Church, said, “If 
      Catholic step forward THERE WILL BE NO ATTEMPT TO CONVERT THEM and their 
      names will be given to the Catholic church nearest their homes” 
      (<I>Vancouver Sun</I>, Oct. 5, 1984). In 1987 a Catholic priest, Donald 
      Willette of St. Jude’s Church, was a supervisor of the counselors for the 
      Denver crusade. Willette reported that from one service alone 500 cards of 
      individuals were referred to St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church in 
      Englewood, a suburb of Denver (Wilson Ewin, <I>Evangelism: The Trojan 
      Horse of the 1990s</I>). In 1989, Michael Seed, Ecumenical Advisor to 
      (Catholic) Cardinal Hume, said of Graham’s London crusade: “Those who come 
      forward for counseling during a Mission evening in June, if they are Roman 
      Catholic, will be directed to a Roman Catholic ‘nurture-group’ under Roman 
      Catholic counselors in their home area” (John Ashbrook, <I>New Neutralism 
      II</I>, p. 35). In 1992, the Catholic archdiocese of Portland, Oregon, had 
      set a goal to supply many of counselors needed for the Graham crusade. All 
      Catholics responding to the altar call were channeled to Catholic 
      churches.</P>
      <P>Billy Graham’s crusade in Cincinnati, Ohio, June 27-30, 2002, included 
      full participation of the Roman Catholic Church. In preparation for the 
      crusade, five Catholic parishes -- Our Lady of Lourdes in Westwood, Our 
      Lady of the Rosary in Greenhills, Our Lady of the Rosary and Guardian 
      Angels in Cincinnati, and Trinity Center in Dayton -- presented week-long 
      courses to prepare Catholic counselors to deal with those who came forward 
      in response to Graham’s invitations. According to Curtis Kneblik, 
      assistant director of evangelization for the Roman Catholic archdiocese of 
      Dayton, invitations were sent out to 9,000 Catholics to request their 
      participation in this training, and hundreds responded. Priest Charles 
      Bowes told his parish that the Graham mission was a “golden opportunity to 
      evangelize Catholics and to help our parish…” (<I>The Catholic 
      Telegraph</I>, May 10, 2002). When Catholic leaders refer to “evangelizing 
      Catholics,” they do not mean what Bible believers mean, that such 
      Catholics are unsaved and on their way to hell. They believe, rather, that 
      the Catholics who go forward at the Graham crusade already have Christ 
      through their infant baptism and that that they merely need to be brought 
      into a more active sacramental relationship with the Catholic Church. When 
      Catholics hear of “receiving Christ,” they do not think in terms of 
      receiving Christ once-for-all through faith in His blood. They think, 
      rather, in terms of Catholic doctrine, which teaches that they receive 
      Christ continually in the sacraments, such as the mass and confession, yet 
      they can never be assured of eternal life because the Catholic gospel is a 
      mixture of faith plus works. Kneblik admitted this when he said: “We have 
      an altar call every Sunday. Christ is truly present (in the Eucharist). We 
      have to stand up and walk toward Him like they did on that field” (<I>The 
      Catholic Telegraph</I>, July 12, 2002). This is the false christ of the 
      mass. The Catholics who went forward in the Graham crusade were 
      subsequently invited to join a Catholic study group in their area. The 
      strong Catholic participation was not mentioned in the official Billy 
      Graham material on the crusade, but the information can be found at the 
      Roman Catholic diocese web site.</P>
      <P>Graham’s June 1996 crusade in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, brought 
      the participation of 119 Catholic parishes and 269 Lutheran congregations 
      (<I>Christianity Today</I>, July 15, 1996). This represented 53 percent of 
      the Catholic parishes. This is a dramatic change from the 1973 Minneapolis 
      crusade, when no Catholic churches and only a few Lutheran churches 
      participated. Archbishop Harry Flynn, head of the archdiocese of St. Paul 
      and Minneapolis, urged priests to become involved in the crusade “in an 
      effort to reach alienated Catholics” (Morphew Clark, <I>St. Paul Pioneer 
      Press</I>, Jan. 13, 1996). Priest Robert Schwartz of the St. John Neumann 
      Catholic parish told reporters that about 60 members of his parish had 
      been trained to counsel those who came forward during the crusade.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Graham said that nearly all of his crusades were supported by 
      Roman Catholic churches. He said this in an interview with <I>New Man</I> 
      magazine, published at that time by Promise Keepers. Fol&shy;low&shy;ing 
      is his statement on Catholicism:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“Early on in my life, I didn’t know much about Catholics. But 
        through the years I have made many friends within the Roman Catholic 
        Church. In fact, when we hold a crusade in a city now, nearly all the 
        Roman Catholic churches support it. And when we went to Minneapolis-St. 
        Paul, Minn., for the crusade [last year], we saw St. Paul, which is 
        largely Catholic, and Minneapolis, which is largely Lutheran, both 
        supporting the crusade. That wouldn’t have happened 25 years ago” 
        (“Billy Graham&nbsp;in His Own Words: What the Evangelist Has Learned 
        from a Lifetime of Ministry to the World,” <I>New Man</I>, March-April 
        1997, pp. 32, 33). </DD></DL>
      <P>The Billy Graham organizational committee preparing for the November 
      2004 crusade in Los Angeles, California, promised the Roman Catholic 
      archdiocese that Catholics will not be “proselytized.” A letter from 
      Cardinal Roger Mahony, dated October 6, 2004, and posted at the 
      archdiocese web site, stated: “When the Crusade was held in other 
      locations, many Catholics responded to Dr. Graham’s message and came 
      forward for Christ. Crusade officials expect the same for the Los Angeles 
      area. These officials have assured me that, IN KEEPING WITH DR. GRAHAM’S 
      BELIEF AND POLICY, THERE WILL BE NO PROSELYTIZING, AND THAT ANYONE 
      IDENTIFYING HIM OR HERSELF AS CATHOLIC WILL BE REFERRED TO US for 
      reintegration into the life of the Catholic Church. We must be ready to 
      welcome them.” Roman Catholic actor Jim Caviezel was featured on the 
      platform at the second night of the Billy Graham Los Angeles Crusade, 
      which lasted from Nov. 18-21. Caviezel starred as “Jesus” in Mel Gibson’s 
      <I>The Passion of the Christ</I>. He says he prayed to St. Genesius of 
      Arles and St. Anthony of Padua for help in his acting career. He has 
      visited Medjugorje to witness the site where Mary allegedly appeared to 
      six young people. Caviezel said, “This film is something that I believe 
      was made by Mary for her Son.” Caviezel prayed the Rosary to Mary every 
      day during the filming. Is it that Graham believes Caviezel’s gospel, or 
      is it that Caviezel believes Graham’s gospel, or is it that the biblical 
      truth that two must be agreed before they walk together is no longer in 
      force today? What confusion and open disobedience!</P>
      <P>This is just the tip of the iceberg. For many decades, Billy Graham has 
      turned large numbers of his converts over to the hands of wolves in 
      sheep’s clothing such as Catholic priests and modernistic Protestant 
      pastors.</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM INVITES CATHOLIC BISHOPS ONTO HIS PLATFORM TO BLESS 
      THOSE WHO COME FORWARD AT HIS INVITATIONS</B></P>
      <P>The Roman Catholic bishop of Sao Paulo, Brazil, stood beside Graham 
      during his 1963 crusade in that city, and blessed those who came forward 
      at the invitation. Graham said this illustrated that “something 
      tremendous, an awakening of reform and revival within Christianity” was 
      happening (<I>Daily Journal</I>, International Falls, Minnesota, Oct. 29, 
      1963, cited by the <I>New York Times</I>, Nov. 9, 1963).</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM SAYS HIS GOAL IS NOT TO LEAD ROMAN CATHOLICS OUT OF 
      CATHOLICISM</B></P>
      <P>In his 1997 autobiography, <I>Just As I Am</I>, Graham said his goal 
      was not to lead people out of Roman Catholicism: “MY GOAL, I ALWAYS MADE 
      CLEAR, WAS NOT TO PREACH AGAINST CATHOLIC BELIEFS OR TO PROSELYTIZE PEOPLE 
      who were already committed to Christ within the Catholic Church. Rather, 
      it was to proclaim the gospel to all those who had never truly committed 
      their lives to Christ” (Graham, <I>Just As I Am</I>, p. 357).&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM THINKS THE POPE IS AN EVANGELIST AND MORAL 
      LEADER</B></P>
      <P>In 1979 Graham called Pope John Paul II “the moral leader of the world” 
      (Religious News Service, Sept. 27, 1979). He also said that John Paul II 
      “is almost an evangelist because he calls to people to turn to Christ, to 
      turn to Christianity” (<I>The Star</I>, June 26, 1979, reprinted in the 
      <I>Australian Beacon</I>, August 1979, p. 1). In an interview with <I>The 
      Saturday Evening Post (</I>Jan-Feb. 1980), Graham described the visit of 
      John Paul II to America with these words: “The pope came as a statesman 
      and a pastor, but I believe he also sees himself coming as an evangelist 
      ... The pope sought to speak to the spiritual hunger of our age in the 
      same way Christians throughout the centuries have spoken to the spiritual 
      yearnings of every age--by pointing people to Christ.” In a lengthy 
      article about the Pope in 1980, Graham praised the Pope as a “bridge 
      builder” and said: “Pope John Paul II has emerged as the greatest 
      religious leader of the modern world, and one of the greatest moral and 
      spiritual leaders of the century” (<I>Saturday Evening Post</I>, Jan.-Feb. 
      1980). After visiting the Pope in 1981, Graham said, “We had a spiritual 
      time” (<I>Christianity Today</I>, Feb. 6, 1981, p. 88). Graham made the 
      following statement about the Pope’s address in Vancouver, British 
      Columbia, in 1983: “I’ll tell you--that was just about as straight an 
      evangelical address as I’ve ever heard. It was tremendous” 
      (<I>Foundation</I> magazine, Vol. V, Issue 5, 1984).</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM SAYS HE IS VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE VATICAN AND AGREED 
      WITH THE LATE POPE ON ALMOST EVERYTHING</B></P>
      <P>In a January 1997 interview on <I>Larry King Live</I>, Graham said that 
      he has wonderful fellowship with Rome, is comfortable with the Vatican, 
      and agrees with the Pope on almost everything.</P>
      <P>KING: What do you think of the other [churches] ... like Mormonism? 
      Catholicism? Other faiths within the Christian concept?</P>
      <P>GRAHAM: Oh, I think I have a wonderful fellowship with all of them.</P>
      <P>KING: You’re comfortable with Salt Lake City. You’re comfortable with 
      the Vatican?</P>
      <P>GRAHAM: I am very comfortable with the Vatican. I have been to see the 
      Pope several times. In fact, the night — the day that he was inaugurated, 
      made Pope, I was preaching in his cathedral in Krakow. I was his guest ... 
      [and] when he was over here ... in Columbia, South Carolina ... he invited 
      me on the platform to speak with him. I would give one talk, and he would 
      give the other ... but I was two-thirds of the way to China...</P>
      <P>KING: You like this Pope?</P>
      <P>GRAHAM: I like him very much. ... He and I agree on almost 
      everything.</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM BELIEVES THE LATE POPE JOHN PAUL II SURELY WENT TO 
      HEAVEN</B></P>
      <P>On <I>Larry King Live</I> aired April 2, 2005, Billy Graham said the 
      late Pope was “the most influential voice for morality and peace in the 
      world in the last 100 years.” When Larry King asked, “There is no question 
      in your mind that he is with God now?” Graham replied: “Oh, no. There may 
      be a question about my own, but I don't think Cardinal Wojtyla, or the 
      Pope -- I think he’s with the Lord, because he believed. He believed in 
      the cross. That was his focus throughout his ministry, the cross, no 
      matter if you were talking to him from personal issue or an ethical 
      problem, he felt that there was the answer to all of our problems, the 
      cross and the resurrection. And he was a strong believer.” This is a most 
      amazing statement by the man who is considered the world’s foremost 
      evangelist. Graham expresses less than certainty about his own salvation 
      but complete certainty about the Pope’s, even though he preached a false 
      gospel of grace mixed with works and sacraments and put his trust in Mary 
      as his intercessor. Graham should know that John Paul II did not believe 
      in the cross in any scriptural sense. Rather he believed in the cross PLUS 
      baptism PLUS the mass PLUS confession to a priest PLUS the saints, and 
      above all PLUS Mary. “And if by grace, then is it no more of works: 
      otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no 
      more grace: otherwise work is no more work” (Rom. 11:6). “I marvel that ye 
      are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto 
      another gospel” (Gal. 1:6).</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM SAYS HE IS EQUALLY AT HOME IN ALL CHURCHES</B></P>
      <P>In a May 30, 1997, interview, Graham told David Frost: “I feel I belong 
      to all the churches. I’M EQUALLY AT HOME IN AN ANGLICAN OR BAPTIST OR A 
      BRETHREN ASSEMBLY OR A ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. ... Today we have almost 100 
      percent Catholic support in this country. That was not true twenty years 
      ago. And the bishops and archbishops and the Pope are our friends” (David 
      Frost, <I>Billy Graham in Conversation</I>, pp. 68, 143).</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM SAYS THAT BAPTISM IS NOT HIS CONCERN</B></P>
      <P>Billy Graham conducted a crusade in St. Louis, Missouri, in October 
      1999. In an interview with the press, Graham said that baptism is not his 
      concern and not his business. The following is his statement: “Baptism is 
      very important because Jesus taught that we are to believe and to be 
      baptized. But that is up to the individual and the church that they feel 
      led to go to. The churches have different teachings on that. I know that 
      in the Lutheran or the Episcopal or Catholic Church it is a very strong 
      point, and in the Baptist church. But there are some churches that would 
      not insist on baptism. So, I GIVE THEM THE FREEDOM TO TEACH WHAT THEY 
      WANT. I am not a professor. I am not a theologian. I’m a simple 
      proclaimer. … I’m announcing the news that God loves you and that you can 
      be forgiven of your sins. And you can go to heaven. My job from God is not 
      to do all these other things. … I am not a pastor of a church. That’s not 
      my responsibility. MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERYONE 
      AND LET THEM CHOOSE THEIR OWN CHURCH, WHETHER IT IS CATHOLIC OR PROTESTANT 
      OR ORTHODOX OR WHATEVER IT IS” (Billy Graham, interview with Patricia 
      Rice, <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, October 10, 1999).</P>
      <P>This is a strange statement in light of the explicit command by the 
      Lord Jesus Christ: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them 
      in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matthew 
      28:19).</P>
      <P>Billy Graham is called an evangelist. The prime example of an 
      evangelist in the New Testament is Philip, and Philip baptized his

        <DD>“And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and 
        the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 
        And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. 
        And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
        And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both 
        into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him” (Acts 
        8:36-38). </DD></DL>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM SAYS PEOPLE IN OTHER RELIGIONS CAN BE SAVED</B></P>
      <P>In an interview with <I>McCall’s</I> magazine, January 1978, entitled 
      “I Can’t Play God Any More,” Graham said: “I used to believe that pagans 
      in far-off countries were lost—were going to hell—if they did not have the 
      Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them. I no longer believe that. … I 
      believe that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of 
      God—through nature, for instance—and plenty of other opportunities, 
      therefore, of saying ‘yes’ to God.”</P>
      <P>Though Graham later tried to stem the controversy brought about by his 
      comments, he continued to allow for the possibility that the unsaved in 
      other religions might not go to hell if they respond to natural light.</P>
      <P>In 1985, Graham affirmed his belief that those outside of Christ might 
      be saved. Los Angeles reporter David Colker asked Graham: “What about 
      people of other faiths who live good lives but don’t profess a belief in 
      Christ?” Graham replied, “I’m going to leave that to the Lord. He’ll 
      decide that” (<I>Los Angeles Herald Examiner</I>, July 22, 1985). While 
      this answer might appear reasonable to those who do not know the Bible, in 
      reality it is a great compromise of the truth. God has already decided 
      what will happen to those who die outside of faith in Jesus Christ. The 
      book of Ephesians describes the condition of such as “children of wrath” 
      (Eph. 2:3) and “having no hope, and without God in the world” (Eph. 2:12). 
      That is why Christ must be preached. Men without a saving knowledge of 
      Christ are condemned already (John 3:18). There is no mystery or question 
      about this matter, because the Bible has plainly spoken.</P>
      <P>In 1993, Graham repeated this philosophy in an interview with David 
      Frost. “And I think there is that hunger for God and people are living as 
      best they know how according to the light that they have. Well, I think 
      they’re in a separate category than people like Hitler and people who have 
      just defied God, and shaken their fists at God. … I would say that God, 
      being a God of mercy, we have to rest it right there, and say that God is 
      a God of mercy and love, and how it happens, we don’t know” (<I>The 
      Charlotte Observer</I>, Feb. 16, 1993).</P>
      <P>In his interview with Robert Schuller in May 1997, Graham again said 
      that he believes people in other religions can be saved without 
      consciously believing in Jesus Christ.</P>
      <P>SCHULLER: Tell me, what do you think is the future of Christianity?</P>
      <P>GRAHAM: Well, Christianity and being a true believer--you know, I think 
      there's the Body of Christ. This comes from all the Christian groups 
      around the world, outside the Christian groups. I think everybody that 
      loves Christ, or knows Christ, whether they're conscious of it or not, 
      they're members of the Body of Christ. And I don't think that we're going 
      to see a great sweeping revival, that will turn the whole world to Christ 
      at any time. I think James answered that, the Apostle James in the first 
      council in Jerusalem, when he said that God's purpose for this age is to 
      call out a people for His name. And that's what God is doing today, He's 
      calling people out of the world for His name, WHETHER THEY COME FROM THE 
      MUSLIM WORLD, OR THE BUDDHIST WORLD, OR THE CHRISTIAN WORLD OR THE 
      NON-BELIEVING WORLD, THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BECAUSE 
      THEY'VE BEEN CALLED BY GOD. THEY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF JESUS but 
      they know in their hearts that they need something that they don't have, 
      and they turn to the only light that they have, and I think that they are 
      saved, and that they're going to be with us in heaven.</P>
      <P>SCHULLER: What, what I hear you saying that it's possible for Jesus 
      Christ to come into human hearts and soul and life, even if they've been 
      born in darkness and have never had exposure to the Bible. Is that a 
      correct interpretation of what you're saying?</P>
      <P>GRAHAM: Yes, it is, because I believe that. I've met people in various 
      parts of the world in tribal situations, that THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A BIBLE 
      OR HEARD ABOUT A BIBLE, AND NEVER HEARD OF JESUS, BUT THEY'VE BELIEVED IN 
      THEIR HEARTS THAT THERE WAS A GOD, and they've tried to live a life that 
      was quite apart from the surrounding community in which they lived.</P>
      <P>SCHULLER: [trips over his tongue for a moment, his face beaming, then 
      says] I I'm so thrilled to hear you say this. There's a wideness in God's 
      mercy.</P>
      <P>GRAHAM: There is. There definitely is (Television interview of Billy 
      Graham by Robert Schuller, broadcast in southern California on Saturday, 
      May 31, 1997).</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM THINKS A MIRACLE HAPPENS IN INFANT BAPTISM</B></P>
      <P>In a 1961 interview with the <I>Lutheran Standard </I>of the liberal 
      American Lutheran Church, Graham testified that all of his children except 
      the youngest were baptized as infants (Graham grew up as a Presbyterian 
      and his wife was a Presbyterian). Graham then made the following amazing 
      statement:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“I have some difficulty in accepting the indiscriminate baptism of 
        infants without a careful regard as to whether the parents have any 
        intention of fulfilling the promise they make. But I do believe that 
        something happens at the baptism of an infant, particularly if the 
        parents are Christians and teach their children Christian Truths from 
        childhood. We cannot fully understand the miracles of God, but I believe 
        that a miracle can happen in these children so that they are 
        regenerated, that is, made Christian, through infant baptism. If you 
        want to call that baptismal regeneration, that’s all right with me” 
        (Graham, interview with Wilfred Bockelman, associate editor of the 
        <I>Lutheran Standard</I>, American Lutheran Church, <I>Lutheran 
        Standard</I>, October 10, 1961). </DD></DL>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM DOES NOT BELIEVE HELL IS A PLACE OF LITERAL FIERY 
      TORMENT</B></P>
      <P>Billy Graham was questioning the literal fire of hell as far back as 
      1951. During his crusade in Greensboro, North Carolina, from Oct. 14 to 
      Nov. 18, 1951, Graham made the following statement:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“I know that God has a fire which burns but does not consume; one 
        example is the fire of the burning bush which Moses saw. I know also, 
        however, that in many places throughout the Bible, the term ‘fire’ is 
        used figuratively to connote great punishment or suffering. The Bible 
        speaks of fire set by the tongue” (Graham, cited by Margaret Moffett 
        Banks, “Crusader: Graham saved souls, made headlines,” <I>News &amp; 
        Record</I>, Greensboro, North Carolina, March 15, 1999). </DD></DL>
      <P>The author of this secular newspaper article noted that Graham “stopped 
      short of describing a literal Hell, where tormented souls burn for 
      eternity.”</P>
      <P>The <I>Orlando (Florida) Sentinel</I> for April 10, 1983, asked Billy 
      Graham: “Surveys tell us that 85% of Americans believe in heaven, but only 
      65% believe in hell. Why do you think so many Americans don’t accept the 
      concept of hell?” He replied: “I think that hell essentially is separation 
      from God forever. And that is the worst hell that I can think of. But I 
      think people have a hard time believing God is going to allow people to 
      burn in literal fire forever. I think the fire that is mentioned in the 
      Bible is a burning thirst for God that can never be quenched.”</P>
      <P>In his 1983 “Affirmations” for evangelists, Graham said the fire of 
      hell could be symbolic:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“Jesus used three words to describe hell. ... The third word that He 
        used is ‘fire.’ Jesus used this symbol over and over. This could be 
        literal fire, as many believe. Or IT COULD BE SYMBOLIC. ... I’ve often 
        thought that this fire could possibly be a burning thirst for God that 
        is never quenched” (<I>A Biblical Standard for Evangelists</I>, Billy 
        Graham, A commentary on the 15 Affirmations made by participants at the 
        International Conference for Itinerant Evangelists in Amsterdam, The 
        Netherlands, July, 1983, Worldwide Publications, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
        pages 45-47). </DD></DL>
      <P>In <I>Time</I> magazine, November 15, 1993, Graham said: “The only 
      thing I could say for sure is that hell means separation from God. We are 
      separated from his light, from his fellowship. That is going to be hell. 
      When it comes to a literal fire, I don’t preach it because I’m not sure 
      about it. When the Scripture uses fire concerning hell, that is possibly 
      an illustration of how terrible it’s going to be—not fire but something 
      worse, a thirst for God that cannot be quenched.”</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM PRAISES CHRIST-DENYING MODERNISTS</B></P>
      <P>Graham’s close affiliation with unbelieving false teachers has been 
      documented for 50 years. There were 120 Modernists on his New York Crusade 
      committee in 1957. One of those was HENRY VAN DUSEN, president of the 
      extremely liberal Union Theological Seminary. Van Dusen denied Christ’s 
      virgin birth. In his book <I>Liberal Theology</I>, he stated that Jesus is 
      not God. Van Dusen and his wife later committed suicide together.</P>
      <P>Another Modernist exalted by Graham during the 1957 New York Crusade 
      was JOHN SUTHERLAND BONNELL, pastor of Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. 
      Bonnell was on the executive committee and was honored by Graham on the 
      platform during the meetings. Bonnell had also participated in Graham’s 
      Scotland crusade in 1955. Graham mentions Bonnell twice in a strictly 
      positive manner in his 1997 biography, <I>Just As I Am</I>. In an article 
      in <I>Look</I> magazine (March 23, 1954) Bonnell had stated that he and 
      most other Presbyterian ministers did not believe in the virgin birth or 
      bodily resurrection of Christ, the inspiration of Scripture, a real heaven 
      and hell, etc. This unbelieving wolf in sheep’s clothing said that he and 
      most other Presbyterians “do not conceive of heaven as a place with gates 
      of pearl and streets of gold. Nor do they think of hell as a place where 
      the souls of condemned are punished in fire and brimstone.”</P>
      <P>In his 1959 San Francisco Crusade, Graham honored the notorious liberal 
      BISHOP JAMES A. PIKE by having him lead in prayer. Graham had attended 
      Pike’s consecration at San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral on May 15, 1958 
      (William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne, <I>The Death and Life of Bishop 
      Pike</I>, p. 306). Pike would also have been involved in Graham’s 1957 New 
      York Crusade, as he was the dean of the extremely modernistic Cathedral of 
      St. John the Divine in New York from 1952 to 1958. Yet Pike was a rank, 
      unbelieving Modernist, a drunkard, an adulterer. He denied the Trinity and 
      refused to state the traditional benediction, “In the name of the Father, 
      and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen!” He abbreviated this to “In 
      the name of God, Amen!” Three times Pike was brought up on heresy charges 
      in the Episcopal Church. In an article in <I>Look</I> magazine Pike stated 
      that he did not believe the fundamentals of the faith. In a pastoral 
      letter that was to be read in all the Episcopal Churches of his diocese, 
      Pike stated that “religious myth is one of the avenues of faith and has an 
      important place in the communication of the Gospel.” He spoke of the “myth 
      of the Garden of Eden.” He said, “The virgin birth... is a myth which 
      churchmen should be free to accept or reject.” In an article in 
      <I>Christian Century</I>, Dec. 21, 1960, Pike declared that he no longer 
      believed the doctrines stated in the Apostles’ Creed. The same month that 
      article appeared Graham again joined Pike at his Grace Cathedral for a 
      Christian Men’s Assembly sponsored by the National Council of Churches. 
      Three times Pike was picked up by San Francisco police while he was 
      wandering around in a drunken, confused state late at night. He spent four 
      years in intensive psychoanalysis. Pike was twice divorced, thrice 
      married, and had at least three mistresses. One of his mistresses 
      committed suicide; one of his daughters attempted suicide. His eldest son 
      committed suicide in 1966 at age 20 (associated with his homosexuality), 
      and Pike got deeply involved in the occult in an attempt to communicate 
      with the deceased. Three years later Pike died from a 70-foot fall in a 
      remote canyon in the Israeli desert near the Dead Sea. His maggot infested 
      body was found five days later. The 56-year-old theologian had gotten lost 
      in the desert while on an extended honeymoon with his 31-year-old third 
      wife (and long time mistress). A biography about Pike noted that “never 
      before in the history of the Episcopal Church had a Solemn Requiem Mass 
      been offered for a bishop in the presence of three surviving wives” 
      (<I>The Death and Life of Bishop Pike</I>, p. 202).</P>
      <P>In Graham’s 1963 Los Angeles Crusade, Methodist Bishop GERALD KENNEDY 
      was chairman of the crusade committee. On August 21, 1963, Graham praised 
      Kennedy as “one of the ten greatest Christian preachers in America.” Yet, 
      Kennedy has denied just about every one of the fundamentals of the 
      Christian faith. In his book <I>God’s Good News</I>, Kennedy said, “I 
      believe the testimony of the New Testament taken as a whole is against the 
      doctrine of the deity of Christ” (p. 125). Kennedy’s printed endorsement 
      is found on the jacket of NELS FERRE’S book, <I>The Sun and the 
      Umbrella</I>. In this book Ferre denied practically every doctrine of the 
      Word of God. He said, “Jesus never was nor became God.” He calls the 
      doctrine of Christ’s pre-existence “the grand myth which at its heart is 
      idolatry.” In Ferre’s book <I>The Christian Understanding of God, </I>he 
      said, “We have no way of knowing, even, that Jesus was sinless.” He denies 
      the virgin birth of Christ and replaces it with his blasphemous theory 
      that Jesus may have been the son of a German soldier. Yet, Graham’s 
      campaign chairman, Gerald Kennedy, endorsed Ferre and his blasphemies.</P>
      <P>In Los Angeles Graham also praised E. STANLEY JONES, liberal missionary 
      to India. Jones denied the virgin birth, the Trinity, the infallible 
      inspiration of Holy Scripture, and many other doctrines of the faith.</P>
      <P>At a National Council of Churches meeting in 1966, Graham praised 
      BISHOP LESLIE NEWBIGEN of South India. Newbigen was a universalist and a 
      syncretist who believed that there is salvation in non-Christian 
      religions. In his book The Open Secret, Newbigen claimed that the church 
      is not “the exclusive possessor of salvation.”</P>
      <P>In 1974, Graham featured MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE at the Congress on World 
      Evangelization, yet Muggeridge disbelieved the Bible and New Testament 
      Christianity. In his book <I>Jesus Rediscovered</I>, Muggeridge stated 
      that it is “beyond credibility” to imagine that God had a virgin-born son 
      who died and rose from the dead.</P>
      <P>In his biography, Graham praises KARL BARTH as “the great theologian” 
      and states: “In spite of our theological differences, we remained good 
      friends” (Graham, <I>Just As I A</I>m, p. 694). Graham does not warn his 
      readers that Barth denied the New Testament faith. He refused to believe 
      the virgin birth. He rejected the Bible as the infallible Word of God. 
      Barth was also a wicked adulterer who kept a mistress in his house in the 
      very presence of his wife, Nelly (Eberhard Busch, <I>Karl Barth: His Life 
      from Letters and Autobiographical Texts</I>, translated by John Bowden, 
      pp. 158,164,185-86).</P>
      <P>Another of the many false teachers praised in Graham’s biography is 
      MICHAEL RAMSEY, former Archbishop of Canterbury. Graham calls him “a giant 
      of a man” and says, “We were friends for many years” (<I>Just As I Am</I>, 
      p. 694). Graham fails to warn his readers that Ramsey was an unbeliever 
      who denied the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. In the London <I>Daily Mail 
      </I>for Feb. 10, 1961, Ramsey said: “Heaven is not a place for Christians 
      only. I expect to see many present day atheists there.” In 1966, Ramsey 
      had an audience with Pope Paul VI at the Vatican. He addressed the Pope as 
      “Your holiness” and expressed his desire for closer unity with Rome. As 
      Ramsey and the other Anglican clergy were departing they bowed and kissed 
      the Pope’s ring. Speaking about this papal visit a year later, Ramsey 
      testified that he and the Pope walked arm and arm out in St. Peter’s 
      Basilica and dedicated themselves to the task of unifying “all Christendom 
      and all the churches of all the world into one church” (Ramsey, cited by 
      M.L. Moser, <I>Ecumenicalism Under the Spotlight</I>, pp. 22-23).&nbsp; In 
      1972, while preaching at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhatten, Ramsey 
      said: “I can foresee the day when all Christians might accept the Pope as 
      the presiding Bishop.”</P>
      <P>Graham’s attitude toward modernists is evident in his pleasant 
      relationship with the WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES. He has attended all but 
      two of the WCC’s General Assemblies. Consider the following statements 
      taken from the telegram sent in 1983 by Graham to PHILIP POTTER, General 
      Secretary of the World Council of Churches. Dr. Graham did not appear at 
      the WCC Sixth Assembly in 1983 because of prior engagements: “Dear Philip: 
      Your gracious and generous invitation to speak twice in Vancouver was 
      deeply appreciated. ... I have tried to juggle my schedule but it is just 
      too heavy at this late date for me to make the drastic changes that would 
      be necessary for me to be in Vancouver. This will be only the second 
      general assembly of the WCC that I have had to miss. I will certainly miss 
      seeing you and many other old friends and fellowshipping with those from 
      all over the world...” (<I>Foundation</I>, Vol. IV, Issue IV, Los Osos, 
      Calif.: Fundamental Evangelistic Association, 1983). We should note here 
      that Philip Potter is an apostate Christian leader. He does not believe 
      that those in non-Christian religions are lost and he has advocated 
      violent communist movements!</P>
      <P>These are merely a few of the hundreds of examples that could be given 
      of Graham’s habit of yoking together with and honoring wicked, 
      Bible-denying, Christ-denying modernists.</P>
      <P><B>BILLY GRAHAM HAS PROMOTED PRACTICALLY EVERY PERVERTED BIBLE VERSION 
      TO APPEAR IN THE LAST FOUR DECADES</B></P>
      <P>In 1952 Billy Graham accepted a copy of the modernistic REVISED 
      STANDARD VERSION and told a crowd of 20,000 people: “These scholars have 
      probably given us the most nearly perfect translation in English. While 
      there may be room for disagreement in certain areas of the translation, 
      yet this new version should supplement the King James Version and make 
      Bible reading a habit throughout America” (Graham, cited by Perry 
      Rockwood, <I>God’s Inspired Preserved Bible</I>, Halifax, N.S.: People’s 
      Gospel Hour, nd., p. 15).</P>
      <P>Graham’s endorsement of the Revised Standard Version foreshadowed 
      Evangelicalism’s capitulation to the endless stream of modern versions. 
      Graham has endorsed practically every new version to appear on the scene, 
      no matter how flippant and unfaithful.</P>
      <P>In his autobiography, modernist Bible paraphraser J.B. PHILLIPS 
      (1906-1982) stated that Billy Graham spoke highly of his work as early as 
      1952: “I think it was in 1952 that I received a visit from Dr. Billy 
      Graham with his charming and intelligent wife. ‘I want to thank you, Dr. 
      Phillips,’ he began, ‘for Letters to Young Churches’” (J.B. Phillips, 
      <I>The Price of Success</I>, Wheaton: Harold Shaw Pub., 1984, p. 116). 
      Phillips taught a form of universalism and the Fatherhood of God, denied 
      hell fire and the existence of Satan and demons, denied the verbal 
      inspiration of Scripture, claimed that Jesus conformed His teaching to the 
      ignorance of His day, was a skeptic in regard to supernatural miracles, 
      and believed that Christ’s ascension was a parable.</P>
      <P>Graham almost single-handedly rescued the LIVING BIBLE from oblivion. 
      “The Living Bible might be called ‘The Billy Graham Bible,’ for it was he 
      who made it the success that it is. According to <I>Time</I> magazine, 
      July 24, 1972, Billy Graham ordered 50,000 copies of the Epistles, and a 
      short time later ordered some 450,000 more, and still later ordered 
      600,000 special paperback versions for his autumn television crusade in 
      1972. From that time on, orders began to pour in” (M.L. Moser, Jr., <I>The 
      Case Against the Living Bible</I>, Little Rock: Challenge Press, p. 9). 
      That was only the beginning of Graham’s love affair with the Living Bible. 
      At Amsterdam ‘86, Graham allowed Living Bibles International to distribute 
      free copies of the Living Bible in 40 different languages to the 8,000 
      evangelists in attendance (<I>Light of Life</I>, Bombay, India, Sept. 
      1986, p. 23). Graham distributed 10,000 copies of the Living Bible to 
      people who attended his Mission England Crusade (<I>Australian Beacon</I>, 
      No. 241, Aug. 1986). In 1987, Graham appeared in television ads for <I>The 
      Book</I>, a condensed version of the Living Bible. He said it “reads like 
      a novel.” In an ad that appeared in a 1991 issue of <I>Charisma</I> 
      magazine, Graham said: “I read The Living Bible because in this book I 
      have read the age-abiding truths of the scriptures with renewed interest 
      and inspiration. The Living Bible communicates the message of Christ to 
      our generation” (<I>Charisma</I>, March 1991, p. 98).</P>
      <P>Billy Graham is also one of the men who first helped make the perverted 
      GOOD NEWS FOR MODERN MAN (Today’s English Version) popular by distributing 
      it through his Association. Graham “called it an excellent translation 
      over nationwide television from his campaign in Anaheim, California.” It 
      was then distributed by the Grason Company of Minneapolis, the 
      distributors of Billy Graham materials (M.L. Moser, Jr., <I>The Devil’s 
      Masterpiece</I>, Little Rock: Challenge Press, 1970, p. 80). The <I>Good 
      News for Modern Man</I> replaces the word “blood” with “death” in speaking 
      of the atonement of Jesus Christ, and corrupted practically every passage 
      dealing with Christ’s deity. The translator of the <I>Good News for Modern 
      Man</I>, Robert Bratcher, does not believe that Jesus Christ is God.</P>
      <P>Graham printed his own edition of Eugene Peterson’s THE MESSAGE. It is 
      called a “translational-paraphrase” and is said to “unfold like a gripping 
      novel.” In fact, it IS a novel! It even uses the term “as above, so 
      below,” which is a New Age expression for the unity of God and man, Heaven 
      and earth. In the book <I>As Above, So Below</I>, the editors of the 
      <I>New Age Journal</I> say: “This maxim implies that the transcendent God 
      beyond the physical universe and the immanent God within ourselves are 
      one. Heaven and Earth, spirit and matter, the invisible and the visible 
      worlds form a unity to which we are intimately linked” (quoted from Warren 
      Smith, <I>Deceived on Purpose: The New Age Implications of the 
      Purpose-Driven Church</I>, 2004).</P>
      <P><B>GRAHAM SAYS THE VIRGIN BIRTH NOT A NECESSARY PART OF CHRISTIAN 
      FAITH</B></P>
      <P>In an interview with a United Church of Canada publication in 1966, 
      Graham gave the following reply to a question about the virgin birth of 
      Christ:</P>
      <P>Q. Do you think a literal belief in the Virgin birth--not just as a 
      symbol of the incarnation or of Christ’s divinity--as an historic event is 
      necessary for personal salvation?</P>
      <P>A. While I most certainly believe that Jesus Christ was born of a 
      virgin, I do not find anywhere in the New Testament that this particular 
      belief is necessary for personal salvation (“Billy Graham Answers 26 
      Provocative Questions,” <I>United Church of Observer</I>, July 1, 
      1966).</P>
      <P>In his zeal to appease the apostates in the United Church of Christ 
      (its current moderator, Bill Phipps, denies that Jesus Christ is God), 
      Graham tells an absolute lie. How would it be possible for a saved person 
      to deny the virgin birth of Jesus Christ? If Jesus Christ were not virgin 
      born, he was a sinner; and if he were a sinner, he could not have died for 
      our sins. Further, if Christ were a sinner and if He were not virgin born, 
      He was a liar for making such claims and the Bible that records those 
      claims is a blatant and wicked lie, and the Bible-believing Christian is a 
      deceived and foolish person whose faith has no authoritative foundation. 
      Therefore, apart from the virgin birth there is no Gospel and no Salvation 
      and no authoritative Bible. Billy Graham is dead wrong. The virgin birth 
      of Christ is “fatal” doctrine, meaning it is crucial for salvation. The 
      entire Gospel stands or falls on the virgin birth.</P>
      <P><B>GRAHAM SAYS THEISTIC EVOLUTION IS POSSIBLE</B></P>
      <P>Graham said in 1966, “How you believe doesn’t affect the doctrine. 
      Either at a certain moment in evolution God breathed into one particular 
      ape-man who was Adam, or God could have taken a handful of dust and blowed 
      and created a man just like that” (“Cooperative Evangelism at Harringay,” 
      <I>United Church Observer</I>, July 1966).</P>
      <P><B>GRAHAM REFUSES TO DEFEND THE BIBLE AS THE INERRANT WORD OF 
      GOD</B></P>
      <P><I>Newsweek</I> magazine, April 26, 1982, examined the debate on the 
      issue of biblical infallibility. The article noted that Billy Graham is 
      not on the side of inerrancy. “Billy Graham, for one, clearly is not. ‘I 
      believe the Bible is the inspired, authoritative word of God,’ Graham 
      says, ‘but I don’t use the word ‘inerrant’ because it’s become a brittle 
      divisive word.’” Graham avoids controversy at any cost. He knows that 
      Modernists and unbelieving Evangelicals are willing to call the Bible 
      “authoritative and inspired” even while denying that it is the infallible 
      and inerrant Word of God. Graham aligns himself with this unbelieving 
      camp. If the Bible is not the inerrant Word of God, who can dogmatically 
      determine which part is and which part is not inerrant! If the Bible is 
      not inerrant, it is not authoritative.</P>
      <P><B>GRAHAM AGREES WITH HERETIC ROBERT SCHULLER’S FALSE DEFINITIONS OF 
      THE GOSPEL</B></P>
      <P>Graham spoke at Robert Schuller’s Crystal Cathedral in 1985, and the 
      two men came up with a joint definition of “born again” as “a decision to 
      stop carrying your own luggage” (Paul Harvey’s report, July 15, 1985). 
      Schuller is false teacher who preaches a false gospel. He uses biblical 
      terms but gives them unbiblical definitions. He says born again is “to be 
      changed from a negative to a positive self-image--from inferiority to 
      self-esteem, from fear to love, from doubt to trust” (Schuller, 
      <I>Self-Esteem: The New Reformation</I>, p. 68). In an article in 
      <I>Christianity Today</I>, October 5, 1984, Schuller said, “I don’t think 
      anything has been done in the name of Christ and under the banner of 
      Christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and, 
      hence, counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often 
      crude, uncouth, and unchristian strategy of attempting to make people 
      aware of their lost and sinful condition.” In spite of Schuller’s unbelief 
      and false gospel, Graham has repeatedly honored him. In 1983, Schuller sat 
      in the front row of distinguished guests invited to honor Graham’s 65th 
      birthday. In 1986, Schuller was invited by Graham to speak at the 
      International Conference for Itinerant Evangelists in Amsterdam. Schuller 
      was featured on the platform of Graham’s Atlanta Crusade in 1994.</P>
      <P><B>GRAHAM SAYS THEOLOGY NO LONGER MEANS ANYTHING TO HIM</B></P>
      <P>As the year 1988 closed, Graham told <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report 
      </I>that theology no longer meant anything to him: “World travel and 
      getting to know clergy of all denominations has helped mold me into an 
      ecumenical being. We’re separated by theology and, in some instances, 
      culture and race, but all that means nothing to me any more” (<I>U.S. News 
      &amp; World Report, </I>Dec. 19, 1988).</P>
      <P><B>GRAHAM DOES NOT EMPHASIZE SALVATION THROUGH THE BLOOD OF 
      CHRIST</B></P>
      <P>A letter from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in 1968 that I 
      have in my files made the following amazing statement:</P>
      <DL>
        <DD>“Mr. Graham believes that we are saved through the blood of Christ, 
        however, this aspect of Christian doctrine he does not emphasize in his 
        messages. This is the duty and prerogative of the pastors” (Rev. W.H. 
        Martindale, Spiritual Counselor, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, 
        letter, Feb. 29, 1968). </DD></DL>
