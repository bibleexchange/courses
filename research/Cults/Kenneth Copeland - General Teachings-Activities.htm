<A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/">charismatic</A> 
Kenneth Copeland is considered to be the most prosperous and well-known in the 
"<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/w-f.htm">Word-Faith</A>"/"<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/posit.htm">Positive 
Confession</A>" movement. His television program is carried nationwide on the 
Trinity Broadcasting Network, and he is the author of numerous 
charismatic-oriented books and articles. Copeland's daily <I>Believers’ Voice of 
Victory</I> television broadcast is available to more than 76 million households 
on nearly 700 stations in the United States. An estimated 82 million households 
are able to receive the Sunday broadcast over more than 600 stations, and the 
broadcast can be seen on about 135 International stations. Copeland also 
publishes the monthly <I>Believer's Voice of Victory</I> magazine, and the 
bimonthly <I>Shout! The Voice of Victory for Kids</I> magazine.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In his <CITE>Believer's Voice of Victory</CITE> magazine, Copeland teaches 
the following heresies: "God has never used sickness to discipline His children" 
(9/89); "AIDS is 'absolutely not' God's way of punishing immoral people" 
(11/87); Jesus didn't claim to be God when He lived on earth (8/88); the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/newage.htm">New Age</A>/occult 
techniques of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/inheal.htm">positive 
imaging and visualization</A> are for God's people today (9/88); God intends for 
His people to be united, and, "That union won't be based on doctrine" (12/88); 
healing is for every believer (2/93); and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/biblical.htm">tongues</A> 
are for the entire Body of Christ (1/93). Copeland also says: "It would have 
been impossible for Jesus to have been poor!" (9/90, <CITE>Charisma</CITE>). 
(Reported in the 2/15/93, <CITE><A 
href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/">Calvary 
Contender</A></CITE>.)<BR><BR>-&nbsp; As the name "Word-Faith" implies, this 
movement teaches that faith is a matter of what we <CITE>say</CITE> more that 
whom we trust or what truths we embrace and affirm in our hearts. A favorite 
term in the Word-Faith movement is "positive confession." It refers to the 
Word-Faith teaching that words have creative power. What you <CITE>say</CITE>, 
Word-Faith teachers claim, determines everything that happens to you. Your 
"confessions," that is, the things you say -- especially the favors you 
<U>demand</U> of God - -must all be stated positively and without wavering. Then 
God is <U>required</U> to answer (<CITE>Charismatic Chaos</CITE>, p. 281). 
Word-Faith believers view their positive confessions as an incantation by which 
they can conjure up <CITE>anything</CITE> they desire: "Believe it in your 
heart; say it with your mouth. That is the principle of faith. <CITE>You can 
have what you say</CITE>" (<CITE>Charismatic Chaos</CITE>, p. 
285).<BR><BR>-&nbsp; Word-Faith is the fastest-growing movement within the 
professing church. It has involved two distinct but closely related factions: 
the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/guidepo/">Peale</A>/<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/schuller/">Schuller</A> 
Positive/Possibility thinkers, with their roots in New Thought, and the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hagin/">Hagin</A>/Copeland 
Positive Confession and Word-Faith groups, which have their roots in E.W. 
Kenyon, William Branham, and the Manifest Sons of God/Latter Rain Movement. In 
Kenneth Hagin's book, <CITE>Having Faith in Your Faith</CITE> (Copeland 
confesses that Hagin's tapes and books revolutionized his ministry), Hagin 
teaches that anyone can develop universal "laws of faith" to get what he wants. 
Hagin teaches that for a pastor or <CITE>anyone </CITE>to drive a Chevrolet 
instead of a luxury car isn't "being humble, that's being ignorant" of God's 
"law of prosperity" that works for "whoever you are," saint or sinner. The 
battle-cry of the Positive Confession (PC) movement is: "Have faith in your 
faith." This is a far cry from what Jesus taught: "Have faith in God" 
(<CITE>Charismatic Chaos</CITE>, p. 281). (Copeland's book, <CITE>The Laws of 
Prosperity</CITE>, teaches these same concepts.)<BR><BR>This is at the heart of 
the PC movement today, also known as the "name-it-and-claim-it" gospel. The PC 
movement is a charismatic form of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/science.htm">Christian 
Science</A>. This can be substantiated by simply comparing the similarities in 
their common beliefs. PC is basically warmed-over New Thought dressed in 
evangelical/charismatic language. (Other well-known PC'ers besides the "father" 
of the movement, Kenneth Hagin, and Copeland, his most successful protégé, are 
Charles Capps, Frederick K.C. Price, Robert Tilton, and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/cho/">David (Paul) Yonggi 
Cho</A>. Many of them are graduates of Hagin's Rhema Bible Training Center in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma.)<BR><BR>-&nbsp; Copeland's teaching on healing is a 
particularly destructive lie -- in the 2/93 issue of <CITE>Believer's Voice of 
Victory</CITE>, Copeland says that every Christian is guaranteed physical 
healing and financial prosperity. Multitudes of those who have believed the 
charismatic lies about healing in the Atonement have become confused and 
disappointed. Many have become bitter against God because God did not do what 
they were convinced He had promised to do. The problem with Copeland's teachings 
is that God has <STRONG>not</STRONG> promised health and prosperity to His 
people in this present world. Nevertheless, Copeland speaks disparagingly of 
Christians who "are still living in sickness, bondage, and lack." Yet this 
"sickness, bondage, and lack" is the epitaph of a great many of God's choicest 
saints.<BR><BR>-&nbsp; Copeland is perhaps the best known proponent of the 
charismatic's "little gods" teaching (see below). He says Jesus told him: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Don't be disturbed when people accuse you of thinking you are God ... They 
  crucified Me for claiming I was God. I didn't claim that I was God; I just 
  claimed that I walked with Him and that He was in Me. Hallelujah! That's what 
  you're doing ..." ("Take Time to Pray," <CITE>Believer's Voice of 
  Victory</CITE>, 2/87, p. 9). </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Copeland thus denies the uniqueness of Christ, saying that Christ was 
<STRONG>not</STRONG> God, only that He walked closely with God. And as Copeland 
says, so does he! Copeland, thereby, places himself on the same level as Jesus 
Christ, willing to blur the distinction between the will of God and the will of 
Copeland. Copeland seems to think that he and Jesus have about the same 
authority for the believer, and sounds like New Ager Shirley MacClaine when he 
says: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"You're all God. You don't have a God living in you; you <CITE>are 
  </CITE>one! ... When I read in the Bible where God tells Moses, 'I AM,' I say, 
  'Yah, I am too!'" ("The Force of Love," Tape BBC-56). </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>- Copeland teaches that Adam was "created in the god class"; i.e., he was a 
reproduction of God: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"He was not <CITE>subordinate</CITE> to God ... [but] was walking as a god 
  with the authority of a god. ... What he said went. What he did, counted. [And 
  when he] bowed his knee to Satan and put Satan up above him, then there wasn't 
  anything God could do about it, because a <CITE>god</CITE> had placed [Satan] 
  there" ("The Force of Love," tape #02-0028). </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When Adam committed high treason, according to Copeland, even though "created 
in the god class," he fell below the god class, but on the cross, Jesus won the 
right for believers to be born again back into the "god class" (see below). 
Jesus' deity, according to Copeland, encompasses "healing, deliverance, 
financial prosperity, mental prosperity, physical prosperity, and family 
prosperity." And because believers are now back in the "god class," they are 
guaranteed those blessings here and now (<CITE>Charismatic Chaos</CITE>, p. 
272).<BR><BR>-&nbsp; Copeland teaches, as do all the Word-Faith teachers, that 
"Jesus Died Spiritually" (JDS). What makes the Word-Faith teachers' version of 
JDS, heresy (if not blasphemy), is their teaching that our redemption comes 
<STRONG>not</STRONG> from Christ's death upon the cross, but from His being 
tortured by Satan in hell for three days and nights! Copeland has, thus, 
embraced a heresy known as the "Ransom theory of the atonement." It is the view 
that Christ's death was a ransom paid to Satan to settle the legal claim the 
devil had on the human race because of Adam's sin. But that view contradicts the 
clear Biblical teaching that Christ's death was a sacrifice offered to God, not 
to Satan (Eph. 5:2) (<CITE>Charismatic Chaos</CITE>, p. 278). Copeland, for 
example, says: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"He allowed the devil to drag Him into the depths of hell as if He were the 
  most wicked sinner who ever lived ... Every demon in hell came down on Him to 
  annihilate Him ... [They] tortured Him beyond anything that anybody has ever 
  conceived ... In a thunder of spiritual force, the voice of God spoke to the 
  death-whipped, broken, punished spirit of Jesus ... [in] the pit of 
  destruction, and charged the spirit of Jesus with resurrection power! Suddenly 
  His twisted, death-wracked spirit began to fill out and come back to life ... 
  He was literally being reborn before the devil's very eyes. He began to flex 
  His spiritual muscles ... Jesus Christ dragged Satan up and down the halls of 
  hell ... Jesus ... was raised up a born-again man ... The day I realized that 
  a born-again man had defeated Satan, hell, and death, I got so excited ...

<P>It is both fanciful nonsense and heretical to teach that our redemption comes 
through Satan torturing Jesus in hell. That would make Satan our co-redeemer. If 
he didn't torture Jesus enough, we wouldn't be saved -- and if he did, do we 
thank Satan? Incredible! Moreover, Satan isn't even the proprietor of hell. He 
hasn't even been there yet. Nor will Satan torture the damned but will himself 
be tortured with "everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels" 
(Matt. 25:41) when death and hell have been "cast into the lake of fire" (Rev. 
20:14).<BR><BR>Before He died, Jesus cried in triumph, "It is finished" (Jn. 
19:30), indicating that our redemption has been accomplished <CITE>on the 
Cross</CITE>. Christ told the thief on the cross who believed in Him, 
"<CITE>Today</CITE> shalt thou be with me in <CITE>paradise</CITE>" (Lk. 23:43), 
<CITE>not in hell</CITE>! He said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit" 
(Lk. 23:46). Yet Hagin, Copeland, <I>et al.</I>, say He ended up, instead, in 
the hands of Satan in the depths of hell! What blasphemy! (5/93, <CITE>Berean 
Call</CITE>).<BR><BR>-&nbsp; Word-Faith teachers owe their ancestry to groups 
like Christian Science, Swedenborgianism, Theosophy, Science of Mind, and New 
Thought -- not to classical <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/pente.htm">Pentecostalism</A>. 
It reveals that at their very core, Word-Faith teachings are corrupt. Their 
undeniable derivation is cultish, not Christian. The sad truth is that the 
gospel proclaimed by the Word-Faith movement is not the gospel of the New 
Testament. Word-Faith doctrine is a mongrel system, a blend of mysticism, 
dualism, and gnosticism that borrows generously from the teachings of the 
metaphysical cults. The Word-Faith movement may be the most dangerous false 
system that has grown out of the charismatic movement so far, because so many 
charismatics are unsure of the finality of Scripture (<CITE>Charismatic 
Chaos</CITE>, p. 290). </P>

hell.</SPAN></B><BR>“[I]n hell He [Jesus] suffered for you and for me. The Bible 
says hell was made for Satan and his angles. It was not made for men. Satan was 
holding the Son of God there illegally … The trap was set for Satan and Jesus 
was the bait.” (<I>Walking in the Realm of the Miraculous</I>, 1979, p. 77)</P>
<P>Satan blew it on a technicality, according to Faith theology, because Satan 
had dragged Jesus into hell illegally. As Copeland puts it, “The Devil forgot to 
take into consideration that Jesus hadn’t sinned Himself but, rather, had merely 
become sin as a result of the sin of others.” (<I>What Happened from the Cross 
to the Throne</I>, 1990, audiotape #02-0017, side 2)</P>
<P>“… [t]hat Word of the living God went down into that pit of destruction and 
charged the spirit of Jesus with resurrection power! Suddenly His twisted, 
death-wracked spirit began to fill out and come back to life. He began to look 
like something the devil had never seen before. He was literally being reborn 
before the devil’s very eyes. He began to flex His spiritual muscles … Jesus was 
born again—the first-born from the dead the Word calls Him—and He whipped the 
devil in his own backyard. He took everything he had away from him. He took his 
keys and his authority away from him.” (“The Price of it All,” <I>Believer’s 
Voice of Victory</I>, September 1991, p. 4)<BR

was exactly like God. Then God separated him and removed the female part. Woman

stayed together.” (<I><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Sensitivity of

<P>“He [Jesus] is suffering all that there is to suffer. There is no suffering 
left apart from Him. His emaciated, poured out, little, wormy spirit is down in 
the bottom of that thing [hell]. And the Devil thinks he’s got Him destroyed.”
