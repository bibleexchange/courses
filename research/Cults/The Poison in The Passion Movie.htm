      <P>Mel Gibson’s much anticipated <I>The Passion</I> officially opened in 
      theaters on Ash Wednesday, February 25, 2004. Never in history has any 
      movie so captured the attention and adoration of the Christian community. 
      No movie, no movement, no sermon, no revival, no event – nothing in modern 
      history has created such a moving among the Christian world. </P>
      <P>The first day <I>The Passion</I> grossed over $25 million dollars. And 
      there appears no slowdown. After 5 days, it has now grossed over $125 
      million dollars. <I>The Passion</I> generated an unbelievable $10 million 
      in advance sales. Many churches leased complete movie theaters to show 
      <I>The Passion</I>. Some churches have rented theaters until March. </P>
      <P>Churches and prominent Christian leaders around the world are heralding 
      <I>The Passion</I> as the greatest evangelical event in modern history – 
      maybe ever. Many are crowning <I>The Passion</I> as the greatest 
      presentation of the crucifixion in history – including the Word of God. 
      </P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>What in the world is going on?</FONT></P>
      <P>Are we witnessing the launching of a great revival across the land as 
      some are proclaiming? Is <I>The Passion</I> the "fire" that could spark a 
      great moving of the Holy Ghost throughout the land? </P>
      <P>We as Christians are given the charge of 2 Thessalonians 5:21 to 
      "<B>Prove all things</B>; hold fast that which is good." There is nothing 
      that we as God’s children should exclude from examination under the light 
      of the Word of God. There is nothing, no matter how "pleasant to the eyes" 
      (Genesis 3:6) it appears that we should automatically presume is the will 
      of God. </P>
      <P>And may we not forget our adversary. Satan is very crafty. His ultimate 
      goal is "to be like the most High" (Isaiah 14:14). He is the master of 
      counterfeiters. The Bible says in Matthew 24:24 that "false Christs shall 
      arise" and "if possible should deceive the very elect". Satan desires to 
      be Christ. His ultimate role would be to "act" as Jesus. </P>
      <P>With that in mind, may we always be cautious to Satan’s potential 
      injection of poison and venom, especially when the Lord Jesus Christ is 
      the topic. May we agree with the apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 2:11, "not 
      to be ignorant of Satan’s devices" – "lest he should get an advantage of 
      us".</P>
      <P>There are some Christians who will cry "Foul, You are just looking for 
      bad stuff in <I>The Passion</I>". And to that I say, "Amen". That is 
      exactly what we as Christians are commanded to do – "Prove all things". 
      Let us never be guilty of closing our eyes and disregarding our Bibles to 
      any possible influence of Satan. </P>
      <P>As we examine <I>The Passion</I>. let us prayerfully hold the attitude 
      and conviction of the Bereans in Acts 17:11 who "searched the scriptures 
      daily, whether those things were so".</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by 
        night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the 
        Jews.<BR>11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that 
        they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <B>searched the 
        scriptures daily, whether those things were so</B>.<BR>Acts 17:11 <B>
        <P>Be sober, be vigilant;</B> because your adversary the devil, as a 
        roaring lion, <B>walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<BR></B>1

      <HR width="100%" SIZE=1>

      <P>Christian ministers and the news media have paraded <I>The Passion</I> 
      as true to The Bible. Most of the Christians interviewed have remarked at 
      how true and authentic it <B><I>appeared</B></I>. </P>
      <P>But is it true to the Word of God? </P>
      <P>Did Mel Gibson, with his loyal Catholic beliefs and his director’s 
      creative ability wander outside the pages of the Word of God? Is it 
      possible that <I>The Passion</I> is not entirely based upon the Bible as 
      most Christians are led to believe? Is it entirely possible that the 
      <B>primary script</B> <B>and inspiration</B> for <I>The Passion</I> is not 
      the Bible at all – but another book?</P>
      <P>Here is an article on MSNBC describing some of the scenes from <I>The 
      Passion</I>. See if you can find these in your Bible:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Gibson’s movie begins in the garden of Gethsemane, with the 
        disciples sleeping as Jesus prays for guidance <B>and stomps on a 
        snake</B> that tempts him to avoid his destiny. There are other horrors: 
        a <B>screeching creature that resembles a berserk monkey</B>, <B>demonic 
        children</B> who might have wandered in from "The Exorcist," <B>a bird 
        that plucks out the eyes of crucified men</B>, <B>the gargoyle-like 
        members</B> of King Herod’s court,. . .<BR>(Hartl, John. Gibson's 
        'Passion' is bloody empty. MSNBC, 
        &lt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4360578&gt;) </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>That is nowhere in the Bible. You can search all day and all night but 
      you will not find such silliness in the Bible. </P>
      <P>Now where in the world did Mel get that stuff from? </P>
      <P>A few years ago, as Mel Gibson was rediscovering and renewing his 
      Catholic faith, Mel Gibson purchased a library of hundreds of books from a 
      closed nunnery. Mel claims as he was reaching for a book on the library 
      shelf a supernatural intervention caused another book to "miraculously" 
      drop into his hands. And that "miracle" book, not the Bible, not the 
      Gospels, is the inspiration of <I>The Passion</I>. The book was <I>The 
      Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the Meditations of 
      Anne Catherine Emmerich</I>. Gibson claims like "magic" this book opened 
      up a new world. "'<B>Amazing images</B>,' he said. <B>'She supplied me 
      with stuff I never would have thought of". </P></B>
      <P>Who is Anne Catherine Emmerich, the mysterious script writer of <I>The 
      Passion</I>?</P><IMG height=449 hspace=5 
      src="The Poison in The Passion Movie_files/dolorous1.jpg" width=234 
      align=right vspace=5 border=0> 
      <P>Anne Catherine Emmerich was a famous, mystic, Catholic Nun who 
      possessed some very unusual abilities.</P>
      <P>Anne was born on the feast of the Virgin Mary’s own nativity: September 
      8, 1774 in Westphalia, Germany. She became a nun of the Augustinian Order 
      at Dulmen.</P>
      <P>Emmerich began having supernatural visions very early in her life. By 
      the age of four she prayed for three hours daily while being physically 
      visited by her guardian angel. Even at that early age people around her 
      described a "mysterious power that emanated from her." </P>
      <P>Emmerich was found frequently practicing the occult art of levitation. 
      Many times when she entered a room, she was clearly seen levitating above 
      the ground. She also practiced the occult art of astral projection, 
      claiming to "bilocate" to various places. Astral Projection is the physic 
      ability when the soul leaves the physical body and travels beyond space 
      and time. During her mystic astral projections, she claims to have watched 
      the actual execution of King Louis XVI, and visited Marie Antoinette, 
      queen of France, in prison. Some times these astral projection trips 
      actually took her into purgatory to view the tortured souls in purgatory. 
      Of course, the Bible does not teach purgatory. Emmerich experienced about 
      every satanic supernatural and occult practices known.</P>
      <P>Emmerich also bore the actual, physical wounds of Jesus Christ, called 
      the Catholic mystic stigmata, where the actual wounds of Christ 
      supernaturally appear on the hands, feet and head. According to supposedly 
      verified medical reports, her supernatural stigmata wounds were half an 
      inch in size and found in her hands, feet, side, head and bled profusely, 
      especially on Fridays (the Catholic’s erroneous day of the crucifixion). 
      At times the blood flowed so heavy from the supernatural stigmata wounds, 
      the blood would completely soak the bandages and freely flow on the 
      ground. According to various sources, this was all verified by medical 
      doctors. One physician who examined Emmerich said, "There can be no 
      question of imposture in this case. The wounds speak for themselves, at 
      least to a man of science. To ascribe them to natural causes such as 
      imagination, induction, analogy, or similar causes, is simply 
      impossible."</P>
      <P>According to her biographers, the last 12 years of Anne’s life she ate 
      no food except the bread and wine of the Holy Eucharist. In other words, 
      she supposedly lived for over 12 years on nothing but the Catholic 
      Eucharist or Mass.</P><B>
      <P>To put it bluntly, Anne Catherine Emmerich was a very spiritually 
      disturbed lady.</P></B>
      <P>Emmerich experienced common occurrences of supernatural visions. During 
      these visions she claims to have "seen" the creation of Heaven, the fall 
      of the angels, the creation of the earth, paradise and many other such 
      scenes. During these demonic visions she also claims to have "seen" the 
      actual crucifixion of Jesus Christ take place. Anne wrote a book titled, 
      <I>The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ</I> from these visions. 
      <B>And according to Mel Gibson, these demonic crucifixion visions, called 
      the <I>Dolorous Passion</I>, became the "supernatural imposed" script and 
      inspiration for <I>The Passion</I> – not the Gospels. This was the book 
      that "supernaturally" fell into his hands that became the script and 
      inspiration for <I>The Passion</I></B>.</P>
      <P>Mel Gibson is so devoted to Emmerich, his cherished possession is a 
      piece of cloth that was once part of Emmerich's habit [garment]. Gibson 
      carries the sacred Emmerich cloth in his pocket. During his PrimeTime 
      interview with Diane Sawyer, Mel proudly displayed his miracle cloth for 
      the world to see. I wonder how many pastors and Christians who watched 
      this interview did not even question Mel’s fanatical devotion to 
      Emmerich?</P>
      <P>Here are a few quotes by Anne Catherine Emmerich:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>The Church is the only one, the Roman Catholic</B>! And 
        if there were left upon earth but one Catholic, he would be the one, 
        universal Church, the Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ 
        against which the gates of Hell shall never prevail." 
        <P>"Then I had the sweet assurance <B>that Mary is the Church; the 
        Church, our mother; God, our father; and Jesus, our brother</B>." 
        <P>"I have had a great vision on the mystery of Holy Mass <B>and I have 
        seen that whatever good has existed since creation is owing to 
        it</B>."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>If Emmerich and her writings are not extreme blasphemy then there is 
      not one word of truth in the Bible. </P>
      <P>Christianity Today writes of Gibson’s obsession of Emmerich’s 
      <I>Dolorous Passion</I>:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"He [Gibson] also recounted a series of <B>divine 
        coincidences</B> that led him to read the works of Anne Catherine 
        Emmerich, a late-18th, early-19th-century Westphalian nun who had 
        visions of the events of <I>The Passion</I>. <B>Many of the details 
        needed to fill out the Gospel accounts he drew from her book, 
        <I>Dolorous Passion of Our Lord</I>."<BR></B>(Mel, Mary, and Mothers<B>,

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Much of <I>The Passion</I> is clearly scripted from Emmerich’s 
      <I>Dolorous Passion</I>. Let us examine a couple of scenes from <I>The 
      Passion</I>.</P>
      <P>In one scene, as "Jesus" is being flogged, Claudia, the wife of Pilate, 
      approaches Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Mary Magdalene. She gives them 
      folded linens. After Jesus is taken away, the two Marys began mopping up 
      the blood on the ground with the linens.</P>
      <P>Somehow in my reading and study of the scriptures I missed that scene. 
      Of course, it is not in the Bible. It is taken directly from Emmerich’s 
      visions. Here is the same scene in Emmerich’a <I>Dolorous 
      Passion</I>:</P><IMG height=229 hspace=5 
      src="The Poison in The Passion Movie_files/mopping1.jpg" width=220 
      align=left vspace=5 border=0>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>When Jesus fell down at the foot of the pillar, after the 
        flagellation, I saw Claudia Procles, the wife of Pilate, send some large 
        pieces of linen to the Mother of God. I know not whether she thought 
        that Jesus would be set free, and that his Mother would then require 
        linen to dress his wounds, or whether this compassionate lady was aware 
        of the use which would be made of her present. … <B>I soon after saw 
        Mary and Magdalen approach the pillar where Jesus had been scourged; … 
        they knelt down on the ground near the pillar, and wiped up the sacred 
        blood with the linen which Claudia Procles had sent</B>.<BR>(Emmerich, 
        Anne Catherine. <I>The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ</I>. 
        North Bay Books:El Sobrante, 2003 pp. 137-138)</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Another curious scene from Emmerich’s <I>Dolorous Passion </I>is when 
      Satan tempts "Jesus" during the garden of Gethsemane as "Jesus" is in 
      agony praying, Satan (which is incidentally played by a beautiful woman in 
      <I>The Passion</I>) tempts "Jesus". Here is how one reviewer describes the 
      scene from Gibson’s <I>The Passion</I>:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>In the darkness, a gaunt, hooded woman appears 
        [Satan].<BR>"Do you really believe one man can bear this burden?" she 
        taunts. "No one man can carry this burden. It’s too heavy. Saving their 
        souls is too costly."<BR>(Warren, Lindy. Witness to <I>The Passion</I>.

      <P>Again the above scene is nowhere in the scriptures. And again it is 
      straight from Emmerich’s <I>Dolorous Passion</I>"</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>He fell on his face, overwhelmed with unspeakable sorrow,. . 
        . But Satan, who was enthroned amid all these horrors, and even filled 
        with diabolical joy at the sight of them, let loose his fury against 
        Jesus, and displayed before the eyes of his soul increasingly awful 
        visions, at the same time addressing his adorable humanity in words such 
        as these: ‘<B>Takest thou even this sin upon thyself? Art thou willing 
        to bear its penalty? Art thou prepared to satisfy for all these 
        sins?'<BR></B>(Emmerich, Anne Catherine. <I>The Dolorous Passion of Our

        <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Another scene from <I>The Passion</I> coming from Emerich’s <I>Dolorus 
      Passion</I> is "Jesus" crushing the serpent’s head:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>A snake slithers from her robe [Satan} toward the man 
        [Jesus] who, for the first time, has diverted his eyes to this enemy.

            executioners increased his pain by tying his chest and arms to the 
            cross, lest the hands should be torn from the nails. They then 
            fastened his left foot on to his right foot, having first bored a 
            hole through them with a species of piercer, because they could not 
            be placed in such a position as to be nailed together at once. Next 
            they took a very long nail and drove it completely through both feet 
            into the cross below, which operation was more than usually painful, 
            on account of his body being so unnaturally stretched out”</P></TD></TR>

      <P>There is no question that <I>The Passion</I> is an openly Catholic 
      originated, inspired and produced movie. Mel Gibson has held back nothing, 
      confessing his complete devotion to his Catholic faith. In an interview 
      with the Australian paper, <I>The Herald Sun</I>, Mel proudly admits 
      "<B>There is no salvation for those outside the [Catholic] Church. 
</P></B>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>"There is no salvation for those outside the Church, I 
        believe it</B>."<BR>Mel Gibson, <I>The Herald Sun</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Gibson goes on to calmly condemn his own wife to hell. Mel readily 
      admits that she "believes in God" and "she knows Jesus" – but that is not 
      enough. According to Gibson’s own words, "knowing Jesus" will not save a 
      person. Mel Gibson clearly believes "There is no salvation for those 
      outside the Catholic Church."</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She’s a much better 
        person than I am. Honestly, She’s, like, Episcopalian, Church of 
        England. <B>She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she 
        believes in that stuff.</B> And it’s just not fair if she doesn’t make 
        it, she’s better than I am. <B>But that is a pronouncement from the 
        chair. I go with it</B>."<BR>Mel Gibson, <I>The Herald Sun</I> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The "pronouncement from the chair" Gibson is referring to is the 
      pronouncement by the Pope, which to Catholics, is literally the voice of 
      God and infallible. The "chair" has more authority than the Bible. </P>
      <P>The Catechism of the Catholic Church number 780 says, "<B>The Church in 
      this world is the sacrament of salvation</B>, the sign and the instrument 
      of the communion of God and men" (CCC 780).</P><B>
      <P><B><FONT size=+1>THE STATIONS OF THE CROSS</FONT></B></P></B>
      <P>To really grasp the complete Catholic inspiration and foundation of 
      <I>The Passion</I> you need to understand the Catholic teaching of "The 
      Stations of the Cross".</P>
      <P>"The Station of The Cross", also called "The Way of the Cross" or Via 
      Dolorosa, is the Catholic sacred ritual where they walk the footsteps of 
      Jesus while praying and meditating along the 14 "stations" or scenes 
      during the last 12 hours before the crucifixion of Jesus. The Station of 
      the Cross is normally done during Lent which begins on Ash Wednesday. The 
      Station of the Cross is vital to the Catholic faith. Most Catholic 
      Churches have plaques or pictures along their walls of the 14 "Stations of 
      the Cross" used to walk through the "stations". Like Mel’s movie, the 
      "Stations of the Cross" are commonly referred to by Catholics as <I>The 
      Passion</I>. Of course, nothing of the sort is found in the Word of 
      God.</P><B>
      <P>Get this. . . Mel Gibson’s <I>The Passion</I> is the Catholic ritual 
      "The Stations of the Cross" in action. Believe it or not. That is what 
      <I>The Passion</I> actually is. It is the Catholic "Stations of the Cross" 
      carried out on film!</P></B>
      <P>There is no doubt the underlying foundation of <I>The Passion</I> is 
      the 14 "Stations of the Cross". They are all there.</P>

      Passion</I>? Of course it is!</P>
      <P>James Dobson’s teen magazine, <I>Plugged In</I>, which lovingly

Cross:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>". . . a woman (the Roman Catholic Saint Veronica) gives

      <P>In an interview with James Dobson, Mel Gibson relates that it was The 
      Stations of the Cross that renewed his Catholic Faith: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Gibson had drifted away from his devout Roman Catholic 
        roots; his ‘early’ midlife crisis caused him to reconsider his faith.

        mark the hours of Christ’s passion.</B> ‘I got on my knees,’ Gibson 
        said. ‘I realized that His wounds could heal my wounds.’"<BR>(Neven,

      <P>There is no question Mel Gibson’s <I>The Passion</I> is a subtle (see

      <P>Mel Gibson’s film contains no English speaking whatsoever, it is all in 
      Latin or Aramaic. The fact is, there is no evidence that Jesus Christ ever 
      spoke any Latin. Most scholars agree the dialogue between Pilate and 
      Jesus, between Jesus and the Roman authorities was Greek. Any Christian 
      <B>knows</B> the New Testament was originally written in Greek; not Latin. 
      Why the Latin language? Simple. Latin is the sacred language of the 
      Catholic Mass. <I>The Passion</I> is a Catholic movie – from top to 
      bottom.</P>

        of the

      <P>There is no doubt <I>The Passion</I> is a subtle Catholic mystic film 
      cunningly teaching and promoting the Catholic religion.</P>
      <P>And there is no question the Catholic Religion is not a Bible Believing 
      Christian faith. Here are some of the un-Biblical and false teachings in 
      Catholicism:</P>
      <P>1. The Pope is called <B>Holy Father</B>, and acts in the place of God. 
      As Gibson stated when the Pope speaks from "the chair" it is the voice of 
      God. The Pope wears the title "Vicar of Christ". Vicar means "substitute". 
      The Pope claims to be the "substitute of Jesus Christ". Jesus Christ is 
      the "head of the church" according to Ephesians 5:23. The Catholic 
      Catechism (882) states, "For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as 
      Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and 
      universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always 
      exercise unhindered." </P>
      <P>Matthew 23:9, quickly demolishes the "Holy Father" myth.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>And call no man your father upon the earth</B>: for one 
        is your Father, which is in heaven.<BR>Matthew 23:9:</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>And Ephesians 5:23 also dethrones the "Vicar of Christ" nonsense.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>For the husband is the head of the wife, even <B>as Christ 
        is the head of the church</B>: and he is the saviour of the 
        body.<BR>Ephesians 5:23</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>2. The Catholic Church teaches salvation is not in the shed blood of 
      the Lord Jesus Christ, but <B>only</B> through the Catholic Church. </P>
      <P>Thank God, John 14:6 and Acts 4:12 (and about a zillion other verses) 
      completely destroy the "Catholic-only-salvation" foolishness:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: 
        no man cometh unto the Father, <B>but by me.<BR>John 14:6 
        <P>Neither is there salvation in any other</B>: for there is none other 
        name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.<BR>Acts 
        4:12</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>3. The Catholic Church teaches salvation is in the Mass or Holy 
      Eucharist. The Eucharist (Mass) is where Catholics partake of the wine and 
      the bread communion. In the Eucharist, through a mystic process called 
      <B>transubstantiation</B> the bread <B>literally </B>changes into the 
      actual body of Christ and the blood <B>literally </B>turns into the blood 
      of Christ. Without partaking of the Catholic Mass, there is no 
      salvation.</P>
      <P>Not surprising, Gibson and Caviezel [the actor who played "Jesus"] 
      received Mass and Communion every morning to prepare for the filming. </P>
      <P>4. The Catholic Church teaches an intermediate place between heaven and 
      hell called purgatory. Purgatory is a place where souls suffer and torture 
      to be purified from their sins. Of course, there is no such nonsense as 
      Purgatory in the Bible.</P>
      <P>5. The Catholic Church worships Mary as the Mother of God. The Catholic 
      Church teaches Mary, not just the Lord Jesus is the mediator between man 
      and God. A very popular Catholic prayer is:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Hail Mary<BR>Hail Mary, full of Grace<BR>The Lord is with 
        thee.<BR>Blessed art thou among women<BR>And blessed is the fruit of thy 
        womb, Jesus.<BR>Holy Mary, mother of God,<BR>Pray for us sinners<BR>Now 
        and at the hour of our death.<BR>Amen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Mel Gibson proudly calls Mary <B>"a tremendous co-redemptrix and 
      mediatrix"</B>. (Mel, Mary, and Mothers. Christianity Today. March 2004 
      &lt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/commentaries/passion-melmarymothers.html&gt;) 
      </P>
      <P>Mel clearly believes Mary is the co-redeemer (with Jesus) and 
      co-mediator (along with Jesus). Any doubts about what Mel Gibson believes? 
      </P>
      <P>The Bible is clear. There is only "one mediator between God and men" – 
      and it is not Mary.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>For there is one God, and one <B>mediator between God and 
        men, the man Christ Jesus;<BR></B>1 Timothy 2:5</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>There are many, many other false teachings in the Catholic Church such 
      as infant baptism, sacraments, confession, penances, indulgences, 
      celibacy, priests, and all kinds of sacrilegious silly stuff. </P>
      <P>It is amazing the Christian leaders who are informed on the false 
      teachings of the Catholic Church and its influence in <I>The Passion</I> 
      and yet these same Christians are wildly promoting <I>The Passion</I>.

      <P>It not only amazes me, but it also amazes Mel Gibson:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>I've been actually amazed</B> at the way I would say the

        of an eye opener for evangelicals who don't usually look at that aspect. 
        . ." (Ibid)</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The actor, who played "Jesus", Jim Caviezel, said in an interview 
      concerning Mary’s omniscience role in <I>The Passion</I>:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>"I ask Mary to guide me and my career.</B> . . <B>This

      <P>Let us understand something. If <I>The Passion</I> is the will of God 
      and if the Lord God of the Holy Bible is pleased with it, then we need to 
      join the Catholic Church and become devout Catholics. <I>The Passion</I>

      <P>Anyone who has watched a movie in a modern day theater is blown away by 
      the images and sound system. Huge screens covering a complete wall; larger 
      than life; living color; super-duper surround sound. It is certainly a 
      graphic feast for the ears and the eyes. Scenes viewed in these darkened

      <BLOCKQUOTE>34 <B>The light of the body is the eye</B>: therefore when

      <P>What you watch will greatly influence you. Not only will it greatly 
      influence you, but according to the Lord Jesus it will "fill you full of

      <P>When you place Luke 11:34-35 in "the darkness" of a gigantic movie

      <P>The Bible in 2 Corinthians 10:5 instructs the Christian to cast down

      what is flashing across the movie screen theaters. These "imaginations" 
      will influence and control you. The rest of the verse proves this point,

      <P>As much as possible, the Holy Spirit requires a clean, uncluttered and

      <P>Perhaps the greatest spiritual damage <I>The Passion</I> does is that

      <P>What a sad confession. It is especially troubling within the darkness 
      of the Anne Catherine Emmerich’s demonic-inspired material infecting 
      <I>The Passion</I>. </P>
      <P>Mel Gibson readily admits Anne Catherine Emmerich’s: "images" was a 
      major player in <I>The Passion</I>, </P>
      <P>"<B>Amazing images</B>,. <B>She supplied me with stuff I never would 
      have thought of".</P></B>
      <P>In my 25 years of research, preaching, teaching and writing, I have 
      researched many filthy and satanic subjects. I have watched videos of 
      actual bloody, satanic rituals. I have listened to hard-core satanic music 
      and the Satanic Black Mass. I have seen many violent and vulgar things. I 
      have seen things that no one but someone God called and God protected 
      should view. But the one thing I have vigorously avoided is religious 
      movies and videos, especially about the Lord Jesus. I have avoided them 
      like a "pit bull with AIDS". </P>
      <P>When the Jesus Video Project was mass mailing out The Jesus video by 
      the millions (several came to my house), people called or wrote asking my 
      opinion. I replied, "I have not watched it and I will not watch it". Why 
      the strict avoidance of the Jesus videos? Because when I read the word of 
      God, I want the Holy Spirit to have as clean a canvas as possible 
      concerning my Saviour and the spiritual things of God to paint into my 
      mind what He wants me to "see". </P>
      <P>Before I was saved over 28 years ago, I watched the movie The Ten 
      Commandments. And even until this day, as I read the books of Moses my 
      mind "sees" Moses looking like Charleton Heston. Those "imaginations" will 
      never go way. As I read about my Saviour, I do not want the "images" of 
      Jim Caviezel, the actor who played "Jesus" in <I>The Passion</I>, popping 
      up in my head.</P>
      <P>One thing you can be absolutely certain of. . . The Holy Spirit does 
      not want your mind filled with the "imaginations" of a demon-possessed 
      Catholic mystic through the "images" of <I>The Passion</I>.</P><FONT

      <P>One of the biggest surprises about <I>The Passion</I> is the wholesale 
      acceptance from the Christian community. I have been saved for over 28 
      years and I have never seen such an indiscriminate reception. It has been 
      called <I>The Passion Phenomena</I>. </P>
      <P>It is even more surprising when the known Catholic influence is 
      considered. Many of the Christian leaders who are adamantly promoting 
      <I>The Passion</I>, are well aware of Mel Gibson’s fanatical Catholicism 
      and it’s inspiration in <I>The Passion</I>. And yet many of these men are 
      ecstatically promoting <I>The Passion</I>. Normally, most of these 
      Christian leaders would draw a straight and deep line of separation 
      against Catholicism – but not with <I>The Passion</I>.</P>
      <P>Mel Gibson was also surprised at how the evangelicals have "hands downs 
      responded" to <I>The Passion</I>, especially since it openly promotes the 
      Catholic adoration of Mary. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>I've been actually amazed at the way I would say the 
        evangelical audience has—hands down—responded to this film more than any

        "the film is so Marian [the Roman Catholic worship of Mary]."(Mel, Mary,

      <P>What is so different about <I>The Passion</I>?</P>
      <P>What is the hook in <I>The Passion</I>? What is about <I>The 
      Passion</I> that Christians are closing their eyes to the blatant 
      doctrinal errors and welcoming it with open arms? </P><I>
      <P>The Passion</I> is "seducing" most Christians because of their desire 
      to know more about the Lord Jesus. They believe if they can just "see" the 
      scourging, the beating, the pain and anguish – they could love Him 
      more<B>. If they could "see" the blood, the torn flesh and what the Lord 
      Jesus went through for them – oh how they could love Him more!</B> </P>
      <P>It sounds logical. </P>
      <P>Their motives are certainly right. They want to know more about their 
      Lord. They want to draw closer to their Lord. They want to love their Lord 
      more. No problem here.</P>
      <P>Their motives are wonderful, but the method is completely wrong.</P>
      <P>Let us understand something very important, something that is missing 
      in today’s Christianity – and that is, the right motive does not make the 
      action right. <B>You can have the right motive, but you can be completely 
      wrong. </P></B>
      <P>Matthew 16 contains a very interesting dialogue in the Word of God. It 
      is the popular conversation between the Lord Jesus Christ and Peter. It 
      begins in verse 13, with the simple question, "Whom do men say that I the 
      Son of man am"? And they answer, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist: 
      some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets" And the Lord 
      asks them, "But whom say ye that I am?" </P>
      <P>In verse 16, Peter gives the correct answer:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>And Simon Peter answered and said, <B>Thou art the Christ, 
        the Son of the living God.<BR></B>Matthew 16:16</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>And the Lord Jesus replies:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, 
        Simon Barjona: for <B>flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, 
        but my Father which is in heaven.<BR></B>Matthew 16:17</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Peter apparently got a direct revelation from the Father. The Lord 
      said, "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee". There is no doubt 
      that Peter loved the Lord. There is no doubt at this point the Lord is 
      pleased with Peter. It would be safe to say at this time Peter is in the 
      perfect will of God.</P>
      <P>Everything is fine at this point. But here comes trouble. . .</P>
      <P>Just 4 verses later, the Lord tells his disciples how He be must 
      beaten, crucified and rise again third day.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, 
        how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders 
        and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the 
        third day.<BR>Matthew 16:21</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The next verse Peter begins rebuking the Lord, "Be it far from thee, 
      Lord: this shall not be unto thee." Peter loved the Lord. The Lord was not 
      going to be beaten and crucified as long as Peter was around. Peter would 
      have fought with every fiber in his soul to protect the Lord. Remember in 
      John 18, when they came for Jesus in the Garden, it was Peter that pulled 
      out a sword to protect the Lord.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, <B>Be 
        it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.<BR></B>Matthew 
      16:22</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Look at the next verse:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>But he [Jesus] turned, and said unto Peter, <B>Get thee 
        behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not 
        the things that be of God, but those that be of men</B>.<BR>Matthew 
      16:23</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Jesus addresses Peter as Satan! Satan had completely taken over Peter. 
      <B>What is amazing is Peter’s motive is love for the Lord! </B>Peter did 
      not want Jesus to be beaten and crucified because he loved His lord. And 
      yet, Satan completely took over Peter. The words coming out of his mouth 
      were no longer Peters – but Satan’s. <B>The motive was wonderful – the 
      method was wrong.</B> </P>
      <P>Remember, just six verses earlier God the Father was speaking to Peter 
      – and six verses later Satan is speaking through Peter. <B>And in both 
      cases, the motive is love</B>.</P>
      <P><FONT size=4>What was the difference? One was <B>the will of God</B>. 
      One was <B>the will of man</FONT></B>.</P>
      <P>Remember what the Lord said to Satan in verse 23, "thou savourest not 
      the things that be of God<B>, but those that be of men</B>. Peter wanted 
      to do the "will of man" by not allowing Jesus to be crucified. <B>His 
      motives were wonderful, but his method was completely wrong. </P></B>
      <P>Oh, how easy it is for us to <B><I>try to serve</B></I> God in the 
      "will of man". We want to do it our way. We want to "see" it. We want to 
      "feel" it. We want this "flesh" to experience it. So many times we try to 
      serve the Lord with our flesh. <B>And every time we do – like Peter, we 
      fail</B>. </P>
      <P>Just like Peter, the millions of Christians flooding the theaters are 
      trying to draw close to the Lord with their "flesh". If I can just "see" 
      the Lord beaten, tortured and crucified – I could love Him so much more. 
      <B>If I could "see" those nails actually driven in those precious hands – 
      I just know I could love Him more!</B> <B>I know I could. . .</P></B>
      <P>Just as Peter quickly discovered, we can not serve God with our "flesh. 
      We can not draw closer to God with our flesh. God is a Spirit – not flesh. 
      </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>God <I>is </I>a Spirit: and they that worship him MUST

      <P>The Christian life is a spiritual life. If we draw closer to the Lord 
      it MUST be spiritual. If we love the Lord more it MUST spiritual<B>. If we 
      really grasp what the Lord Jesus did for us – it MUST be spiritual. 
      </P></B>
      <P>There are no alternatives. There is no "plan B". God is a Spirit. You

      <P>In fact, the Bible says in Galatians 5:17, "For the flesh lusteth

      contrary the one to the other: . ."</P>
      <P>The flesh and the Spirit are completely opposite of each other. </P>
      <P>The Bible says in Romans 8:7, the "carnal mind is enmity against God". 
      The flesh is the enemy of God. Genesis 6:3, says, "And the LORD said, 
      <B>My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is 
      flesh</B>. . ." The flesh and God do not fellowship.</P>
      <P>Are you getting the picture? We can not love the Lord Jesus Christ more 
      with our flesh. Going to a picture show, any picture will not help us 
      understand more what the Lord Jesus did for us. Why? It is flesh. It is 
      the carnal mind. In order to love and know God it <B>must</B> be in the 
      spiritual realm. There are no exceptions.</P><I>
      <P>The Passion</I> appeals and touches the flesh. <I>The Passion</I> shows 
      in very graphic detail with all the graphic enhancements possible a man 
      tortured and beaten to death. For 45 non-stop minutes a man is beaten 
      bloody with torn flesh flying in slow motion, groans of pain and agony 
      searing through the sound system – <B>of course it will touch you</B>. Of 
      course, it will bring tears to any sane person’s eyes. <B>It could be any 
      human being beaten like that for 45 minutes and it would touch your 
      emotions.</B> </P><B><I>
      <P>The Passion</I> feeds and speaks to the flesh. The Holy Spirit feeds 
      and speaks to the spirit. </P></B>
      <P>A.W. Tozer in the book, <I>Tozer on Worship and Entertainment</I>, 
      addresses how movies touch our emotions, but can not touch our spirit: 
</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>"Religious movies are mistakenly thought by some people 
        to be blessed of the Lord because many come away from them with moist 
        eyes.</B> If this is a proof of God's blessing, then we might as well go 
        the whole way and assert that every show that brings tears is of God. 
        Those who attend the theater know how often the audiences are moved to 
        tears by the joys and sorrows of the highly paid entertainers who kiss 
        and emote and murder and die for the purpose of exciting the spectators 
        to a high pitch of emotional excitement. Men and women who are dedicated 
        to sin and appointed to death may nevertheless weep in sympathy for the 
        painted actors and be not one bit the better for it. The emotions have 
        had a beautiful time, but the will is left untouched. <B>The religious 
        movie is sure to draw together a goodly number of persons who cannot 
        distinguish the twinges of vicarious sympathy from the true operations 
        of the Holy Ghost."<BR></B>(A.W. Tozer, A.W., <I>Tozer on Worship and

      <P>Do you really believe Mel Gibson’s Anne Emmerich inspired 
      <I>Passion</I> could do more for you spiritually than the inspired Word of

      Emmerich could possibly "show" you more than the Holy Spirit of God? </P>
      <P>The reason millions of people are flooding the theaters is they are 
      desperately searching for something from God. Some are seeing <I>The 
      Passion</I> over and over, just trying to get a "glimpse" of God. "Oh, I 
      want too see Him, look upon His face". They are starving spiritually to 
      hear from the Lord. Amos 8:11, prophesied of the days when there would be 
      a famine not of bread. . . but of hearing the words of the Lord. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, <B>that I will

      <P>Well friend, we are there. The famine is clearly here. Millions of 
      people are storming the theaters looking for a morsel or a few crumbs from 
      the Lord. They are spiritually starving to death.</P>
      <P>Yet the Lord gave us a spiritual feast, but we have refused to taste 
      it. Like a little child refusing to eat their vegetables, "I don’t like 
      them". The Lord gave us the King James Bible to feast on but people say, 
      "I don’t like it. It’s too hard to read. It’s too outdated". And the 
      people are slowly starving to spiritual death. They crawl in the garbage 
      dumps of Hollywood and Catholicism searching for some scraps from the 
      Lord. <B>But friend, they are not there. . .</P></B>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>A.W Tozer in the book, Tozer on Worship and Entertainment, 
        writes of the Miracle Plays of the Middle Ages. The Miracle Plays were 
        today’s version of <I>The Passion</I>. They were futile attempts to 
        bring spiritual revival through the art of drama and acting. But they 
        produced the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages were the darkest hours in the 
        history of the church.
        <P></P>
        <P>"Those who would appeal for precedent to the Miracle Plays have 
        certainly overlooked some important facts. For instance, <B>the vogue of 
        the Miracle Play coincided exactly with the most dismally corrupt period 
        the Church has ever known.</B> When the Church emerged at last from its 
        long moral night these plays lost popularity and finally passed away. 
        And be it remembered, <B>the instrument God used to bring the Church out 
        of the darkness was not drama; it was the biblical one of 
        Spirit-baptized preaching.</B> Serious-minded men thundered the truth 
        and the people turned to God. 
        <P><B>Indeed, history will show that no spiritual advance, no revival, 
        no upsurge of spiritual life has ever been associated with acting in any 
        form. The Holy Spirit never honors pretense."<BR></B>(Tozer, A.W. Tozer

      read, "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. . . then

      <P><I>The Passion</I> with it’s elaborate special effects, dramatics, make 
      up, blood, ripped flesh, actors, music and stereo surround system makes 
      the God-given, God-inspired Word of God, almost insignificant in 
      comparison. It clearly lessens the effect and appeal of the Word of God.

      <P>One alarming thought penetrates my mind as I read these quotes. . . Do 
      these men really believe that a Hollywood movie can reveal the passion of 
      the Lord Jesus Christ better than the Word of God? Are they so deceived 
      and spiritually blind to believe that a demon-possessed Catholic mystic 
      inspired blood and gore movie can portray the passion of the Lord Jesus 
      better than the Holy Spirit of God?</P>
      <P>God help us. . . </P>
      <P>One reason <I>The Passion</I> has found such a welcome mat in the 
      Laodicean Church Age is because the Word of God has been surgically 
      diminished and crippled through the years. The authority and wonder of the 
      Word of God has been de-throned and replaced with movies, music, jewelry, 
      productions, drama, and any other crowd appealing invention.</P>

      <P>Hundreds of more warnings concerning the children could easily be 
      produced. Even Mel Gibson himself has said no children under 13 should see 
      <I>The Passion</I>.</P>
      <P>How does <I>The Passion</I> measure up against the many admonitions of 
      the Lord Jesus to "Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come 
      unto me . . ." Not very well.</P>
      <P>The stern "forbidding" and "inappropriate" exclusion of children to 
      "view" <I>The Passion</I> should provide irrefutable proof to any Bible 
      Believer – that <I>The Passion</I> is not from the Lord. </P>
      <P>With the glowing endorsements by hundreds of Christian leaders claiming 
      <I>The Passion</I> is "true to the Gospels", "factual", "like it really 
      happened" and "bringing the Bible to life" this begs an important 
      question. Some have even redefined the "R" rating as "R for Reality". 
      Since The Gospels are a "real" representation of The Bible – and since 
      virtually every Christian leader recommending <I>The Passion</I> are 
      "forbidding" children to view it –- does that mean they also "forbid" 
      young children to "view" and "read" The Bible?</P>
      <P>Don’t laugh. When Jay Leno asked Mel Gibson on NBC’s The Tonight Show 
      about the R rating of <I>The Passion</I>, Mel said:</P><B>

      <P><B>"R" rated. Hmmm. . . So, no one under 17 should read the Bible? I 
      don't think so.</B> 
      <P>Isn’t it amazing how quick and how far we can wander from the will of 
      God when we forsake the Bible? I say this with fear and trembling, but 
      without any hesitation of the truth, most of these popular Christian 
      leaders recommending <I>The Passion</I> are far, far away from the Word of 
      God and the will of God. Like Esau, most sold their birthright [The Word 
      of God] for one morsel of the world’s meat long, long ago.</P>
      <P>By the way, did you notice how many times the age of 13 came up as the 
      forbidden age? No one under 13 should see it. What? No one under 13 should 
      see the "greatest evangelistic tools in modern day history"? No one under 
      13 should see the "the most powerful evangelistic tools of the last 100 
      years"?</P>
      <P>A very enlightening survey was conducted by the Barna Research Group 
      titled Third Millennium Teens: Research on the Minds, Hearts and Souls of 
      America’s Teenagers. The research consisted of extensive nation-wide 
      surveys of teenagers. Using statistical analysis the margin of error is 
      less than 5%. The research discovered some enlightening information 
      concerning the average age in which people accept Jesus Christ as their 
      Savior. According to the Barna Research, "<B>The data show that if a 
      person does not accept Jesus Christ as savior before the age of 14, the 
      likelihood of ever doing so is slim</B>." </P>
      <P>Barna Research went on to say, "<B>if they’re not saved by age 13, they 
      probably never will</B>. The data shows clearly that the prime 
      evangelistic years <B>are those before a person becomes a teenager</B>". 
      (Third Millennium Teens, Barna Research, p. 65)</P>
      <P>Wow. No wonder the Lord Jesus Christ put so much emphasis on the 
      "little children".</P>
      <P>There has been much controversy accusing <I>The Passion</I> of being 
      Anti-Semitic or Anti-Jewish. More publicity has been devoted to the 
      possible Anti-Jewish interpretation of <I>The Passion</I> than any other 
      issue. But where is the outcry against the anti-children discrimination<B> 
      </B>of<B> </B><I>The Passion</I>?<B> </B>If <I>The Passion</I> is the<B> 
      </B>"greatest evangelistic tools in modern day history" and "the most 
      powerful evangelistic tools of the last 100 years" – where does this leave 
      the "little children"? Are we to let "these little children" go to hell 
      because they can not see <I>The Passion</I>?</P>
      <P>And what about the "little children" whose parents take to see <I>The 
      Passion</I>? They watch over 45 straight minutes of bloody, close-up 
      graphic detail of a man virtually beat to death. Their little eyes watch 
      in large-screen, living color, graphic surround sound as ripped bloody 
      flesh is flying through the air as blood splatters all over the Romans 
      executors. What will those images do to those tender young vulnerable 
      minds? Judging by the many adults who leave <I>The Passion</I> shocked and 
      dazed over the extreme blood and violence, I would dare say the "little 
      children" will have some confusing questions, to say the least. </P>

      Mel Gibson is not exactly the "poster boy" for good, clean G rated-films. 
      Mel has appeared in many films, such as <I>Mad Max, Payback,</I> and the 
      extremely violent <I>Lethal Weapon</I> series. Most of Mel's movies are 
      steaming with profanity and vulgarity mixed in with the typical 
      "Helly-wood" sexual scenes. 
      <P>Gibson had a leading role in the sexually charged comedy, 2000 film, 
      <I>What Women Want</I>. Mel starred as Nick, who after a freak accident 
      possessed the ability to read women's mind. Soon Nick's "goal in life was 
      to bed all the women his lustful heart desired." <I>The Target</I> review 
      ironically says of <I>What Women Want</I>, "Add Mel Gibson--as Nick, the 
      divorced 'man's man' <B>who can charm almost any woman into bed</B>--and 
      you've got high-concept comedy made in <B>Hollywood heaven</B>, right?" 
      <P><I>Screenit's</I> review of <I>What Women Want</I> reads, "There's also 
      some brief fooling around between a 15-year-old girl and her older 
      boyfriend and <B>related comments that she plans to lose her virginity to 
      him after their prom</B>, other kissing and g<B>azing at body parts of the 
      opposite sex, and various instances of cleavage and some brief, partial 
      nudity</B> in a flashback." (Screenit) 
      <P><B>Monica Bellucci</B>, the actress who plays Mary Magdalene in <I>The 
      Passion</I>, posed for the "2001 GQ Italia Totally Nude" calendar. 
      <P>The French film, <I>Irreversible</I>, which Monica Bellucci (aka Mary 
      Magdalene) plays a leading role, features total male and female nudity 
      with violent and filthy perverted sex scenes including homosexual S&amp;M 
      acts. 
      <P>Scoop news agency says, ". . . the film delivers <B>a stomach-churning 
      opening punch set in 'Rectum,' a sado-masochist gay club.</B>" Monica 
      performs in a 10 minute perverted-sex, graphic and violent sodomy rape 
      scene. 
      <P>The sleaze provoked veteran movie critic of 25 years, Jack Mathews of 
      <I>The New York Post</I>, to write: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>You may feel debased</B>. . . I won't be surprised if an 
        audience member somewhere <B>leaves his seat in the midst of the rape

      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>The movie, Irreversible, premiered at last years Cannes

        administer oxygen to 20 people (at the Cannes Festival) who fainted

        [of Monica Bellucci], and also contains graphic scenes of rape and

      professional opinion of Monica's Irreversible: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"France, where mainstream filmmakers have been taking

        the elevated shock quotient of 'Irreversible is nearly <B>a demonic

      <P><B>And friends, these are professional secular people trained and

      <P>Fire brigade spokesman Lieutenant Gerard Courtel said of 
      <I>Irreversible</I>: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"In 25 years in my job I've never seen this at the Cannes 
        festival. <B>The scenes in this film are unbearable, even for us 
        professionals</B>." (Scoop)</BLOCKQUOTE><B>For that kind of severe 
      nauseating response from them - Irreversible is pure, 100%, unadulterated 
      violent filth! </B>
      <P>Monica Bellucci, of The Passion, calmly says of the filthy and vile, 
      <I>Irreversible</I>: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"This is a film that people love or they hate, <B>but it's 
        good to have these kind of extremes</B>."</BLOCKQUOTE>No wonder Gibson 
      chose Monica for the extreme graphic blood and gore-fest of The Passion. 
      As the old saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together." Or as the 
      Word of God says, "<B>Can two walk together, except they be agreed</B>?" 
      Amos 3:3 
      <P><B>Searching Google with "'Monica Bellucci" and porn will return a 
      whopping 44,100 hits of extreme graphic vile and filth!</B> 
      <P>What about those Christian young people who viewed <I>The Passion</I> 
      and now innocently search the internet for some info on Monica and get 
      44,000 pages of wicked vile and filth! Don't tell me it does not happen. 
      <B>I have already received emails from some of the surprised innocent 
      victims! </B>Some of the Monica Bellucci laced "porn sites" will literally 
      take over your computer browser replacing your browser's home page with 
      their filth. You have to cancel or re-boot to get out of their filthy 
      sewers. <B>This happened to me personally many times simply researching 
      this chapter! </B>
      <P><B>Rosita Celentano,</B> who plays Satan is not exactly your cute 
      "little girl next door". A Google search with "Rosita Celentano" will 
      pop-up over 6,000 pages of porn-garbage. She has starred in such wonderful 
      movies as "Diary of a Porn Star" (which is a gay porn star). 
      <P><B>Maia Morgenstern,</B> who plays the virgin Mary in <I>The 
      Passion</I> is not exactly pure. She starred in the move, "The Whitman 
      Boys". It is a bizarre death film which contains prostitution, animal 
      sacrifices, violence and nudity. One review describes it as," two brothers 
      become obsessed with death after the death of their father. They 
      investigate the cemetery, dissect small animals, and then meet a young 
      prostitute who becomes an important presence in their lives" (Hollywood). 
      The "warning" on CVMC's film site reads: Contains "adult themes; brief 
      nudity; sexual themes; violence" (CVMC) 
      <P><B>Claudia Gerini, </B>who plays Pilate's wife in <I>The Passion</I>, 
      is also very popular in the Internet "Hall of Scum". A Google search on 
      "Claudia Gerini" and porn will infect your computer (and mind) with over 
      6,000 hits of depraved vile. 
      <P>The height of hypocrisy is James Dobson's recent praise of The Passion 
      as "the most powerful and important [film] ever made." (Dobson). Remember 
      it was Dobson a few years ago that was viciously fighting pornography and 
      even on the attorney general's Commission on Pornography and now he is 
      lavishly recommending a film to Christians virtually infested with "porn 
      stars". <B>Shame on you Dobson! </B>

      <P>The Bible is crystal clear. God’s people are to be separated from the 
      world, and the things of the world.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Wherefore come out from among them, <B>and be ye

      <P>Ephesians 5:11-12, resembles the "darkness" of a theater, where "it is 
      a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them. . .". It is 
      a shame, but the world projects the "shame" on huge color screens in 
      stereo surround sound.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>11 <B>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of 
        darkness</B>, but rather reprove them.<BR>12 For it is a shame even to 
        speak of those things which are done of them in secret<BR>Ephesians 
        5;11-12</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Hundreds, probably thousands, of separated Bible-Believing Christians 
      who have never stepped inside the darkness of a movie theater, with the 
      encouragement of their pastors, will enter the movie house for the first 
      time. And it will probably not be their last. Once that wall of separation 
      is broken, it is very hard to repair. The carnal mind (which we all 
      possess) instinctively says, "Now that wasn’t that bad. And the picture 
      and sound was awesome! And after all, there are some decent shows 
      available. Maybe I’ll just come back". As Proverbs 30:20 testifies, "Such 
      is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, 
      <B>and saith, I have done no wickedness</B>."</P>
      <P>Before someone jumps in and says, "Well the movie theater is no worse 
      than the television.". While I am certainly not attempting to justify the 
      filth on the TV, anyone who has spent any time in the theater (as I did 
      before I was saved) can testify to the contrary. As bad as network 
      television is, most of the really vulgar scenes are removed – but in the 
      movie house, it is full-life, large-scene, filth with the vilest language 
      and complete nudity – and that is an R rated show, which by the way, is 
      what <I>The Passion</I> is rated. </P>
      <P>The opening day of <I>The Passion</I> in the U.S. alone grossed over 
      $23.6 million in one day. <I>The Passion</I> is by far the largest opening 
      day not on a holiday or in the summer. If the first few days are any 
      indication, <I>The Passion</I> is destined to be crowned one of the 
      biggest selling, possibly the greatest selling movie of all time. Not 
      surprisingly, the vast majority of the viewers flooding the theaters are 
      professing Christians. According to news reports, many churches have 
      leased complete theaters – some have them completely booked up until 
      March! The Christian community has purchased over $10 million in advance 
      ticket sales. A new advance sales ticket record! God only knows what these 
      millions of dollars could have done for the missionaries around the world 
      and the spread of the Gospel. </P><B>

      <P>While we have <I>The Passion</I> on our examination table, we dare not 
      ignore the actor playing "Jesus".</P>
      <P>I find it very degrading and irreverent for anyone to "play" or "act" 
      as the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. I believe there are some things a 
      Christian should not "play" with. I believe there are some things that are 
      simply too sacred and too glorious for man to "touch". <B>And the person 
      of Lord Jesus Christ is one of these.</P></B>
      <P>I know what some are already thinking. "C’mon, chill out, it is just a 
      movie. All they are trying to do is bring the Gospel Story to life. What 
      is the big deal?" </P>
      <P>I am reminded of a story in the Old Testament found in 2 Samuel 6. It 
      is when David decided to retrieve the sacred ark from the house of 
      Abinadab. As they lifted the ark on a new cart and began rolling the ark 
      out. As the ark was moving the oxen shook the ark, and in order to help 
      the Lord to keep the ark from possibly falling, Uzzah put his hand on the 
      ark to steady it – <B>and the Lord immediately killed him.</B> Somebody 
      says, he was just trying to help the Lord. He was just trying to steady 
      the ark. What is the big deal? Friend, there are some things that are too 
      sacred for depraved men to "touch". <B>And the person of the Lord Jesus is 
      one.</P></B>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought 
        it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, 
        the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.<BR>4 And they brought it out 
        of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of 
        God: and Ahio went before the ark.<BR>5 And David and all the house of 
        Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir 
        wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, 
        and on cymbals.<BR>6 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, 
        <B>Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for 
        the oxen shook it.<BR></B>7 <B>And the anger of the LORD was kindled 
        against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error</B>; and there he 
        died by the ark of God.<BR>2 Samuel 6:3-7</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>For someone to "act" as the Lord Jesus Christ is the creation of 
      "another Jesus" (2 Cor. 11:4) As we saw previously the full-screen, 
      incredible images enhanced with surround creates an atmosphere that is 
      larger than life. Remember how amazed Billy Graham was after viewing 
      <I>The Passion</I>:</P>
      <P>"I feel as if I have actually been there. I was moved to tears. No one 
      who <B>views this film's compelling imagery will ever be the same</B>. 
      <B>Every time I preach</B> or speak about the Cross, <B>the things I saw 
      on the screen</B> will be on my heart and mind."</P>
      <P>Now every time when millions of people read their Bible or think of the 
      Lord Jesus Christ they will instinctively picture Jesus as Jim Caviezel. 
      Friend, Jim Caviezel is not Jesus.</P><IMG height=253 hspace=5

      <BLOCKQUOTE>"It just extended over the board and hit me with such a

      <P>Caviezel also carries in his a pocket a piece of wood from the

      <HR width="100%" SIZE=1>

      <P>The overwhelming feature of <I>The Passion</I> is the "scourging".</P>
      <P>Everyone that sees <I>The Passion</I> leaves shocked by the amount of 
      torn flesh and blood graphically displayed. Even with all the news media 
      reporting on the extreme violence, people knowing before hand what to 
      expect, leave literally dazed at the amount of blood and gore. Over 45 
      non-stop, continuous minutes are nothing but "Jesus" scourged, beaten and 
      whipped with nails. All the while, close up graphic scenes in slow motion 
      show every gruesome detail of the torn flesh flying and blood splattering 
      over the Roman executors. And this is surrounded and enhanced with 
      gruesome sound effects. </P>
      <P>To give you an idea of the amount of scourging and torture was 
      displayed, it took eight hours of makeup to create the beaten "Jesus".</P>

        <P>"His [Mel Gibson] version of the Gospels is harrowingly violent; the 
        final hour of ‘<I>The Passion</I> of the Christ’ essentially consists of 
        a man being beaten, tortured and killed in graphic and lingering detail. 
        Once he is taken into custody, Jesus (Jim Caviezel) is cuffed and kicked 
        and then, much more systematically, flogged, first with stiff canes and 
        then with leather whips tipped with sharp stones and glass shards. By 
        the time the crown of thorns is pounded onto his head and the cross 
        loaded onto his shoulders, he is all but unrecognizable, <B>a mass of

        pain.<BR></B>- A.O. Scott, The New York Times 
        <P>"Jesus is lashed until his entire body is covered in bloody 
        crisscrossing canals. When he rises, amazing the Roman soldiers with his 
        stamina, they go for the scourges, which rip and puncture his flesh in 
        slow motion—all while the Romans and the Jews cackle wildly. Carrying 
        his cross, he falls again and again in slow motion on his swollen, 
        battered body while the soundtrack reverberates with heavy, Dolby-ized 
        thuds. <B>It is almost a relief when the spikes are driven into his

      <P>The above disturbing reviews could easily be reproduced by the

      <P>The Bible describes the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus "as a lamb to the 
      slaughter". Isaiah 53:7</P>
      <P>Isaiah 50:6 says the Lord Jesus "gave’ His back to the "smiters", His 
      beard was literally ripped from His face and He was "spit on".</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that 
        plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. 
        <BR>Isaiah 50:6</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Isaiah 53 describes the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and 
        acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was 
        despised, and we esteemed him not. 4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, 
        and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, 
        and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was 
        bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; 
        and with his stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone 
        astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid 
        on him the iniquity of us all. 7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, 
        yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, 
        and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his 
        mouth.<BR>Isaiah 53:3-7</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Isaiah 52:14 says the Lord Jesus was so beaten, people that saw Him was

      <P>There is no question the Lord Jesus was beaten unmercifully before He 
      was crucified.</P>
      <P>But friend it was not something to be viewed in graphic, bloody, full 
      screen, enhanced stereo surround sound with music blaring in the 
      background! When the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified it was not 
      eight-hours of makeup with polyurethane simulating torn flesh and fake 
      blood. It was His actual torn flesh and sinless blood!</P>
      <P>And there were no movie theaters with millions of people gazing at the 
      blood and torture. No. He died all alone. </P>
      <P>The Bible says, <B>"And they all forsook him, and fled".</B> Mark 
      14:50</P>
      <P>Jesus Christ died a curse. The book of Galatians 3:13 says, Jesus was 
      "made a curse for us".</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, <B>being 
        made a curse for us</B>: for it is written, Cursed is every one that 
        hangeth on a tree:<BR>Galatians 3:13</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Beloved, the cross of Jesus Christ was the darkest, shameful, 
      disgraceful moment in the history of the universe. <B>It was such a shame 
      His own Father could not even look upon His Son.</P>
      <P>In Matthew 27:46 the cry that literally shook the universe was uttered 
      as God the Father forsook His Son – "My God, my God, why hast thou 
      forsaken me?"</P></B>

      <P>Friend, that was such a day of darkness the sun refused to shine. 
      Darkness veiled the Son of God on the cross to hide the shame. And yet 
      Christians by the millions are flooding theaters to view the scene. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Now from the sixth hour <B>there was darkness over all the 
        land unto the ninth hour.<BR></B>Matthew 27:45</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>As the Lord Jesus Christ was hanging on the cross, Matthew says the

      cross</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>It shocks me at the huge number of Christians that are literally 
      overflowing the theaters to watch their Saviour beat and tortured 
      unmercifully for nearly two hours! They are coming for one reason, and one 
      reason only – to see the blood! To view the extreme graphic scenes of torn 
      flesh and blood! There are no teachings. There are no miracles. The Gospel 
      is not even told The sound is not even in a language they understand! 
      <B>The only thing they understand is the blood!</B> </P>
      <P>Oh my God how far we have wandered from your Word! No wonder we are 
      seeing same-sex marriages, abortions and perversion of the Word of God 
      with hardly a whimper from God’s people! </P>
      <P>I have no desire to watch someone I love beaten and tortured in graphic 
      gruesome detail. I have no desire to watch my Saviour beaten, bruised and 
      bloody anymore than I had see my wife and children beaten and 
tortured.</P>
      <P>Yes, I know it happened. Yes, I know it was real. Yes, I know it was 
      very gory and bloody.</P>
      <P>Yes, I know.</P>
      <P>Thank God, I know what happened on the cross of Calvary. I know what 
      the Lord Jesus did for me. Thank God I can say with the apostle Paul in 
      Galatians 6:14, "<B>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross 
      of our Lord Jesus Christ,. .</B> ." But I think it’s a shame and a 
      disgrace for Christians to wallow in the blood and gore of watching their 
      Saviour tortured.</P>
      <P>Before I end this critique of <I>The Passion</I>, let me ask you dear 
      reader – do you really know what the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus was 
      really about? Are you aware of what took place that night? Do you realize 
      it was so much more than the physical beatings and physical death on the 
      cross? </P>
      <P>When the Lord Jesus was praying in the Garden He said, "O my Father, if 
      it be possible, let this cup pass from me. . .".</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and 
        prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from 
        me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.<BR>Matthew 
      26:39</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The "cup" Jesus Christ was referring to was more than just the physical 
      death of Calvary. That cup was the wrath of a Holy God filled to the brim 
      with the sins of mankind. The Lord Jesus would literally pay for the "sins 
      of the whole world". When John the Baptist saw Jesus in John 1:29, he 
      said, "Behold the Lamb of God, <B>which taketh away the sin of the 
      world</B>."</P>
      <P>In order for Jesus Christ to "take away the sin of the world" He had to 
      drink the "cup" of the wrath of God.</P>
      <P>No wonder as Jesus Christ was praying in the Garden He was in such 
      agony, Luke 22:44 tell us, "<B>his sweat was as it were great drops of 
      blood falling down to the ground</B>". Jesus Christ knew what was ahead. 
      He knew what was about to happen! Oh beloved don’t you love Him so! Oh 
      what a Saviour is mine! </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, 
        strengthening him.<BR>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: 
        <B>and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the 
        ground.<BR></B>Luke 22:44</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>All the sins of the world, every perversion, every abortion, every 
      murder, every child molestation, every rape, every curse word, every 
      thought of hate, every single sin ever committed by man in all of history 
      was going to be "drunk" by the Sinless Lamb of God. 6,000 years of filth, 
      violence, hate and sins was going to be placed on the pure, spotless Lord 
      Jesus Christ! </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>2 Corinthians 5:21, tells it all: "<B>For he hath made him 
        to be sin for us</B>, who knew no sin; that we might be made the 
        righteousness of God in him."</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>When Jesus Christ hung on the cross He cried, <B>"My God, my God, why 
      hast thou forsaken me?"</B> Do you know why God forsook Him? Do you 
      realize this was the only time Jesus Christ referred to His Father as God? 
      Every other time, He called Him "Father". But not this time. . .</P>
      <P>When Jesus Christ was "made sin for us", the fellowship He had with His 
      Father from all eternity was broken. That is why God the Father "forsook" 
      Him. Jesus could not even refer to His Father as "Father". The wrath of 
      God was placed on the sinless Son of God. Oh, what a price the Lord Jesus 
      Christ paid for our sins! Oh, do you love Him my friend? Do you know this 
      wonderful Saviour? </P>
      <P>Here is how Charles Spurgeon describes the crucifixion:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The central event around which all of human history revolves 
        was about to unfold. God would take the mass of guilty, blood-soaked sin 
        which had accumulated against His people and place it on the body of His 
        beloved Son. But that's barely half of it. This One who had never known 
        anything except the presence, fellowship, and communion of God would be 
        heard to cry out, "My God, My God! Why hast though forsaken me?!!" This 
        One who had lived as eternal spirit had taken on a body which would be 
        so racked with pain that Isaiah would declare, "His visage was so marred 
        more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men" (Isaiah 
        52:14). His body was torn and distorted as God poured out the cup of 
        Holy wrath. He was beaten, bruised, and abused by men and God. As it 
        loomed before Him, He feared. The more amazing side of this story, 
        though, is that He knew it was coming. He cried out to the one who could 
        save Him, "if it be possible, let this cup pass from me." Yet, He 
        submitted Himself. You're not getting it...I'll say it again... Yet, He 
        submitted Himself!!! In humility and obedience to the will of His 
        Father, knowing the horror that lay ahead of Him, our eternal Priest 
        acquiesced, "nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."<BR>Charles 
        Spurgeon, Hebrews commentary:</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Let me ask you my friend, have you ever asked received the Lord Jesus 
      Christ as your Saviour? Is there a time and a place when you asked the 
      Lord Jesus Christ to save you?</P>
      <P>If you've never received Jesus Christ as your Savior, please bow your 
      head this minute and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to save you and give YOU 
      that "joy unspeakable".
