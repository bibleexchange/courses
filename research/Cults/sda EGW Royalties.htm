      <P><B>Note:</B> This article by Pastor Ballenger, shows Ellen was more 
      concerned about getting money from her book Great Controversy, by pushing 
      to sell it ahead of Bible Readings. Which do you think God would be most 
      pleased, getting Bible Readings out first, which focuses on the Bible, or 
      Mrs. E. G. White plagiarized Great Controversy? She surely was the 
      Seventh-day Adventist's Prophet for profit.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: 700; FONT-SIZE: 24pt; COLOR: red; FONT-STYLE: italic"><FONT

      </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><I>By E. S. Ballenger<O:P> 
      </O:P></I></P>
      <P>About 1898, the R&amp;H publishing House decided to quit paying 
      royalties. They passed the following resolutions: "That manuscripts 
      prepared outside the office, at an author's expense, be purchased before 
      publishing the same.</P>
      <P>"That no further investment be made in publishing or promoting books 
      unless ownership and <B>full control </B>of the plates can be secured." 
      THE TIME, THE NEED, THE MESSAGE. p. 75. <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Mrs. 
      White simply told them</SPAN></B> she would not submit to any such 
      arrangement, and threatened to take the publication of her books into her 
      own hands. In proof of this we quote her own words: - "Then, if my 
      brethren did not awake to the situation, I was to make no delay in taking 
      the books into my own hands, and the Lord would prepare the way before 
      me." SPECIAL INSTRUCTION REGARDING ROYALTIES. p. 7.</P>
      <P>To meet this situation, she gave some very peculiar advice. On page 11 
      of the same pamphlet, we read: - "I wish to say to authors, that I can not 
      see that they have any liberty to either give away or sell their right to 
      books they have written."</P>
      <P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Mrs. White had an eye for 
      business.</SPAN></B> She was receiving from $8,000 to $12,000 a year on 
      the books she wrote while in the employ of the Gen. Conf. Her son, Willie, 
      was also being paid by the General Conference; and he was giving his whole 
      time to the work of his mother. How many other helpers were paid by the 
      General Conference, we are not prepared to say. However, she forced the 
      publishing house to continue to pay her 10 per cent on the retail price of 
      her books.</P>
      <P>These royalties evidently had some influence on her attitude toward 
      some other books. We quote again from the same document, page 9: - 
      <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">"No one can have been hurt financially more 
      than I was hurt </SPAN></B>when "The Great Controversy" lay for nearly two 
      years dead in the office. Just work was not done in this matter. The book 
      'Bible Readings' was crowded in before 'Great Controversy', which was 
      already printed, and which should have been placed in the canvasser's 
      hands first. . . . <SPAN style="COLOR: red">This was a dishonest 
      transaction toward me, and it was unfaithful stewardship toward God."<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>When BIBLE READINGS was put on the market, it was sold by the tens of 
      thousands; but she did not get 10 per cent on these 'sales, whereas she 
      did get 10 per cent on GREAT CONTROVERSY. She was very pronounced in 
      recommending her own books. However, she did share her recommendation with 
      Uriah Smith, as follows:-</P>
      <P>"The light given was that 'Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation,' 
      'Great Controversy,' and 'Patriarchs and Prophets,' would make their way. 
      They contained the very message the people must have, The angels of God 
      would prepare the way for these books in the hearts of the people." Id. p. 
      7.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to know in connection with these statements that 
      something like a year ago, the Southern Publishing Association at 
      Nashville, Tenn., made a somewhat slight revision on THOUGHTS ON DANIEL 
      AND REVELATION, and published 3000 or 5000 copies; but the General 
      Conference put a veto on their selling them. I was unable to get a 
      copy.</P>
      <P>The Gen. Con. appointed a committee to revise THOUGHTS ON DANIEL AND 
      REVELATION; but their revision was not ready to go to press. However, just 
      recently, they have published a revised edition of this book. The 
      denomination put out a book if THOUGHTS ON DANIEL AND REVELATION "<SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">contained the very message</SPAN> the people must 
      have," the special light God had given his people," <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">why should it be necessary to revise this book 
      </SPAN>that contained just what wanted the people to have; and why should 
      they forbid Southern Publishing House to sell this book? It looks as if 
      they did not believe the Testimonies.</P>
      <P>"Had the very book God appointed to stand in its lot and place been 
      handled as earnestly as 'Bible Readings', men would have cooperated with 
      the angels of God, to make the very impression essential for that time." 
      SPECIAL INSTRUCTION REGARDING ROYALTIES, March 11, 1899, pp. 4, 5.</P>
      <P>BIBLE READINGS were studies from the Word of God; <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">while her book was stolen from other writers without 
      credit.</SPAN> If this isn't putting her own writings above the Bible, 
      then my intelligence needs some kindergarten training. Her defenders deny 
      'that they put her writings on equality with the Bible, but in this 
      instance <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">she places them above the Bible.<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>She not only defended her own royalties, but she looked after the 
      royalties of her son who put out a similar book called the GOSPEL PRIMER 
      which had a very liberal circulation.</P>
      <P>The denomination put out a book called "HIS GLORIOUS APPEARING" which 
      cut into the sale of her son Edson's book. She used strong language in 
      condemning this follows:- "The dealing in regard to 'Gospel Primer' was 
      unjust. Another book 'His Glorious Appearing' was crowded in to kill the 
      sale the Primer. The way in which the "The Gospel Primer was handled has 
      left a record on the books of heaven which those concerned in the matter 
      will not be pleased to meet in the judgment."… This article was published
