size=6><B>THE VELCRO BISHOP WITH ANOTHER GOSPEL</B></FONT></H3>
<P align=center><STRONG>by G. Richard Fisher</STRONG></P>
<P>If nothing else, Thomas D. Jakes appears to be very successful. Called a 
“Bishop” by <I>Charisma</I> magazine, this prolific writer, recently purchased 
sizable land holdings from the crippled ministry of jailed evangelist W.V. 
Grant. <I>The Dallas Morning News</I> reported the sale of three of Grant’s 
properties to Jakes, with an estimated tax value of over $4 
million.<SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P><I>The Bookstore Journal</I> lists three of Jakes’ books, from a variety of 
publishers, on its best seller chart for several months running. Its December 
1996 issue said Jakes has a gift for writing, indicating that the bishop “does 
almost all his own writing” and that he “attributes his engaging prose to divine 
inspiration.”<SUP>2</SUP></P>
<P>The Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) and the Black Entertainment Network 
(BET) both air various programs by Jakes up to three times weekly. In addition, 
the highly popular Promise Keepers organization enlisted Jakes as a member of 
its “Men’s Conferences Speaker Team” in 1995 at its Seattle and St. Petersburg 
conferences and has invited him as a speaker for its 1997 
lineup.<SUP>3</SUP></P>
<P>In its November 1996 issue, <I>Charisma</I> also labels Jakes as “one of the 
nation’s most popular preachers”<SUP>4</SUP> and quotes New Orleans pastor Paul 
Morton, who labels Jakes a “black Billy Graham.”<SUP>5</SUP> Jakes’ publications 
and the conferences where he is a keynote speaker are regularly advertised in 
<I>Charisma</I>.</P>
<P>But the real question is not his popularity, but his commitment to the truth 
of Scripture. Is Jakes doctrinally sound? Does he teach the Gospel in its 
purity? Is this “popular preacher” staying within historical orthodoxy or is he 
(and those he influences) moving away from the mainstream?</P>
<P>Jakes catches attention as he struts, prances and preens across the stage. 
While he may be a bombastic and entertaining speaker, is he a good 
instructor?</P>
<P>Jakes is part of the Higher Ground Always Abounding Assembly, a Pentecostal 
fellowship of more than 200 churches begun in the late 1980s. He promotes his 
books and videotapes through Jakes Ministries, now based in Dallas. His 
orientation is decidedly Pentecostal and clearly Word-Faith. The vast majority 
of his messages are definitely motivational and all about empowerment. They are 
weighted with psychological jargon.</P>
<P>Yet, there are troubling things about Jakes. For instance, did he misspeak to 
<I>Charisma</I> in the above-mentioned November issue or was he simply misquoted 
when he spoke of people who have “failed to appreciate their 
divinity.”<SUP>6</SUP> Divinity means that you are divine and it is a word that 
only fits with God. The word is derived from Latin (<I>divinitatem</I>) and 
means “godhead” or “the quality of being divine.”<SUP>7</SUP></P>
<P>More importantly, man is never addressed anywhere in Scripture as having 
divinity or being divine. Is Jakes, by virtue of his statement, associating 
himself with the god-man errors of the Word-Faith Movement? If not, and at the 
very least, he owes the credulous readership of <I>Charisma</I> a clarification. 
To even suggest that man is divine takes empowerment too far.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>BIRDS OF A FEATHER...</B></FONT></P>
<P>Jakes gives deference to the ministries of Marilyn Hickey and Joyce 
Meyer.<SUP>8</SUP> Both these “celebrated ministers” are heretical and promote 
Word-Faith doctrine without apology. How many erroneous camps can you occupy and 
still be considered a good example? In 2 John 9-11, we are commanded not to 
endorse heretical teachers in any way.</P>
<P>Jakes has also shared the platform at a September 1996 conference with 
Roberts Liardon.<SUP>9</SUP> Any discerning Christian should want to stay as far 
away as possible from Liardon who claims he was transported to heaven and there 
met Jesus face to face and that he and Jesus had a water fight in the River of 
Life! Liardon further claims he was shown a building filled with unclaimed body 
parts (hair, eyes, skin, legs, etc.). This heavenly warehouse of unclaimed body 
parts is overstocked, according to Liardon, simply because here on earth 
believers have failed to appropriate them by faith.<SUP>10</SUP> Liardon’s 
charade is either lunacy or sheer deception and should be given public rebuke, 
not public relations.</P>
<P>Jakes patronizes and clearly finds himself among the celebrities of the 
Charismatic camps. A full-color advertisement on the inside cover of the January 
<I>Charisma</I> announced that Jakes would appear at the August “Victory Word 
Explosion” in Tulsa, Oklahoma with Benny Hinn, Richard Roberts, Rod Parsley, 
Joyce Meyer and Jerry Savelle. With this roster, it might better be called 
“Heresy Explosion.”</P>
<P>And why invite Jim Bakker to speak, as Jakes did in April 1996, before Bakker 
has even had a chance to demonstrate some long-term repentance since leaving 
prison. Placing Bakker back into the limelight and ministry too quickly may 
create the same dynamics that brought him down before. First Timothy 5:22 
suggests that Jakes should have done just the opposite.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>RIDING IN FIRST CLASS</B></FONT></P>
<P>When questioned for his opulent lifestyle, including an expensive home and a 
Mercedes-Benz automobile, Jakes merely refers to himself as an investor and an 
author. The Apostle Peter, however, said, “silver and gold have I none” (Acts 
3:6).</P>
<P>It is obvious that the religion business is very lucrative for some. <I>The 
Dallas Observer</I> magazine reports:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“His conferences draw tens of thousands. His television show, broadcast on 
  both the Trinity Broadcasting Network and Black Entertainment Television, 
  reaches hundreds of thousands. He has spawned his own industry, T.D. Jakes 
  Ministries, which sells his books — 10 in all, with five best-sellers — and 
  videotapes, the income from which allowed him to spend nearly $1 million last 
  year on a residence in his hometown of Charleston, West 
  Virginia.”<SUP>11</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Dallas Observer</I> goes on to report:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“He says he is not embarrassed by this, even though his extravagant 
  lifestyle has caused controversy in his hometown that will likely follow him 
  to Dallas. His suits are tailored. He drives a brand new Mercedes. Both he and 
  his wife Serita are routinely decked out in stunning jewelry. His West 
  Virginia residence — two homes side by side — includes an indoor swimming pool 
  and a bowling alley. These homes particularly caused the ire of the local 
  folks. One paper wrote at length about the purchase and made much of their 
  unusual features. A columnist dubbed Jakes ‘a 
huckster.’”<SUP>12</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yet, what is most disturbing about Jakes’ prosperity is not the wealth 
itself, but his false teaching about Jesus to justify his fortune. <I>The Dallas 
Observer</I> shares further:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Besides, Jakes says — during an interview and in his sermons — Jesus was a 
  rich man. He had to have been, in order to have supported his disciples and 
  their families during his ministry.”<SUP>13</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To add to his false and mythical Christ, Jakes brazenly says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The myth of the poor Jesus needs to be destroyed, because it’s holding 
  people back.”<SUP>14</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Jakes obviously perverts the true biblical picture of Jesus in an effort to 
advocate his own lifestyle. <I>The Fort Worth Star Telegram</I> reports:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Jakes, who drives a Mercedes, has moved with his wife and their five 
  children to a luxurious seven-bedroom home with swimming pool in the White 
  Rock Lake area of Dallas. He said the home cost more than $1 million. ‘I do 
  think we need some Christians who are in first class as well as coach,’ Jakes 
  said.”<SUP>15</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sadly, in the case of so many prosperity teachers, they are the ones flying 
in “first class” by way of the donations of their impoverished flock while the 
latter fly in “coach” — or miss the flight altogether because they lack the 
money to even buy a ticket.</P>
<P>All this when the Scripture is so very clear: “For you know the grace of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, 
that you through His poverty might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9). Our 
spiritual riches came only because he stripped and divested Himself of all 
earthly goods (Ephesians 1:3).</P>
<P>Archaeological excavations of Nazareth in the 1950s demonstrates the little 
village to have been occupied in Jesus’ day by poor agricultural 
people.<SUP>16</SUP> As we’ve seen Scripture clearly shows the poverty of 
Jesus.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>A WOUNDED VIEW OF SIN</B></FONT></P>
<P>In Jakes’ writings, he introduces so much in psychological terms that it is 
hard to cut through the thicket. It becomes hard to distinguish Freud from fact. 
He refers to immoral, lustful and sinful thinking as merely “little boy 
thoughts.”<SUP>17</SUP> The Bible takes a stronger view and approach to mental 
sins and calls us to confession and renewal of mind. A lustful thought is as 
sinful as a lustful act in God’s view (Matthew 5:28-30).</P>
<P>In fact, very little is called sin in the above referenced book but there is 
much about wounding and being wounded, dysfunction and “the child 
within.”<SUP>18</SUP> This is peppered throughout this book.</P>
<P>The above is stock and trade with the New Age-self help guru John Bradshaw. 
One of Bradshaw’s workshops is called “healing your inner child.” It is obvious 
that, whether knowingly or unknowingly, Jakes has digested large portions of 
Bradshaw’s esoteric psychobabble, including the terminology.<SUP>19</SUP></P>
<P>No doubt, a study of the extent of Jakes’ borrowing from Bradshaw could be 
the topic of an entire paper. It appears that Jakes has absorbed many of the 
psychological trends of the age.</P>
<P>The <I>Charisma</I> article also mentions Jakes having courses in psychology 
before dropping out of college.<SUP>20</SUP> Jakes, like Velcro, has had much of 
this influence stick with him. Velcro can have good things and things not so 
good (like lint and dirt) stuck to it. Such is the case with Jakes. He is 
tainted by some very questionable associations and endorsements and some very 
questionable borrowings, beliefs and teachings.</P>
<P>Jakes refers to an adulterous man as a “frightened little boy” and a wife 
beater as a “terrified little boy.”<SUP>21</SUP> The Scriptures never speak of 
such heinous things in such a cavalier way. If a doctor misdiagnosed a disease 
and called it by a different name there would be very little possibility that 
the cure or medication would address the issue at all. A wrong diagnosis would 
lead to wrong treatment and malpractice. Again Jakes has succumbed to 
questionable and changing psychological theory.</P>
<P>Lutheran pastor and radio host Don Matzat warns against the wholesale 
acceptance of very questionable psychological theory:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Modern psychology is not an innocent helping-discipline that we can 
  carelessly borrow from the kingdom of the left-hand and merge with our 
  pastoral theology. There are theories and techniques in psychology, such as 
  self-esteem, the encounter dynamic, and psychological mysticism, that can 
  grossly distort Christian truth and inflict grave spiritual damage upon 
  Christian people. <I>... We must carefully discern the theories and practices 
  of modern psychology before we visit them upon the people of 
  God.”</I><SUP>22</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In his excellent and perceptive book, <I>The Biblical View Of Self-Esteem, 
Self-Love, Self-Image</I><B><I>,</I></B> Dr. Jay Adams points out that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The self-love movement that was begun by humanistic psychologists has 
  already had a significant impact on the church. ... You cannot simply ‘add’ 
  the insights of this new teaching to your set of existing Christian beliefs; 
  if you add them, you must modify or subtract many of the beliefs you already 
  hold. ... You are choosing between two divergent views of man, his problem, 
  and how to solve it.”<SUP>23</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Jesus, in John 17:17, did not say, “Sanctify them by building up their self 
image,” but rather “Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.”</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>ANOTHER JESUS</B></FONT></P>
<P>It has been shown above that as far as money and riches are concerned, Jakes’ 
view of Jesus is not hard to determine. His “rich Jesus” is merely a figment of 
his imagination, or perhaps he is merely regurgitating the false teachings of 
Fred Price, Paul Crouch and John Avanzini.<SUP>24</SUP></P>
<P>Jakes seems just as confused when it comes to the human nature of Jesus. He 
states that because the teachers in Jesus’ day listened to Him as a child it 
boosted His self-esteem.<SUP>25</SUP> Here again we have Jakes’ psychological 
jargon but now, even worse, it is being dumped on Jesus. At the very least it is 
erroneous and irreverent to speak of Jesus in those terms. To suggest that Jesus 
needed a boost in self-esteem and that it took some Jewish teachers to do it is 
to really miss the point of who Jesus really is.</P>
<P>Jesus may have opted to allow His sinless manhood to progress in a normal 
course (Luke 2:51-52) but His Deity and perfection put Him outside mundane false 
human categories. Again we see the pop psychology dominating with Jakes and a 
different Jesus being constructed out of the paper mache of human ideas. What 
Jakes suggests now puts Jesus into the category of a flawed rich man needing an 
ego boost!</P>
<P>Because the incarnation is such a great mystery, we must always be careful to 
say about Jesus only what the Scriptures actually say. If not, we can fall into 
extreme and heretical views on either side. As others have suggested there must 
be a “reverent agnosticism” about some aspects of the Godhead incarnate.</P>
<P>In the fifth century, the Eutychians so deified Christ’s humanity that He was 
no longer truly human. On another extreme, the Nestorians at the same time so 
separated the two natures of Jesus as to suggest two distinct 
personalities.<SUP>26</SUP></P>
<P>Jakes appears to tilt toward the Nestorian error. The Orthodox view was 
promulgated at the Council of Chalcedon in A.D. 451 and stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“In the one person Jesus Christ there are two natures, a human nature and a 
  divine nature, each in its completeness and integrity, and these two natures 
  are organically and indissolubly united, yet so that no third nature is formed 
  thereby. In brief, to use the antiquated dictum, orthodox doctrine forbids us 
  either to divide the person or to confound the 
natures.”<SUP>27</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Church has always held that Christ’s human nature was complete as 
Chalcedon taught. Therefore to suggest a boost was needed in Christ’s 
self-esteem is a definite move away from orthodoxy.</P>
<P>In chapters 13 and 15 of <I>Loose That Man,</I> Jakes spends 30 pages 
developing applications from the Lazarus story as how to live like a “loosed 
man.” That may be all well and good, but not once does Jakes state the Apostle 
John’s objective of clearly showing Jesus as the Resurrection and the Life — 
Jesus as the one who conquers death for us and offers us resurrection hope for 
the future.</P>
<P>As well, this tremendous miracle confirmed Jesus as the Messiah and caused 
some to believe (John 11:45). John’s expressed purpose for recording any of the 
miracles of Christ was to confirm Jesus as Messiah and engender commitment to 
Him: “But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name” (John 20:31). 
Jakes seems to miss the primary interpretation to spin out many secondary, 
subjective applications to boost our esteem.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>LOOKING FOR MANHOOD IN ALL THE WRONG 
PLACES</B></FONT></P>
<P>Jakes mentions that he purchased (for all the men in his organization) 
subscriptions to the secular <I>GQ Magazine</I> to help them learn about 
manhood.<SUP>28</SUP></P>
<P>Any Christian need only briefly scan the contents of a recent issue of 
<I>Gentlemen’s Quarterly</I> — <I>GQ Magazine</I> — to be shocked and even 
appalled at its contents, some of which is nearly pornographic. Consider, for 
example, the November 1996 issue where there is an advertisement for the “Better 
Sex Videos.” The photograph accompanying this ad left little to the imagination. 
This same issue’s table of contents listed articles on “Nightlife at the Viper 
Room,” a crime story about a crossdressing heiress, the cigar clubs of Beverly 
Hills, and things even worse.</P>
<P>This writer cannot imagine a minister endorsing a publication with such 
questionable contents as this for any reason. On the cover of the February 1997 
issue, controversial basketball star Dennis Rodman and supermodel Rebecca Romijn 
were both featured in skimpy bathing suits. I am still trying to figure what any 
of this has to do with Christianity. How far we’ve come. Jakes expresses love 
for his children but is this the kind of material they would find around the 
house?</P>
<P>Instructions in biblical texts and biblical manhood would be far safer and 
far more sane, as well as more profitable and lasting. God’s Word has incredible 
things to say about manhood and godliness. The male leadership of the Church is 
given in specific, practical guidelines in 1 Timothy 3:1-13 and Titus 1:5-9. The 
Bible presents ideal manhood. It may not be as trendy as <I>GQ</I>, but it is 
far more life changing and God honoring.</P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>A STROLL DOWN MYSTIC LANE</B></FONT></P>
<P align=left>In Jakes’ book, <I>Why? Because You Are Anointed,</I> he teaches a 
personal guidance system that is not only strange but misleading and fraught 
with problems of self-deception and outright manipulation of others.</P>
<P>Instead of telling people to follow the clear dictates and details of God’s 
Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17), he leads people to follow confusing detours of inner 
impressions and guess work by others. Listen to his advice:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“God imparts to you a revelation of His plans for your life. That is how 
  the vision begins. Then in some cases, God confirms that word he spoke 
  personally to you through a prophecy given to you by another man or woman of 
  God.”<SUP>29</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Jakes does not seem to have even an elementary idea of the basic doctrines 
and distinctions between revelation, inspiration and illumination. Yet he 
purports to give direction and guidance to thousands.</P>
<P>In the same book he says that the guidance will be proven later by the 
Scripture.<SUP>30</SUP> That certainly puts the cart before the horse. Suppose 
by that time you have created an unmitigated disaster. We must always start with 
the Scripture and not use God’s Word as an addendum.<SUP>31</SUP> </P>
<P>At this point some may say that all the above is unimportant and to express 
concern about these things is simply nit picking. Certainly the good Jakes does 
out weighs minor differences.</P>
<P>A lavish materialistic lifestyle, a vastly different Jesus, the 
psychologizing of Christianity, crude magazines, an unsafe guidance system may 
be good and acceptable to some, but not to those that take the Bible seriously 
and see Scripture as the sole court of appeal when it comes to religious claims 
and teachings.</P>
<P align=left>However it get worse, especially Jakes’<FONT size=2> </FONT><FONT 
size=3>teaching on the Gospel and salvation.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>DYING TO GET SAVED</B></FONT></P>
<P>In his 1996 work, <I>The Harvest,</I> Jakes sends confusing signals as to 
whether or not he believes in salvation by grace through faith. He says he is 
“called to preach the message of the cross” and that we must “preach the Gospel 
as sincerely and effectively as possible,”<SUP>32</SUP> which sounds good. And 
then he also warns of false gospels,<SUP>33</SUP> which sounds even better. But 
as he elaborates he sounds totally confused and contradictory and leads one to 
wonder if he really understands the simplicity of the Gospel.</P>
<P>We find a heavily conditional, or works, salvation being developed and 
described by Jakes. His comments could also be called salvation by struggle:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Unless the believer is willing to lose his life for Christ’s sake, he 
  cannot ever attain everlasting life. If the Master must suffer to the point of 
  death, so likewise must the servant.”<SUP>34</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Taken at face value, it appears that only martyrs or nearmartyrs qualify for 
heaven. Try to interpose this concept into the 16th chapter of Acts. You would 
have to say to the jailer in response to his question, “What must I do to be 
saved?”: “You have to make sure you have a martyr’s mind set or its no 
good.”</P>
<P>There is not a shred of biblical evidence for Jakes’ condition. Given his 
lifestyle, Jakes fails the test himself. He surely is no martyr and has very 
little to worry about on the material plane.</P>
<P>To confuse things even further Jakes declares that we must: “Die! Die and 
keep on dying daily until all of you is dead and only Christ lives. Death is the 
key to life and life more abundantly.”<SUP>35</SUP> This certainly begs the 
question: What has Bishop Jakes died to? Surely not materialism. He needs to 
show us, not preach at us.</P>
<P>It is obvious that Jakes is uncertain as to salvation being a <I>free 
gift</I> from God as Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5 and Romans 6:23 teach. He warns 
about false gospels and is even so bold to say that ministers propagating false 
beliefs are probably greed-oriented.<SUP>36</SUP> He then goes on to propose the 
strangest Gospel to come down the pike in a while.</P>
<P>Jakes’ view can be called a two-tiered salvation or a two-step salvation or 
perhaps a progressive graduated salvation. His imaginary salvation is based on a 
distortion of John 1:12-13. It goes as follow:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Scripture teaches that receiving Christ as your personal Savior does not 
  necessarily make you a son of God, but if you choose to do so, the power 
  (authority) and right to do so is present. ... Just being saved does not make 
  you a son of God, ...only those who are willing to be led by the Spirit 
  actually realize and manifest the sonship of God.”<SUP>37</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So in Jakes’ view being a son is not something you are, it is only something 
you can opt to manifest. His teaching is more at home with that of the late cult 
leader Herbert W. Armstrong, than with orthodoxy.<SUP>38</SUP></P>
<P>Jakes does not realize how nonsensical he sounds when he says one can be 
saved and not be a son of God. Does he not realize that the terms are 
interchangeable and that one really means the other? Being “saved” and “being a 
son of God” are one in the same. The moment we exercise faith in Jesus and 
accept Him, we are sons. “<I>For you are all sons of God through faith in Jesus 
Christ,”</I> Galatians 3:26 declares.</P>
<P>Jakes confounds and distorts the salvation process by making a distinction 
between accepting Jesus as Savior and being a son of God. He says that these are 
different states arrived at in different ways. The Bible does not recognize 
Jakes’ false dichotomy.</P>
<P>The truth of Scripture regarding the riches of our salvation is summarized by 
Thomas R. Edgar:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Every person who believes in Jesus Christ has their sins forgiven and is 
  immediately justified. The Holy Spirit indwells every believer immediately 
  upon salvation. Every believer has access to God in prayer and has other 
  believers available for fellowship, edification, and counsel. Every Christian 
  has all of this immediately upon justification.”<SUP>39</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If we were to believe Jakes, we would have to believe that receiving Christ 
and being saved are one thing (doing very little if anything for you, except for 
being a first step) and being a son of God is something entirely different that 
you can choose or not choose to become. So you can be “saved” but not really 
saved. When you decide to be led by the Spirit you then manifest son-ship. </P>
<P>Romans 8:1 indicates, however, that walking in the Spirit is something you 
can and will do because you are already a son of God. Walking in the Spirit is a 
privilege and the manifestation of sons. Jakes totally misunderstands and 
confuses salvation and sanctification.</P>
<P>Jakes’ other obvious mistake is that he teaches that the authority, right or 
power, in John 1:12, is the authority and right of the believer to do something 
for himself. He misses entirely the clear thrust of John’s passage which is 
talking about God’s authority.</P>
<P>We can say we are saved, we can say we are sons of God if we’ve received 
Christ as John 1:12 indicates based on <I>God’s right, God’s power, God’s 
authority to declare that of us.</I> It is clear from this passage that God 
gives the right to every believer to be named as His sons and children.</P>
<P>The word “become” in the verse is not to be seen as tentative in any way but 
as declarative as to what we become by receiving Jesus as Savior. God’s 
prerogative, in John 1:12, does not become man’s prerogative no matter what 
Jakes says. Griffith Thomas, known throughout the Anglo-Saxon world as one of 
the great English scholars of modern times, conveys the thrust of verse 12: 
<I>“Having received Christ as ‘Word’ and ‘Light,’ we become sons of 
God.”</I><SUP>40</SUP></P>
<P>First John 5:12 assures us, “<I>He that has the Son has life.”</I> Romans 
10:17 reminds us, “<I>Whoever calls on the Name of the Lord shall be saved.”</I> 
Being saved, being sons, being a child of God, being born again, having received 
Christ, having faith in Christ, and being in Christ are really nuances of the 
same experience and standing. Receiving Christ puts us eternally “in Christ” as 
children and joint heirs. This privilege in Romans 8 is a position that has no 
condemnation, no amputation and no separation. Christ in us is the hope of glory 
as Colossians 1:27 announces.</P>
<P><I>The Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible</I> lays out the simple 
Biblical truth that seems to elude Jakes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“In the three Johannine epistles the figure of the child is brought to its 
  fulfillment with the repetition of the apostolic love for the Church in terms 
  of family endearment (1 John 3:10, et. al.). The legal proposition of 
  children, inheritance, adoption, illegitimacy and naming are all used <I>as 
  figures of the application of the Atonement</I> in the epistles (Gal 4:5; Eph 
  1:5; Phil 4:3; Heb 12:8; 1 Pet 1:4; et. al.)”<SUP>41</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus there are two “BVs” to choose from. The first, Bishop Velcro with his 
earthly mansions, his wealthy Rolex Jesus, his psychological trappings, the pep 
rallies, the questionable reading material and the truncated Gospel. Or the 
second BV, the old trustworthy BV — Bible verses — that tell us of mansions in 
glory, the man of sorrows, the provision of free grace with immediate and 
eternal sonship for desperate needy sinners who will in faith repent and receive 
Christ.</P>
<P>We must choose — the stakes are enormous — and eternal. Put away the Jakes 
materials and revisit the Bible. It will tell you the truth minus the 
velcro.<BR></P>
