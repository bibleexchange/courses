<P>WILMER, Texas&nbsp;—&nbsp;A bus carrying elderly evacuees from <B>Hurricane 
Rita</B> (<A href="javascript:siteSearch('Hurricane%20Rita');">search</A>) 
caught fire and then was rocked by explosions early Friday on a gridlocked 
highway near Dallas, killing as many as 24 people, authorities said.</P>
<P>"Deputies were unable to get everyone off the bus," <B>Dallas County 
Sheriff's Department</B> (<A 
href="javascript:siteSearch('Dallas%20County%20Sheriff&amp;#39;s Department');">search</A>) 
spokesman Don Peritz said. He said he believed 24 people were killed, but added 
that that number could change.</P>
<P>The bus was carrying 43 people who had been traveling since Thursday from a 
nursing home or managed-care facility near Houston, Peritz said.</P>
<P>Early indications were that the bus caught fire because of mechanical 
problems, setting off passengers' oxygen tanks, Peritz said. He said the brakes 
may have been on fire.</P>
<P>The bus was engulfed with flames, causing a lengthy backup on Interstate 45 
already congested with evacuees from the Gulf Coast. The bus was reduced to a 
blackened, burned-out shell, with large blue tarps covering the bodies. About 20 
emergency vehicles surrounded it.</P>
<P>Tina Jones, a nurse from Ennis, was driving behind the bus when she saw it 
start to smoke and pull to the side of the road.</P>
<P>"I saw the smoke and then there was an explosions," said Jones, who pulled 
over and helped treat cuts and bruises. She said she saw at least six dead 
bodies.</P>
<P>"I'll probably go home and have a good cry," she said.</P>
<P>Peritz said the driver survived and helped emergency workers try to save 
people, but that there wasn't much time before explosions ended rescue 
efforts.</P>
<P>"It's my understanding he went back on the bus several times to try to 
evacuate people," he said.</P>
<P>No emergency workers suffered major injuries in the blast.</P>
<P><B>Parkland Memorial Hospital</B> (<A 
href="javascript:siteSearch('Parkland%20Memorial%20Hospital');">search</A>) in 
Dallas has been told to expect nine patients, said hospital spokeswoman Candace 
White. The most severe cases involved smoke inhalation, she said.</P>
<P>Interstate 45 stretches more than 250 miles from Galveston through Houston to 
Dallas. The crash site is roughly 17 miles southeast of downtown Dallas.</P>
<P>Gov. Rick Perry spokeswoman Kathy Walt said traffic on I-45 would be diverted 
at Ennis, about 30 miles southeast of Dallas. Drivers could take State Highway 
287 west to Interstate 35E, or State Highway 34 east to Interstate 20. She said 
it was unclear how far the gridlock extended.</P>
<P>Authorities were taking the unusual step of moving the wreckage and continue 
investigating in to a remote location so the interstate could reopen for 
evacuees, Peritz said.</P>
<P>"You have thousands of people who are in their vehicles trying to escape," he 
said.</P>
<P>Nearly 2 million people along the Texas and Louisiana coasts were urged to 
get out of the way of Rita before it makes landfall late Friday or early 
Saturday.</P>
<P>On Friday morning, the freeways within Houston had cleared out, but it was 
still bumper-to-bumper traffic from the outskirts of Houston toward Austin and 
Dallas.</P>
