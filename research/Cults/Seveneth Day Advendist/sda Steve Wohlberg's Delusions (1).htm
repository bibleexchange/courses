  minister--a sinister minister--who denies many clear teachings of the Bible, 
  including: The Pretribulation Rapture, The Tribulation Period, the person of 
  the Antichrist, the restoration of Israel, and many other plain Bible 
  teachings.&nbsp; If fact, Mr. Wohlberg is so hateful of Biblical truth that

  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Yet, tragically, professed "Christians" all 
  around the world recognize Steve Wohlberg as a Christian, and happily sell his 
  damnable books.&nbsp; If God-hating, Bible-disobeying, Christ-rejecting Wiccan 
  witches <B>highly recommend</B> Mr. Wohlberg's books, something is VERY 
  WRONG!!!&nbsp; You see they are all on the same team--the Devil's team--so 
  they work together fighting against the truth of God's Word.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Steve Wohlberg is a heretic, who teaches the lies 
  of <I><A 
  href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Seventh-Day%20Adventist/hidden.htm">Seventh-Day 
  Adventism</A></I>, including the ridiculous and unbiblical theory of the <I><A 
  href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Seventh-Day%20Adventist/ij.htm">Investigative 
  Judgment</A></I> (a far fetched doctrine fabricated by Ellen G. White).&nbsp; 
  Occultist Ellen G. White, and others, officially founded SDA in <A 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church">1963</A>, 
  which was spawned as a result of a failed prophecy by a heretic named William 
  Miller.&nbsp; Miller predicted the Lord's return, and had set a date for 
  October 22, 1844.&nbsp; Followers of Miller sold their homes, quit their jobs, 
  and gave away all worldly possessions.&nbsp; There were an estimated 10,000 
  followers of Miller, known as "Millerites."&nbsp; When Miller's prediction 
  failed to come to fruition, people became suicidal.&nbsp; To save face, a 
  handful of Millerites scrambled to fabricate a cover for their blunder; thus, 
  SDA was born.&nbsp; This is the hilarious and yet tragic history upon which 
  the SDA Church was founded.&nbsp; This alone should cause every SDA to leave 
  their organization, and follow the Word of God instead!&nbsp; Jesus NEVER 
  started a religion; BUT, rather, commanded us to... SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES 
  (John 5:39). </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Just as with the damnable Catholic religion, SDAs 
  have fabricated their own TRADITIONS which are completely unbiblical, and go 
  100% contrary to the plainest teachings of the Bible.&nbsp; It is tragic that 
  the pastor's of America's largest <I>Independent Baptist Churches</I> are more 
  interested in writing books on finances, than on prophecy and the 
  Endtimes.&nbsp; The world is absolutely enamored with the subject of the end 
  times; yet the church is fast asleep.&nbsp; As a result, cult leaders and 
  shysters are propagating lies that receive raving reviews from witches and 
  other God-haters.&nbsp; Great men of God from the past, who have written 
  Biblically sound books on prophecy, are being silenced by greedy ministries 
  today, who hold the copyrights to the books, and couldn't care less about 
  anything other than making more money.&nbsp; The world is going to Hell 
  folks!&nbsp; We need reinforcements on the frontline!</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Steve Wohlberg is delusional, and a false 
  prophet.&nbsp; <I>Seventh-day Adventism</I> is a strange religion, that veers 
  considerably from the plain teachings of the Scriptures.&nbsp; SDAs believe in 
  soul sleep, as do the Jehovah's Witnesses.&nbsp; <I>Soul Sleep</I> is the 
  false doctrine that a person is unconscious after death, and remains in such a 
  state until a future resurrection.&nbsp; In sharp contrast, 2nd Corinthians 
  5:8 states... "<I>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent 
  from the body, and <B>to be present with the Lord</B>.</I>"&nbsp; Jesus told 
  the thief on the cross... "<I><B>Today</B> shalt thou be with me in 
  paradise</I>" (Luke 23:43).&nbsp; In Luke 16, Lazarus died and was <B>carried 
  by angels</B> into Paradise (i.e., Abraham's Bosom).&nbsp; Such Biblical 
  references are clear evidence against the false doctrine of <I>Soul 
  Sleep</I>.&nbsp; There is no break in conscience at death, for the spirit 
  cannot die physically.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Steve Wohlberg is a dangerous man, because he 
  APPEARS to be a Christian; BUT, he is a wolf in sheep's clothing (Mathew 
  7:15).&nbsp; Mr. Wohlberg's books and teachings are in popular demand--a clear 
  indicator of the apostasy of these last days.&nbsp; For a man to deny so many 
  fundamental teachings of the Scriptures, and still retain such a large 
  following, is disturbing indeed.&nbsp; Please do NOT be deceived--Steve 
  Wohlberg is <A href="http://www.templetonhills.com/history.html">a 
  <I>Seventh-Day Adventist</I> minister</A>, who adheres to the damnable 
  doctrine of the <I>Investigative Judgment</I>.&nbsp; He is NO Christian.&nbsp; 
  Contrary to Walter Martin's claim, in his book <I>The Kingdom of the 
  Cults</I>, SDA is NOT a Christian cult!&nbsp; SDAs clearly adhere to a 
  works-based salvation, which requires it's members to endure 'til the end to 
  be saved.&nbsp; This is a lie of the Devil, as evidenced by Scriptures such as 
  1st Corinthians 3:15 and 5:5 which show that some believers live in horrible 
  sin; YET, still go to Heaven. <BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

  <P align=left><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Here is a quote from Dr. John R. 
  Rice's excellent book, <I>FALSE DOCTRINES </I>(pg. 183), available from the <A 
  href="http://www.swordofthelord.com/">Sword of the Lord</A> (which I highly 
  recommend)...</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#00ff00 size=2>"In article 9 
    </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>(of 'What Seventh-Day Adventists 
    Believe')</FONT><FONT face=Verdana color=#00ff00 size=2>, it says, 'that 
    those who are truly converted and love God will diligently study, and give 
    heed to, His Word.'&nbsp; And they give eight Scripture references and none 
    of them say anything like that.&nbsp; The simple truth is that people who 
    are converted do not always 'diligently study' the Bible and do not always 
    obey it in many matters.&nbsp; This is a part of the doctrine of salvation 
    by works which they teach, and that one may keep saved by keeping on 
    working."</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Thank God for Dr. Rice's wisdom and 
  uncompromising stand for the truth!&nbsp; The Devil can't deceive us if we 
  shine the light of God's Word upon the darkness.&nbsp; As with most false 
  religions, SDAs talk out of both sides of their mouth.&nbsp; They say one 
  thing here, and then another over there.&nbsp; SDAs will swear on their 
  mother's grave that they believe in salvation by grace through faith in 
  Christ; BUT, then the writings of Ellen G. White, whom they ALL recognize as a 
  prophet inspired by God, contradicts their claims.&nbsp; Here again are the 
  words of Dr. John R. Rice, from his book <I>FALSE DOCTRINES</I> (Pg. 
  188)...</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT face=Verdana color=#00ff00 size=2>"Mrs. White, the 'prophetess' of 
    Seventh-Day Adventists, is quoted in their book, <I>Answers to 
    Objections</I>, by Francis D. Nichol (published by the Review and Herald 
    Publishing Association, Washington, D.C.), page 402, as saying:</FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana color=#00ff00 size=2>'Those who accept the Saviour, 
      however sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or to feel 
      that they are saved.&nbsp; This is misleading.&nbsp; Every one should be 
      taught to cherish hope and faith; but even when we give ourselves to 
      Christ and know that He accepts us, we are not beyond the reach of 
      temptation ... Only he who endures the trial will receive the crown of 
      life."</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Verdana color=#00ff00 size=2>"On page 409 </FONT><FONT 
    face=Verdana size=2>(of <I>Answers to Objections</I>) <FONT 
    color=#00ff00>Mr. Nichol says, speaking officially for Seventh-Day 
    Adventists:</FONT></FONT></P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana color=#00ff00 size=2>'Thus we escape on the one 
      hand, the false doctrine of Universalism; and on the other, the equally 
      false doctrine of claiming full and final salvation for a man before he 
      has endured 'unto the end.' "</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Clearly, SDAs teach that a person must "endure" 
  to the end to be guaranteed salvation in Christ.&nbsp; In contrast 1st John 
  5:13 states, "<B>These things have I written unto you that believe on the name 
  of the Son of God; that ye may <U>KNOW</U> that ye have eternal life, and that 
  ye may believe on the name of the Son of God</B>."&nbsp; We read in Romans 
  4:3, 5 that Abraham simply BELIEVED God, and was saved WITHOUT any works, 
  "<B>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted 
  unto him for righteousness ... But to him that <U>worketh not</U>, but 
  believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for 
  righteousness.</B>"&nbsp; There is NO mention of enduring to the end to be 
  saved.&nbsp; "Enduring" would be a work.&nbsp; Eternal life is a "FREE GIFT" 
  (Romans 5:15; 6:23), paid for by the precious blood of Christ (1st Peter 
  1:18,19).&nbsp; SDAs teach salvation by works when they require a person to 
  "endure unto the end" to be saved for certain.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Francis D. Nichol, in his book, <I>Answers to 
  Objections</I>, states on page 243...</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT face=Verdana color=#00ff00 size=2>"Here is our position: Only those 
    will be saved who, having been redeemed by the grace of Christ, walk in 
    obedience to all the light that God sheds on their 
  way."</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">This is the official Adventist position!&nbsp; 
  The above doctrine means that all SDA members must comply with ALL of the 
  requirements of the SDA church to be saved.&nbsp; So, according to SDA 
  doctrine, if you don't tithe, you're not saved.. if you don't keep the Sabbath 
  Day, you're not saved, etc.&nbsp; Jesus NEVER asked anyone to FOLLOW Him to be 
  saved; BUT, rather, only to BELIEVE on Him (John 3:16).&nbsp; Jesus never 
  asked anyone to work for salvation, only <U>believe</U> (Acts 
  16:31).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Steve Wohlberg is <B>delusional</B>, having 
  denied dozens of Biblical truths.&nbsp; Mr. Wohlberg even <U>denies</U> that 
  the Sabbath Day was specifically ordained by God as a Jewish ceremonial 
  law.&nbsp; SDA are also <A 
  href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Seventh-Day%20Adventist/sk.htm">Sabbath 
  Keepers</A>, another false doctrine.&nbsp; Steve Wohlberg <U>denies</U> the 
  literalness of the Bible--he denies the Pretribulation Rapture, the 
  Tribulation Period, the restoration of Israel, the coming Person of 
  Antichrist, et cetera.</FONT></P>
