            <P><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Preamble</B></P>
            <P>This statement is addressed to all members of the Seventh-day 
            Adventist Church with the purpose of providing guidelines on how to 
            study the Bible, both the trained biblical scholar and others.</P>
            <P>Seventh-day Adventists recognize and appreciate the contributions 
            of those biblical scholars throughout history who have 
            devel&shy;oped useful and reliable methods of Bible study consistent 
            with the claims and teachings of Scripture. Adventists are committed 
            to the acceptance of biblical truth and are willing to follow it, 
            using all methods of interpretation consistent with what Scripture 
            says of itself. These are outlined in the presuppositions 
            de&shy;tailed below.</P>
            <P>In recent decades the most prominent method in biblical studies 
            has been known as the historical-critical method. Scholars who use 
            this method, as classically formulated, op&shy;erate on the basis of 
            presuppositions which, prior to studying the biblical text, reject 
            the reliability of accounts of miracles and other supernatural 
            events narrated in the Bible. Even a modified use of this method 
            that retains the principle of criticism which subordinates the Bible 
            to human reason is unacceptable to Adventists.</P>
            <P>The historical-critical method minimizes the need for faith in 
            God and obedience to His commandments. In addition, because such a 
            method de-emphasizes the divine element in the Bible as an inspired 
            book (including its resultant unity) and depreciates or 
            misunder&shy;stands apocalyptic prophecy and the eschato&shy;logical 
            portions of the Bible, we urge Adventist Bible students to avoid 
            relying on the use of the presuppositions and the resultant 
            deductions associated with the historical-critical method.</P>
            <P>In contrast with the historical-critical method and 
            presuppositions, we believe it to be helpful to set forth the 
            principles of Bible study that are consistent with the teachings of 
            the Scriptures themselves, that preserve their unity, and are based 
            upon the premise that the Bible is the Word of God. Such an approach 
            will lead us into a satisfying and rewarding experience with 
God.</P>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible is the Word of God and is 
              the primary and authoritative means by which He reveals Himself to 
              human beings.</P>
              <P>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Spirit inspired the Bible 
              writ&shy;ers with thoughts, ideas, and objective information; in 
              turn they expressed these in their own words. Therefore the 
              Scriptures are an indivisible union of human and divine elements, 
              neither of which should be emphasized to the neglect of the other 
              (2Peter 1:21; cf. <I>The Great Controversy</I>, v, vi). 
            </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Scripture is inspired by God 
              and came through the work of the Holy Spirit. However, it did not 
              come in a continuous chain of unbroken revelations. As the Holy 
              Spirit communicated truth to the Bible writer, each wrote as he 
              was moved by the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the aspect of the truth 
              which he was led to stress. For this reason the student of the 
              Bible will gain a rounded comprehension on any subject by 
              recognizing that the Bible is its own best interpreter and when 
              studied as a whole it depicts a consistent, harmonious truth 
              (2Tim. 3:16; Heb. 1:1, 2; cf. <I>Selected Messages,</I> Book 1, 
              19, 20; <I>The Great Controversy,</I> v, vi).</P>
              <P>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it was given to those who 
              lived in an ancient Near Eastern/Mediterra&shy;nean context, the 
              Bible transcends its cultural backgrounds to serve as God's Word 
              for all cultural, racial, and situational contexts in all 
            ages.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Authority</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixty-six books of the Old and 
              New Testaments are the clear, infallible revelation of God's will 
              and His salvation. The Bible is the Word of God, and it alone is 
              the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested 
              (2Tim. 3:15, 17; Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20; John 
              17:17; 2Thess. 3:14; Heb. 4:12).</P>
              <P>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scripture is an authentic, reliable 
              record of history and God's acts in history. It provides the 
              normative theological interpretation of those acts. The 
              supernatural acts re&shy;vealed in Scripture are historically 
              true. For example, chapters 1-11 of Genesis are a factual account 
              of historical events.</P>
              <P>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible is not like other books. 
              It is an indivisible blend of the divine and the human. Its record 
              of many details of secular history is integral to its overall 
              purpose to convey salvation history. While at times there may be 
              parallel procedures employed by Bible students to determine 
              historical data, the usual techniques of historical research, 
              based as they are on human presuppositions and focused on the 
              human element, are inadequate for interpreting the Scriptures, 
              which are a blend of the divine and human. Only a method that 
              fully recognizes the indivisible nature of the Scriptures can 
              avoid a distortion of its message.</P>
              <P>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human reason is subject to the 
              Bible, not equal to or above it. Presuppositions re&shy;garding 
              the Scriptures must be in harmony with the claims of the 
              Scriptures and subject to correction by them (1Cor. 2:1-6). God 
              intends that human reason be used to its fullest extent, but 
              within the context and under the authority of His Word rather than 
              independent of it.</P>
              <P>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The revelation of God in all 
              nature, when properly understood, is in harmony with the written 
              Word, and is to be interpreted in the light of 
            Scripture.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

            Principles for Approaching the &shy;Interpretation of 
            Scripture</B></P>
            <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            Spirit enables the believer to accept, understand, and apply the 
            Bible to one's own life as he seeks divine power to render obedience 
            to all scriptural requirements and to appropriate personally all 
            Bible promises. Only those following the light already received can 
            hope to receive further illumination of the Spirit (John 16:13, 14; 
            1Cor. 2:10-14).</P><BR clear=all>
            <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Scripture cannot be correctly interpreted without the aid of the 
            Holy Spirit, for it is the Spirit who enables the believer to 
            un&shy;derstand and apply Scripture. Therefore, any study of the 
            Word should commence with a request for the Spirit's guidance and 
            illumination.</P>
            <P>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those 
            who come to the study of the Word must do so with faith, in the 
            humble spirit of a learner who seeks to hear what the Bible is 
            saying. They must be willing to submit all presuppositions, 
            opinions, and the conclusions of reason to the judgment and 
            correction of the Word itself. With this attitude the Bible student 
            may come directly to the Word, and with careful study may come to an 
            understanding of the essentials of salvation apart from any 
            hu&shy;man explanations, however helpful. The biblical message 
            becomes meaningful to such a person.</P>
            <P>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            investigation of Scripture must be characterized by a sincere desire 
            to discover and obey God's will and word rather than to seek support 
            or evidence for preconceived ideas.</P>
            <P><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Methods of Bible Study</B></P>
            <P>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select a 
            Bible version for study that is faithful to the meaning contained in 
            languages in which the Bible originally was written, giving 
            preference to translations done by a broad group of scholars and 
            published by a general publisher above translations sponsored by a 
            particular denomination or narrowly focused group.</P>
            <P>Exercise care not to build major doctrinal points on one Bible 
            translation or version. Trained biblical scholars will use the Greek 
            and Hebrew texts, enabling them to examine vari&shy;ant readings of 
            ancient Bible manuscripts as well.</P>
            <P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose a 
            definite plan of study, avoiding haphazard and aimless approaches.

            <P>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek to 
            grasp the simple, most obvious meaning of the biblical passage being 
            studied.</P>
            <P>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek to 
            discover the underlying major themes of Scripture as found in 
            individual texts, passages, and books. Two basic, related themes run 
            throughout Scripture: (1)The person and work of Jesus Christ; and 
            (2)the great controversy perspective involving the author&shy;ity of 
            God's Word, the fall of man, the first and second advents of Christ, 
            the exoneration of God and His law, and the restoration of the 
            divine plan for the universe. These themes are to be drawn from the 
            totality of Scripture and not imposed on it.</P>
            <P>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Recognize that the Bible is its own interpreter and that the meaning 
            of words, texts, and passages is best determined by diligently 
            comparing scripture with scripture.</P>
            <P>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study 
            the context of the passage under consideration by relating it to the 
            sentences and paragraphs immediately preceding and following it. Try 
            to relate the ideas of the passage to the line of thought of the 
            entire Bible book.</P><BR clear=all>
            <P>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as possible 
            ascertain the historical circumstances in which the passage was 
            written by the biblical writers under the guid&shy;ance of the Holy 
            Spirit.</P>
            <P>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Determine the literary type the author is using. Some biblical 
            material is composed of parables, proverbs, allegories, psalms, and 
            apocalyptic prophecies. Since many biblical writers presented much 
            of their material as poetry, it is helpful to use a version of the 
            Bible that presents this material in poetic style, for passages 
            employing imagery are not to be interpreted in the same manner as 
            prose.</P>
            <P>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Recognize that a given biblical text may not conform in every detail 
            to present-day lit&shy;erary categories. Be cautious not to force 
            these categories in interpreting the meaning of the biblical text. 
            It is a human tendency to find what one is looking for, even when 
            the author did not intend such.</P>
            <P>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take 
            note of grammar and sentence construction in order to discover the 
            author's meaning. Study the key words of the passage by comparing 
            their use in other parts of the Bible by means of a concordance and 
            with the help of biblical lexicons and dictionaries.</P>
            <P>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the 
            study of the biblical text, explore the historical and cultural 
            factors. Archaeology, anthropology, and history may contribute to 
            understanding the meaning of the text.</P>
            <P>l.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Seventh-day Adventists believe that God inspired Ellen G. White. 
            Therefore, her expositions on any given Bible passage offer an 
            inspired guide to the meaning of texts without exhausting their 
            meaning or preempting the task of exegesis (for example, see 
            <I>Evangelism, </I>256; <I>The Great Controversy,</I> 193, 595; 
            <I>Testi&shy;monies,</I> vol. 5, pp. 665, 682, 707-708; <I>Counsels 
            to Writers and Editors,</I> 33-35).</P>
            <P>m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 
            studying as outlined above, turn to various commentaries and 
            secondary helps such as scholarly works to see how others have dealt 
            with the passage. Then carefully evaluate the different viewpoints 
            expressed from the standpoint of Scripture as a whole.</P>
            <P>n.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In interpreting prophecy 
            keep in mind that:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible claims God's power to 
              pre&shy;dict the future (Isa 46:10).</P>
              <P>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophecy has a moral purpose. It 
              was not written merely to satisfy curiosity about the future. Some 
              of the purposes of prophecy are to strengthen faith (John 14:29) 
              and to pro&shy;mote holy living and readiness for the Advent (Matt 
              24:44; Rev 22:7, 10, 11).</P>
              <P>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of much prophecy is on 
              Christ (both His first and second advents), the church, and the 
              end-time.</P>
              <P>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The norms for interpreting prophecy 
              are found within the Bible itself: The Bible notes time prophecies 
              and their historical fulfillments; the New Testament cites 
              specific fulfillments of Old Testament prophecies about the 
              Messiah; and the Old Testament itself pre&shy;sents individuals 
              and events as types of the Messiah.</P>
              <P>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the New Testament application of 
              Old Testament prophecies, some literal names become spiritual: for 
              example, Israel represents the church, Babylon apostate religion, 
              etc.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR clear=all>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two general types of 
              pro&shy;phetic writings: nonapocalyptic prophecy as found in 
              Isaiah and Jeremiah, and apocalyptic prophecy as found in Daniel 
              and the Revelation. These differing types have different 
              char&shy;acteristics:</P>
              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <P>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonapocalyptic 
                prophecy addresses God's people; apocalyptic is more universal 
                in scope.</P>
                <P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonapocalyptic 
                prophecy often is conditional in nature, setting forth to God's 
                peo&shy;ple the alternatives of blessing for obedience and 
                curses for disobedience; apocalyptic emphasizes the sovereignty 
                of God and His control over history.</P>
                <P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonapocalyptic 
                prophecy often leaps from the local crisis to the end-time day 
                of the Lord; apocalyptic prophecy presents the course of history 
                from the time of the prophet to the end of the world.</P>
                <P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time prophecies in 
                nonapocalyptic prophecy generally are long, for example, 400 
                years of Israel's servitude (Gen. 15:13) and 70 years of 
                Babylonian captivity (Jer. 25:12). Time prophecies in 
                apocalyptic prophecy generally are phrased in short terms, for 
                example, 10 days (Rev. 2:10) or 42 months (Rev. 13:5). 
                Apocalyptic time periods stand symbolically for longer periods 
                of actual time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apocalyptic prophecy is highly 
              symbolic and should be interpreted accordingly. In interpreting 
              symbols, the following methods may be used:</P>
              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <P>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look for 
                interpretations (explicit or implicit) within the passage itself 
                (for example, Dan. 8:20, 21; Rev. 1:20).</P>
                <P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look for 
                interpretations elsewhere in the book or in other writings by 
                the same author.</P>
                <P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a concordance, 
                study the use of symbols in other parts of Scripture.</P>
                <P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study of ancient 
                Near Eastern docu&shy;ments may throw light on the meaning of 
                symbols, although scriptural use may alter those 
              meanings.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The literary structure of a book 
              often is an aid to interpreting it. The parallel nature of 
              Daniel's prophecies is an example.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>o.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel 
            accounts in Scripture sometimes present differences in detail and 
            emphasis (for example, cf. Matt 21:33, 34; Mark 12:1-11; and Luke 
            20:9-18; or 2Kings 18-20 with 2Chron. 32). When studying such 
            passages, first examine them carefully to be sure that the parallels 
            actually are referring to the same historical event. For example, 
            many of Jesus' parables may have been given on different occasions 
            to different audiences and with different wording.</P>
            <P>In cases where there appear to be differences in parallel 
            accounts, one should recognize that the total message of the Bible 
            is the synthesis of all of its parts. Each book or writer 
            communicates that which the Spirit has led him to write. Each makes 
            his own special contribution to the richness, diversity, and variety 
            of Scripture (<I>The Great Controversy,</I> v, vi). The reader must 
            allow each Bible writer to emerge and be heard while at the same 
            time recognizing the basic unity of the divine 
            self-disclosure.</P><BR clear=all>
            <P>When parallel passages seem to indicate &shy;discrepancy or 
            contradiction, look for the underlying harmony. Keep in mind that 
            dissimi&shy;larities may be due to minor errors of copyists 
            (<I>Selected Messages,</I> Book 1, p. 16), or may be the result of 
            differing emphases and choice of materials of various authors who 
            wrote under the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit for 
            different audiences under different circum&shy;stances (<I>Selected 
            Messages,</I> Book 1, pp. 21, 22; <I>The Great Controversy,</I> 
            vi).</P>
            <P>It may prove impossible to reconcile minor dissimilarities in 
            detail which may be irrelevant to the main and clear message of the 
            passage. In some cases judgment may have to be suspended until more 
            information and better evidence are available to resolve a seeming 
            discrepancy.</P>
            <P>p.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            Scriptures were written for the practical purpose of revealing the 
            will of God to the human family. However, in order not to 
            misconstrue certain kinds of statements, it is important to 
            recognize that they were addressed to peoples of Eastern cultures 
            and expressed in their thought patterns.</P>
            <P>Expressions such as "the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh" (Ex. 
            9:12) or "an evil spirit from God..." (1Sam 16:15), the imprecatory 
            psalms, or the "three days and three nights" of Jonah as compared 
            with Christ's death (Matt. 12:40), commonly are misunderstood 
            because they are interpreted today from a different viewpoint.</P>
            <P>A background knowledge of Near Eastern culture is indispensable 
            for understanding such expressions. For example, Hebrew culture 
            attributed responsibility to an individual for acts he did not 
            commit but that he allowed to happen. Therefore the inspired writers 
            of the Scriptures commonly credit God with do&shy;ing actively that 
            which in Western thought we would say He permits or does not prevent 
            from happening, for example, the hardening of Pha&shy;raoh's 
            heart.</P>
            <P>Another aspect of Scripture that troubles the modern mind is the 
            divine command to Isra&shy;el to engage in war and execute entire 
            nations. Israel originally was organized as a the&shy;ocracy, a 
            civil government through which God ruled directly (Gen. 18:25). Such 
            a theocratic state was unique. It no longer exists and cannot be 
            regarded as a direct model for Christian practice.</P>
            <P>The Scriptures record that God accepted persons whose experiences 
            and statements were not in harmony with the spiritual principles of 
            the Bible as a whole. For example, we may cite incidents relating to 
            the use of alco&shy;hol, polygamy, divorce, and slavery. Although 
            condemnation of such deeply ingrained social customs is not 
            explicit, God did not &shy;necessarily endorse or approve all that 
            He permitted and bore with in the lives of the patriarchs and in 
            Israel. Jesus made this clear in His statement with regard to 
            divorce (Matt 19:4-6, 8).</P>
            <P>The spirit of the Scriptures is one of restoration. God works 
            patiently to elevate fallen hu&shy;manity from the depths of sin to 
            the divine ideal. Consequently, we must not accept as models the 
            actions of sinful men as recorded in the Bible.</P>
            <P>The Scriptures represent the unfolding of God's revelation to 
            man. Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, for example, enlarges and expands 
            certain Old Testament concepts. Christ Himself is the ultimate 
            revelation of God's character to humanity (Heb. 1:1-3).</P><BR 
            clear=all>
            <P>While there is an overarching unity in the Bible from Genesis to 
            Revelation, and while all Scripture is equally inspired, God chose 
            to reveal Himself to and through human indi&shy;viduals and to meet 
            them where they were in terms of spiritual and intellectual 
            endowments. God Himself does not change, but He progressively 
            unfolded His revelation to men as they were able to grasp it (John 
            16:12; <I>The SDA Bible Commentary, </I>vol .7, p. 945; <I>Selected 
            Messages,</I> Book 1, p. 21). Every experience or statement of 
            Scripture is a divinely inspired record, but not every statement or 
            experience is necessarily normative for Christian behavior today. 
            Both the spirit and the letter of Scripture must be understood 
            (1Cor. 10:6-13; <I>The Desire of Ages,</I> 150; <I>Testimonies,</I> 
            vol. 4, pp. 10-12).</P>
            <P>q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the final goal, make 
            application of the text. Ask such questions as, "What is the message 
            and purpose God intends to convey through Scripture?" "What meaning 
            does this text have for me?" "How does it apply to my situation and 
            circumstances today?" In doing so, recognize that although many 
            biblical passages had local significance, nonetheless they contain 
            timeless principles applicable to every age and culture.</P>

            Conclusion</B></P>
            <P>In the "Introduction" to <I>The Great Controversy</I> Ellen G. 
            White wrote:</P>
            <P>The Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in the language of 
            men, pre&shy;sents a union of the divine and the hu&shy;man. Such a 
            union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of God and 
            the Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of Christ, 
            that "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." John 1:14. (p. 
            vi)</P>
            <P>As it is impossible for those who do not &shy;accept Christ's 
            divinity to understand the purpose of His incarnation, it is also 
            impossible for those who see the Bible merely as a human book to 
            understand its message, however careful and rigorous their 
            methods.</P>
            <P>Even Christian scholars who accept the di&shy;vine-human nature 
            of Scripture, but whose methodological approaches cause them to 
            dwell largely on its human aspects, risk emptying the biblical 
            message of its power by relegating it to the background while 
            concentrating on the medium. They forget that medium and message are 
            inseparable and that the medium without the message is as an empty 
            shell that cannot address the vital spiritual needs of 
            hu&shy;mankind.</P>
            <P>A committed Christian will use only those methods that are able 
            to do full justice to the dual, inseparable nature of Scripture, 
            enhance his ability to understand and apply its message, and 
            strengthen faith.</P>
