      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>Sabbath observance was a memorial of 
      creation (Exodus 31:16-17). Later, it was a memorial of Israel’s 
      deliverance from Egyptian slavery (Deuteronomy 5:15). And in the New 
      Testament it was fulfilled by Jesus in the rest we have in Christ (Hebrews 
      4). Here we see that throughout history it was celebrated for different 
      reasons: first, creation; second, the exodus from Egypt and third our rest 
      in Christ. “Wicked are like a troubled see that cannot rest but casts up 
      mire and dirt” (Isaiah 57:20).</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>“Don’t judge in <B>meat, drink</B> or 
      <B>Sabbaths</B> that are a <B><FONT color=#ff0000>shadow</FONT></B>, a 
      symbol, of the reality found in Christ” (Col.2:16,17). At an airport, a 
      large shadow crossed my path. Looking up, I saw a jumbo jet, something 
      greater than its shadow, coming in for a landing. The Sabbath rest was a 
      shadow of Jesus who was to come and give us eternal rest (Hebrews 4). 
      Dietary laws were fulfilled by the Bread of Life, Jesus. Adventists put 
      all emphasis on symbols and forget what they symbolize. Pharisee means 
      “separate.” They were separated by clothes, food and days and also from 
      sinners but Jesus was a friend of 
      sinners.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>God told Israel to keep the Passover <B>forever</B> (Exodus 12:14). 
      Jesus <B>fulfilled</B> it for he is our Passover lamb sacrificed for us (1 
      Cor. 5:7). The Passover feast continues today in a <B>different form</B>, 
      the communion service, with grape juice as a symbol of his blood (1 Cor. 
      11:25). </FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>The children of Israel were told to keep the Sabbath <B>forever</B> 
      as a memorial of their deliverance from Egypt (Deut. 5:15). The Sabbath 
      continues today in a <B>different form</B>, our rest in Christ 
      (Heb.4:1-12; Matt.11:28,29). Adventists in the shadows, adhere to symbols 
      not knowing what they symbolize. The Sabbath points to Jesus not to a day 
      on the calendar but in remembrance of Israel’s deliverance from Egypt by 
      the Passover Lamb, Jesus (Deut. 5:15). Here we see it is not a legalistic 
      prescription to relax on a certain day but like the Passover it is a 
      celebration of a Person, Jesus, the substance that fulfills the 
      symbol.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>Come out of shadows into the Light. There is a vast difference 
      between abolishing law and fulfilling it. Love fulfills the law. If you 
      love someone you will not kill him. “You shall not kill [murder]” is 
      fulfilled in this way. True love protects the innocent so it is within the 
      law to have police and armies to subdue criminals and murderous nations. 
      Rulers do not bear the sword in vain (Romans 13:4). We must distinguish 
      between killing and murder. Some think the moral law was abolished but 
      have a rude awakening in jail after they are caught. It was written in our 
      conscience long before the time of Moses (Romans 2:14,15). “Whosoever 
      sheds man’s blood by man shall his blood be shed” (Genesis 9:6). Civil, 
      dietary, and ceremonial laws were fulfilled. Adventists are like Jews and 
      others who keep feasts and Sabbaths not realizing they was fulfilled.

      size=2>Revelation 12:17 is a key verse in 
      Adventism:</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>“The dragon was wroth with the woman and 
      went to make war with the remnant of her seed which <FONT

      of Jesus Christ.”</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>How do we know what commandments John is 
      referring to in the above verse? Is it the “eternal ten” from the Old 
      Testament or the two Jesus gave, <FONT color=#ff0000>“Love God and love 
      your neighbour?”</FONT> (Matt. 22:36-40). The only way to accurately 
      interpret Scripture is to see what the Bible says about itself. John wrote 
      Revelation and also four other Bible books. Read his words in 
      1</FONT><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt" size=1><SUP> </SUP></FONT><FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>John 
      3:23,24:</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2><FONT color=#ff0000>“...keep his commandments...and this is His 
      commandment that we should believe on his Son, Jesus, and love one 
      another.”</FONT> This is God, the Father, commanding us to believe on his 
      Son. <FONT color=#ff0000>“And this commandment we have from Him that he 
      who loves God loves his brother also” </FONT>(1 John 4:21). Revelation 
      22:12-14 tells of Jesus and to “keep his 
      commandments.”</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>There are moral, civil and ceremonial laws. 
      Moral aspects of the law such as “do not steal or murder” are universal 
      today in dealing with lawless people (1 Timothy 1:9). With God’s love in 
      our hearts we don’t need laws to restrain us from murdering our 
      neighbours. We treat them the way we want them to treat us. Legalism 
      refers to ceremonial laws concerning days, diets, dress codes and other 
      things pertaining to works, culture and outward appearance. Under the law 
      people were put to death for working on the Sabbath and were forbidden to 
      light a fire so were out of luck if they had a gas or wood stove. “We are 
      ministers of the New Testament for the ministration of <B>death</B> 
      engraved in stones was done away” (2 Cor. 
      3:6,7).</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>“The sign or seal of God is revealed in the observance of the 
      seventh day Sabbath, the Lord’s memorial of creation...the mark of the 
      beast [666] is the opposite-- the observance of the first day of the week. 
      This mark distinguishes those who acknowledge the supremacy of papal 
      authority from those who acknowledge the authority of God.”</FONT><FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt" 
      size=1><SUP>5</SUP></FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>They teach that Sabbath observance is “the 
      seal of God” that separates them from Sunday observers who are followers 
      of the beast. This is fiction for circumcision of the flesh was the sign 
      and seal of righteousness in the Old Testament (Rom. 4:11) and was a 
      symbol that was fulfilled by heart circumcision. God requires a 
      “circumcision inwardly of the heart” (Rom. 2:28,29). The Holy Spirit is 
      the seal in the new covenant (Eph. 4:30). If Sunday implies sun worship 
      then Saturday speaks of Saturn worship!</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>Their harsh judgment is the lake of 
      fire for not observing the Sabbath. If Sabbath breaking is such a deadly 
      sin, why is it never included in any New Testament list of sins and why is 
      its observance not mentioned for gentiles in the New Testament? Neither 
      the Pope nor anyone else changed the Saturday Sabbath. On Sunday we 
      celebrate Christ’s resurrection.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>Blood of animals covered sin in Old 
      Testament times. A <FONT color=#ff0000>post-dated cheque</FONT> does not 
      erase a debt but <FONT color=#ff0000>covers</FONT> it until a certain date 
      when money is deposited in the bank. In like manner, animal blood covered 
      sin until, figuratively speaking, money was in the bank at Calvary where 
      Jesus paid it all. He paid a debt he did not owe since we owed a debt we 
      could not pay.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>The old covenant had blood of animals but 
      the new has the blood of Jesus (Luke 22:19,20). The wicked are like a 
      troubled sea that cannot rest but the weekly Sabbath is fulfilled when we 
      enter God’s rest for our souls by faith in Christ (Heb. 4). In our church 
      we have Saturday and Sunday meetings.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>Most Christians celebrate Christ’s 
      resurrection by worshipping on Sunday (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2). Choose the 
      day of worship and diet you prefer and accept those <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>weak in faith</FONT> who eat only vegetables (Romans 
      14:1-6). “Nothing is unclean of itself but to you it is unclean if you 
      think so” (Rom.14:14). Eat fish! Jesus ate the Passover meal of lamb, 
      multiplied fish and fed thousands (John 6). They ate roast beef when the 
      prodigal son came home (Luke 15). “No food should be refused if it is 
      received with thanksgiving and sanctified by the word of God and prayer” 
      (1 Tim. 4:1-5). </FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>No meats that enter our stomachs can defile 
      us but evil thoughts and other things that come out of our hearts defile 
      us (Mark 7:18-23). Keep in mind that the best way to become fat is to eat 
      fat for it goes from lip to hip. It is suicidal to smoke or overeat. If 
      you become like a Buddha, a blimp or a sumo wrestler you will not be able 
      to move and exercise to lose weight. Do smokers get to heaven 
      sooner?</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>Many sinned without the law (Rom. 2:12). The moral law makes sin 
      known but cannot forgive. You could drive 100 miles an hour down main 
      street and not be charged unless a law limited speed. We have all broken 
      God’s moral laws but Jesus paid our death penalty on the cross.

      size=2>Disciples <B>preached Jesus</B> <B>Christ</B> in the <B>temple</B> 
      and in every house every day of the week (Acts 5:42). They entered the 
      temple to preach Jesus not to observe the Sabbath. Jesus knew there would 
      be non-Christian Jews that would flee to the mountains during tribulation 
      of the last days so he said to pray their flight would not be on the 
      Sabbath (Matt. 24). “What is the purpose of the law? It was added because 
      of transgressions <B>UNTIL</B> the seed [Christ] should come” (Galatians 
      3:19). Jesus was “wounded for our transgressions” (Isaiah 
      53:5).</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>Paul, a Pharisee, was not a Christian but blameless as far as the 
      law was concerned (Philippians. 3:1-14). Moses taught the ten 
      commandments: <FONT color=#ff0000>“The Lord did not make this covenant 
      with our fathers but with us”</FONT> (Deut. 5:3-23). From creation to 
      Moses there was no command to observe the Sabbath. Adam transgressed the 
      command “You shall not eat” not the ten. Noah obeyed the command to build 
      the ark. Legalists are self-righteous control freaks who suffocate you in 
      a straitjacket of external demands. </FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>Seventh Day Adventists with tunnel 
      vision think the Old Covenant is primarily the 10 commandments but that is 
      only a small part of it. The main difference concerns the blood of bulls 
      and goats versus the blood of Christ, a better Priesthood, Jesus, and we 
      become the temple (Hebrews chapters 9 &amp; 10; 1 Cor. 
      3:16)..</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>Herbert W. Armstrong’s <I>Worldwide Church of God</I> was strong on 
      Sabbath and feast keeping. After his death, church leaders became 
      Christians and now even the <I>Plain Truth </I>magazine tells the truth. 
      His son, Garner Ted Armstrong in Texas, and many splinter groups continue 
      to flounder as they flog their founder’s errors. Those in Judaism seek 
      enlightenment by keeping 630 laws or through social improvement but remain 
      in darkness waiting for the first coming of the Messiah but we expect his 
      second coming. Many in Messianic Judaism recognize Jesus as the promised 
      Messiah. The Bible tells precisely when he will come, when you least 
      expect him like a thief in the night (2 Peter 3:10).</FONT><BR>

      who created all things (John 1:3). People are alive and conscious and 
      their existence is not interrupted during sleep. After death, the rich man

      resurrection we receive glorified, visible bodies of flesh and bones 
      (Phil. 3:21). When Jesus returns with his saints, souls and resurrected 
      bodies reunite (1 Thess. 3:13). “Graves (<I>mnamei </I>in Greek) were 
      opened and <FONT color=#ff0000>bodies of saints</FONT> that slept arose” 
      (Matt. 27:52). Notice that bodies slept not souls. Hell is not the grave

      Jehovah’s Witnesses, claim they are the only true church, the remnant, and

      hypocritically beholding a speck in another’s eye with a beam in yours

      anger and enables us to turn the other cheek. It’s easy to act like angels 
      if others don’t ruffle our feathers. Anger, like acid, does most harm to 
      the container it is in. It is hard to let your light shine after blowing a

      me a sinner” and was justified (Luke 18:10-14). The Pharisee, clad in rags 
      of self-righteousness, compared himself with the publican. We fall short 
      when we compare ourselves with the holiness of God. We need “the 
      <B>gift</B> of righteousness” from Jesus Christ also called “the 
      breastplate of righteousness” (Rom. 5:17; Eph.

      they are sinless but they sin less and less. They will be judged in the 
      last day on the basis of Christ’s perfect imputed righteousness not the 
      kind that comes from the law. If all their works are burned up they will 
      be saved (1 Cor. 3:15). Robes of fine, white linen are symbolic of 
      righteousness of Christians (Rev.19:8). Pray: Jesus, forgive my sins. I 
      accept you as my Saviour from sin, and you will be given the gift of

      Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30). The word “<B>finished</B>” is

      merchants on bills of sale. “Not one jot or tittle shall pass from the law 
      <B>UNTIL</B> all be fulfilled” (Matt. 5:18). We owed a debt we could not 
      pay but Jesus paid a debt he did not owe. “The work of God is to believe 
      in Jesus” (John 6:28,29). We can save the dollar but it can’t save us. 
      Jesus saves from sin (Mat.1:21). Never mind Rock &amp; Roll; get Jesus in 
      your soul! Working out salvation that was not worked in first is like 
      working water out of a dry sponge (Phil.

      stone. The first commandment was to have no other gods but at the base of 
      the mountain Israelites already had a golden calf. Moses in anger broke 
      the tablets by throwing them to the ground. Picture in your mind these 
      lawbreakers, like us, standing before the broken law with a false god. 
      Their only hope was the future coming of Christ. Moses made animal 
      sacrifices and the blood covered their sins. Old Testament people looked 
      forward in faith to Calvary for salvation but we look back to the same 
      place where Jesus died for our sins (1 Cor.

      for a righteous man but a schoolmaster to bring sinners to Christ (1 Tim. 
      1:9-16). We see ourselves as sinners when we look into the mirror of the

      our sins we are born again, born of the Spirit from above and 
      <B>adopted</B> into His family. With birth must come growth so we should 
      grow in grace and in the knowledge of God. We start out as babes in Christ

      most the first step to becoming a Christian is the church step for it was 
      there they heard of Jesus and accepted him as Saviour. No church can save 
      us from our sins but they can point us to the Saviour. Unitarians cannot

      <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>People have <B>visible</B> and 
      <B>invisible</B> sins. Pride and unbelief are not visible like 
      drunkenness, murder and adultery. Sins of omission are the good works we 
      fail to do. Pride says, “I am a good person able to stand on my own two 
      feet, not a sinner who needs a Saviour.” Cemeteries are proof that we will 
      not always stand on our own. Sin is like a disease with many 
      <B>symptoms</B>. Mine might be pride or unbelief and yours drunkenness. 
      The human race is <B>suicidal</B> and does not need Dr. Kevorkian’s 
      suicide machine. We kill ourselves with cars, alcohol, drugs, stress and 
      cigarettes. Some think they will get to heaven sooner by smoking or 
      drinking?</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>Many quote the <I>Golden Rule</I> spoken by Jesus in Matthew 7:12: 
      “<B><FONT color=#ff0000>Do</FONT></B> unto others as you want them to 
      <B><FONT color=#ff0000>DO</FONT></B> unto you.” It is a vain attempt to 
      lift themselves by their own shoe laces. Jesus’ death for our sins is 
      unnecessary if we can get to heaven by <B>doing</B> and <B>behaving</B> 
      rather than <B>believing</B> the gospel. We are not saved from our sins by 
      works we <B><FONT color=#ff0000>DO</FONT></B> but by what Jesus has 
      <B><FONT color=#ff0000>DONE</FONT></B> for us at Calvary. Salvation is a 
      free <B>gift</B> not of works (Ephesians 2:8-10). A gift is bought by 
      others and freely received. Adam and Even sinned in Eden then covered 
      themselves with fig leaves which is symbolic of salvation by human effort. 
      Jesus cursed the fig tree. God made coats of skins and clothed them which 
      pointed to the future sacrifice of Christ to forgive sins (Genesis 
      3:21).</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>When Jesus taught the <I>Golden Rule</I> in Matthew 7:12, he was 
      speaking disciples who were already Christians. His sermon gave 
      instructions on how to treat others. We are not saved <B>by</B> good works 
      but <B>for</B> good works. Even atheists can do good 
      works.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>Imagine walking in a flower garden with a blind person trying to 
      explain to him the beautiful sight. Non-Christians are mentally blinded by 
      sin and spiritually dead. In Greek, <I>bios</I> refers to natural life and 
      <I>zoe</I> refers to eternal spiritual life. Artificial flowers look real 
      but they have no life. The death rate is <B>one per person</B> and we are 
      one heartbeat from eternity. Accept Christ’s forgiveness and your name 
      will be written in the <I>Lamb’s Book of Life</I>. Pray, God be merciful 
      to me a sinner. I accept you, Jesus, as my Saviour. Forgive my sins, 
      Amen.</FONT><BR>

      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>A centuries old debate continues among 
      Christians. Both groups agree the free gift of salvation comes through 
      faith in Christ apart from works but the disagreement concerns whether or 
      not one can lose salvation. </FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>Think of Christianity as <I>The good Ship 
      Grace</I>. Followers of <B>Arminius</B> say you lose salvation and fall 
      <B>overboard</B> when you persist in sinning. Calvinists say you fall 
      <B>on board</B> the ship and are eternally secure. They say a person 
      cannot be born again and again. Sin breaks our communion with God not our 
      union. A disobedient child is still a son or daughter of his earthly 
      father and the same applies to his heavenly Father. They further say that 
      if one continues in sin he has <B>said faith</B> not <B>saving faith</B>. 
      “They draw near with their lips but their hearts are far from me” (Isaiah 
      29:13). </FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" 
      size=2>Calvin emphasized God’s sovereignty and Arminius stressed human 
      free will. In extreme Calvinism all is predetermined so some are doomed 
      from the womb to the tomb with no power to choose. They are puppets with 
      God as a puppeteer. Most find middle ground between the sovereignty of God 
      and our responsibility. Jesus would have gathered Jerusalem as a hen 
      gathers her chicks but they “<FONT color=#0000ff>WOULD NOT” </FONT>(Matt. 
      23:37). He did not say they <FONT color=#0000ff>COULD 
      NOT</FONT>.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>A southern gospel preacher explained 
      <B>election</B>: “Both God and the devil vote for you but, with free will, 
      you cast the deciding vote for the one you want to serve.” Blind leaders 
      pretend to know the sequence of last days events. Jesus said, “It is not 
      for you to know” (Acts 1:7). Our vision of the future is like “looking 
      through a dark glass...we know and prophesy in part” (1 Cor.13:9-12). We 
      see some mountain peaks in prophecy but valleys are obscure. The debate on 
      whether the earth is young or old is a secondary issue and does not affect 
      our salvation.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2><B>Pre-destination</B> means God, with his 
      foreknowledge, knows our eternal <B>destination</B> ahead of time. He 
      knows in advance the bad things that will come our way but he does not 
      cause them to happen. Whether we go to heaven or hell depends on our 
      choices. The same sun that melts butter hardens clay. Some hearts become 
      hardened by the gospel while others receive it with gladness and turn from 
      their sins. What about forgiving people who have wronged us? “Rebuke them 
      and if they say, ‘I repent,’ forgive them” (Luke 17:3,4; 15:11-32; 
      18:10-14). There is no forgiveness without repentance.</FONT><BR><FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where did Cain get 
      his wife?” is an often asked question. Adam lived 930 years and begat sons 
      and daughters (Genesis 5:4,5). Just imagine how big a family, including 
      great, great, great grandchildren, Adam and Eve had after almost 1,000 
      years! The genetic code was not corrupted until the time of Moses, 1500 
      BC., so there was no incest. From that time marriage of relatives was 
      forbidden (Leviticus 18). Apostate, Bishop Spong, said, “Christianity must 
      change or die.” Man has not changed but remains a sinner in need of the 
      same salvation so why should Christianity change? Spong must get back to 
      the gospel that saves and have a change of heart. The Episcopal church has 
      gone into total apostasy including same-sex marriage similar to the 
      Anglican Church in Canada with Bishop Ingham.</FONT><BR><FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Bible 
      condone slavery? In Bible days people volunteered as slaves to work off 
      debts just as we are slaves to Visa and Master Card. Slaves were not held 
      against their will as in the days of U.S. President, Abraham Lincoln. God 
      used Moses and blood of the Passover lamb to free Jewish slaves in 
      Egypt.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt" size=2>1.Schaff-Herzog
