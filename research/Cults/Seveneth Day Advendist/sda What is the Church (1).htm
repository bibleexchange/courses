      style="COLOR: blue">The Bible does not teach us to look for a true church, 
      or a remnant church. The Bible does not name any Christian denomination or 
      church as as a "remnant church" or "true church". Some denominations teach 
      they are God's true church in an attempt to get Christians and 
      non-Christians into their fold. They will tell you that you do not want to 
      be a member of a church if it is not "the true church"? Church membership 
      has not saved on person. We are saved by faith in Jesus Christ as our 
      Savior from sin. The church is not a savior, or a mediator between its 
      members and God.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">All denominations and independent churches 
      are all founded are man and woman founded. SDAs by James and Ellen White 
      and Bates, Jehovah's Witnesses by Charles Taze Russell, Latter Day Saints 
      by Joseph Smith, Lutherans by Martin Luther, Methodists by John and 
      Charles Wesley, Christian Scientist&nbsp;by Mary Baker Eddy and 
      etc.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>The Bible describes the Christian Church as both visible and 
      invisible. The <I>"visible churches"</I> are denominations and independent 
      churches that meet publicly that we can see. Their members are known and 
      sometimes recorded on their church books. The members of the <I>"invisible 
      church" </I>are members whose names are recorded in the books of heaven 
      and we can not see who they are. Not all names recorded in the books of 
      the visible church are recorded in Heaven's invisible church. The Lambs 
      Book of Life has all the names of the saints of God recorded from Adam 
      till the end of time.</P>
      <P><B>The Visible Church:<O:P> </O:P></B></P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>If you would ask the question "what is the church" to a member of 
      any denomination, they would tell you, "the church" is Baptist, Methodist, 
      Catholic, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Christian Science, Latter Day Saints, 
      Seventh-day Adventist, and et cetera. If you have any doubt to the 
      accuracy of this statement look in the yellow pages of a telephone 
      directory and you will see these listed as well as many more.</P>
      <P><B>How does the Bible define "the Church"?<O:P> </O:P></B></P>
      <P>From Strong's Greek, 1577. "ekklesia, ek-klay-see'-ah; from a comp. of 
      G1537 and a der. of G2564; a calling out, i.e. (concr.) a popular meeting, 
      espec. a religious congregation (Jewish synagogue, or Christian community 
      of members on earth or saints in heaven or both):--assembly, church."</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Therefore the Christian Church is a group of people that assembles 
      for a religious meeting. The Bible never defines the Christian Church as a 
      denomination.</P>
      <P><B>What are the Churches of the Bible are called?<O:P> </O:P></B></P>
      <P><B><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN></B>There are 108 references to church or churches in the N. T. and 
      there is not one reference to a denomination. This is a sample 
listing:</P>
      <P>I will build my church. Mat. 16:18.<BR>the church at Jerusalem, Acts 
      8:1<BR>the church at Antioch, Acts 13:1<BR>the church in Cenchrea, Rom. 
      16:1<BR>the church that meets at their house, Rom. 16:5.<BR>the church of 
      God in Corinth, 1Cor. 1:2<BR>the Galatian churches, 1 Cor. 16:1.<BR>the 
      Macedonian churches, 2Cor. 8:1.<BR>of his body is the church, Col. 
      1:24.<BR>the church in her house, Col. 4:15.<BR>the church that meets in 
      your home. Phil. 1:2.<BR>to the seven churches, Rev. 1:11.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>The churches in the cities mentioned in the Bible are called "the 
      church" that met in one place in the city or in several places in that 
      same city. The single local church was not "The Church," or Universal 
      Church. It was "the church" a part of the Universal Church. The combined 
      churches in the world were "The Universal Church." Keep in mind when the 
      word <I>"church"<B> </B></I>(ekklesia) is mentioned in the Bible, it is a 
      group of Christians meeting together. The church may be as small as two or 
      three members. "For where two or three come together in my name, there am 
      I with them." Mat 18:20 (NIV)</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>All of the churches of the Bible were a united Church. There were 
      no Pope as leader of all the churches, nor Cardinals, or priests to 
      confess your sins. There were no denominations.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;All the Apostolic churches were united under their leader, Jesus 
      Christ. The Apostolic Christian Church after a time had fragmented into 
      denominations and groups, with some claiming to be the true "Universal 
      Church", such as the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox Catholic and the 
      Church of England.</P>
      <P><B>The Christian Church is one church. <O:P></O:P></B></P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Christians that accept Jesus Christ as Savior and Head of the 
      church and his Word the Bible as their only rule of faith belong to the 
      world Universal Christian Church. Your denomination separates you as a 
      person from other Christians bodies because of churches creeds; doctrines, 
      and statement of beliefs. Nevertheless, when you accept Christ you are 
      joined together into one world "Universal Church." <B>This is the Body of 
      Christ</B> that you have joined by baptism and by faith in his shed blood 
      of Jesus Christ that atones for your sins.</P>

      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ 
      is the head of the church not any church leader.&nbsp; </SPAN>It is 
      interesting to note that some church denominations expect its members to 
      yield up their understanding of Biblical beliefs to the interpretation of 
      the church leaders or the denomination’s creed. This is in violation of 
      the work of the Holy Spirit to guide all believers into all truth. When 
      church leaders do this, they are nullifying the work of the Spirit of God. 
      They are sinning against God, and the individuals that yield to their 
      pressure to give up their Biblical beliefs, are also sinning against God 
      and disgracing his Church.</P>

      </SPAN>Christ assigned leaders to be leaders of his flock in the "visible

      <P>By now after reading to this point you are aware that there is no true

      <P>Visit churches in you area that preaches the gospel and does not 
      require you to accept doctrines that you do not believe that are salvation 
      issues. Many ex SDAs have found fellowship in Pentecostal churches and do 
      not accept speaking in tongues. Others enjoy Baptist fellowship even 
      though they may not believe in the doctrine of the state of the dead. </P>

      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/Sabbath_Not_A_Law.htm">All the old 
      covenant ended at Calvary with all 613 commands.</A> To keep any of the 
      old covenant is a denial of God such as keeping the Jewish Sabbath, <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/Tithing.htm">paying tithe,</A> and <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/Unclean_Meat.htm">forbidding eating 
      unclean meat. </A></P>
      <P>Any denomination that tries to make Sunday some sort of a Sabbath are 
      as in as much error as the Sabbatarians that promote the Jewish Sabbath. 
      Any day of the week is acceptable to worship to God whether in a church 
      building or on the street. God does not require weekly attendance. Some 
      denominations pressure you to be in church each week. Perhaps they miss 
      your money.</P>
      <P>I could never see myself going to churches with so called 
      prophets/prophetess. God has given us his word for the last 2000 years to 
      live by and the promises of salvation through Christ. I would not attend 
      or support a church that promotes practicing homosexual leaders and 
      members as acceptable to God. I do not have a high regard for the pulpit 
      being a forum for political politics. But that is just me. God is the 
      judge of us all.</P>
