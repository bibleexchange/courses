      G. White, deleted part of her visions and changes the words which changes 
      the meanings in her books. Ellen White's problems are often compared by 
      the denomination to the Bible prophets. Such as plagiarizing, making 
      sinful mistakes, using hearsay information to reprimand individuals and 
      etc. But has any Bible prophet ever deleted parts of their vision or came 
      back and changed the words of their writings to give it a different 
      meaning? This question we must ask, <I>does a prophet have the right to 
      delete the Word of God? What if John decided to delete two thirds of 
      Revelation? Ellen has gone where no Bible prophet ever went by deleting 
      her visions. <O:P></O:P></I></SPAN></P>

      </SPAN></B><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">The italics in the preface are a lie 
      that had the approval of Ellen G. White and the Adventist denomination. As 
      you will see, Ellen did change her original work, by deleting parts of her 
      vision. This lie continued from 1851 to 1945, ninety four years. EGW and 
      the denomination have not made an effort to correct this lie in the 
      preface or to add the deleted portions of the vision. The first printing 
      of Early Writings was in 1851 with a different title, "Christian 
      Experience and Views of Mrs. E. G. White." The fourth edition of Early 
      writings was published in 1945. I have reproduced Early Writings by pages, 
      please note the deletions and why?</SPAN></P>

      These lines were left out of Early Writings because the White's were 
      wanting to purge from their teachings that the door of mercy was shut on 
      the sinners that did not accept Miller's teachings. We have documents to 
      show the White's believed in the shut door till 1851. The meaning of the 
      shut door changed later as the Sanctuary doctrine evolved meaning the door 
      of the holy was shut when Jesus moved into the Most holy in October 22, 
      1844, which is a non Biblical teaching. Also notice the paragraph above 
      the deleted vision. The meaning of those that fell off the path, were 
      those that did not accept Miller's false teaching.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">Soon we heard the voice of God like many 
      waters, which gave us the day and hour of Jesus' coming. The living 
      saints, 144,000 in number, knew and understood the voice', while the 
      wicked thought it was thunder and an earthquake. When God spoke the time, 
      He poured upon us the Holy Ghost, and our faces began to light up and 
      shine with the glory of God, as Moses' did when he came down from Mount 
      Sinai.</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">The 144,000 were all sealed and perfectly 
      united. On their foreheads was written, God, New Jerusalem, and a glorious 
      star containing Jesus' new name. At our happy, holy state the wicked were 
      enraged, and would rush violently up to lay hands on us to thrust us into 
      prison, when we would stretch forth the hand in the name of the Lord, and 
      they would fall helpless to the ground. Then it was that the synagogue of 
      Satan knew that God had loved us who could wash one another's feet and 
      salute the brethren with a holy kiss, and they worshiped at our feet,</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">Soon our eyes were drawn to the east, for a 
      small black cloud had appeared, about half as large as a man's hand, which 
      we all knew was the sign of the Son of man. We all in solemn silence gazed 
      on the cloud as it drew nearer and became lighter, glorious, and still 
      more glorious, till it was a great white cloud. The bottom appeared like 
      fire; a rainbow was over the cloud, while around it were ten thousand. 
      angels,</P>
      <P>17</P>
      <P>clothed with a glorious white mantle from their shoulders to their 
      feet. Angels were all a about us as we marched over the sea of glass to 
      the gate of the city. Jesus raised his mighty, glorious arm, laid hold of 
      the pearly gate, swung it back on its glittering hinges, and said to us, 
      "you have<I> </I>washed your robes in My blood, stood stiffly for My 
      truth, enter in." We all marched in and felt that we had a perfect right 
      in the city.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1"> </SPAN>Here we saw 
      the tree of life and the throne of God. Out of the throne came a pure 
      river of water, and on either side of the river was the tree of life. On 
      one side of the river was a trunk of a tree, and a trunk on the other side 
      of the river, both of pure, transparent gold. At first I thought I saw two 
      trees. I looked again, and saw that they were united at the top in one 
      tree. So it was the tree of life on either side of the river of life. Its 
      branches bowed to the place where we stood, and the fruit was glorious; it 
      looked like gold mixed with silver.</P>

      </SPAN>We all went under the tree, and sat down to look at the glory of 
      the place, when Brethren Fitch and Stockman, who had preached the gospel 
      of the kingdom, and whom God had laid in the grave to save them, came up 
      to us and asked us what we had passed through while they were sleeping. We 
      tried to call up our greatest trials, but they looked so small compared 
      with the far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory that surrounded 
      us, that we could not speak them out, and we all<I> </I>cried<I> </I>out!

      wings were spread, was a golden pot of <I>Manna </I>with a golden cast; 
      and I saw a rod, which Jesus said was Aaron's; I saw it bud, blossom and 
      bear fruit. And I saw two long golden rods, on which hung silver wires, 
      and on the wires most glorious grapes; one cluster was more than a man 
      here could carry.. And I saw Jesus step up and the </SPAN><I><SPAN

      of Ellen's early visions from 1847. At that time she may not have been 
      aware the Ten Commandments were in the Ark and not fruit. This is an 
      excellent way to correct a false vision, to delete the erroneous parts and 
      perhaps no one will be the wiser. She corrected her error in a later 
      vision showing that the Ten Commandments were in the Ark and the Sabbath 
      had a halo of light around it with no fruit mentioned that replenishes

      <P>Sabbath commandment, shone above them all; for the Sabbath was set 
      apart to be kept in honor of God's holy name. The holy Sabbath looked 
      glorious-a halo of glory was all around it. I saw that the Sabbath 
      commandment was not nailed to the cross. I saw if it was, the other nine 
      commandments were; and we are at liberty to break them all, as well as to 
      break the fourth. I saw that God had not changed the Sabbath, for He never 
      changes. But the pope had changed it from the seventh to the first day of 
      the week; for he was to change times and laws.</P>
      <P>And I saw that if God had changed the<B> </B>Sabbath from the seventh 
      to the first day, He would have changed the writing of the Sabbath 
      commandment, written on the tables of stone, which are now in the ark in 
      the most holy place of the temple in heaven; and it would read thus: The 
      first day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. But I saw that it read the 
      same as when written on the tables of stone by the finger of God, and 
      delivered to Moses on Sinai, "But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the 
      Lord thy God." I saw that the holy Sabbath is, and will<I> </I>be, the 
      separating wall between the true Israel of God and unbelievers; and that 
      the Sabbath is the great question to unite the hearts of God's dear, 
      waiting saints.</P>

      the Image Beast followed on after, and kept the Pope's Sabbath. And all we

      style="COLOR: blue">In the above deletion Ellen made two mistakes which 
      probably called for its deletion. One, that the Image Beast had the number 
      666 which is not Biblical as only the Beast has the number 666, Revelation 
      13. The second mistake is that the number of the Image Beast is made up 
      and this has to be in 1847 when Ellen had this vision. This would mean 
      everyone born after 1847 will never receive the number 666. Is this what 
      the Bible teaches? It is no wonder this nonsense was deleted. There is no 
      Bible text that tells us that giving up the Seventh day Sabbath and 
      accepting Sunday in its place a person will receive the Mark of the Beast 
      and his Image neither does the Bible tell us the Sabbath is the Seal of 
      God.&nbsp; Revelation 14:9 tells us that "worshipping the Beast and his 
      Image" a person will receive the Mark not by giving up the Sabbath for 
      Sunday worship. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>In he time of trouble we all fled from the cities and villages, but 
      were pursued by the wicked, who entered the houses of the saints with a 
      sword. They raised the sword to kill us, but it broke, and fell as 
      powerless as a straw. Then we all cried day and night for deliverance, and 
      the cry came up before God. The sun came up, and the moon stood still. The 
      streams ceased to flow. Dark, heavy clouds came up, and clashed against 
      each other. But there was one clear place of settled glory, whence came 
      the voice of God like many waters, which shook the heavens and the 
      earth<B>. </B>The sky opened and shut, and was in commotion. The mountains 
      shook like a reed in the wind, and cast out ragged<B> </B>rocks all 
      around. The sea boiled like a pot, and cast out stones upon the land. And 
      as God spoke the day and the hour of Jesus' coming, and delivered the 
      everlasting covenant to His people, He spoke one sentence, and then 
      paused, while the words were rolling through the earth. The Israel of God 
      stood with their eyes fixed upward, listening, to the words as they came 
      from the mouth of Jehovah, and rolled through the earth like peals of 
      loudest thunder. It was awfully solemn. And at the end of every sentence 
      the saints shouted, "Glory! Alleluia!" Their countenances were lighted up 
      with the glory of God; and they shone with the glory, as did the face of 
      Moses when he came down from Sinai. The wicked could not look on them for 
      the glory. And when the never-ending blessing was pronounced on those who 
      had honored God, in keeping His Sabbath holy, there was a mighty shout of 
      victory over the beast and over his image.</P>

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><B>Notice: </B>In the 1888 edition, Ellen 
      claimed that in Revelation 14 Babylon does not refer to the Roman Catholic 
      Church. She applies Babylon to religious bodies, the Protestant churches. 
      In the 1911 edition she adds "alone," which changes the meaning to now 
      include the Roman Catholic Church as well as the Protestant Churches. So 
      when a Seventh-day Adventist teacher would teach that the Roman Catholic 
      Church was Babylon from Revelation 14, he would be contradicting the 
      Spirit of Prophecy of EGW 1888 edition. When Ellen changed her wording and 
      added "alone" in the 1911 edition, the teacher was now in harmony with 
      Ellen. This is exactly what happened in the 1919 Bible Conference, page 
      55.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      <P><B>C. M. Sorenson: </B>On what point?</P>
      <P><B>W. W.Prescott: </B>My interpretation was, and I taught for years in 
      <I>(The Protestant Magazine<SPAN style="COLOR: red">) </SPAN></I><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">and I taught it for years that Babylon stood for the 
      great apostasy against God, which headed up in the papacy which included 
      all minor forms, and that before we come to the end, they would all come 
      under one.</SPAN> That was <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">not</SPAN></B> the 
      teaching of "Great Controversy." "Great Controversy" said that Babylon 
      could not mean the romish church, and I had made it mean that largely and 
      primarily. After the book was revised, although the whole argument 
      remained the same, it said that it could not mean the Roman Church
