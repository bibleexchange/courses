      <H2>Did Mrs. White Practice what she Preached on Diet?</H2></FONT>
      <H3>M. Chugg and D. Anderson</H3>
      <HR width="80%">
      </CENTER>Mrs. White said of her testimonies, "it is God and not an erring 
      mortal who has spoken."<SUP>1</SUP> In a testimony to Elder G.A. Irwin she 
      states that "<B>those who do not accept the light God has given on health 
      reform...can not represent the truth to others</B>".<SUP>2</SUP> From this 
      statement it is clear by her own definition that Mrs. White could not 
      represent the truth to others if she was not a vegetarian. We could take 
      this one step further and ask the question: If she ignored the light of 
      heaven on meat eating, and thus according to her own testimony could not 
      "represent the truth to others," then how could she hold the position of 
      church prophet--a role whose sole responsibility is to represent the truth 
      to others? 
      <P>Mrs. White emphasized that eating meat would destroy not only physical 
      health, but also spiritual life: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Is it not time that all should aim to dispense with flesh 
        foods? <B>How can those who are seeking to become pure, refined, and 
        holy, that they may have the companionship of heavenly angels, continue 
        to use as food anything that has so harmful an effect on soul and 
        body</B>?"<SUP>3</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Mrs. White said eating meat had a 
      "harmful" effect upon the "soul". As you read on, you will discover that 
      all the while Mrs. White was the prophetess of the Adventist church, she 
      was secretly "harming her soul" by eating meat.

      <P>Mrs. White claimed to have taken her vegetarian stand <I>prior</I> to 
      1869, yet four years later we find her eating deer and duck on a trip in 
      the mountains of Colorado: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Our provisions have been very low for some days. Many of 
        our supplies have gone. . . . We expected supplies three days ago 
        certainly, but none has come. Willie went to the lake for water. We 
        heard his gun and found <B>he had shot two ducks</B>. This is really a 
        blessing, for we need something to live upon."<SUP>5</SUP> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Here we find Willie going down to the lake for water. It 
      seems a little odd that he would be toting a rifle with him on his trip to 
      fetch water. Perhaps he planned to fetch more than just water. Willie 
      returned with two dead ducks. From this we can gather that it is okay to 
      let the health reform principles slide a little when supplies are short. 
      Here is another quote from the same trip: <IMG hspace=10 
      src="sda Ellen White Contradictions on Diet_files/deer.jpg" align=left 
      border=2> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"A young man from Nova Scotia had come in from hunting. He 
        had a quarter of <B>deer</B>. He had traveled 20 miles with this deer 
        upon his back. ... <B>He gave us a small piece of the meat, which we 
        made into broth. Willie shot a duck which came in a time of need, for 
        our supplies were rapidly diminishing.</B>"<SUP>6</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>What 
      happened to the stand she had made upon principle? Apparently there are 
      exceptions to her health rules, at least for herself. Even though Mrs. 
      White deplored the "laxness" of others when it came to obeying her health 
      reforms, she broke the rules herself: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>I was at times placed where I was compelled to eat a 
        little meat... When I could not obtain the food I needed, I have 
        sometimes eaten a little meat...</B>"<SUP>7</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE><BR

      <P>Mrs. White had still not given up eating meat by 1880. The following is 
      an excerpt from a letter she wrote to her sister Elizabeth while 
      traveling: <IMG 
      src="sda Ellen White Contradictions on Diet_files/chicken.jpg" align=right 
      border=2>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Thursday morning we arose from our births refreshed with 
        sleep. At eight o'clock we took a portion of the pressed <B>chicken</B> 
        food liberally furnished us by the matron of the sanitarium, put the 
        same in a two-quart pail, and placed it on the stove, and thus we had 
        good hot chicken broth and enjoyed our breakfast. The morning was very 
        cold and this hot dish was very palatable. ... We have plenty of room, 
        good food and plenty of it. <B>Sister McComber scalded up the chicken. 
        Will scald the meat tomorrow morning</B>."<SUP>10</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>There 
      appears to have been ample food available at the Sanitarium, yet Sister 
      White ate chicken that was furnished by the Matron of the Sanitarium. Then 
      she took the pressed chicken with her on her trip and ate it in the train 
      for breakfast: "We again made a nice hot broth of our pressed 
      chicken."<SUP>11</SUP> 
      <P>Certainly Mrs. White could have planned a vegetarian diet for this 
      trip. This was her fifteenth trip on this route so she knew exactly what 
      to expect. Yet while she indulged in meals of chicken, she advised 
      Adventists contemplating this journey to "Take your lunch baskets with 
      you, well filled with fruits and plainly cooked bread".<SUP>12</SUP> No, 
      they were not permitted to violate the health reform principles and enjoy 
      a little "palatable" chicken. They must follow the health reform and 
      subsist on bread and fruit!

      align=right border=2> Mrs. White was still privately eating <B>unclean 
      meat</B> a full 13 years after her public commitment! In this 1882 excerpt 
      from a letter to her daughter-in-law, Mary Kelsey White, she expresses her 
      fondness for herring and oysters: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Mary, if you can get me a good box of herrings - fresh 
        ones - please do so. These last ones that Willie got are bitter and old. 
        If you can buy cans, say (a) half dozen cans of good tomatoes, please do

      <P>Some find it difficult to believe that Sister White actually ate 
      oysters because her testimonies tell Adventists they should refuse to eat 
      them: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>His stronghold seems to be giving way; his hitherto brave 
        heart is growing weak. He is invited to accompany them for a walk, and

      <P>According to Dr. John Kellogg, Mrs. White celebrated her return from 
      Europe in 1887 with "a large baked fish." When she visited the Battle 
      Creek Sanitarium during the next several years, she "always called for 
      meat and usually fried chicken," much to the consternation of Kellogg and 
      the cook who were both vegetarians.<SUP>16</SUP> 
      <P>At the various camp meetings she attended, her lax dietary habits 
      became common knowledge, thanks in no small part to her own children. 
      Kellogg recalled once hearing Edson (J.E.) White standing in front of his 
      mother's tent calling out to a meat wagon that regularly visited the 
      grounds: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Say, hello there! Have you any fresh fish?"<BR>"No," was 
        his reply.<BR>"Have you got any fresh chicken?"<BR>Again the answer was 
        "no," and J.E. bawled out in a very loud voice, "Mother wants some 
        chicken. You had better get some quick."<SUP>17</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Years 
      after his mother's death Willie White told of his mother's difficulty in 
      giving up meat. He described the difficulty in finding vegetarian cooks, 
      and of lunch baskets filled with turkey, chicken, and tinned 
      tongue.<SUP>18</SUP>

        <TR>
          <TD><FONT face=arial size=2>"Already during the time of the Roman 
            Empire oysters enjoyed a randy reputation, which only increased over 
            the ages. During the "Golden Century" in the Netherlands (the 17th 
            century) oysters were the symbol, the very incarnation of an 
            aphrodisiac. Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, sprang forth from 
            the sea on an oyster shell and promptly gave birth to Eros, hence 
            the origin of the word, "aphrodisiac". The great Casanova also used 
            to start his meals with 12 dozen oysters."<SUP>19</SUP> 
        </FONT></TR></TBODY></TABLE>According to Leviticus 11:10 anything from the 
      waters without fins or scales is "unclean." In addition, oysters have long 
      been considered an aphrodisiac. Surely James White must have recognized 
      this because in 1870 he lambasted those who ate oysters: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"What kinds of edibles command the highest price in the 
        market? <B>Those that stimulate this passion, and because they create 
        impure desires. What mean those oyster stews, and crab parties, and 
        terrapin soups, and squab suppers, wild fowls, cloves, and a host of 
        other like things? Eaten, in many instances in high (?low) life, 
        expressly to beget unhallowed desires! Oh! shame, where is thy blush! Do 
        you want more proof? Behold the fertile South. But particulars are too 
        revolting, both as regards the beastly indulgence of whites with blacks, 
        and the number of rakes [immoral men] and harlots among the latter! Our 
        world is literally FULL of sensuality!</B>"<SUP>20</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>James blasted those who ate oysters because of their supposed power to 
      stimulate "sensual desires." Yet surprisingly, his own wife fostered a 
      love for these forbidden, unclean creatures. In 1907, Adventist physician 
      Dr. Charles Stewart wrote a letter to Mrs. White questioning why she ate 
      oysters: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>Three parties, all Seventh-day Adventists, two of them 
        officially connected with the denomination, state for a number of years 
        after you received the light on health reform, that you ate meat and 
        oysters. Two of these persons within the past ninety days told me 
        personally that you ate oysters in their own home, on one occasion as 
        late as 1890. Another stated that he saw you eating oysters in a 
        restaurant. 
        <P>"If you deny that you ate oysters and state that the statements of 
        these two men are false, I will make an affidavit to this statement and 
        give you the names of the two persons referred to so that they can be 
        asked for an explanation.</B>"<SUP>21</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>Mrs. White 
      never responded to Dr. Stewart's letter, nor did she deny the statements 
      of the two men who saw her eating oysters.

        Campmeeting (January, 1894). It was not my purpose to have it on my

      align=right border=0> We noted at the top of this page that Mrs. White 
      said she gave up eating butter in 1869. In a letter to her son written May 
      25, 1869, Mrs. White encourages Edson to follow her "strict" example in 
      giving up meat and butter: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>We have in diet been strict to follow the light the Lord 
        has given us</B>. You are acquainted with that light, and we trust you 
        will have the fear of the Lord continually before you and will respect 
        the light He has given and be no less strict than we have been. We have 
        advised you not to eat butter or meat. <B>We have not had it on our 
        table</B>. ... <B>All know that we do not put butter on our table</B>. 
        If they see you, our son, eat the things we have condemned, you weaken 
        our influence and lower yourself in their estimation."<SUP>24</SUP> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>She further stated in 1870: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>No butter or flesh-meats of any kind come on my 
        table.</B>"<SUP>25</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>In 1872 she bore positive testimony 
      against it: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>We bear positive testimony 
        against...butter...</B>"<SUP>26</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>In 1874, she wrote the 
      following to her son Willie: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Your father and I have dropped milk, cream, <B>butter</B>, 
        sugar, and meat <B>entirely</B> since we came to 
        California."<SUP>27</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>But did she really drop it 
      "entirely"? In 1895 she mentions that she uses butter "for cooking 
      purposes": 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"We purchase <B>butter for cooking</B> purposes from dairies 
        where the cows are in healthy condition, and have good 
        pasture."<SUP>28</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>By 1901 it seems that God had changed 
      His mind on butter, because Sister White sent out a testimony taking 
      butter off the banned list: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>When the time comes</B> that it is no longer safe to use 
        milk, cream, <B>butter</B>, and eggs, <B>God will reveal this</B>... No 
        <B>extremes in health reform</B> are to be advocated. The question of 
        using milk and <B>butter</B> and eggs will work out its own problem. 
        <B>At present we have no burden on this line</B>."<SUP>29</SUP> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Perhaps that time came in 1903--34 years after she supposedly 
      received instruction to stop eating butter--because Mrs. White claimed she 
      had finally stopped eating butter: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"As for myself, <B>I have settled the butter question. I do 
        not use it</B>."<SUP>30</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Despite that claim, it appears 
      she was eating butter again the very next year in 1904. E.S. Ballenger, a 
      former SDA minister, wrote of Mrs. White contradicting her 1872 testimony 
      against butter: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Mrs. White did not follow her own testimonies. <B>She ate 
        butter at my table</B> 32 years after giving this definite 
        instruction..."<SUP>31</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Seventh-day Adventist president 
      A.G. Daniels, who knew Mrs. White for over 40 years, stated in 1919: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"I have eaten <B>pounds of butter</B> at her table myself, 
        and dozens of eggs. I could not explain that in her own family if I 
        believe that she believed those were the Lord's own words to the 
        world."<SUP>32</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>

            her own testimonies?</B></FONT> </TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>After reviewing this evidence it is now painfully obvious Mrs. White 
      failed to follow the very health principles that she claimed to have 
      received from God and insisted others follow. Her health practices were 
      clearly not in line with her health teachings. She either chose to disobey 
      the instruction of God, or perhaps she did not follow her testimonies 
      because they did not come from God at all, but from the writings of other 
      health reformers. 
      <P>There can be no doubt Mrs. White claimed her insight on meat came 
      straight from her "visions": 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"It was at the house of Brother A. Hilliard, at Otsego, 
        Michigan, June 6, 1863, that the great subject of health reform was 
        opened before me in vision."<SUP>33</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The following statements leave no doubt about her stance on 
      meat-eating: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>I do not preach one thing and practice another. I do not 
        present to my hearers rules of life for them to follow while I make an 
        exception in my own case...</B>"<SUP>34</SUP> 
        <P>"<B>Above all things, we should not with our pens advocate positions 
        that we do not put to a practical test in our own families, upon our own 
        tables. This is a dissimulation, a species of 
        hypocrisy.</B>"<SUP>35</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>Mrs. White even went so far 
      as to condemn those who ate meat as being unfit for God's service: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>No man should be set apart as a teacher of the people 
        while his own teaching or example contradicts the testimony God has 
        given His servants to bear in regard to diet . . . <FONT face=arial 
        color=#f00000>His disregard of health reform unfits him to stand as the 
        Lord's messenger</FONT></B>..."<SUP>36</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Jesus had 
      something to say about hypocrites who placed burdensome requirements on 
      others while not obeying those requirements themselves: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=arial size=+1>For they bind heavy burdens and 
        grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they 
        themselves will not move them with one of their 
        fingers.</FONT><SUP>37</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>In the <I>Didache</I>, an early 
      Christian document believed to have been written around the first century 
      A.D., the author advises early Christians on how to identify a false 
      prophet: 
      <P align=center><B><FONT face=arial color=#f00000 size=6>“If any prophet 
      teaches the truth,<BR>yet does not practice what he teaches,<BR>he is a

        eating of flesh-meat. Let them and their families live up to the light 
        of health reform. Let not our ministers animalize their own nature and 
        the nature of their children.</B>"<SUP>39</SUP> 
        <P>"<B>If ever there was a time when the diet should be of the most 
        simple kind, it is now. Meat should not be placed before our children. 
        Its influence is to excite and strengthen the lower passions, and has a 
        tendency to deaden the moral powers. Grains and fruits prepared free 
        from grease, and in as natural a condition as possible, should be the 
        food for the tables of all who claim to be preparing for translation to 
        heaven."</B>"<SUP>40</SUP>

        them how to shun the vices and corruption's of this age. Instead of 
        this, many are studying how to get something good to eat. You place upon 
        your tables butter, <B>eggs</B>, and meat and then your children partake 
        of them. They are fed with the very things that will excite their animal 
        passions, and then you come to meeting and ask God to bless and save 
        your children. How high do your prayers go?</B>"<SUP>41</SUP> 
        <P>"<B>Those who have received instruction regarding the evils of the 
        use of flesh foods...will not continue to indulge their appetite for 
        food that they know to be unhealthful. God demands that the appetites be 
        cleansed, and that self-denial be practiced in regard to those things 
        which are not good. This is a work that will have to be done before His 
        people can stand before Him a perfected people.</B>"<SUP>42</SUP>

      published on www.TruthorFables.com. Fannie Bolton wrote: "I left to go 
      with Sr. White on the very day when my brother was to be married. At the 
      depot Sr. White was not with her party, so Eld. Starr hunted around till 
      he found her behind a screen in the restaurant very gratified in eating 
      big white raw oysters with vinegar, pepper and salt. I was overwhelmed by 
      this inconsistency and dumb with horror. Eld. Starr hurried me out and 
      made all sort of excuses and justifications of Sr. White's action; yet I 
      kept thinking in my heart, 'What does this mean? What has God said? How 
      does she dare eat these abominations?' On the cars out to California, W. 
      C. White came into the train with a great thick piece of bloody beefsteak 
      spread out on a brown paper and he bore it through the tourist car on his 
      own two hands. Sarah McEnterfer who is now with Sr. White as her 
      attendant, cooked it on a small oil stove and everyone ate of it except 
      myself and Marian Davis who I found out afterwards was more the author of 
      the books purported to be Sr. White's than she was her&shy;self. I was 
      with Mrs. White for seven and a half years like a soul on a rock, because 
      of all kinds of inconsistencies, injustices, and chicaneries. I have seen 
      Sr. White eat meat chicken, fish, fowl, shrimps, rich cake, pies, etc. 
      etc. I cannot go into detail but Sr. Daniells told me she herself had 
      cooked meat for Sr. White on the campground. Eld. Horn told me his wife 
      had done the same thing. Sr. Rousseau told me that she too had done so. 
      Dear Sister, Sr. White has written that when we do not live up to the 
      testimonies we re&shy;tract them. She has vitiated (made lifeless) her own 
      claims..."
