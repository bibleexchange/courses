            <P><I><B>Principles</B></I></P>
            <P>1) Christ ministered to the whole person. Following His example, 
            the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church includes a ministry 
            of healing to the whole person—body, mind, and spirit. The ministry 
            of healing includes care and compassion for the sick and the 
            suffering. It also includes the maintenance of health. Teaching the 
            positive benefits of following the laws of health, the 
            interrelationship of spiritual and natural laws, man's 
            accountability to these laws, and the grace of Christ which assures 
            victorious living are integrated in the ministry of healing.</P>
            <P>2) Health-care institutions (hospitals, medical/dental clinics, 
            nursing and retirement homes, rehabilitation centers, etc.) function 
            as an integral part of the total ministry of the Church and follow 
            church standards including maintaining the sacredness of the Sabbath 
            by promoting a Sabbath atmosphere for staff and patients, avoiding 
            routine business, elective diagnostic services, and elective 
            therapies on Sabbath. These standards also include the promotion of 
            an ovo-lactovegetarian diet free of stimulants and alcohol and an 
            environment free of tobacco smoke. Control of appetite shall be 
            promoted, use of drugs with a potential for abuse shall be 
            controlled, and techniques involving the control of one mind by 
            another shall not be permitted. The institutions are governed as a 
            function of the Church with activities and practices clearly 
            identified as the unique Christian witness of Seventh-day 
            Adventists.</P>
            <P>3) In harmony with Christ's reaffirmation of the dignity of man 
            and His demonstration of love, which forgives and cares regardless 
            of the past and maintains the right for individual choice in the 
            future, Seventh-day Adventist health-care institutions give high 
            priority to personal dignity and human relationships. This includes 
            appropriate diagnosis and treatment by competent personnel; a safe, 
            caring environment conducive to the healing of mind, body, and 
            spirit; and education in healthful habits of living. It also 
            includes supportive care of the patient and family through the dying 
            process.</P>
            <P>4) Health-care policies and medical procedures must always 
            reflect a high regard and concern for the value of human life as 
            well as individual dignity.</P>
            <P>5) Seventh-day Adventist health-care institutions operate as part 
            of the community and nation in which they function. In representing 
            the love of Christ to these communities, the health of the community 
            and the nation is a concern of each institution. Laws of the land 
            are respected and the regulations for the operation of institutions 
            and licensors of personnel are followed.</P>
            <P>6) The Institutions welcome clergy of all creeds to visit their 
            parishioners.</P>
            <P>7) The mission of institutions in representing Christ to the 
            community, and especially to those who utilize their services, is 
            fulfilled through a compassionate, competent staff which upholds the 
            practices and standards of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In the 
            development of the staff institutions regularly schedule classes 
            which assist the staff in keeping up to date professionally, growing 
            in understanding, and in sharing the love of God. Long-range staff 
            planning supports formal education of prospective staff including 
            utilizing an institution for clinical practice for students.</P>
            <P>8) Institutions must operate in a financially responsible manner 
            and in harmony with the <I>Working Policy</I> of the Seventh-day 
            Adventist Church.</P>
            <P>9) Primary prevention and health education shall be an integral 
            part of the health emphasis of health-care institutions.</P>
            <P>10) The administration and operation of individual health-care 
            institutions shall be conducted in consultation with the Health and 
            Temperance Department on a regular and continuing basis. 
            Communication shall include the mission/conference, union, division, 
            and General Conference Health and Temperance Departments as 
            circumstances and occasion may indicate.</P>
            <P><I><B>Establishment and Closure of Health-Care 
            Institutions</B></I></P>
            <P>1) When consideration is being given to the opening of a new 
            institution, building a major addition, or evaluating the continued 
            operation of an existing institution, consideration shall be given 
            to:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>a. The long-range plans of the Church in that area and whether 
              the institution facilitates the mission of the Church.</P>
              <P>b. The health-care needs of the area.</P>
              <P>c. The available resources, especially finances, personnel, and 
              equipment, to operate the institution.</P>
              <P>d. Government regulations for the operation of the 
              institution.</P>
              <P>e. Government regulations for closing an institution.</P>
              <P>f. The impact which the opening or closing of the institution 
              will make on the Church in the area and on the community at 
              large.</P>
              <P>g. The educational needs of the Church.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
