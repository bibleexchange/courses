      <P class=MsoNormal>The Seventh-day Adventist, Jehovah Witnesses and the 
      Armstrong splinter groups all say that the first big lie is the teaching 
      of the immortal soul. They claim that Christianity in general follow the 
      lie of Satan and promised that Adam and Eve would not die.&nbsp; And that 
      the teaching of the immortal soul means that no one dies. </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The question is what is "<B>death</B> " and what does 
      it mean to die. The scripture says in Genesis, "<B>in that day</B>, that 
      you eat of the fruit thereof you shall surely die".&nbsp; What happened 
      "<B>in that day</B>" that they ate of the forbidden fruit?&nbsp; Were they 
      annihilated "that day"? Did they vanish into thin air never to appear 
      again "that day"?&nbsp; NO! What did happen? They were removed from the 
      Garden of Eden and <B>separated </B>from the presence from God. <B>Isa 
      59:2 (NIV) </B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></SUP>But your 
      iniquities <B>have separated</B>&nbsp;you from your God; your sins have 
      hidden his face from you,&nbsp;so that he will not hear.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The Bible speaks of death in two forms.&nbsp; We are 
      all aware of the one type of death that is the death of the body.&nbsp; 
      Some, however, are unaware of the death, which is spiritual.&nbsp; That is 
      death by separation of our fellowship with God.&nbsp; This death is to be 
      out of fellowship and out of God' s grace.&nbsp; It is to be cut off from 
      God.&nbsp; In Genesis we find the first the death separation from 
      God.&nbsp; Adam and Eve were first created in fellowship with God; they 
      lived and walked in his grace with the hope of eating from the fruit of 
      the tree of everlasting life.&nbsp; However, their sin brought forth 
      death.&nbsp; Not, only the promise of physical death in the flesh but more 
      importantly, the spiritual separation of life giving grace from God. They 
      were removed from the place of fellowship, Grace and Light in the garden 
      to suffer spiritual darkness in the earth.&nbsp; From that moment, that 
      very day, they suffered the first stage of spiritual death, their soul 
      became bent toward ruin and darkness and the flesh began to corrupt.&nbsp; 
      &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Adam and Eve begin to suffer punishment, "that 
      day".&nbsp; And from that day on they suffered punishment and so has all 
      mankind.&nbsp; Nowhere, does scripture call death,&nbsp; "annihilation". 
      &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Let us look at what the Apostle Paul says describes 
      what it means to be "dead". And what it means to be "alive". Paul writes 
      in Eph<B><SPAN style="COLOR: black"> 2:1 (NIV) </SPAN></B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">1</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and 
      sins.</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Paul and Christ describe those who are <B>physically 
      alive are as yet </B>"cut off" from God's grace as being "dead" in their 
      sins.&nbsp; Does he mean, "annihilated"? Of course not, they mean they 
      were cut off from God!&nbsp; And that is how Adam and Eve "died <B>that 
      day</B>!"&nbsp; Christ in like manners says in <B>Matt 8:22(NIV) 
      </B><SUP><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">22</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">But Jesus told him,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">“Follow me, and let the dead bury their own 
      dead.”</SPAN>&nbsp; <B>Does Christ mean, let the "annihilated bury the 
      annihilated"?</B> Of course not.&nbsp; He means let those who are not in 
      God's Grace and separated from God bury those who died outside of God's 
      Grace. Paul writes concerning the widow that lives in pleasure of sin in 
      <B>1 Tim 5:6(NIV) </B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">6</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even 
      while she lives.&nbsp;</SPAN>Meaning that while she lives and enjoys the 
      pleasure of the flesh, she is dead in that she is cut off from God.&nbsp; 
      To "live" is to being in God's Grace and it means to live <B>forever 
      </B>even though the body may die.&nbsp; As Christ says, "they cannot kill 
      the soul” when they kill they body in <B><SPAN style="COLOR: black">Matt 
      10:28 (NIV) </SPAN></B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">28</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but 
      cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both 
      soul and body in hell.&nbsp;</SPAN>God promises "eternal life" to those 
      who die in God's Grace and "eternal punishment" to those who do not. 
      &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Annihilationist have argued that "eternal life" is 
      reduced to simple existence<B>, even if it's an existence in 
      punishment.</B>&nbsp; They claim, if a person exists "everlasting 
      punishment" then he has also the scriptural meaning of&nbsp; "eternal 
      life".&nbsp; Most people can see through such a childish argument. We all 
      know that eternal life that is promised by Christ means joyous everlasting 
      life.&nbsp; The term "eternal life" is means the abundant, glorious and 
      joyous life in Christ.&nbsp; The word "zoe" in the Greek&nbsp; (life) 
      means an abundant life, not simply existence.&nbsp; In John 11:25 Christ 
      promises that He is the "resurrection and the life" and that those who 
      believe in him "<B>Shall never die”. </B>&nbsp;Christ understands that 
      they will die in the flesh but though they do, <B>they will never be 
      separated from Him </B>or God.&nbsp; Christ "is the resurrection" because 
      though they have died in their sins and separated from God, He is a 
      resurrection spiritually unto them and they <B>now live and shall never 
      again die as to be separated from God.&nbsp; </B>Paul repeats this same 
      thought in Rom.8:38-39 when he writes, "<B> <SUP><SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">38</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">For I am persuaded, that neither death, 
      </SPAN></B><SPAN style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">nor life</SPAN>…<SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line"> <B>shall be able to separate us from the 
      love of God,</B> which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."&nbsp; Christ says in 
      </SPAN><B><SPAN style="COLOR: black">John 8:51 (NIV) </SPAN></B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">51</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, 
      </SPAN><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">he will never see death.”</SPAN><SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line; COLOR: red"> </SPAN><SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line; COLOR: black">Yet, we know, and so did 
      they, that the body will die, but the believer who keeps Christ sayings 
      shall never die as to be separated from God. &nbsp;</SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line; COLOR: black">Early in scripture, in fact 
      at the very fall of Adam and Eve, we find that a hope is established, that 
      would defeat and overcome the death that man incurred by the sins of Adam 
      and Eve.&nbsp; The hope comes in the form of a promise.&nbsp; The promise 
      that <B>the seed of the woman, </B>would crush the head of the serpent the 
      devil which tempted and caused Adam and Eve to fall, Gen.3:15.&nbsp; Then 
      they were cast out of the garden.&nbsp; By believing in that promised 
      seed, there was hope that the sin which had made them fall would be 
      forgiven, and thus brought the hope of eternal life back to them again. 
      Though, the flesh must suffer death, by means of the promise seed, 
      fellowship could be restored as long as they remained in that hope and 
      trusted in that promise. </SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line; COLOR: black">Only God has "immortality"? 
      </SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The Adventist claim: "Paul clearly states <B>that God 
      only</B> has immortality, 1 Timothy 6.15, 16". They quote not even half of 
      the verse. Let us read the whole verse, <B><SPAN style="COLOR: black">1 
      Tim 6:16 (NRSV) </SPAN></B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">16</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in 
      unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be 
      honor and eternal dominion. Amen. </SPAN>That is what <B>the whole verse 
      says</B>.&nbsp; It is not that He only is immortal! It is that He ONLY 
      that is immortality that is dwelling in the light which no man can 
      approach…”.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that angels have immortality</B>.&nbsp; 
      But they do not have self-existing "immortality dwelling in unapproachable 
      light".&nbsp; Angels as well as all life other than God is dependent upon 
      God for existence.&nbsp; God gives angels immortality while only HE HAS 
      self-existing immorality. Any honest Adventist or Armstrongite knows that 
      they have immortality and are not subject to death.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the 
      type of immortality that Paul is speaking of here, is self-existing 
      immortality not just eternal existence. </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Paul is declaring that God is the only one who has 
      self-existing immortality <B>in unapproachable light</B>!&nbsp; It is not 
      a discussion of the immortality of the soul.&nbsp; It is a discussion of 
      Christ’s self-existence, in his Godhood of "unapproachable light"! No man 
      has self-existing immortality.&nbsp; God has to GIVE this immortality to 
      man, when he is born.&nbsp; His soul cannot be killed.&nbsp; It is 
      "immortal”.&nbsp; And as such it will receive either abundant joyous life 
      or eternal punishment according to our works in faith or lack thereof. 
      &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Secondly, the Epistle of Hebrews Chapter 11 clearly 
      shows that "Enoch was translated that he should not see death"&nbsp; 
      Heb.11:5 as well as Elijah and other "souls"&nbsp; of the martyrs are in 
      heaven&nbsp; interceding on behalf of the suffering on earth.&nbsp; 
      Hebrews 12:23-25, Rev.6: 9.&nbsp;</P>
      <H2><FONT size=4>Didn't Solomon say the dead know nothing?</FONT></H2>
      <P class=MsoNormal>There is an interesting contrast between Proverbs by 
      Solomon and Ecclesiastes by Solomon.&nbsp; <B>Proverbs begins with God and 
      asks</B>,&nbsp; "How should we live?"&nbsp; Ecclesiastes begins with 
      <B>without God </B>and asks, "How should we live”. </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Proverbs is positive, while Ecclesiastes is negative 
      and pessimistic.&nbsp; Proverbs begins with the assumption that there is a 
      personal God who gives to all meaning to life (Prov.1: 7) In Contrast, 
      Ecclesiastes begins with the assumption of "the man under the sun", 
      <B>life on earth and</B>, autonomous, man WITHOUT GOD (Eccl. 
      1:16-17).&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Proverbs promises us life will be wonderful if we begin 
      with God (1:1-7).&nbsp; Ecclesiastes warns us that life is empty and 
      without meaning, if we begin without God. (1:2).&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>In Proverbs, wisdom is more important than money 
      (3:13-18). In Ecclesiastes, money is more important than wisdom (10:19, 
      1:17-18). &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The text, which is seized upon by the Annihilationist 
      to prove their doctrine of soul sleep, must be interpreted in the context 
      of the basic theme, "Life under the sun" or "life on earth".&nbsp; Solomon 
      says in <B>Eccl 9:5 - Eccl 9:6 (NIV) </B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></SUP>For the 
      living know that they will die,&nbsp;but the dead know nothing;&nbsp;they 
      have no further reward,&nbsp;and even the memory of them is forgotten.

      since vanished;&nbsp;never again will they have a part&nbsp;in anything 
      that happens <B>under the sun.</B></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Again, Solomon is addressing life<B> on earth as 
      </B>"under the sun" not the immortality of the soul.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, he 
      says, the living are aware that they will die, and they neither will have 
      any more reward for their labors and soon people forget they even 
      existed.&nbsp; The dead at this time, prior to the resurrection does not 
      know anything of what is going on "under the sun".&nbsp; Now notice that 
      this statement is not a statement on the immortality of the soul but the 
      fact.&nbsp; It is a statement that the dead do not know anything that is 
      happening on the earth, prior to the resurrection of Christ. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Does Solomon himself believe in the immortality of the 
      soul? Let us see.&nbsp; In the same chapter he writes,<BR><B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">Eccl 9:3 (NIV) </SPAN></B><SUP><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">3</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">This is the evil in everything that happens under the

      of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and 
      afterward <B>they join the dead.</B>&nbsp;</SPAN>Solomon does not view 
      those who have died, as "annihilated" because he says the living when they 
      die <B>will join the dead</B>. That is to Sheol or the Greek word "Hades”. 
      &nbsp;Luke 16 in Christ words shows that exact thing in the story of 
      Lazarus and the rich man.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Does Solomon believe that spirit or soul survives 
      death?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; In <B>Eccl 12:7 (NIV) <SUP><SPAN

      <P class=MsoNormal>Before the resurrection of Christ, the spirits are

      28, "Fear not them that are able to kill the body <B>but are not able to 
      kill the soul.&nbsp; </B>Christ says this to them in the midst of warning 
      that the persecutors will kill the body, BUT, the soul will survive the 
      death of the body and live with God.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Hence, we find in Rev.6: 9, the "<B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">souls</SPAN></B> of the righteous martyrs " praying for 
      those on earth.&nbsp; We find "the heavenly Jerusalem" in Heb.12:22&nbsp; 
      with the "spirits of Just men made righteous" along with myriad of angels, 
      And Jesus Christ, himself in heaven (12:24) all together!&nbsp; So then 
      when we read in Eph.2: 6And hath raised us up together, and made us sit 
      together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus" we do not make it a symbolic 
      or ethereal meaning but know it is real that the Souls of the righteous 
      are with Christ in heaven. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The Adventist quote Malachi 4:1, 3 to show that the 
      wicked are to be burned up and become stubble under the feet of the 
      righteous.&nbsp; All of Malachi 4 is a prediction of the coming of John 
      the Baptist and Christ's first coming.&nbsp; <B>Mal.4:1, 3, have to do 
      with the destruction of Jerusalem not the second death in Rev. 19 &amp; 
      20.</B>&nbsp; Malachi is written to the Jews not to the rest of the 
      world.&nbsp; The context is not the resurrection of the dead and the last 
      judgment but the judgment upon the Jews.&nbsp; There is no mention of the 
      resurrection of the flesh. It is the wicked Jews who are punished in the 
      judgment of Mal.4:1 &amp; 3.&nbsp; The wicked in verse one are those that 
      reject Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, at his first coming.&nbsp; The 
      Christians were warned to leave Jerusalem before its destruction while the 
      wicked remained. Josephus records how Jerusalem, which the Apostle John in 
      Revelation calls “Sodom and Egypt” was destroyed and burned to the ground 
      and the wicked with them. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Verses 4-6 all point to John the Baptist who was Elijah 
      to come before the great and dreadful day of the Lord's visitation of his 
      wrath upon the Jerusalem.&nbsp; Christ confirms this in his rebuking of 
      the Pharisees of</P>

      <P class=MsoNormal><B>Job 14.10-12</B> all declare that men and women upon 
      death cease to exist but sleep until the coming of Christ. At which time 
      they are resurrected, some to the resurrection of life eternal and the 
      others in the resurrection of final resolution and annihilation. 
&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Job is speaking of the bodily resurrection and not 
      whether a man has an immortal soul.&nbsp; The entire context of Job.<B>14: 
      10-12</B> is <B>the resurrection of the flesh</B>.&nbsp; Job, then asks 
      God to HIDE HIM IS SHOEL until his wrath is past.&nbsp; <B>Sheol is not 
      the grave</B>. Job plainly declares himself to be in existence because he 
      asks God to "hide him”.&nbsp; If he were "annihilated” there would be 
      NOTHING TO HIDE.&nbsp; And in asking God to "hide him" he declares his 
      soul survives the death of the body.&nbsp; And then plainly says he is 
      "waiting" , not annihilated. But waiting the resurrection and the change 
      of his body.&nbsp; If he is "annihilated" he is not waiting on 
      anything.&nbsp; He doesn't even exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as Josephus 
      and Christ point out, the souls before the death of Christ "waited" in 
      Sheol or Hades.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in "non-existence" but in joyous rest for 
      the righteous and torment for the wicked.&nbsp; The Annihilationist should 
      learn that <B>the Hebrew word for “Grave” in the Old Testament is “keber”, 
      not “Sheol”.</B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Ezek 18:20 tells us that 
      the soul who sins is the one who will die. </SPAN></B>Death is not said to 
      be annihilation but suffering from the Grace of God.&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin 
      with, everyone Adventist and Armstrongites and all Christianity knows that 
      everyone will die.&nbsp; Ezekiel is not speaking of physical 
      death!&nbsp;&nbsp; The scripture declares "it is appointed unto men once 
      to die" Heb.9: 27.&nbsp; So it is not a physical death that is being 
      spoken of by Ezekiel.&nbsp; No, it is the death in judgment! An 
      everlasting punishment, that the would strike fear in the hearts of the 
      reader and the hearer.&nbsp; As Daniel the prophet spoke of a resurrection 
      unto "everlasting shame" or contempt.&nbsp; Every criminal in jail or 
      prison knows the meaning of everlasting shame and contempt.&nbsp; They 
      understand how every civilized person holds them in shame and contempt for 
      the sins they committed, especially the unrepented sin. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B>Ezek 18:20 (NIV) <SUP><SPAN

      annihilation but suffering from the Grace of God.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ezekiel 18 
      begins with the Israelites complaining that they are suffering for the 
      sins of their ancestors.&nbsp; So the prophet Ezekiel then proclaims, that 
      it is now going to be that whoever sins will suffer and no longer the sins 
      of the ancestors causing suffering upon their descendants.&nbsp; Ezekiel 
      shows that the person who lives a life of sin "shall die" while those who 
      turn from unrighteousness to righteous, "shall live<B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black"> </SPAN></B>27Again, when the wicked man turneth away 
      from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful 
      and right<B>, he shall save his soul alive.</B>&nbsp; Ezekiel is not 
      speaking of the flesh but whether man who sins will suffer the loss of 
      Grace and be punished. The person who lives righteously enjoys a share in 
      eternal life now and forever.&nbsp; The person who sins shares his part in 
      death and suffering now and forever, if he does not repent.&nbsp; We will 
      see Christ using this language exactly as I described all over the New 
      Testament. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>One should contemplate why sometimes criminals commit 
      suicide before giving up.&nbsp; Or they have they refuse to give up, even 
      when they know they are going to die because they cannot win.&nbsp; 
      Sometimes it is the belief that death is merely annihilation.&nbsp; The 
      criminal believes that by dying he will escape the shame of his sin and 
      the associated guilt.&nbsp; The criminal believes he will escape 
      punishment.&nbsp; Annihilation is sweet music to the ears of the worst of 
      criminals.&nbsp; Annihilation is a gospel of hope to them, for then they 
      neither must repent and admit their crime or fear the coming punishment 
      promised to the unrepentant in scripture.&nbsp; However, annihilation is 
      not what scripture teaches, it teaches a sore punishment to them only 
      compounded by the final taking of their own lives as the final act." 
      &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The Adventist think that what this preaches is that a 
      sinner can go ahead and have all the illicit and immoral fun, doing every 
      evil work and because he does, he'll get eternal peace in "soul sleep" for 
      his reward. Every unrepentant, godless, murder, rapist and evil doer being 
      put to death at the prisons all hope in they won't be punished as the 
      scripture says with everlasting punishment.&nbsp; The all love to hear the 
      gospel of soul sleep, and the promise of no everlasting punishment for 
      their sins. They all hope they will pass into peace and non-existence. 
      But, that is not what the scripture teaches. How many have the Adventist 
      caused to become incorrigible sinners with the promise of "soul sleep" and 
      eternal peace?&nbsp; Even some of there very own, no doubt. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The New Testament defines <B>what kind</B> of death it 
      is.&nbsp; It is NOT a death in annihilation but a death that results in 
      everlasting punishment.&nbsp; In Luke 16 Christ clearly defines the 
      <B>suffering </B>immediately after death of the rich man who is "<B>NOW in 
      torment</B>" While the righteous is <B>"NOW comforted”.</B>&nbsp; The 
      Annihilationist is quick to attempt to try to diminish the impact of this 
      story by calling it a "parable”, the scripture doesn't say it is a 
      "parable".&nbsp; Even it if were, it doesn't lessen the truth taught in 
      the story. And more importantly AN ACTUAL EVENT can still be used as a 
      parable.&nbsp; Secondly, Heb.9: 7-9, 11:19 speak of the services in the in 
      the tabernacle as "figure" (parablee in the Greek).&nbsp; Those parables 
      were <B>actual events. </B>&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B>&nbsp;Jesus Christ NEVER used myths and fables in 
      his parables</B>. <B>.&nbsp; Christ never uses false doctrine to teach the 
      truth and Christ only preaches what he believes.</B>&nbsp; So, we can be 
      quite certain that the wicked do indeed suffer punishment immediately 
      after death as well as the righteous "comfort”.&nbsp; The unmistakable 
      lesson from Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16:19-31 is that the rich man 
      avoided the fact that both Moses and the Prophets taught the immortality 
      of the soul and the punishment of the wicked immediately after 
      death.&nbsp; While the righteous are immediately comforted from the 
      persecutions, trials and suffering that he suffered in the flesh on 
      earth.&nbsp; Luke 16:25-31.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Christ used the word "hades" to describe the place of 
      the departed souls from the body after death.&nbsp; The Adventist and the 
      Armstrong's claim that idea came from Paganism centuries after 
      Christ<B>.&nbsp; I don't know how they read the story of Lazarus and the 
      rich man in Luke 16:19-31 and cannot see that Christ himself used Hades in 
      the same manner as the Christian Church. </B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black">This whole notion that because the Greeks believed 
      something Christ can't believe the same thing is false. The Greeks learned 
      it from the Jews and Christ and the Jews agree.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN style="COLOR: black">Hades the place for 
      departed souls - It's not from the pagans. </SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: black">Here is another prime 
      example of the Apostles using another common Greek term to speak of the 
      torment of angels exactly in the same manner as the Greeks:. 2Peter 2:4 
      "4For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to 
      hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto 
      judgment;" The word "HELL" is the Greek word "Tartaroo". It is #5020 in 
      the Strong's Concordance. "Tartaroo" is used to mean "(the deepest abyss 
      of Hades) to incarcerate in eternal torment-cast down to hell" Strong's 
      Exhaustive Concordance. It again demonstrates the belief and confirmed by 
      Peter and Christ that Hades had compartments with were used to torment the 
      sinful angels and Human souls alike.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: black">Thayer's Greek Lexicon 
      says<B>, "the name of a subterranean region, doleful and dark, regarded by 
      the ancient Greeks as the abode of the wicked dead,</B> where they suffer

      pg.615.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: black">In this same verse of Peter, 
      he uses the Greek word, exactly as the Greeks used it <B>as "a place of

      prophets being in the blackness of darkness or "gloom of darkness"&nbsp; 
      NAB and RSV</B>.&nbsp; The souls of the wicked false prophets and the 
      wicked spirits of fallen angels are all given to the same place of 
      torment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: black">This idea that Greeks, Jews 
      and Christ as well as Christians did not share some of the same beliefs is 
      entirely false. Christ uses the word Hades to mean the place of souls 
      after death (Lk.16:19-27), Peter uses the word "Tartaroo" from the Greek 
      to mean the place of torment of the wicked, just like the Greeks did. The 
      Greeks learned it from the Jews, who learned it from God.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: black">Man is made in the image of 
      God and because God is an immortal spirit, He made man with an immortal

      annihilated. <B>The flesh must be made alive</B> but the <B>SOUL is not 
      decayed</B>, nor was it ever "killed" as Christ said, "they cannot kill 
      the soul " Mt.10:28a The corruptible which puts on incorruption is not the 
      soul because it is already incorruptible as Christ said <B>they are not 
      able to kill the soul</B>. The body is corruptible because Christ said, 
      "they are able to kill the body".&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Had Paul taught that the soul was annihilated he would 
      have then had to answer the same questions about the soul as he did about 
      the body. For example: 1 Cor. 15:35, "What soul do they come" instead of 
      what "body" do they come.&nbsp; But, it isn't necessary.&nbsp; Paul knew 
      there were no questions concerning soul because both Jews and Gentiles all 
      believed in the immortality of the soul. And, the Scripture, Christ and 
      the Apostles taught it.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>1Cor.15 doesn't say anything about recreating a soul or 
      a resurrection of the soul. The whole chapter is about the resurrection of 
      the<B> body</B>.&nbsp; It is the body that is corruptible not the 
      soul.&nbsp; Christ said, "(they) <B>are not able to kill the soul</B>" 
      Mt.10:28a&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Christ warned his disciples in Mt.10:1-30 of the 
      sufferings and torture that men induce to them as a result of their belief 
      in Christ. The pages of the book of Acts are filled with the suffering of 
      the disciples. Christ warns them not to fear them, which are able to kill 
      the body because <B>they ARE</B> <B>NOT ABLE TO KILL THE SOUL. In the most 
      explicit manner Christ confirms the soul survives the death of the body. 
      </B>&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>In the next sentence Christ says they should FEAR HIM 
      (Christ) who is able to destroy both body and soul in ghenna.&nbsp; The 
      Annihilationist falsely interprets this verse to mean that the soul is 
      annihilated.&nbsp; But, that is not the meaning of the verse.&nbsp; <B>If 
      you want to know the meaning of the verse, you turn to Revelation and find 
      the example where the body and the soul are destroy in ghenna.&nbsp; 
      Notice Rev.14:10-11</B> is that description of both body and <B>soul being 
      destroyed, not annihilated!</B> Rev.14:10-11 describes the souls of the 
      wicked as <B>being "tormented day and night for ever and ever"</B> 
      and&nbsp; <B>"they have NO REST". </B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rev.14:"... <B>he shall 
      be tormented with fire and brimstone</B> in the presence of the holy 
      angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: <B>11And the smoke of their 
      torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor 
      night,.."</B> There is no promise of soul sleep or rest for the wicked but 
      torment day and night forever and ever.&nbsp; <B>The scripture says 
      exactly the opposite of the Adventist, JW and Armstrong 
      interpretation.&nbsp; They teach the wicked have “rest” while the 
      scripture teaches, “they have NO REST, day and night for ever and ever.” 
      &nbsp;</B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B>Instead of "Fearing him who is able to destroy body 
      and soul in ghenna, "&nbsp;the Annihilationist would have you to believe 
      that you should Fear the persecutor more than Christ! Because, while God, 
      they claim will annihilate you and give your rest, the persecutor may 
      torment you for months and years! What Christ is saying in Mt. 10:28 is 
      that the torment of martyrdom, which may last an hour, week, month or 
      years, is not to be compared to torment of everlasting fire.&nbsp; </B>But 
      Scripture teaches just the opposite of the Adventist..&nbsp; That is that 
      a far worse punishment will come upon you, if you fear the persecutors 
      instead of Christ.&nbsp; Polycarp, the martyr and Bishop of Symrna was 
      first attempted to be burned to death but he would not burn so they 
      stabbed him to death, in the second century said,<B> "you torment me with 
      a fire which shall burn for an hour and is quenched, but you are unaware 
      of the fire which shall torment the wicked and never be quenched"

      <P class=MsoNormal>The Annihilationist have not understood the meaning of 
      the word destroy correctly. It means to ruin the use for which it is 
      designed not only to annihilate. For example, a person may have his car 
      destroyed by a hailstorm. It doesn't mean the car is annihilated and 
      vanished into thin air no longer existing but only means that the 
      appearance of the car is no long pleasing.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B>Destroy Not Annihilate</B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>From Mt. 10:28 and Lk. 12:4, 5, we must conclude that 
      those who get cast into hell (geenna) have both their soul and body 
      destroyed there<B>. However, the word translated destroy (apollumi), as 
      used in Mt. 10:28, doesn't mean annihilate</B>. Beside Rev. 20:10 as proof 
      for this, we also can easily deduce this by examining two other verses 
      where this same Greek word is used but rendered perish and lost 
      respectively:&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the 
      bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles <B>perish 
      [apollumi]:</B> but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are 
      preserved (Mt. 9:17, KJV).&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>"For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was 
      <B>lost [apollumi]</B> and is found." And they began to be merry (Lk. 
      15:24, NKJV).&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Again, this Greek word can't be equated with 
      annihilate. We know this because the wine bottles that perished would 
      still be in existence, but ruined for the purpose for which they were 
      intended. Moreover, the prodigal was not annihilated when he was lost, but 
      was fully conscious in that spiritual state.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The book of Revelation explicitly illustrates what 
      "destroy body and soul in Ghenna" and it doesn't mean to annihilate. It 
      means to "torment day and night for ever and ever". It means just as the 
      scripture says, "they have NO rest" NAB says, <B>"they have no 
      relief”.</B>&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>What the Annihilationist would have you believe is that 
      it is far better to fear the persecutors, than to fear God. Their teaching 
      is that God will only annihilate and put you to sleep you while the 
      persecutors may punish you for years and years. While Christ teaches that 
      the persecution of beatings, dungeons, starvation, year after year is 
      nothing to be compared to the sufferings of Ghenna. Therefore, one ought 
      not to fear the sufferings on earth but God who will hand out eternal 
      punishment.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>God plainly torments the wicked even in this 
      life.&nbsp; Rev.9:"4 And it was commanded (By the Angel of God) them that 
      they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, 
      neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in 
      their foreheads. 5And to them it was given that they should not kill them, 
      but that <B>they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as 
      the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</B>&nbsp; That torment 
      is given so that they might repent, so they wouldn't end up in everlasting 
      torment.&nbsp; </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;Rev.14: 10 The same shall drink of the wine of 
      the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his 
      indignation; and <B>he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone</B> in 
      the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 11 And 
      the <B>smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they 
      have no rest day nor night,</B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;Rev.20:And the devil that deceived them was cast 
      into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet

      <P class=MsoNormal>It is common to hear Adventist to say that the word 
      "hades" means grave.&nbsp; However, that is not true.&nbsp; It is an error 
      in the KJV of the scriptures that the some have followed. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>"HADES" : From <B>Vines Expository Dictionary of Greek 
      Words&nbsp; Nelson Publishers , page 286: </B>hades(86), <B>"the region of 
      departed spirits of the lost" (but including the blessed dead</B> in 
      periods preceding the ascension of Christ). It has been thought by some 
      that the word etymologically meant "the unseen" (from a, negative, and 
      eido, "to see"), but this derivation is questionable; a more probable 
      derivation is from&nbsp; hado, signifying "all-receiving." It corresponds 
      to "Sheol" in the OT. In the KJV of the OT and NT; it has been unhappily 
      rendered "hell," e.g., Ps. 16:10; or "the grave," e.g., Gen. 37:35; or 
      "the pit," Num. 16:30, 33; in the NT the revisers have always used the 
      rendering "hades"; in the OT, they have not been uniform in the 
      translation, e.g. in Isa. 14:15 "hell" (marg., "Sheol"); usually they have 
      "Sheol" in the text and "the grave" in the margin. <B>It never denotes the 
      grave</B>, <B>nor is it the permanent region of the lost; in point of time 
      it is, for such, intermediate between decease and the doom of Gehenna</B>. 
      For the condition, see Luke 16:23-31. &nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>The Lord, in Matt. uses the word four times in the 
      Gospels, and always. 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; it is used with 
      reference to the soul of Christ, Acts 2:27, 31. Christ declares that He 
      has the keys of it, Rev. 1:18; in Rev. 6:8 it is personified, with the

      11:47), anything done to preserve the memory of things and persons; it 
      usually denotes a tomb, and is translated either <B>"tomb" or "sepulchre" 
      or "grave."</B> Apart from the Gospels, it is found only in Acts 13:29. 
      Among the Hebrews it was generally a cavern, closed by a door or stone, 
      often decorated. Cf. Matt. 23:29. See TOMB. </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>2. mnema (3418), akin to No. 1, like which it signified 
      "a memorial" or "record of a thing or a dead person," then "a sepulchral

      11:9 (RV, "a tomb"); "tomb" or "tombs," Mark 5:3, 5 (some mss. have No. 1, 
      as in 15:46, KJV, "sepulchre") and 16:2 (KJV, "sepulchre"); Luke 8:27; 
      Acts 2:29 and 7:16 (KJV, "sepulchre"). See TOMB. </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Note: In 1 Cor. 15:55, where some texts have "Hades,"

      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;The grave is the "Pit" or "phrear" (5421) or

      <P class=MsoNormal>As you can seed there are words for "Grave",&nbsp;

      from the dead. "&nbsp; How often have I made them aware that they had made 
      the same mistake as the rich man!&nbsp; If Lazarus himself had gone to 
      them from the dead, they would not believe it!&nbsp; It seems NOTHING will 
      change their minds, not Moses and the prophets, not Christ's own words, 
      the Apostles, not scripture, not 2,000 years of Biblical scholarship from 
      one end of the world to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;Instead of believing Moses and the prophets, 
      Christ and the Apostles, Ms. White and the Armstrong's have taught people 
      to call the Christ that saves them from everlasting punishment, 
      "Satan".&nbsp; She proclaimed the gospel that Christ himself taught, as 
      "Paganism" and from "Satan”.&nbsp; The teaching that is of the Holy 
      Spirit, she taught was from Satan!&nbsp; In Matt.12: 24 the self-righteous 
      Pharisees said that Christ did works by the Satan, when it was the works 
      of the Holy Spirit that did the works.&nbsp; Christ responded, in verse 
      24: "31Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be 
      forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be 
      forgiven unto men. 32And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, 
      it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, 
      it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world 
      to come."&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not sufficient that she blasphemed both 
      Christ and the Holy Spirit but then she taught the host of her followers 
      to do so as well!!&nbsp; I leave her in the hands of the righteous judge 
      who will reward every man according to his works.&nbsp; </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;We know from Christ's own words that the wicked 
      souls of the departed are judged immediately after death in Hades.&nbsp; 
      And that the righteouses are also judged immediately after death.&nbsp; 
      Before Christ's death all the souls righteous and unrighteous went to 
      hades, where the righteous received comfort and blessing and the wicked 
      were "kept under judgment" to be judged both in body and soul at the 
      resurrection 2Peter 2:9.&nbsp; All the souls from Adam till Christ went to 
      Hades and were kept there in their separate places.</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;When Christ died his soul as well went to Hades, 
      while his body was in the sepulchre.&nbsp; In Acts 2: Peter proclaims the 
      words of King David, from the Psalms concerning Christ, "26Therefore did 
      my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall 
      rest in hope: <B>27Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hades</B>, 
      neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. "</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;Note what rests!&nbsp; "<B>His FLESH</B> rests in 
      hope" while his <B>"soul is in hades</B>".&nbsp; Christ soul went to 
      hades, he was not annihilated<B>.&nbsp; Christ promised the thief on the 
      cross, "today, you will be with me in paradise”.</B>&nbsp; The place for 
      the righteous in Hades was known as "paradise" or the bosom of 
      Abraham.&nbsp; </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>At the resurrection of Christ, Mt.27: 53 records how 
      that even the bodies of the saints arose and "went into the holy city and 
      appeared unto many”.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were not soul-less bodies but body 
      and souls of the saints that were raised with Christ!&nbsp; Therefore, 
      Paul calls Christ in 1Cor.15:23, "Christ the firstfruits" (plural).&nbsp; 
      For they were all raised in Christ.&nbsp; <B>This is the declaration of 
      that the souls of the righteous were no longer to be restrained in 
      Hades!</B>&nbsp; Christ had victory over the captivity of Hades! And now 
      they were to ever be with Christ in heaven.&nbsp; St. Stephen (Acts 7:59), 
      the first martyr after the resurrection of Christ.&nbsp; Therefore, new 
      the words of Christ and <B>did not fear them that were able to kill the 
      body but are not able to kill the soul, </B>looked up to heaven when he 
      was stoned to death in the flesh and said to Christ, <B>"Lord receive my 
      spirit" fully expecting Christ to receive him that moment.</B> </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;Paul writes to the Ephesians in Chapter 4: 
      "8Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high<B>, he led captivity 
      captive</B>, <B>and gave gifts unto men.</B>&nbsp; 9(Now that he ascended, 
      what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the 
      earth? 10He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all 
      heavens, that he might fill all things.)&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul declares 
      that captivity (Hades which held the souls of the righteous) was NOW 
      captive and the gifts of God were given unto men when Christ "ascended" 
      far above all the heavens’.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the gift of eternal life with 
      Christ is to be shared at death in heaven with the righteous martyrs and 
      all the saints throughout the ages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we see in 
      Heb.12:22<B>- the spirits of righteous men made perfect"</B> and in 
      Rev.6:<B>9 the souls of the martyred saints in heaven interceding to 
      Christ for the suffering on earth! </B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrews 12:1-3 <B>Now 
      presents the righteous faithful of the Old Testament in Hebrews 11 as “a 
      great cloud of witness” over looking us who are running our race. </B>How 
      glorious is the reward of those who suffer with him now and who fear not 
      them, which can "kill the body but are not able to kill the soul"!&nbsp; 
      Mt.10:28</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B>&nbsp;In Phil.1:21-25</B> We find Paul torn between 
      “departing to be with the Lord” or to continue living on earth serving the 
      brethren.&nbsp; Paul says his desire is “<B>to die is gain” </B>but he 
      still has a desire to serve the brethren on earth.&nbsp; If death meant 
      annihilation to the Apostle Paul, there would be <B>nothing to gain by his 
      death because he would neither be able to serve the brethren or “be with 
      the Lord”.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious that these verses only makes sense 
      when Paul views death as immediately “being with the Lord” which indeed 
      would be gain, as it was for St. Stephen and the other martyrs.&nbsp; 
      </B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B>&nbsp;2 Cor.5:8-10 </B>Paul again says “we would 
      <B>rather leave the body and be home with the Lord” . </B>&nbsp;The soul 
      is what must leave the body as it is the soul that is “at home with the 
      Lord” where St. Stephen knew himself to go immediately after they killed 
      his body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul again teaches the same thing as Christ, that 
      when the soul leaves the body,&nbsp; “we appear before the judgment seat 
      of Christ” so that the each one receives recompense of reward <B>for the 
      deeds done in the body”. </B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just exactly as the teachings of 
      Christ in the story of Lazarus and the rich man. When Paul finishes his 
      discussion of those who will stand before God and answer for "the deeds 
      done in the body" he then speaks thus in verse 11, "<SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line"> <B><SUP>11</SUP>Knowing therefore the 
      TERROR of the Lord, we persuade men.."</B></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>Paul speaks in Rom.2:9 that those who do wickedness 
      will receive not annihilation but “<B>indignation,</B> <B>wrath, 
      tribulation, anguish</B> and upon everyone that does wickedness, the Jew 
      first and the Gentile” . Paul makes no promise of annihilation, rest or 
      soul sleep but only the indignation and wrath, which brings 
      <B>"tribulation" and "anguish"</B> upon the evildoer. </P>
      <P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;The souls of the wicked will continue to be sent 
      to Hades where they are "kept under punishment <B>until the day of 
      judgment TO BE PUNISHED" 2Peter 2:9.&nbsp; </B>When at that day both body 
      and soul will be punished together because the sinned together in the 
      flesh.&nbsp; The day will come when the righteous bodies which suffered 
      for Christ will be raised and the righteous souls “made perfect”&nbsp; 
      (Heb.12:25)&nbsp; which has been rewarded in heaven will receive the 
      glorious immortal body according the glory which is due to them by the 
      righteous judge.&nbsp; While the wicked will have been punished in hades 
      and will be restored to the wicked bodies that both which sinned will be 
      punished together.&nbsp; Therefore, we always remember the Lord’s words, 
      “Fear not them which are able to kill the body, but are not able to kill 
      the soul, but Fear Him which is able to destroy both body and soul in 
      Ghenna.” Mt. 10:28</P>

      <DIV class="post-body entry-content">
      <DIV class="ArwC7c ckChnd" id=1fcn>The fact is, that Christ is plainly a 
      sacrifice for the dead in scripture. It is so clearly taught that one only 
      has to contemplate a few scriptures to see it for himself.
      <P>Did Christ die for the sins of Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the 
      Prophets of the Old Testament? Were they Dead when Christ died? Then 
      Christ died for the sins of the dead. Christ made atonement for the dead, 
      so that they might be delivered from their sin."</P>
      <P>In the Spirit and mind of the Apostles, the sacrifice of Christ 
      offering on the cross is an offering for those who are dead in sins, 
      whether they be alive in the body or departed from the body before Christ 
      died. <B>From Adam to Christ, countless righteous besides those listed in 
      the scriptures, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, 
      Joseph, David, Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, all of the Old Testament 
      prophets and others had all died before the coming of Christ. They all had 
      sinned in the flesh, and now were dead in the flesh.<SPAN> </SPAN>Christ 
      hundreds of years later lived his life, free from sin as a petition to 
      save those that had died in the flesh, yet had sin. Christ made himself an 
      offering for their sin, for our sins and a sacrifice for sin for those who 
      were dead.</B></P>
      <P>The concept of sacrifice for the dead is not foreign to the Apostles or 
      to Christ. The Apostle Paul makes it known that Christ's offering was not 
      only for those that would be dead in the flesh but those who are even dead 
      in their sins.<SPAN> </SPAN>Col.2: 13And you, being dead in your sins and 
      the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, 
      having forgiven you all trespasses;</P>
      <P>So great and holy an offering is Christ's sacrifice, that it is applied 
      to us while we are dead in our sins. To whence, when we come to Christ, it 
      is because the grace of Christ calls us, even while we are dead in our 
      sins.<SPAN> </SPAN>Therefore, having this sacrifice already applied, the 
      grace of Christ may bring us to repentance that we might live according to 
      His Grace. </P>
      <P>Again, the Apostle Paul explains in his epistle to Ephesus in Chapter 
      1:Eph.2: 1"And you hath he quickened, <B>who were dead in trespasses and 
      sins"</B></P>
      <P>2: 4But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he 
      loved us, <B>5Even when we were dead in sins,</B> hath quickened us 
      together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) .</P>
      <P>So great is the sacrifice of Christ which is applied to us while we 
      were dead in our sins, that it is able to bring us to Christ by his grace. 
      Therefore, the scripture says, "by grace are you saved".<SPAN> </SPAN></P>
      <P>Those that repent and are baptized admit and gracefully receive the act 
      of baptism which Christ and the Apostles used to demonstrate the FACT, 
      <B>that Christ sacrifice was an offering for us, while we were dead in 
      sin. </B></P>
      <P>The link between Christ's death as an offering for sin, while we were 
      dead, is plainly shown in scripture. It is therefore, not surprising that 
      we find that in the&nbsp;<SPAN class=683181805-23032008>deutercanonicals 
      </SPAN>a story of the Jews offering a sacrifice for the dead and calling 
      it a "holy and pious thing" . </P>
      <P>The story is one of actual history where the noble Jews who went to 
      battle against the wicked. But found that those of the Jews that died in 
      battle had sinned. So the story reads on in 2Maccabees 12: 41 "So they all 
      blessed the ways of the Lord, the righteous judge, who reveals the things 
      that are hidden; 42 and they turned to supplication, praying that the sin 
      that had been committed might be wholly blotted out. The noble Judas 
      exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen 
      with their own eyes what had happened as the result of the sin of those 
      who had fallen. 43 He also took up a collection, man by man, to the amount 
      of two thousand drachmas of silver, and sent it to Jerusalem to provide 
      for a sin offering. In doing this he acted very well and honorably, 
      <STRONG>taking account of the resurrection</STRONG>. 44 For if he were not 
      expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been 
      superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead. 45 But if he was looking to 
      the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in 
      godliness, <B>it was a holy and pious thought.</B> Therefore he made 
      atonement for the dead, so that they might be delivered from their sin." 
      </P>
      <P>What foresight by the Holy Spirit to leave such a witness and prophetic 
      picture of Christ's own offering for those countless others who had died 
      in the flesh without the one true sacrifice of Christ which was to come. 
      For His sacrifice would free all those who were dead in the flesh and make 
      them alive to God by making atonement for their sins.<SPAN> </SPAN>Not 
      only for their sins but all of the sins of mankind. 1John 2.: 2And he is 
      the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the 
      sins of the whole world. For Christ looked forward to the resurrection in 
      a far more PERFECT WAY than Judas Maccabees did in verse 43, and made 
      atonement for the sins of all mankind, not those only who are dead in the 
      flesh but also those who were dead in sins.<SPAN> </SPAN>Therefore, we may 
      rejoice in the words and repeat ever more in gladness the scripture of 
      2Maccabees 12: "45 But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is 
      laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious 
      thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, so that they might be 
      delivered from their sin."</P>
      <P>Therefore, we may rejoice in the words and repeat ever more in gladness 
      the scripture of 2Maccabees 12: "45 But if he was looking to the splendid 
      reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a 
      HOLY AND PIOUS thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, so that 
      they might be delivered from their sin." HOW MUCH HOLIER AND PIOUS is the 
      thought of Christ to make atonement for our sins and the sins of all those 
      who have died? It is proper and right that as many as we have known who 
      have professed Christ but not always lived up to the measure should or 
      anyone who has died with the stain of sin upon their soul should do as the 
      Judas Maccabees in scripture and "So they all blessed the ways of the 
      Lord, the righteous judge, who reveals the things that are hidden; <B>42 
      and they turned to supplication, praying that the sin that had been 
      committed might be wholly blotted out. "</B></P>
      <P><B>Not only so, but when the High Priests of Israel made an atonement 
      for ALL the SINS of the children of Israel ONCE A YEAR, as commanded in 
      Lev.16:29-34, he made the atonement for all the sins of those who died 
      during that year, that did not live unto the day of atonement.<SPAN> 
      </SPAN>Lev.16: "..</B> to make an atonement <B>for the children of Israel 
      for ALL their sins </B>once a year. " just as Christ made an atonement not 
      only for the living but for the dead.</P>
      <P>My point in the teaching is that Christ offered himself a sacrifice for 
      the sins of those who were dead, while they were dead. His suffering and 
      death benefited those who had already died in the flesh and for those who 
      were also dead in sin. From this we learn the deeper and profundity of the 
      meaning of the word "GRACE" which is found in Christ Jesus.<SPAN> 
      </SPAN>In scripture we learn to be like Christ<SPAN 
      class=683181805-23032008>. </SPAN>&nbsp;That by the merits of the grace of 
      Christ's sacrifice for all of us who were dead in sins "their sins may be 
      blotted out" as 2Maccabees 12 uses the same words<SPAN> </SPAN>as does the 
      Apostle Peter, borrowing from the very words of 2Maccabees 12:42 in Acts 
      3:19 <B>" that your sins may be blotted out"</B> , Peter, likewise teaches 
      us to learn to be like Christ<SPAN> </SPAN>in 1Peter 2: 21 "For even 
      hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us 
      an example, that ye should follow his steps: "</P></DIV></DIV>
