      was an aside, a parenthetical remark by Ellen White to a group of invited 
      "representative brethren" in the library at Battle Creek College which met 
      at 2:30 P.M. on the first of April 1901 behind shut 
doors.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This select group of "representative brethren," 
      which apparently had no other woman besides Sister White, included A.G. 
      Daniells, S.N. Haskell, M.C. Wilcox (who gave the opening prayer), Dr. 
      J.H. Kellogg, and Willie White (his mother's principal aide) since they 
      were mentioned in the official minutes of this important meeting. Probably 
      two other men, elders Irwin and Olsen, would have been there as they were 
      in the small group that had met with Ellen White the day before when they 
      had decided to ask her to address this meeting.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.45pt"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Who else may have attended cannot be certainly 
      determined because no official list of attendees was compiled for this ad 
      hoc meeting. It is reasonable to assume that it constituted what now would 
      be termed the General Conference Committee. Daniells, who presided, simply 
      remarked that at a "small meeting" the previous evening it had been 
      decided to invite Sister White to speak to the group, "and place before us 
      any fight that she might have for us." It was also decided to enlarge the 
      group by inviting "others who are bearing 
      responsibilities."&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      began deferentially, "but still not because I have not anything to say, 
      because I have." Then following this typical double negative, she launched 
      into a lengthy, convoluted, complex, and discursive discourse that must 
      have lasted well over an hour, with no questions or interruptions except 
      three brief comments meant to be helpful.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 36.2pt"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Apparently she did not have a prepared script (at 
      least none has survived and no one has ever referred to such a document). 
      And the rambling nature of her talk indicates that she probably did not 
      have even a simple topical outline. Sufficient for our purposes will be a 
      listing of her principal topics. Essentially, she stated and reiterated 
      that the structure of the church was seriously flawed with excessive power 
      dangerously concentrated at the top in a few persons. Frequently she used 
      the image of an autocratic monarchy: "a kingly, ruling power" (page 2); 
      "there is [sic] to be no kings here ruling at all; (11); and God "does not 
      want two or three minds to sit as kings." (19) Unfortunately, she gave no 
      specific recommendations on how to achieve a more democratic and efficient 
      structure for the small, struggling, infant church.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 4.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 36.2pt"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Although no names were used, Sister White was also 
      very seriously concerned about the character of some of the leaders. Among 
      these concerns were selfishness (8), "sharpness ... exercised toward 
      outsiders" (8), a lack of "Christlike principles" (specifically, nobility,

      live, until you can obey the Bible ... then you will know better how to 
      receive some counsel from God [obviously a reference to a "testimony" from 
      her]." Then she returned to her severe command mode: " . . . do not go and 
      repeat any more what Sister White said--'Sister White said this,' and 
      'Sister White said that'; and Sister White said the other thing; [but] you

      mouthpiece for God. In just her fourth sentence, she plainly declared that 
      her counsel came from "the light that I have had for some time." (2) Then 
      she quickly qualified this statement by explaining that this "light" was 
      presented to me in figures, "that is, her enlightenment came in symbols or

      closed doors provides an invaluable insight into the character and 
      personality of Ellen White through the medium of a carefully preserved 
      record of her words as recorded by Elder Clarence C. Crisler, Elder 
      Daniells' secretary. It is obvious that he was meticulous in noting every 
      word she uttered. When he was uncertain of a specific word this is 
      indicated within brackets, as college student would have been taught to do

      careful work by Crisler. "Nowhere is the way the matter [is] represented," 
      appears on page 10. Apparently he was uncertain that he heard "is" so it 
      is given this way. On the next page this appears: "Did they [you] create 
      the means?" And on the following page there is this: " . . . and this 
      world is to be converted and educated just as far [fast] as they will 
      yield to the truth, but the seed of the truth must be sown. " These 
      instances actually occur very infrequently; and they almost certainly are 
      a careful attempt by Crisler to provide an absolutely accurate and 
      complete record of Ellen White's words rather than an attempt to correct 
      her English.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      have seen, her frequent use of double negatives was not corrected. And if 
      her diction was poor, Crisler let it stand. "Now God wants every soul here 
      should sharpen up," she declared. "He wants every soul here shall have his 
      converting power. You need not refer not once to what Sister White has

      just about [sic] as much dilly&#8209;dallying, and it is time that we arise and 
      shine. " (4) Also from the same linguistic roots she utilized an old 
      English small coin to symbolize the utter worthlessness of faulty logic: 
      "I would not care a farthing for anything like that." (13) And Crisler 
      allowed to stand her graphic references to physical problems that plagued 
      her life. In traveling to Battle Creek from California she suffered from 
      "that terrible disorder, the bloody flux [diarrhea] --could not sit up at

      melted and broken down," she recalled concerning a recent experience at 
      Elmshaven. "There they were all weeping, all broken, and the blessing of 
      God was flowing right through our room like a tidal wave." (18) Her 
      figures of speech could also be strikingly graphic. "Do not pick flaws any 
      more," she warned. And then this warning was dramatically depicted: "O, I 
      see enough buzzards, and I see enough vultures that are trying and 
      watching for dead bodies; but we do not want nothing of that [sic]."

      have responsible men, and we want men that shall stand just as true as the 
      compass to the pole," (6) she warned in words that would be refined into 
      perhaps one of her best loved statements by using the more apt term

      really quite old. "We want no picking and picking and picking of flaws in 
      others," she cautioned. "Attend to Number One, and you have got all that 
      you have got to do." Then she immediately used it again, this time without

      <P class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>Crisler's meticulous transcript indicates that 
      Ellen White's very long monologue was interrupted briefly by three 
      different people all with the best of intentions of helping a woman in 
      distress. The first break came early when she mistakenly attributed the 
      famous "You have lost your first love" text to Daniel. S. N. Haskell 
      simply said, "It was John." She gave no recognition of this prompting, but 
      in continuing she quickly cited John. (7)<SPAN

      Harvey Kellogg was actually present in the meeting, Elder Arthur G. 
      Daniells responded simply, "Yes, he is here." Ellen explained that she 
      could not see faces without her "congregational glasses." (14) Yet near 
      the end of the meeting she again mentioned Kellogg with the aside, "if he 
      is here." (20) No one commented then.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      had wandered astray. "You started to tell about your prayer Saturday 
      night," he prompted. "O, yes," she exclaimed and immediately picked up the 
      dramatic story about Christ's return to earth recently at Elmshaven.

      have not had meat in my house for years." (Note here that Maggie changed

      into the lifeless, "But do not quote Sister White. . . . " (19) And Ellen 
      White's opening sentence ("I would prefer not to speak to-day, but still 
      not because I have not anything to say, because, I have") Maggie 
      compulsively revised to a proper but debilitated opening for this key 
      address: I would prefer not to speak today, not because I have nothing to 
      say. I have something to say." (1) (In defense of Mrs. White it should be

      detailed account of continual sickness, apparently a reoccurrence of 
      malaria acquired in Australia, with its attendant "bloody flux" (diarrhea) 
      and "melted" kidneys (no appropriate alternative phrase is evident) was

      (Was she actually the author of the finished and expanded statement? When 
      a writing enterprise employs literary assistants--"ghost writers"--to the 
      extent that Ellen White did, it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
      determine the real author of any particular article or book, or any part 
      of them. So a business enterprise can quickly become charged with ethical

      double-spaced, typed pages. In general it covers the same ground as 
      Crisler's transcript but in a much less careful and meticulous manner. 
      This secretary also had great difficulty in determining when Sister 
      White's flow of words should have been logically broken off into 
      paragraphs. Thus a massive single paragraph extends from pages 1 to 5, and 
      even more forbiddingly, from pages 6 to 12.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      not tolerate the low level locution "dill--dally," so it was euthanized. 
      However, they did find two "Amens" that others had missed which were 
      placed within parentheses. (3) But the beautiful old colloquialism "Number 
      One" was retained with slight variations: "Attend to No. 1, and you have 
      got all that you can do. If you attend to Number One, and if you purify 
      your souls by obeying the truth, you will have something to impart."

      resolve troublesome problems, it is difficult from our century-long 
      perspective to give even a tentative evaluation of its success. Perhaps 
      some walked away harboring even more troubling, unanswered questions than 
      they had possessed before. No votes were taken and no resolutions were
