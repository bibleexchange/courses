      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Ellen White's Angel 
      Guide turned to her and said with great solemnity, "Look ye! And take heed 
      for there are some very strange things going on at Elmshaven. There seems 
      to be a baseball craze. Look ye! And behold the idolatry of your own 
      Godless wayward grandchildren who are outside playing baseball! " And her 
      Angel Guide wept with a loud voice, saying, "Look ye! Look ye! For Satan 
      is on the playground. Look ye from your upstairs window. See how 
      frivolous, how rude, how grotesque your seven grandchildren appear as you 
      allow them to mimic the amusements of the Gentiles. Oh! What an account 
      their father Willie will have to render to God, for behold, he has allowed 
      baseball to win his children to the world. Hear ye! has Christ Himself not 
      told you to warn your own family that baseball is "an offense to God"? 
      Christ can no longer look upon one of your seven grandchildren with favor. 
      They have all been weighed in the balances and found wanting. Look ye! 
      Rebuke the sins in thine own house." But Ellen looked away.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it came to pass after 
      many months Ellen White's Angel Guide again appeared unto her in the night 
      season, saying with greater solemnity than before, "Look ye! Time is 
      short! Hearken to this, my last warning! Look ye in the direction of son 
      Willie's home next door. Behold, I have seen some things in Willie's 
      family that are still not in accordance with what you said you were shown 
      in vision, for in spite of all your warnings to others, why are Willie's 
      four sons and three daughters still playing baseball? If your wayward 
      granddaughters needed exercise, why didn't you tell them to get into the 
      house and start cooking, washing dishes, sweeping and scrubbing? Hasn't 
      their mother taught them anything? I have waited and waited for you to 
      warn them, but instead you sat on the upstairs veranda watching Willie's 
      seven wayward children engaging in their favorite bewitching, worldly 
      sport. But you were not sitting alone as the only spectator on the 
      veranda. Satan and his angels were there and so were the angels of God, 
      not to approve, but to disapprove.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Ellen White's Angel 
      Guide wept in an even louder voice than before, saying, and "For Christ's 
      sake tell Willie to put a halt to this at once before his probation 
      closes. For Willie, like Eli, has brought himself under the curse of God 
      by allowing his wayward children to play baseball. Behold ye! Willie, his 
      mother, his wife and all his Godless children have been weighed in the 
      balances and found wanting. Look ye! And weep, oh thou prophetess who 
      claims to 'Cry aloud and spare not and show my people their sins.' For 
      thou never didst rise up early in the morning to reprove and rebuke thy 
      son Willie and his family for their sins. Look ye! Oh thou hypocrite! But 
      Ellen I looked away. The Angel Guide said, "Ellen and you and your family 
      have a marred record in heaven."</P>
