      <P align=left><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Some Seventh-day Adventist members 
      have written me that they were not baptized into Ellen G. White. This is 
      done in such a way that baptismal candidates do not realize what has 
      happened. The pastor or Bible teacher will teach the baptismal candidates 
      that Ellen G. White has the "Spirit of Prophecy." I have listed below the 
      Summary of Doctrinal Beliefs, Vows, and from the SDA Church Manual, how 
      this all takes place.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      and do you believe that the gift of prophecy in the remnant church is one 
      of the identifying marks of that church?" (See pp. 39, 40, 293.)</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Note: To the candidate, the remnant church is 
      the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the gift of prophecy in the 
      Adventist church is Ellen White. So if you did not hear Ellen G. White 
      mentioned in your vows, this is the reason, you had already agreed to it 
      in your indoctrination.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And 
      when the church hears the vows it is assumed by all that you have accepted 
      Ellen White. If any non-Adventist visitors are present they will not think 
      anything cultic has transpired, which they would if the pastor asked, "do 
      you accept Ellen G. White as having the "Spirit of Prophecy"? They would 
      ask, "Who is Ellen G. White," that you are accepting before you can be 
      baptized into Christ?<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      <FONT color=#ff0000><B>for baptism,</B></FONT> and by those being received 
      on profession of faith.</P>
      <P>1. Do you believe in God the Father, in His Son Jesus Christ, and in 
      the Holy Spirit?</P>
      <P>2. Do you accept the death of Jesus Christ on Calvary as the atoning 
      sacrifice for the sins of men, and believe that through faith in His shed 
      blood men are saved from sin and its penalty?</P>
      <P>3. Renouncing the world and its sinful ways, have you accepted Jesus 
      Christ as your personal Saviour, and do you believe that God, for Christ's 
      sake, has forgiven your sins and given you a new heart?</P>
      <P>4: Do you accept by faith the righteousness of Christ, recognizing Him 
      as your Intercessor in the heavenly sanctuary, and do you claim His 
      promise to strengthen you by His indwelling Spirit, so that you may 
      receive power to do His will?</P>
      <P>5. Do you believe that the Bible is God's inspired word, and that it 
      constitutes the only rule of faith and practice for the Christian?</P>
      <P>6. Do you accept the Ten Commandments as still binding upon Christians; 
      and is it your purpose, by the power of the indwelling Christ, to keep 
      this law, including the fourth commandment, which requires the observance 
      of the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath of the Lord?</P>
      <P>7. Is the soon coming of Jesus the blessed hope in your heart, and are 
      you determined to be personally ready to meet the Lord, and to do all in 
      your power to witness to His loving salvation, and by life and word to 
      help others to be ready for His glorious appearing?</P>
      <P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">8. Do you accept the Biblical teaching of 
      spiritual gifts, and do you believe that the gift of prophecy in the
