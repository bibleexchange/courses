            Faith</FONT></B></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The history of the 
            Seventh-day Adventist Church is filled with examples of individuals 
            and institutions who have been, and are, vibrant witnesses to their 
            faith.&nbsp; Because of their passionate commitment to their Lord 
            and appreciation of His unbounded love, they all have the same goal: 
            to share the Good News with others.&nbsp; One key Bible text has 
            motivated them.&nbsp; It is a text that fires the souls of 
            Seventh-day Adventists everywhere.&nbsp; It is what is called the 
            Gospel Commission, the mandate from the Lord Himself, as recorded in 
            Matthew 28:19,20, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing 
            them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
            Ghost."&nbsp; The New International Version says: "Therefore go and 
            make disciples of all nations...."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This mandate, from the 
            Lord Himself, is simple, beautiful, and binding.&nbsp; It is for 
            every follower, whether member, pastor, or administrator--<B>Go ... 
            teach ... baptize ... make disciples.</B>&nbsp; This principle 
            ignites the mission of the Church and sets the standard for any 
            measuring, any assessment,&nbsp; of success.&nbsp; It touches all, 
            whatever their responsibility, whether they are laypersons or church 
            employees.&nbsp; It spans all the elements of church life, from the 
            local church to the General Conference, in schools and colleges, 
            publishing houses, health-care institutions, and health food 
            organizations.&nbsp; The promise is encapsulated in the baptismal 
            vows, in mission statements, in aims and objectives, in policies, 
            and in constitutions and bylaws&nbsp; "to witness to His loving 
            salvation," "to facilitate the proclamation of the everlasting 
            gospel," "to supply the multitudes with the bread of life," and "to 
            nurture them in preparation for His soon return."&nbsp; The 
            four-fold command to <B>go ... teach ... baptize ... make 
            disciples</B> sounds wherever Seventh-day Adventists work or come 
            together.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the Church has grown 
            in size and complexity, more and more members, pastors, and 
            administrators have asked serious questions about how the Church 
            relates to the Gospel Commission.&nbsp; Do the wheels and the gears 
            of the Church just turn out above average products and services that 
            cannot be readily distinguished from their secular 
            counterparts?&nbsp; Or does the Church make sure its basic products 
            and services reveal to the world the way to eternal life?&nbsp; 
            Nothing should be excluded from these questions, whether it be 
            church worship services or&nbsp; organizational or institutional 
            programs and products.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The time has come for 
            the Church as a whole to ask and answer the hard questions about how 
            the Church is relating to the guiding principle of the Gospel 
            Commission.&nbsp; How can the guiding principle be actualized in the 
            lives of&nbsp; members, pastors and congregations?&nbsp; How can 
            they measure their progress in fulfilling the Gospel 
            Commission?&nbsp; How can the Church's universities, colleges and 
            academies, health-food factories, high-tech health-care 
            institutions, clinics, publishing houses, and media centers develop 
            accountability based on the Gospel Commission?</FONT></P><FONT 
            face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR clear=all></FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This challenge calls 
            for a frank and analytical approach in determining where the Church 
            is in relationship to the Lord's command.&nbsp; It is not enough to 
            measure success by secular standards, not enough to give those 
            standards priority.&nbsp; Total commitment to God involves, 
            primarily, total acceptance of the principles of Christianity as 
            outlined in the Bible and as supported by the Spirit of 
            Prophecy.&nbsp; Congregations, institutions, individual church 
            employees and church members can easily find satisfaction in goals 
            reached, funds raised, buildings completed, budgets balanced, 
            accreditation achieved or renewed, and yet fail to be accountable 
            before God to the Gospel Commission.&nbsp; The first and continuing 
            priority for the Church must be this directive from the Lord: <B>Go 
            ...&nbsp; teach ... baptize ... make disciples.</B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the Gospel 
            Commission does not change, its fulfillment is demonstrated in 
            different ways.&nbsp; A pastor works within a different context than 
            that of a classroom teacher, a physician, or an institutional 
            administrator.&nbsp; Whatever the personal or institutional role, 
            each one is accountable to God's command.&nbsp; Among the great 
            benefits resulting from an assessment of their effectiveness will be 
            the increasing trust that develops as each member, each pastor, each 
            administrator, and each church institution&nbsp; addresses this 
            priority and gives it proper attention.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The family of God 
            acknowledges that each person is individually accountable to 
            God.&nbsp; At the same time, believers are admonished to examine 
            themselves (see 2 Corinthians 13:5).&nbsp; A spiritual assessment 
            process has its place in the personal life. Just as surely it has 
            its place in organizational life</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spiritual assessment, 
            while appropriate, is also a very delicate matter.&nbsp; For 
            humankind sees only in part.&nbsp; The earthly frame of reference is 
            always limited to that which is visible and to a brief span of time 
            surrounding the present.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is much to be 
            gained from careful and thoughtful evaluation of personal and 
            organizational life.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is possible to 
            identify several principles which can guide such an 
            assessment.&nbsp; While any attempt will be incomplete,&nbsp; the 
            following areas of specific assessment will heighten awareness of 
            and accountability to God and to the mission which is an integral 
            part of the Christian's relationship and commitment to Him.&nbsp; 
            The list is not comprehensive of those identified for attention, but 
            the principles outlined here are applicable also to other 
            individuals, organizations, and institutions.</FONT></P>
