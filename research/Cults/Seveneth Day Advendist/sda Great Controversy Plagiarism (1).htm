      <P>Elder W, A. Spicer delivered two morning talks at the World's 
      Educational Conference held at Blue Ridge, North Carolina, on August 19 
      and 20, 1937. These two lectures were published in the R. &amp; H. in four 
      issues beginning with Jan. 6, 1938. We pass over many interesting features 
      of these addresses for lack of space, but wish to devote some time to the 
      consideration of the second section as found in the R. &amp; H. of Jan. 
      13. Quite a portion of this number is devoted to Mrs. White's plagiarisms. 
      Among other excuses for Mrs. White's literary thefts, Elder Spicer 
      says:<BR>"The carefulness among later writers in giving credit, did not 
      obtain so essentially a generation or two ago." This is not true. It did 
      obtain. In 1891 T. DeWitt Talmage, in his book FROM MANGER TO THRONE, 
      gives credit to thirty-three authorities from which he drew his material; 
      and Edersheim, in his LIFE AND TIMES OF JESUS THE MESSIAH, published in 
      1883, cites no less than 300 authorities. It was always recognized as a 
      sin and a crime to use other people's thoughts, without credit. <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">Some had tried to excuse Mrs. White's plagiarisms 
      because of her youth and inexperience; but, when she wrote GREAT 
      CONTROVERSY she was fifty-seven years old. She had already been writing 
      nearly forty years.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: blue">Did Elder Spicer Tell the Truth?<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Elder Spicer saw that when Mrs. White's attention was called to the 
      fact that she had not given credit for some material that she used, "She 
      immediately gave instructions to her helpers to go through her books, and 
      mark every sentence or paragraph she had taken from those historians, and 
      insert the proper punctuation for introducing a quotation. ... She saw to 
      it herself that this was done for the next edition of the book." Notice, 
      he says: "She immediately gave instruction." We have the first, the third, 
      and the ninth editions of GREAT CONTROVERSY, and several editions after 
      that which are not numbered; and not one of them gave credit for the facts 
      and thoughts she used from other authors. <SPAN style="COLOR: red">She 
      published many editions after her attention was called to her plagiarisms 
      before she gave credit. It must have taken her helpers a long time to 
      search out her plagiarized portions. GREAT CONTROVERSY was first published 
      in 1884, and proper credits were not given until the edition of 1911, a 
      period of 27 years. </SPAN>You can put all the confidence you care to on 
      Elder Spicer's "immediately."</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">A 
      Pioneer Tells the Truth<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>We have a letter from an old S. D. A. worker bearing on this question, 
      a portion of which we reproduce here: "I called W. C. White's attention to 
      the flagrant plagiarisms and literary piracies in 'The Great Controversy' 
      a short time before and his mother went to Australia.. [They went to 
      Australia in 1891] . . . Besides being wicked it was stupid and I told him 
      that it would destroy all respect for the special authority claimed by the 
      author as well as for the integrity of the authors or publishers.</P>
      <P>"I turned to the preface and called his attention to the claims made in 
      the preface<B> </B>of a supernatural source for the information given in 
      the book. His defense was as foolish as his conduct. He said in effect, 
      'It is ideas that counts and not words. When mother finds in reading the 
      writings of other persons statements of facts which have been revealed to 
      her, there is no reason that<B> </B>she should not copy them. The fact 
      that she uses the same words does not matter.' "I replied, 'Of course your 
      mother has the right to incorporate such statements into her writings. It 
      is perfectly all right for her to do so if she wishes, but in doing so she 
      should use quotation marks and should give credit to the persons to whom 
      the Lord revealed the ideas before he did to her. ' "</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">He 
      Leaves Out Damaging Evidence<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Eld. S. tries to excuse her practice by citing an example from the 
      writings of John Wesley. He quotes a part of a paragraph from Wesley's 
      EXPLANATORY NOTES UPON THE NEW TESTAMENT.</P>
      <P>We will introduce what Elder Spicer copied, together with some of the 
      preface just preceding what he quotes. In the following quotation, that 
      which is in bold face type did not appear in Elder Spicer's article in the 
      R. &amp; H. of Jan. 13, page 9, middle of first column.</P>
      <P>After acknowledging his indebtedness to Bengel's Gnomon Novi 
      Testamenti, Wesley says: <B>"Many of his excellent notes I have therefore 
      translated. Many more I have abridged, omitting that part which is purely 
      critical, and giving the substance of the rest. . . . <O:P></O:P></B></P>
      <P><B>"I am likewise indebted for some useful observations to Dr. Heylin's 
      Theological Lectures: and for many more to Dr. Guyse, to the Family 
      Expositor of the late pious and learned Dr. Doddridge.</B> It was a doubt 
      with me for some time, whether if should not subjoin to every note I 
      received from them the name of the author from whom it was taken; 
      especially considering I had transcribed some, and abridged many more, 
      almost in the words of the author. But upon further consideration, I 
      resolved to name none, that nothing might divert the mind of the reader 
      from keeping close to the point in view, and receiving what was spoken 
      only according to its own intrinsic value."</P>
      <P>The question arises, Is there a genuine parallel between the method of 
      writing used by Wesley and by Mrs. White?</P>
      <P>Wesley was writing in the middle of the 18th century; Mrs. White did 
      most of her writing during the latter part of the 19th century.</P>
      <P>The writers from whom Mrs. W. borrowed freely were as 
      follows:<BR><B>D'Aubigne,</B> whose History of the Reformation was 
      published between 1835 and 1853. <B>Wylie,</B> whose History of

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">What was the practice of these writers with 
      reference to giving credit to authorities whom they consulted and used? 
      </SPAN>There are footnotes on practically every page of every one these 
      writers in which they give exact references to the sources of their 
      material. These authors were contemporaries of Mrs. White. Hundreds of 
      other books of the period could be listed to show that conscientious 
      writers were just as careful to give credit where credit was due. Mrs. W. 
      had the example of' D'Aubifne, Wylie, and Conybeare and Howson before her; 
      <SPAN style="COLOR: red">and if she did not know before reading them the 
      correct form for acknowledging the debt of one writer to another, she 
      could have learned it from them.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>Why did not Elder Spicer give to these young educators the other part 
      of Wesley's introduction bearing on this question? Our enemies have 
      maliciously accused us of taking statements out of their setting and 
      putting a wrong construction on them. Are we unjustly harsh on Elder 
      Spicer when we express our conviction that he had a definite purpose in 
      omitting a part of this introduction? <SPAN style="COLOR: red">He knew 
      that if he had reproduced it all, it would have shown Mrs. White's 
      dishonesty instead of excusing her conduct.</SPAN> Wesley was honest 
      enough to put in his preface the fact that he had used other people's, 
      thoughts, and he did not claim inspiration. Mrs. White, who claimed that 
      every word. she wrote was a divine revelation, made no mention of the fact 
      that she used thoughts and words from other writers. Granted that it would 
      have been all right for Mrs. White to do as Wesley did, there still 
      remains the question of inspiration. Was Wesley inspired or is Elder 
      Spicer comparing an inspired writer with an uninspired writer? He speaks 
      of "a few paragraphs from the historians." Does he not know that whole 
      chapters from Sketches from the Life of Paul were merely paraphrases from 
      Conybeare and Howson's Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul? It is barely 
      possible that Elder Spicer quoted from another edition of Wesley's notes; 
      but we have consulted two different editions and they agree in every 
      particular. Therefore, we are forced to believe that he omitted certain 
      portions of Wesley's introduction for a purpose.<B> <O:P></O:P></B></P>

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Elder W. C. White attempted to excuse her 
      plagiarisms</SPAN> by saying that if she had taken others' thought, and 
      used them as her own, she would not have quoted from such popular authors 
      as D'Aubigne and Wylie. This explanation no doubt satisfied many of her 
      followers. We wrote to every public library in Southern California in 
      cities of 30,000 or more, and not a single set of Wylie's HISTORY OF 
      PROTESTANTISM could be found. The great library of the city of Los Angeles 
      — declared to be one of the finest and most complete libraries in the 
      world — has not a copy of Wylie's HISTORY OF PROTESTANTISM. They are 
      extremely rare; probably not one in a million of the inhabitants of the U. 
      S. A. has ever seen a set.</P>

      style="COLOR: blue">Mrs. White Plagiarized Whole Articles<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>The first page article in every issue of the WATCHMAN, a weekly 
      magazine published by the S. D. A. publishing house, at Nashville, Tenn. 
      was given to Mrs. White's writings in 1906, excepting one issue which was 
      devoted to reporting the proceedings of the Southern Union Conference. 
      <SPAN style="COLOR: red">In the issue of May 1, is an article signed by 
      Mrs. E. G. White, entitled RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. Not a word of this was 
      written by Mrs. White. It was written wholly by Elder George E. Fifield, 
      and published by him years before it appeared in the WATCHMAN. 
      Nevertheless, it is inserted in this magazine as a revelation from 
      God.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>If this is not fraud, we will let our critics name it. Here is a whole 
      article, not a word of which Mrs. White wrote; yet she published it as a 
      direct revelation from God. We recognize that some people will say that 
      Mrs. White was not responsible for this blunder. This, in a certain sense, 
      may be true. If she delegated others to send out material over her name, 
      and they selected anything that suited their fancy, and published it to 
      the world as divine revelation, then she was responsible for entrusting 
      such power or privilege to any of her helpers. If they were in the habit 
      of practicing this deception, then how may we know that anything that is 
      put in print over her name is authentic?</P>
      <P>This is not the only case of its kind that has come to our attention. 
      At the general conference of <B>1909,</B> held at Washington, D.C., the 
      last conference Mrs. White attended, Elder W. A. Colcord was handed a 
      batch of Testimonies supposedly from Mrs. White, to read at a special 
      session of the Religious Liberty Association. In reading it over, previous 
      to the session, he discovered an article that was quite familiar to him, 
      and behold, the whole article was a product of his own pen, which he had 
      sent to Mrs. White two or three years before, yet it was assigned to him 
      to read as a revelation from God. <SPAN style="COLOR: red">We would be 
      pleased to have Elder W. A. Spicer offer a satisfactory explanation of 
      this kind of plagiarism."<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
