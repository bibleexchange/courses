<P>The Use of the Spirit of Prophecy In Our Teaching of Bible and History July 
30, 1919</P></DIR></DIR></B></FONT>
<P>W.E. Howell: Our topic for this hour, as arranged in the program, is "The Use 
of the Spirit of Prophecy in our Teaching of Bible and History." Elder Daniells 
is here with us this morning to fulfill his promise to our teachers that he 
would give us a talk along this line, and I am sure the opportunity of 
considering this question further will be greatly appreciated.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I have been a little uncertain in my own mind as to just what 
line it would be best to follow. There is so much in this that it can not be 
fully presented in one talk, and I would regret missing the mark and taking up 
that which would not be of most interest to you; and so I finally decided that I 
would prefer to have a round-table talk. I would prefer to have you question me 
and then I would try to answer such points as are of most interest to you. I may 
not be able to give another talk here, and you probably would not have the time, 
and so I would like to make this hour most profitable. I will present one or two 
points as briefly as I can to start with, and then I will just open the way for 
questions.</P>
<P>First of all I want to reiterate what I stated in the talk I gave some 
evenings ago on this subject, - that I do not want to say one word that will 
destroy confidence in this gift to this people. I do not want to create doubts. 
I do not want to in any way depreciate the value of the writings of the spirit 
of prophecy. I have no doubt in my own mind. I do not know whether every man can 
say that or not, but I can say it with all honesty. I have had perplexities 
through the forty years I have been in the ministry. I have found things similar 
to that to which Peter referred in Paul's writings, - hard to be understood. You 
know Peter said that, and I have had personal testimonies come to me that I 
could not understand. That is a remarkable thing, isn't it, for a man to get 
such a message as that? But that is what nearly all doubters hark back to when 
they get away from us, - they got a testimony they could not understand and 
believe. I could not understand then, but time has helped me to understand; and 
I have concluded that we do not see from the Lord's standpoint, and we do not 
know as much as the Lord knows about ourselves and so when He reveals things to 
us that we do not understand, it is because He knows more about us and our 
tendency and dangers than we do, ourselves.</P>
<P>The first one I got that threw me into confusion charged me very strongly 
with sort of - well, I will put it in the worst form - a tendency to domineer 
over my brethren in administrative matters, not giving them the freedom of mind 
and thought that they were entitled to. I did not understand that. It did not 
seem so. I asked some of my good friends, and they said they never had felt it, 
and that threw me into worse trouble. Even some members of the Committee had 
never seen that. What was I to do? They were not the right men for me to get my 
information from. I soon found that there were some men who believed that the 
message was right. Inside of a year or so I found a very strong tendency, under 
a bit of nervousness and weariness, to do that very thing; so I got the message 
out and reread it prayerfully, and acknowledged it to the Lord, and I am trying 
all the time to guard against any domineering spirit, for I think it is a most 
abominable thing for a man in office to begin to lord it over people who are not 
in office; but it is in human nature. You have heard the story of the Irishman 
who was promoted to the position of foreman of a section gang. The next morning 
he went out and said to one of the men:</P>
<P>"Timothy O'Brien, come here."</P>
<P>When the man came, he said to him: "I discharge ye this morning, not because 
I have anything agin ye, but to show me authority." [Laughter]</P>
<P>He had been put in office, and the very first thing he wanted to do was to 
show his authority. That is human nature, but it is not Christianity; and it is 
to be abominated and avoided by every one who gets office, whether president of 
the General Conference, or principal of a school, or head of a department in a 
school. All should avoid that and give every man his rights and freedom and 
liberty.</P>
<P>As I said, I have met things that were hard to be understood, but time has 
helped me to understand them, and I can honestly say this morning that I go 
along in this movement without any doubts in my mind. When I take positions 
differing from other men, that is not proof that I am a doubter. I may be a 
doubter of their views or their interpretation, but that does not make me a 
doubter of the spirit of prophecy. I may differ with a man about his 
interpretation of the Bible, but that does not make me a doubter of the Bible. 
But there are men who just hold me right up as a doubter of the Testimonies 
because I take the position that the Testimonies are not verbally inspired, and 
that they have been worked up by the secretaries and put in proper grammatical 
shape. A few years ago a man came onto the nominating committee and wanted me 
kept out of the presidency because I did not believe the Testimonies were 
verbally inspired. That was because I differed with him on theory and 
interpretation; but I am the one to say whether I doubt the Testimonies, am I 
not? [Voices: Yes, yes!] And so are you. I want to leave the impression that I 
am not trying in any way to put any doubts in your mind. And O, I would feel 
terribly to have this denomination lose its true, genuine, proper faith in this 
gift that God gave to this church in these messages that have come to us. I want 
that we shall stay by this clear through to the end. [Amens]</P>
<P>Now with reference to the evidences: I differ with some of the brethren who 
have put together proofs or evidences of the genuineness of this gift, in this 
respect, - I believe that the strongest proof is found in the fruits of this 
gift to the church, not in physical and outward demonstrations. For instance, I 
have heard some ministers preach, and have seen it in writing, that Sister White 
once carried a heavy Bible - I believe they said it weighed forty pounds - on 
her out-stretched hand, and looking up toward the heavens quoted texts and 
turned the leaves over and pointed to the texts, with her eyes toward the 
heavens. I do not know whether that was ever done or not. I am not sure. I did 
not see it, and I do not know that I ever talked with anybody that did see it. 
But, brethren, I do not count that sort of thing as a very great proof. I do not 
think that is the best kind of evidence. If I were a stranger in an audience, 
and heard a preacher enlarging on that, I would have my doubts. That is, I would 
want to know if he saw it. He would have to say, No, he never did. Then I would 
ask, "Did you ever see the man that did see it?" And he would have to answer, 
"No, I never did."</P>
<P>Well, just how much of that is genuine, and how much has crawled into the 
story? - I do not know. But I do not think that is the kind of proof we want to 
use. It has been a long time since I have brought forward this sort of thing, - 
no breath in the body, and the eyes wide open. That may have accompanied the 
exercise of this gift in the early days, but it surely did not in the latter 
days, and yet I believe this gift was just as genuine and exercised just the 
same through these later years as in the early years.</P>
<P>C. P. Bollman: Isn't the same thing true of the Bible? Can't you size it up 
and believe it because of its fruit, what it does, and not because of the 
supernatural things related in it?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes. For instance, I would not take the story of David 
killing a lion and a bear, or of Samson killing a lion, and herald that to 
unbelievers or strangers as proof that the Bible was inspired, especially about 
Samson. Here is the way I would want to teach the boys and girls: I would want 
to begin with the beginning of this movement. At that time here was a gift given 
to this person; and with that gift to that individual, at the same time, came 
this movement of the three-fold message. They came right together in the same 
year. That gift was exercised steadily and powerfully in the development of this 
movement. The two were inseparably connected, and there was instruction given 
regarding this movement in all its phases through this gift, clear through for 
seventy years.</P>
<P>Then, in my own mind, I look the phases over. We will take one on the Bible. 
What shall be the attitude of the people in this movement toward the Bible? We 
know that that should be our authority without a creed and without the higher 
criticism. This is the Book. The position we hold today is the right position, 
we believe, - to magnify this Book, to get our instruction from this Book, and 
to preach this Book. The whole plan of redemption, everything that is necessary 
to salvation, is in this Book, and we do not have to go to anything outside of 
the Book to be saved. That has been the attitude of the spirit of prophecy 
toward this book from the beginning, hasn't it? [Voices: Yes.] And I suppose we 
can give credit to that gift for our attitude toward the Book as much as to any 
influence that anybody has exercised.</P>
<P>Now take the doctrines of the Bible: In all the other reformations that came 
up, the leaders were unable to rightly distinguish between all error and truth, 
- the Sabbath day, Baptism, the nature of man, etc., - and so they openly taught 
errors from this book. But now, when we come to this movement, we find the 
wonderful power of discrimination on the part of the spirit of prophecy, and I 
do not know of a single truth in this Book that is sat aside by the spirit of 
prophecy, nor a single biblical or theological error that came down through the 
dark ages that has been fostered by the spirit of prophecy and pressed upon the 
people that we have to discredit when we come to this Book. The doctrines of 
baptism, the law, the place and value and dignity of the Holy Spirit in the 
church, and all the other teachings that we have, have been magnified by this 
gift among us.</P>
<P>Take another line, - the activities of the church. Here is our attitude 
toward foreign missions or world evangelism. Who among us has ever exercised 
greater influence than this gift in behalf of world evangelism?</P>
<P>Take the question of liberal, unselfish support of the work. When you go to 
those writings, you find them full of exhortations, and if we would live them 
out better than we do our gifts would be greater, and our progress would be more 
rapid.</P>
<P>Then take our attitude on our service that we are to render to our fellowmen, 
Christian help work, - all those activities where a Christian should be a real 
blessing, an unselfish individual in the community to help people in their 
sorrows and misfortunes, their poverty and sickness, and every way that they 
need help. We find that the writings of the spirit of prophecy abound with 
exhortations to an unselfish life in living among our fellowmen.</P>
<P>Take the question of health and the medical missionary work, and all these 
activities, and take the service that should be put forth in behalf of the 
young. Where do you find in any movement that we read about where better 
instruction has been given as to the attention that should be given to the young 
people. Take the question of education: Why, brethren, none of our teachers ever 
have stood in advance of the counsel, that good wholesome instruction, that we 
find in the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>Those things I point to as really the convincing evidence of the origin of 
this gift, and the genuineness of it, - not to some ocular demonstrations that a 
few people have seen. I have no objections to persons speaking of those; but in 
close work with students I certainly would take the time to note down all these 
actual facts and hold them before the students, and show that from the beginning 
of this movement there has been inseparably and intimately and forcefully and 
aggressively connected with it this gift that has magnified everything good and 
has discounted, I think, everything bad. And if that is not evidence of the 
source of this gift among us, then I do not know what would be evidence.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: I am sure the teachers would like to have some suggestions on 
the use of the spirit of prophecy and its writings in their teaching work.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Well, give me a question that will be definite, in a 
particular way.</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: I would like to ask you to discuss for us the exegetical value 
of the Testimonies. Of course I think it is generally understood by us that 
there are many texts to which she makes no reference. There are many texts that 
she explains, and there may be other explanations that are equally true that she 
does not touch. But my question is really this: May we accept the explanations 
of scripture that she gives? Are those dependable?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I have always felt that they were. It may be that in some 
very critical matters there may be some difficulties; but I have used the 
writings for years in a way to clarify or elucidate the thought in the texts of 
scripture. Take "Desire of Ages" and "Patriarchs and Prophets." In reading them 
through I have found many instances of good illumination.</P>
<P>Does that answer your question? Do you mean whether students should resort to 
the writings for their interpretation of the Bible, or to get additional light? 
That is to say, is it necessary to have these writings in order to understand 
the Bible? Must we go to her explanations to get our meaning of the Bible? Is 
that the question or is that involved in it?</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: Not directly, but possibly indirectly. But I will give a more 
concrete example. We will suppose that a student comes for help on a certain 
scripture, and wants to know what it means. Is it proper for the teacher to 
explain that scripture, with perhaps other scriptures illuminating the text, and 
then bring in the spirit of prophecy also as additional light on the text? Or 
suppose two students differ on the meaning of a text, and they come to the 
teacher to find out what it means: Should the teacher explain the text and then 
use the Testimonies to support the position he takes? Or take still a third 
case: Suppose that two brethren, both of them believers in the Testimonies, and 
of course believers in the Bible primarily, have a difference of opinion on a 
certain text: Is it right for them in their study of that text to bring in the 
spirit of prophecy to aid in their understanding of it, or should they leave 
that out of the question entirely?</P>
<P>A. G.. Daniells: On that first point, I think this, that we are to get our 
interpretation from this Book, primarily. I think that the Book explains itself, 
and I think we can understand the Book, fundamentally, through the Book, without 
resorting to the Testimonies to prove up on it.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: The Spirit of prophecy says the Bible is its own expositor.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, but I have heard ministers say that the spirit of 
prophecy is the interpreter of the Bible. I heard it preached at the General 
Conference some years ago, when it was said that the only way we could 
understand the Bible was through the writings of the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>J. M. Anderson: And he also said "infallible interpreter."</P>
<P>C. M. Sorenson: That expression has been canceled. That is not our 
position.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: It is not our position, and it is not right that the spirit 
of prophecy is the only safe interpreter of the Bible. That is a false doctrine, 
a false view. It will not stand. Why, my friends what would all the people have 
done from John's day down to the present if there were no way to understand the 
Bible except through the writings of the spirit of prophecy! It is a terrible 
position to take! That is false, it is error. It is positively dangerous! What 
do those people do over in Roumania? We have hundreds of Sabbath-keepers there 
who have not seen a book on the spirit of prophecy? What do those people in 
China do? Can't they understand this Book only as we get the interpretation 
through the spirit of prophecy and then take it to them? That is heathenish!</P>
<P>L. L. Caviness: Do you understand that the early believers got their 
understanding from the Bible, or did it come through the spirit of prophecy?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: They got their knowledge of the Scriptures as they went along 
through the Scriptures themselves. It pains me to hear the way some people talk, 
that the spirit of prophecy led out and gave all the instruction, all the 
doctrines, to the pioneers, and they accepted them right along. That is not 
according to the writings themselves, "Early Writings." We are told how they 
did; they searched these scriptures together and studied and prayed over them 
until they got together on them. Sister White says in her works that for a long 
time she could not understand, that her mind was locked over these things, and 
the brethren worked their way along. She did not bring to this movement the 
Sabbath truth. She opposed the Sabbath truth. It did not seem right to her when 
Brother Bates presented it to her. But she had help from the Lord and when that 
clear knowledge was given her in that way, she was a weak child, and could not 
understand theology, but she had a clear outline given to her, and from that day 
to her death she never wavered a minute. But the Lord did not by revelation give 
to another all that He had given in this Book. He gave this Book, and He gave 
men brains and thinking power to study the Book.</P>
<P>I would not, in my class work, give out the idea at all to students that they 
can not understand this book only through the writings of Sister White. I would 
hold out to students, as I do to preachers, and in ministerial meetings, the 
necessity of getting our understanding of the Bible from the Bible itself, and 
using the spirit of prophecy to enlarge our view. I tell them not to be lazy 
about studying the Book, and not to rummage around first for something that has 
been written on a point that they can just swallow without study. I think that 
would be a very dangerous thing for our ministers to get into that habit. And 
there are some, I must confess, who will hunt around to find a statement in the 
Testimonies and spend no time in deep study of the Book. They do not have a 
taste for it, and if they can look around and find something that is already 
made out, they are glad to pick that up and go along without studying the Bible. 
The earnest study of the Bible is the security, the safety of a man. He must 
come to the book itself and get it by careful study, and then whatever he finds 
in the spirit of prophecy or any other writings that will help him and throw 
light and clarify his vision on it, - that is alright. Does that cover your 
point?</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: It does to a certain extent; and yet when you take the case of 
those two brethren who accept the Bible and the Testimonies, but still have a 
difference of interpretation that they want help on, - is it right for them to 
use the Testimonies in their study of that text, as well as the Bible?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I think it is right to take the whole trend of teaching and 
thought that is put through the Testimonies on that subject. If I am perplexed 
about a text, and in my study of the spirit of prophecy I find something that 
makes it clear, I take that. I think Brother Prescott illustrates that in this 
matter of Matthew 24, of which there is a clear outline in the spirit of 
prophecy.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott:For two or three years I spent a lot of time in the study of 
the 8th chapter of Daniel, to get what I thought to be the proper interpretation 
of that chapter. I got up to the point one time where I felt that I must get 
that clearer, where I could use it, and I made it the special subject of prayer. 
I was over in England, stopping at the home of a brother there. It came to me 
just like a voice, "Read what it says in 'Patriarchs and Prophets' on that 
subject." I turned right around to a book case back of me, and took up 
"Patriarchs and Prophets" and began to look through it. I came right to the 
chapter that dealt with the subject, and I found exactly the thing I wanted to 
clarify my mind on that subject. It greatly helped me. That, Brother Daniells,is 
my own personal experience over this matter that Brother Taylor raises.</P>
<P>In connection with what Brother Taylor has asked, I would like to suggest 
this, Whether a comment on the spirit of prophecy upon the Authorized Version 
establishes that version as the correct version against the Revised Version, 
where the reading is changed; and if one accepted the Revised Version, it would 
throw out the comment made in the spirit of prophecy. I have a definite case in 
mind.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Just in addition to that other point: I had a similar 
experience when I was in Europe the last time, when I was greatly exercised 
about the finishing of this work. I felt so anxious about it, and I said, "Lord, 
what is the vital, important thing necessary to get this work finished?" I was 
at Friedensau, and in my room praying earnestly over that matter. And on my 
knees I took this little book, "Christ's Object Lessons," and began to read. I 
had really got weary with prayer, and stopped to read a little, and the first 
thing I found was this: [Not verified with the book] " _______ receive the 
Spirit of Christ, you will grow and bring forth fruit. Your faith will increase, 
your convictions deepen, your love be made perfect. The fruit of the Spirit is 
love, joy, peace, etc. This fruit can never perish. When the fruit is brought 
forth, immediately He putteth in the sickle because the harvest is ripe. That is 
the finish of the work. Christ is waiting with longing desire for the 
manifestation of Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be 
perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim His own. It is 
the privilege of every Christian not only to look for but to hasten the coming 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Were all who profess His name bearing fruit to His 
glory, how quickly the whole world would be sown with the seed of the gospel! 
Quickly the last great harvest would be ripened, and Christ would come to gather 
the precious grain."</P>
<P>I just stayed there on my knees and praised God for that gleam of light that 
came to me. It took that text in Mark, "When the fruit is brought forth, 
immediately He putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come." It shows just 
the steps to take. I have felt from that day to this that this denomination 
should be on its knees praying for the infilling of the Holy Spirit, that we 
might quickly finish the work.</P>
<P>So, Brother Taylor, I would feel that the view that would be made clear by 
the notes in the spirit of prophecy would be the safe view to take.</P>
<P>W. F. Howell: I had a little experience on that same point that came to me 
during this Conference, and it made an impression on my mind. I have always 
claimed a part of the fifth chapter of Hebrews for the teacher. I have resorted 
to it many times for help from a teacher's viewpoint. Last week we were studying 
here the divine call to teach, and I resorted to this chapter for some thought, 
and in connection with it I read a comment in the spirit of prophecy. I think 
the Spirit of the Lord led me to it. It says this is for the teacher: "He who 
seeks to transform humanity must himself understand humanity." I thought that 
was good for the teacher. "Only through sympathy, faith and love can men be 
reached and uplifted. Here Christ stands revealed as the Master-Teacher. Of all 
that ever dwelt on the earth, He alone has perfect understanding of the human 
soul." Then comes this scripture from the fifth of Hebrews: "We have not a high 
priest - Master-Teacher, for the priests were teachers - that can not be touched 
with the feelings of our infirmities, one that hath not been in all points 
tempted like as we are." That brought a flash of light on the fifth chapter of 
Hebrews I had never received before. Then I took that idea of the high-priest 
being a master-teacher, and I found the best outline of the qualifications of a 
teacher I could find in any one place in the Bible; and now I claim the whole of 
the fifth chapter for the teacher.</P>
<P>F. M. Wilcox: I have a paragraph here I would like to read. This is so 
completely in harmony with what Brother Daniells has expressed that I thought I 
would like to read it. James White, in the Review of 1851, wrote this and it was 
republished again four years later, as expressing what he considered the 
denominational view with respect to the Testimonies back there:</P>
<P>"GIFTS OF THE GOSPEL CHURCH"</P>
<P>"The gifts of the Spirit should all have their proper places. The Bible is an 
everlasting rock. It is our rule of faith and practice. In it the man of God is 
'thoroughly furnished unto all good works.' If every member of the church of 
Christ was holy, harmless, and separate from sinners, and searched the Holy 
Scriptures diligently and with much prayer for duty, with the aid of the Holy 
Spirit, we think, they would be able to learn their whole duty in 'all good 
works.' Thus 'the man of God may be perfect.' But as the reverse exists, and 
ever has existed, God in much mercy has pitied the weakness of his people, and 
has set the gifts in the gospel church to correct our errors, and to lead us to 
his living Word. Paul says that they are for the 'perfecting of the saints,' 
'till we all come in the unity of the faith.' The extreme necessity of the 
church in its imperfect state is God's opportunity to manifest the Spirit.</P>
<P>"Every Christian is therefore in duty bound to take the Bible as a perfect 
rule of faith and duty. He should pray fervently to be aided by the Holy Spirit 
in searching the Scriptures for the whole truth, and for his whole duty. He is 
not at liberty to turn from them to learn his duty through any of the gifts. We 
say that the very moment he does, he places the gifts in a wrong place, and 
takes an extremely dangerous position. The Word should be in front, the eye of 
the church should be placed upon it, as the rule to walk by, and the fountain of 
wisdom, from which to learn duty in 'all good works.' But if a portion of the 
church err from the truths of the Bible, and become weak and sickly, and the 
flock become scattered, so that it seems necessary for God to employ the gifts 
of the Spirit to correct, revive, and heal the erring, we should let him work. 
Yea, more, we should pray for him to work, and plead earnestly that he would 
work by the Spirit's power, and bring the scattered sheep to his fold. Praise 
the Lord, he will work. Amen." - Review and Herald of April 21, 1851.</P>
<P>We wrote the above article on the gifts of the gospel church four years 
since. It was published in the first volume of the Review. One object in 
republishing it is that our readers may see for themselves what our position has 
ever been on this subject, that they may be better prepared to dispose of the 
statements of those who seek to injure us.</P>
<P>The position that the Bible, and the Bible alone, is the rule of faith and 
duty, does not shut out the gifts which God set in the church. To reject them is 
shutting out that part of the Bible which presents them. We say, Let us have a 
whole Bible, and let that, and that alone, be our rule of faith and duty. Place 
the gifts where they belong, and all is harmony. - Review and Herald of October 
3, 1854.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: How should we use the writings of the spirit of prophecy as 
an authority by which to settle historical questions?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Well, now, as I understand it, Sister White never claimed to 
be an authority on history, and never claimed to be a dogmatic teacher on 
theology. She never outlined a course of theology, like Mrs. Eddy's book on 
teaching. She just gave out fragmentary statements, but left the pastors and 
evangelists and preachers to work out all these problems of scripture and of 
theology and of history. She never claimed to be an authority on history; and as 
I have understood it, where the history that related to the interpretation of 
prophecy was clear and expressive, she wove it into her writings; but I have 
always understood that, as far as she was concerned, she was ready to correct in 
revision such statements as she thought should be corrected. I have never gone 
to her writings, and taken the history that I found in her writings, as the 
positive statement of history regarding the fulfillment of prophecy. I do not 
know how others may view that, but I have felt that I should deal with history 
in the same way that I am exhorted to deal with the Bible, - prove it all 
carefully and thoroughly, and then let her go on and make such revisions from 
time to time as seem best.</P>
<P>Just one more thought: Now you know something about that little book, "The 
Life of Paul." You know the difficulty we got into about that. We could never 
claim inspiration in the whole thought and makeup of the book, because it has 
been thrown aside because it was badly put together. Credits were not given to 
the proper authorities, and some of that crept into "The Great Controversy," - 
the lack of credits; and in the revision of that book those things were 
carefully run down and made right. Personally that has never shaken my faith, 
but there are men who have been greatly hurt by it, and I think it is because 
they claimed too much for these writings. Just as Brother White says, there is a 
danger in going away from the Book, and claiming too much. Let it have its full 
weight, just as God has fixed it, and then I think we will stand without being 
shaken when some of these things do appear that we can not harmonize with our 
theory.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: There is another experience that you know of that applies to 
what Brother Taylor has brought up. Some of the brethren here remember very well 
a serious controversy over the interpretation of the 8th chapter of Daniel, and 
there were some of the brethren who ranged themselves against what was called 
the new view, and they took her writings to uphold their position. She wrote to 
those brethren and instructed them not to use her writings to settle that 
controversy. I think that ought to be remembered as being her own counsel when 
brethren that did claim to believe the Bible and the spirit of prophecy were 
divided over an interpretation, and it was a matter of public controversy.</P>
<P>J. N. Anderson: How far would you take that word from Sister White to be a 
general statement about her writings?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I think it was especially on the case then, but I think we 
have to use the same judgment about using her writings in other cases.</P>
<P>C. A. Shull: Just how shall we use the Testimonies in the class room? What 
shall be our attitude toward them in the line of history, especially? Before I 
knew that there was any statement in the spirit of prophecy regarding the 
experience of John, I stated to the class that there was a tradition that John 
had been thrown into a caldron of boiling oil, and a student immediately 
produced that statement in the Testimonies that John was thrown into the boiling 
oil. Now, I want to know, was she given a divine revelation that John was thrown 
into a vat of boiling oil?</P>
<P>Now another question, on the taking of Babylon. Mrs. White in the spirit of 
prophecy mentions that Babylon was taken according to the historian, by the 
turning aside of the waters. Modern scholarship says it was not taken that way. 
What should be our attitude in regard to such things?</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams: We have that question to meet every year.</P>
<P>E F. Albertsworth: I have been confronted in my classes by students who come 
with the Testimonies and endeavor to settle a question by quoting where she 
says, "I have been shown." They said that of all things that must settle the 
matter. I have wanted to know what attitude we should take on a question of that 
kind.</P>
<P>C. P. Bollman: Wouldn't that latter question require a concrete example?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, I think it would.</P>
<P>E. F. Albertsworth: I do not recall the example; but some of the students 
would say that meant she had a direct revelation, and others would say that 
meant that she was shown by people around her.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I do not think that is what she means when she says that. 
When she was shown, it was by the angel or the revelation that was made to her. 
I feel sure that was her meaning.</P>
<P>E. F. Albertsworth: I have found students who had doubts about that.</P>
<P>W. G. Wirth: Suppose we do have a conflict between the authorized and revised 
versions?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: That question was up before. You must not count me an 
authority for I am just like you in the matter. I have to form my own opinions. 
I do not think Sister White meant at all to establish the certainty of a 
translation. I do not think she had that in mind, or had anything to do with 
putting her seal of approval on the authorized version or on the revised version 
when she quoted that. She uses whichever version helps to bring out the thought 
she has most clearly.</P>
<P>With reference to this historical matter, I cannot say anything more than I 
have said, that I never have understood that Sister White undertook to settle 
historical questions. I visited her once over this matter of the "daily," and I 
took along with me that old chart, - as early a chart as we have access to, 
-</P>
<P>C. P. Bollman: The same chart that Elder Haskell sells?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, it was that same chart. I took that and laid it on her 
lap, and I took "Early Writings" and read it to her, and then I told her of the 
controversy. I spent a long time with her. It was one of her days when she was 
feeling cheery and rested, and so I explained it to her quite fully. I said, 
"Now here you say that you were shown that the view of the 'daily' that the 
brethren held was correct. Now," I said, "there are two parts here in this 
'daily' that you quote. One is this period of time, the 2300 years, and the 
other is what the 'daily' itself was."</P>
<P>I went over that with her, and every time, as quick as I would come to that 
time, she would say, "Why, I know what was shown me, that that period of 2300 
days was fixed, and that there would be no definite time after that. The 
brethren were right when they reached that 1844 date."</P>
<P>Then I would leave that, and I would go on about this "Daily." "Why," she 
said, "Brother Daniells, I do not know what that 'daily' is, whether it is 
paganism or Christ's ministry. That was not the thing that was shown me." And 
she would go into that twilight zone right away. Then when I would come back to 
the 2300 years, she would straighten. right up and say, "That is the thing we 
never can move away from. I tell you, you never can move away from that 2300 
year period. It was shown to me that that was fixed." And I believe it was, 
brethren. You might just as well try to move me out of the world as to try to 
move me on that question, - not because she says it, but I believe it was 
clearly shown to her by the Lord. But on this other, when she says she was not 
shown what the "daily" was, I believe that, and I take "Early Writings" 100% on 
that question of the "daily," fixing that period. That is the thing she talks 
about, and I take the Bible with it, and I take the Bible as to what the "daily" 
itself is.</P>
<P>So when it comes to those historical questions about the taking of Babylon, I 
think this, brethren, we ought not to let every little statement in history that 
we find lead us away from the spirit of prophecy. You know historians contradict 
each other, don't you? Of course your work is to get back, get back, get back to 
the fountain head, the original thing; and when you get back there, and get it 
perfectly clear, I do not believe that if Sister White were here to speak to you 
today, she would authorize you to take a historical fact, supposed to be a fact, 
that she had incorporated in the book, and put it up against an actual thing in 
history. We talked with her about that when "Great Controversy" was being 
revised, and I have letters in my file in the vault there where we were warned 
against using Sister White as a historian. She never claimed to be that. We were 
warned against setting up statements found in her writings against the various 
history that there is on a fact. That is where I stand. I do not have to meet it 
with students, and I do not have to explain myself in a congregation. I suppose 
I have it easier than you teachers do.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: On that very point you mention as to the capture of Babylon, 
one of the most recent editions of the Bible (?) takes the position of Herodotus 
against the .........., and he says: "Why should we discount the writings on 
parchment in favor of the writings on clay?"</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: That is what I mean, that we should not allow every 
historical statement that we find that contradicts the Testimonies to set us 
wild. If there are two authorities of equal value on that point, bring up the 
authority that is in harmony with what we have.</P>
<P>C. A. Shull: We teachers have a great responsibility on us to take the right 
attitude. If we say that a certain thing in the Testimonies is not correct, 
students are likely to carry away the impression that we do not have faith in 
the Testimonies.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: There are two ways to hurt students in this matter. One way 
is to discount the Testimonies and cast a little bit of question and doubt on 
them. I would never do that, brethren, in the school room.</P>
<P>No matter how much I was perplexed, I would never cast a doubt in the mind of 
a student. I would take hours to explain matters to ground the student in it. 
Casting doubts and reflections is one way to hurt a student. Another way is to 
take an extreme and unwarranted position. You can do that and pass it over; but 
when that student gets out and gets in contact with things, he may be shaken, 
and perhaps shaken clear out and away. I think we should be candid and honest 
and never put a claim forth that is not well founded simply to appear to 
believe. You will have to be careful in giving this instruction, because many of 
the students have heard from their parents things that are not so, and they hear 
from preachers things that are not so, and so their foundation is false.</P>
<P>I must refer again to the attitude of A. T. Jones. In his heyday you know he 
just drank the whole thing in, and he would hang a man on a word. I have seen 
him take just a word in the Testimonies and hang to it, and that would settle 
everything, -just a word. I was with him when he made a discovery, - or, if he 
didn't make it, he appeared to make it, - and that was that there were words in 
the Testimonies and writings of Sister White that God did not order her to put 
in there, that there were words which she did not put in by divine inspiration, 
the Lord picking the words, but that somebody had helped to fix that up. And so 
he took two testimonies and compared them, and he got into great trouble. He 
went on with Dr. Kellogg, where he could just pick things to pieces.</P>
<P>F. M. Wilcox: Back in the 60's or 70's a General Conference in session passed 
this resolution, - they said, we recognize that the Testimonies have been 
prepared under great pressure and stress of circumstances, and that the wording 
is not always the happiest, and we recommend their republication with such 
changes as will bring them to a standard.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I would like to get hold of that resolution. Now, brethren, I 
want to ask you honestly if there is a man here who has had doubt created in 
your mind from my attitude and the positions I have taken? [VOICES: No! No!] Or 
is there one of you that thinks I am shaky on the Testimonies? - I will not say 
that [. . .] thinks my position is not just right, for you might not agree with 
me, but from what I have said, is there a tendency to lead you to believe that I 
am shaky, and that some time I will help to get you away from the Testimonies? 
[Several decided no's were heard.]</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: In your talk a few evenings ago I agreed 100% in everything you 
said. Today there is just one question in my mind.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Let us have it.</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: That is regarding those outward manifestations, those things of 
perhaps a miraculous nature. I do not know whether you intend to carry the 
impression that you discredit those or that you simply would not teach them. If 
it is that you would not hold them up as proof that the work is inspired, I am 
heartily in agreement with that. On the other hand, if you take the position 
that those things are not to be relied on, that Elder Loughborough and others 
are mistaken about these things, I should have to disagree with you.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: No, I do not discount them nor disbelieve them; but they are 
not the kind of evidence I would use with students or with unbelievers.</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: I agree with that.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I do not question them, but I do not think they are the best 
kind of evidence to produce. For instance, I do not think the best kind of proof 
for me to give an audience on the Sabbath question or the nature of man or 
baptism, is to go and read Sister White's writings to them. I believe the best 
proof I can give is the Bible. Perhaps you will remember that it fell to me to 
preach Sister White's funeral sermon; and if you will remember, I took that 
occasion to give evidence of her high calling. I did not give a long list of 
fruits and miraculous evidences. I knew the matter would be published to the 
world in hundreds of papers, and I wanted to give them something that would be a 
high authority, and this is what I gave:</P>
<P>First, that she stood with the word of God from Genesis to Revelation in all 
its teaching.</P>
<P>Then, she stood with mankind in his highest endeavors to help mankind, - 
elaborating on those points.</P>
<P>That is what I mean, Brother Taylor; but I do not discount those other 
things.</P>
<P>What I want to know is this, brethren: Does my position appear to be of such 
a character that you would be led to think I am shaky? [VOICES: No!] If you 
think it,just say it right out! I do not want to do that, but I have to be 
honest, - I can not camouflage in a thing like this. I have stood through it 
about forty years unshaken, and I think it is a safe position; but if I were 
driven to take the position that some do on the Testimonies, I would be shaken. 
[VOICE: That's right!] I would not know where to stand, for I can not say that 
white is black and black is white.</P>
<P>H. C. Lacey: To us there is no doubt that you believe the Testimonies, but 
will you mind my adding another personal note to it?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: No.</P>
<P>H. C. Lacey: It is this: Those who have not heard you, as we have here, and 
are taking the other side of the question, - some of them are deliberately 
saying that neither you nor Professor Prescott believe the Testimonies. For 
instance, I went out to Mt. Vernon and I met the graduating class there, and 
when the exercises were over, I had a private talk with three or four of those 
young people, and they told me that they certainly understood that our General 
Conference men down here - they did not mean me or Brother Sorenson - did not 
believe the Testimonies.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: You are not telling us news.</P>
<P>H. C. Lacey: We as teachers are in a terribly hard position. We have got 
nearly down to bed-rock in the questions that have been asked here; but the 
students do get right down to bed-rock on some of these things, and we need to 
get a little deeper here. There are people here at these meetings who do not 
dare to ask certain questions that have come up in their minds or in private 
talks. But you know that the teacher is in a very difficult position.</P>
<P>On that matter of the capture of Babylon, I have felt free to say that I 
thought the evidence was that Cyrus did not capture it that way, but we would 
hold the matter in abeyance and simply study it. Suppose now that further 
tablets would come to light, and other evidence would be brought in to prove 
indisputably that Cyrus did not capture Babylon that way, would it be right to 
say that if there is a revision of that book, "Patriarchs and Prophets," which 
endorses, in one casual sentence, that old view, - the revision would be brought 
into harmony with recently discovered facts?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I think that is the position Sister White occupies. I think 
that is what she has done. I never understood that she put infallibility into 
the historical quotations.</P>
<P>H. C. Lacey: But there are some who do understand it.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: It is interesting to know that even a higher critic like 
George Adams Smith agrees with Herodotus (?) on that.</P>
<P>Brother Daniells was speaking about this question of physical outward 
evidences. One of those evidences has been that the eyes were open, as you will 
remember, and this scripture in the 24th chapter of Numbers is always referred 
to, showing that it is in harmony with that. But you read the Revised Version, 
and you find it reads, "And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of 
Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith:" In this text it puts it 
just the other way. Then I would not want to use that as an argument, that the 
prophet's eyes were open.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: That is what I mean by referring to secondary matters.</P>
<P>H. C. Lacey: In our estimate of the spirit of prophecy, isn't its value to us 
more in the spiritual light it throws into our own hearts and lives than in the 
intellectual accuracy in historical and theological matters. Ought we not to 
take those writings as the voice of the Spirit of our hearts, instead of as the 
voice of the teacher to our heads? And isn't the final proof of the spirit of 
prophecy its spiritual value rather than its historical accuracy?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, I think so.</P>
<P>J. N. Anderson: Would you set about to explain things as you have this 
morning? Would you explain that you do not think the Testimonies are to be taken 
as final in the matter of historical data, etc., so as to justify a 
position?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Who gives the teaching in the school on the spirit of 
prophecy? Is it the Bible teacher? How do you get that question before the 
students?</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: Both Bible and history teachers catch it.</P>
<P>W. H. Wakeham: It comes up in every Bible class.</P>
<P>H.C. Lacey: Wouldn't it be a splendid thing if a little pamphlet were written 
setting forth in plain, simple, straight-forward style the facts as we have 
them, - simple, sacred facts, - so that we could put them into the hands of 
inquiring students?</P>
<P>Voice: Our enemies would publish it everywhere.</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: I think it would be a splendid thing if our brethren were a 
little conservative on these things. We had a man come to our Union and spend an 
hour and a half on the evidences of the spirit of prophecy through Sister White. 
The impression was conveyed that practically every word that she spoke, and 
every letter she wrote, whether personal or otherwise, was a divine inspiration. 
Those things make it awfully hard for our teachers and ministers.</P>
<P>W. G. Wirth: I want to second what Professor Lacey has brought out. I wish 
you general men would get out something for us, because we are the ones that 
suffer.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: To my certain knowledge, a most earnest appeal was made for 
that from her office to issue such a statement, and they would not do it.</P>
<P>C. P. Bollman: It wasn't made to her, though.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: No, but it was made to those who were handling her 
manuscripts.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Some of those statements like what Brother Wilcox read here 
this morning have been up a number of times, and Brother White always took a 
good sensible position.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Brother Wilcox had a letter from Sister White herself that he 
read.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: When these things were under pretty sharp controversy, W. C. 
White, for his mother, sent out things that we had in our vaults here that 
greatly modified this, and helped to smooth out these wrinkles and get a 
reasonable ground on which to stand. I do not know but what perhaps the General 
Conference Committee might appoint a committee to do this, and have reliable, 
responsible men that the people do not question at all take hold of that and 
bring out these facts. It does seem to me that in our schools there ought to be 
an agreement among the teachers. The history and Bible teachers and others that 
have to do with these things should get together and have their stories and 
their teaching alike, if possible. The truth should be given to those students, 
and when you give the truth to them you will have them founded and established 
on this without trouble. But when these erroneous views are given them, they get 
a false idea and then there is danger when an honest man takes the true side and 
states his position.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: It seems to me that the point is of very great importance. I 
have been somewhat perplexed on this matter. We have talked over things very 
freely and frankly here at the other meeting and at this, and I think the 
teachers here at [sic] all satisfied as to the place that is to be given to the 
spirit of prophecy in its relation to their work. But these teachers, when they 
get back to their places of work, will have all kinds of questions put to them, 
and it has been a question with me as to how far a teacher ought to go with a 
class of young people or with an indiscriminate body to deal with and attempt to 
bring out the things that they have heard here and have received and believed 
for themselves. I think there is where the difficulty is going to be. We have 
only two teachers here out of an entire faculty. Some other member of the 
faculty might not be cleared up on these things. There may be teachers who are 
endeavoring to teach science out of the spirit of prophecy; or another teacher 
who has not had the benefit of this discussion, may have some other viewpoint. 
And it really puts these teachers in a very hard situation. If there is anything 
that can be done by way of putting something in the hands of the teachers so 
that they could give the true representation in the matter, I think it would be 
a very great help.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Can you explain how it is that two brethren can disagree on 
the inspiration of the Bible, one holding to the verbal inspiration and the 
other opposed to it, and yet no disturbance be created in the denomination 
whatever. That situation is right here before us. But if two brethren take the 
same attitude on the spirit of prophecy, one holding to verbal inspiration and 
the other discrediting it, he that does not hold to the verbal inspiration is 
discredited.</P>
<P>F.M. Wilcox: Do you believe that a man who doesn't believe in the verbal 
inspiration of the Bible believes the Bible?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: I do not have any trouble over it at all. I have a different 
view myself. If a man does not believe in the verbal inspiration of the Bible, 
he is still in good standing; but if he says he does not believe in the verbal 
inspiration of the Testimonies, he is discounted right away. I think it is an 
unhealthful situation. It puts the spirit of prophecy above the Bible.</P>
<P>W. G. Wirth: Really, that is my biggest problem. I shall certainly be 
discredited if I go back and give this view. I would like to see some published 
statement given out by those who lead this work so that if that thing should 
come up there would be some authority back of it, because I am in for a lot of 
trouble on that thing. I would like to see something done, because that 
education is going right on, and our students are being sent out with the idea 
that the Testimonies are verbally inspired, and woe be to the man out where I am 
that does not line up to that.</P>
<P>Now as to health reform: Frequently a student will come to me and quote what 
Sister White says about butter. But we serve butter on our tables right along. 
And they will bring up about meat, how under no consideration is that to be 
eaten. And I know that that is unreasonable, and there are times when it is 
necessary to eat meat. What shall we do about that? I would like a little light 
on some of those details, as to whether we ought to take them at full value.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I am willing to answer part of that, for I have had it about 
a thousand times. Take this question of health reform. It is well known from the 
writings themselves and from personal contact with Sister White, and from common 
sense, that in traveling and in knowledge of different parts of the world, that 
the instruction set forth in the Testimonies was never intended to be one great 
wholesale blanket regulation for peoples' eating and drinking, and it applies to 
various individuals according to their physical condition and according to the 
situation in which they find themselves. I have always explained it that way to 
our ministers in ministers' meetings. We had a ministers' meeting over in 
Scandinavia, and we had one man there from the "land of the midnight sun," up in 
Hammerfest where you never grow a banana or an apple or a peach, and hardly even 
a green thing. It is snow and cold there nearly all the time, and the people 
live to a large extent on fish and various animal foods that they get there. We 
had sent a nurse from Christiania up there as a missionary. He had the strict 
idea of the diet according to the Testimonies, and he would not touch a fish or 
a bit of reindeer, nor any kind of animal food, and he was getting poor; because 
missionaries that are sent out do not have much money, and they cannot import 
fresh fruits; and it was in the days when even canned goods were not shipped 
much. The fellow nearly starved to death. He came down to attend that meeting, 
and he was nearly as white as your dress [speaking to Sister Williams]. He had 
hardly any blood in his body. I talked to him, and I said, "Brother Olson, what 
is the matter with you? We will have to bring you away from up there if you do 
not get better. You have no red blood corpuscles in your blood." I talked with 
him a while, and finally asked him, "What do you live on?"</P>
<P>"Well," he said, "I live a good deal on the north wind."</P>
<P>I said, "You look like it, sure enough."</P>
<P>We went on talking, and I found out that the man wasn't eating much but 
potatoes and starchy foods, - just a limited dietary. I went at him with all the 
terror I could inspire for such foolishness.</P>
<P>Voice:Did you make any impression?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, I did. And I got other brethren to join me. We told that 
man he would be buried up there if he tried to live that way. We talked with him 
straight about it.</P>
<P>When I got back to this country I talked with Sister White about it, and she 
said, "Why don't the people use common sense? Why don't they know that we are to 
be governed by the places we are located?" You will find in a little testimony a 
caution thrown out, modifying the extreme statements that were made.</P>
<P>F. M. Wilcox: Sister White says in a copy of the Instructor that there are 
some classes that she would not say should not eat some meat.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: There are very conscientious men and ministers who are very 
much afraid they will eat something they ought not to. On that very point Paul 
says that the kingdom of God is not meat or drink, but righteousness and peace; 
and we are working and trying to get through to the kingdom just as much on the 
ground of works by eating or not eating as by any other thing in this world. You 
never can put down vegetarianism as the way to heaven. I have been over in India 
where they are mighty strict about their eating, but they do not get 
righteousness that way.</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: It is true of all works, isn't it?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Certainly. You take men who have never allowed a piece of 
animal food to pass their lips, and some of them are the most tyrannical, brutal 
men; and when we try to reach them with the gospel, we have to tell them that is 
not the way to God, that they will have to come and believe in the Lord Jesus 
Christ and have His righteousness imputed to them on confession, forgiveness, 
and all of that. We have people among us that are just as much in danger of 
trying to establish this righteousness by works in the matter of the dietary as 
the world has seen in any thing. You know from what Sister White brought out on 
the matter of righteousness that it was not her purpose to put down eating and 
drinking as the way to heaven. It has its place. It is important, and I would 
not want to see this denomination swing away over to the position of other 
denominations; but I do not like to hear of teaching that would lead this people 
to fall back on eating and drinking for righteousness, for Paul said that is not 
the way. I do not think proper caution was used in putting out some of these 
things, and I have told Sister White so.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams: You mean in publishing them?</P>
<P>A .G. Daniells: Yes, when they were written. I told Sister White that it 
seems to me that if conditions in the arctic regions and in the heart of China 
and other places had been taken into account, some of those things would have 
been modified. "Why," she said, "yes, if the people are not going to use their 
judgment, then of course we will have to fix it for them." It seemed so sensible 
to me. Sister White was never a fanatic, she was never an extremist. She was a 
level-headed woman. She was well-balanced. I found that so during a period of 40 
years of association with her. When we were down in Texas, and old Brother White 
was breaking down, that woman just got the most beautiful venison every day to 
eat, and my wife cooked it; and he would sit down and eat some of that and say, 
"O, Ellen, that is just the thing!" She did not hold him up and make him live on 
a diet of starch! I always found her well-balanced. There are some people who 
are extremists, who are fanatical; but I do not think we should allow those 
people to fix the platform and guide this denomination. I do not propose to do 
it, for one. And yet I believe that we should use all the caution and all the 
care that is set out for the maintenance of health. And brethren, I have tried 
to do it, but I have not lived all my life on the strictest dietary set down 
there. I have had to go all over this world, and as you know, I have had to be 
exposed to all the disease germs. I have had to live on a very spare dietary in 
places in my travel, and I have. lived on wheels, and under great pressure, and 
it was prophesied when I went into this in 1901 that a decade would finish me, 
and I would either be a broken-down old man on the shelf or in the grave. That 
is the way my friends talked, and they sympathized with me, and regretted that I 
ever took this position; but I said to myself, "By the grace of God, I will live 
in every possible way just right as far as I know it, to conserve my strength." 
This is my 19th year, and I am not broken down, and I am not on the shelf or in 
the grave. I am strong and well. I am weary, but I can get rested. I have tried 
to be honest and to be true to my sense of what was the right thing to do, and 
it has kept me well and strong. That is the basis on which I propose to work. I 
do not propose to have any extremist lay down the law to me as to what I shall 
eat up in the heart of China. I propose to use my sense as to what I ought to 
eat in those places where you can not get a green thing, hardly.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams: In the interior of Africa, we had to cook everything we ate, 
so as to kill the germs.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Why, yes, in China you must sterilize your hands and your 
knife, and if you eat an apple, it must be sterilized after it is peeled, and 
even then it is not always safe. I do not think we have to take an extreme 
position on the question of the diet for all classes. We are not all alike. What 
is good for one man is not good for another. I have seen Elder Irwin sit down 
and eat two or three raw apples at night just before going to bed; but one apple 
at night would upset me so that my tongue would be covered with fur and my head 
all swelled up. I would not eat one if you would give me five dollars. I count 
that health reform, to reject that which I know injures me and take that which I 
know strengthens me and maintains me in the strongest physical trim for service 
and hard work. That is my health reform. Raw apples are good for people that 
have the right digestion for them; but if a person hasn't that sort of 
digestion, he must lay down the law, No raw apples for him.</P>
<P>That is the way a lot of things got into the Testimonies. They were many of 
them written for individuals in various states of health, and then they were 
hurried into the Testimonies without proper modification. That is not to say 
that they are false things, but it is to say that they do not apply to every 
individual the world over alike. And you can not put a health-reform regime or 
rule down for the whole world alike, because of the different physical 
conditions that maintain. That is what I tell in ministers' meetings and I do 
not think I destroy the force of the message at all, only to the extremist.</P>
<P>Brother Waldorf: I have had no trouble for over twenty years with the spirit 
of prophecy or with the Bible. The more I have studied both the more firmly I 
have become convinced on this platform. I have read the whole of higher 
criticism right through, and the other side of it. There are 50,000 different 
readings in the Bible. There are many mistakes that were made in transcribing. 
Now in the matter of historical complication, I take the Bible and the spirit of 
prophecy exactly alike.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Here is one illustration of a mistake in the Bible: In Samuel 
it says a man lifted up his hand against 800 men whom he slew; then in 
Chronicles this same thing is spoken of, and it says that he lifted up his hand 
against 300 men, whom he slew.</P>
<P>Waldorf: I have never held up the spirit of prophecy as being infallible. But 
students come to me from different teachers, having different views. One comes 
and says Professor Lacey taught me this way, and another comes from Professor 
Johnson who taught him some other way. There are lots of them coming to the 
medical college that way from different teachers. They do not know whether every 
word of the spirit of prophecy is inspired or not. I teach them this way: That 
when this message was first started, God brought this gift of prophecy into the 
church, and through this gift God has approved of the major doctrines that we 
hold right down from 1844. I for one hold that the gift of the spirit of 
prophecy was given to us in order to get the mold, lest we should trust human 
reasoning and modern scholarship, for I believe that modern scholarship has gone 
bankrupt when it comes to Greek and Hebrew.</P>
<P>As for meat eating, I haven't touched meat for twenty-one years; but I buy 
meat for my wife. I often go into a butcher shop and get the very best they have 
in order to keep her in life. I never will use the Testimonies as a sledge 
hammer on my brother.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I will tell you one thing, a great victory will be gained if 
we get a liberal spirit so that we will treat brethren who differ with us on the 
interpretation of the Testimonies in the same Christian way we treat them when 
they differ on the interpretation of the Bible. That will be a good deal gained, 
and it is worth gaining, I want to tell you, for I have been under criticism 
ever since the controversy started in Battle Creek. Isn't it a strange thing 
that when I and some of my associates fought that heresy year after year, and we 
got message after message from the spirit of prophecy - some of them very 
comforting and uplifting messages - and all that time we were counted as 
heretics on the spirit of prophecy? How do you account for that? Why didn't the 
spirit of prophecy get after us? I claim that I know as well as any man whether 
I believe in the spirit of prophecy or not. I do not ask people to accept my 
views, but I would like the confidence of brothers where we differ in 
interpretation. If we can engender that spirit, it will be a great help; and I 
believe we have to teach it right in our schools.</P>
<P>Suppose students come to you with questions about the Bible that you do not 
know what to do with, - or do you always know? I would like to go to a teacher 
for a year that would tell me everything in here that puzzles me! What do you do 
when students come to you with such questions?</P>
<P>W. H. Wakeham: I tell them I do not know, and I do not lose their confidence, 
either.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Well, when they come to you with something in the spirit of 
prophecy that is puzzling, why not say, as Peter did, that there are some things 
hard to be understood. I do not think that destroys the confidence of the 
people. But we have got the idea that we have got to just assume full and 
complete knowledge of everything about the spirit of prophecy and take an 
extreme position in order to be loyal and to be true to it.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: I just want to remark two things. One is on the question 
Professor Prescott raised on our previous meeting as to why people take these 
different attitudes toward a man on the Bible and on the Testimonies. I am not 
philosopher enough to explain an attitude of that sort, but I do think that the 
cause of it lies primarily in the making of extreme and radical positions. I 
think that is where the root of the difficulty lies, especially with reference 
to the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>Brother Daniells and Brother Prescott and others have come in here with us 
and have talked very frankly with us, and I am sure every man here will say that 
they have not covered up anything. They have not withheld from you anything that 
you have asked for that they could give you in reference to this matter. I do 
not doubt that it is your experience as it is mine, when I go out from 
Washington, to hear it said that Brother Daniells or Brother Prescott does not 
believe the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Brother Spicer, too.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: Yes, and Brother Spicer. I feel confident of this, that as you 
go out from this council you can be a great help in setting people straight on 
these things, and I believe it is our privilege to do it, brethren, to help the 
people on these points. Many of them are sincere and honest in that position, 
from what they have heard. I think it is our duty to help such persons all we 
can as we meet them.</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: Is this subject going to be dropped here? From what Brother 
Daniells has said, I know what it is going to mean to some of our schools and to 
our General Conference men. I feel it would be unfair to us as teachers to go 
back and make any statement. Letters have already come in, asking about the 
general men with reference to interpreting the spirit of prophecy. I do not 
think it is fair for us to go out and try to state the position of our General 
Conference men. On the other hand, I know the feeling and doctrine as taught in 
our conferences, and they are the Bible teachers of the people; and if our Bible 
and history teachers take these liberal position on the spirit of prophecy, our 
schools are going to be at variance entirely with the field. Our people are 
beginning to wonder about the condition our schools are in. They say they read 
in the Review of this spirit of paganism, and they say those articles surely 
would not have been published in the Review if these conditions did not exist in 
our own schools? Why, what would they be putting it in the Review for if that 
were not the case? That is a fact, many of our people take the position that 
those articles were written because of conditions existing in our own schools. I 
think we ought to get down to a solution of this thing if we can, and start some 
kind of a campaign of education. Out in the field we have stressed the 
importance of the spirit of prophecy more than the Bible, and many of our men 
are doing it right along. They tell of the wonderful phenomena, and many times 
they get their entire sermon from the spirit of prophecy instead of the Bible. 
If a break comes between our schools and the field we are in a serious 
place.</P>
<P>T. M. French: I believe it would help us a great deal if some general 
statement were issued, and if some of this matter that has been brought up could 
be given, showing that we are not shifting our position, that we are viewing the 
spirit of prophecy as it has been viewed all along. I believe it would help to 
settle the situation in our conferences, and would be a great help both to the 
conferences and to the schools. I am sure from what has been read here of 
letters and resolutions of the past that we have not shifted our position, but 
the matter is just up again; and if we could get out statements as to our 
attitude all along, and restate the matter, I believe it would do much good.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: The next topic we have is a consideration of how to teach the 
spirit of prophecy in our schools. In our recent general educational convention 
we provided for a semester's work in the curriculum in this subject. I think we 
ought to take ten minutes' intermission, and then take up this topic, which will 
give opportunity for further questions along this line.</P>

<P>Inspiration of the Spirit of Prophecy As Related to The Inspiration of the 
Bible August 1, 1919</P></DIR></DIR></B></FONT>
<P>W. E. Howell, Chairman: The topic for this hour, as arranged for on 
Wednesday, is a continuation, in a measure, of our consideration of the spirit 
of prophecy, and the subject of inspiration connected with that, as related to 
the inspiration of the Bible. This hour is not intended to be a formal 
discourse, occupying the whole period, but Brother Daniells' will lead in the 
topic, and then he has expressed a wish that it might be a kind of round-table 
in which we will study things together.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Brother Chairman, I think there has been a misunderstanding 
among us. I protested against taking such a heavy topic the other day, under the 
circumstances, and I dismissed it from my mind, and have been thinking along 
another line, that of pastoral training, and a further discussion of the 
question we had before us. I would not feel free, under the circumstances, to 
give a talk on the subject that I understand was looked for.</P>
<P>As you know, there are two views held by eminent men regarding the verbal 
inspiration of the Bible. You read their views in the books they have put out. 
One man, - scholarly, devout, earnest, a full believer in the Bible in every 
sense of the word, - believes that it was a revelation of truth to the writers, 
and they were allowed to state that truth as best they could. Another man - 
equally scholarly and pious and earnest in his faith - believes that it was a 
word-for-word inspiration or revelation, that the actual words were given, - 
that every word in the original, as it was written by the prophets down from 
Moses to Malachi, was given to them by the Lord. These men differ, and differ 
honestly and sincerely; and they have their followers among us, right here at 
the conference, both of them; and I see nothing to be gained by a man in my 
position, with my knowlege of these things, attempting to prove up on this. I do 
not wish to do it. We would all remain of the same opinion, I think, as we are 
now; so I want to beg you to allow me to dismiss that part of it, and either go 
directly into the other question of pastoral training or open the way for 
further questions and discussions of the matter we had before us. I feel more at 
home in that, for all these years since the Battle Creek controversy began I 
have been face to face with this question of the Testimonies. I have met all the 
doubters, the chief ones, and have dealt with it in ministerial institutes, and 
have talked it over and over until I am thoroughly familiar with it, whether I 
am straight or not. I do not know that there is a crook or a kink in it that I 
have not heard brought up by these men that have fallen away from us. I would be 
willing to hear further questions and further discussion, if it is the wish of 
the convention.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: I am sure I do not want Brother Daniells to feel that he is 
disappointing us in any real sense this morning; and if I understand the wishes 
of the teachers, it has not been that he should discuss so much the rather 
technical question of the verbal or truth - revealed inspiration of the Bible, 
but rather that he will give us some further instruction along the line of the 
inspiration of the spirit of prophecy and its relation to that of the Bible. I 
have nothing further to press along that line, but as teachers have expressed 
themselves to me, I have felt that it might be well to consider some aspects of 
that question a little further, particularly the use of unpublished writings, 
letters, talks, etc, in the light of what was referred to here the other day. 
Sister White herself said that if we wanted to know what the spirit of prophecy 
said on a thing, we should read her published writings. That is one question I 
think the teachers have in mind, Brother Daniells.</P>
<P>F. M. Wilcox: I have enjoyed these discussions very much. I enjoyed the 
evening of last week when the question of the spirit of prophecy was considered. 
I enjoyed very much the talk Elder Daniells gave on the question, and I think 
the view he took of the question very fully agrees with my own view. I have 
known for long years the way in which Sister White's works were brought together 
and her books compiled. I have never believed in the verbal inspiration of the 
Testimonies. I must say, however, that last Wednesday evening and also since 
then, some remarks have been made without proper safeguarding, and I should 
question the effect of those statements and positions out in the field. I know 
that there is considerable talk around Takoma Park over positions that have been 
taken here, and there will be that same situation out in the field. As Brother 
Wakeham suggested the other day, I think we have to deal with a very delicate 
question, and I would hate terribly to see an influence sweep over the field and 
into any of our schools that the Testimonies were discounted. There is great 
danger of a reaction, and I do feel concerned.</P>
<P>I have heard questions raised here that have left the impression on my mind 
that if the same questions are raised in our classes when we get back to our 
schools, we are going to have serious difficulty. I believe there are a great 
many questions that we should hold back, and not discuss. I am not a teacher in 
a school, although I did teach the Bible 13 years in a nurses' training school, 
where I had a large number of young people; but I can not conceive that it is 
necessary for us to answer every question that is put to us by students or 
others, or be driven into a place where we will take a position that will lessen 
faith. I think the Testimonies of the Spirit of God are a great asset to this 
denomination, and I think if we destroy faith in them, we are going to destroy 
faith in the very foundation of our work. I must say that I do view with a great 
deal of concern the influence that will go out from this meeting, and from 
questions that I have seen raised here. And unless these questions can be dealt 
with most diplomatically, I think we are going to have serious trouble. I surely 
hope the Lord will give us wisdom so that we shall know what to say and do in 
meeting these things in the future.</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: I have felt very much concerned along the same line; and the 
question that has raised itself in my own mind goes a little further than has 
been brought up here; but it seems to me it is almost a logical step. That is 
this: If there are such uncertainties with reference to our historical position, 
and if the Testimonies are not to be relied on to throw a great deal of light 
upon our historical positions, and if the same is true with reference to our 
theological interpretation of texts, then how can we consistently place implicit 
confidence in the direction that is given with reference to our educational 
problems, and our medical school, and even our denominational organization? If 
there is a definite spiritual leadership in these things, then how can we 
consistently lay aside the Testimonies or partially lay them aside when it comes 
to the prophetic and historic side of the message? and place these things on the 
basis of research work? That question is in my mind, and I am confident that it 
is in the minds of others.</P>
<P>Waldorf: That is in my mind. That is why I brought out that illustration on 
the blackboard this morning, - those three rivers, history, spirit of prophecy, 
and the Bible.</P>
<P>J. N. Anderson: I thought when we dismissed the subject the other day the 
main question was how we as teachers should deal with this question when we 
stand before our students. I think we have come to quite a unanimous opinion 
about this matter among ourselves here, and we stand pretty well together, I 
should say, as to what position the Testimonies occupy, - their authority and 
their relation to the Bible, and so on, - but the question in my mind, and in 
the mind of some others, too, I think, is, What shall we as teachers do when we 
stand before our classes and some historical question comes up, such as we have 
spoken of here, where we have decided that Sister White's writings are not 
final? We say there are many historical facts that we believe scholarship must 
decide, that Sister White never claimed to be final on the historical matters 
that appear in her writings. Are we safe to tell that to our students? Or shall 
we hold it in abeyance? And can we hold something in the back of our head that 
we are absolutely sure about, and that most of the brethren stand with us on? - 
can we hold those things back and be true to ourselves? And furthermore, are we 
safe in doing it? Is it well to let our people in general go on holding to the 
verbal inspiration of the Testimonies? When we do that, aren't we preparing for 
a crisis that will be very serious some day? It seems to me that the best thing 
for us to do is to cautiously and very carefully educate our people to see just 
where we really should stand to be consistent protestants, to be consistent with 
the Testimonies themselves, and to be consistent with what we know we must do, 
as intelligent men, as we have decided in these meetings.</P>
<P>Of course these are not such big questions, because I do not teach along this 
line. Still, they do sometimes arise in my classes. But personally I am not 
concerned about it. I am concerned about the faith of the young men and women 
that come into our schools. They are to be our leaders, and I think these are 
the days when they should be given the very best foundation we can give them. We 
should give them the most sincere and honest beliefs that we have in our own 
hearts.</P>
<P>I speak with some feeling because it does come close to my convictions that 
something should be done here in this place, - here is where it can be done - to 
safeguard our people, to educate them and to bring them back and cause them to 
stand upon the only foundation that can ever be secure as we advance and 
progress.</P>
<P>C. L. Taylor: With regard to the verbal inspiration of the Testimonies, I 
would say that I have heard more about it here in one day than ever before in my 
life. I think we have made a great big mountain of difficulty to go out and 
fight against. I do not believe that our people generally believe in the verbal 
inspiration of the Testimonies. I think that the general idea of our people is 
that the Testimonies are the writings of a sister who received light from God. 
As to verbal inspiration, I think they have a very ill-defined idea. I think 
they believe that in some way God gave her light, and she wrote it down, and 
they do not know what verbal inspiration means.</P>
<P>But I do see a great deal in the question Professor Benson raised, and that 
is if we must lay aside what Sister White has said interpreting history, or what 
we might call the philosophy of history, as unreliable, and also lay aside as 
unreliable expositions of scripture, the only natural conclusion for me, and 
probably for a great many others, would be that the same authorship is 
unreliable regarding organization, regarding pantheism, and every other subject 
that she ever treated on; - that she may have told the truth, but we had better 
get all the historical data we can to see whether she told the truth or not. 
That is something I would like to hear discussed. I do not believe we shall get 
to the foundation of the question unless we answer Professor Benson's 
question.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Shall we consider some points as settled, and pass on? Take 
the matter of verbal inspiration. I think it is very much as Brother Taylor 
says, that among the most of our people there is no question. It is not 
agitated. They do not understand it, and they do not understand the technical 
features of the inspiration of the Bible, either. And the power of the Bible and 
its grip on the human race does not depend on a technical point as to their 
belief in it, whether it is verbally inspired or truth-inspired. The men who 
hold directly opposite positions have the same faith in the Bible. I will not 
allow a man who believes in the verbal inspiration of the Bible to depreciate my 
faith in the Bible because I do not hold with him, - I will not consent to that 
a moment. I know my own faith in it, I know that I have enough faith in it to 
get forgiveness of my sins and companionship with my Lord and the hope of 
heaven. I know that, and a man that holds a different view need not try to 
depreciate my faith because I do not hold the same view that he does. I do not 
depreciate another man's faith or standing with God at all because he holds a 
different view. I think we could argue about the inspiration of the Bible - I 
was going to say till doomsday - till the end, and not come to the same view, 
but all have the same confidence in it, and have the same experience, and all 
get to the same place at last.</P>
<P>But now with reference to the Testimonies: I think more mischief can be done 
with the Testimonies by claiming their verbal inspiration than can with the 
Bible. If you ask for the logic of it, it might take some time to bring it out, 
and I might not be able to satisfy every mind; but if you ask for practical 
experience, I can give it to you, plenty of it.</P>
<P>F.M. Wilcox: Because we know how the Testimonies were brought together, and 
we do not know anything about the Bible.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, that is one point. We do know, and it is no kind of use 
for anybody to stand up and talk about the verbal inspiration of the 
Testimonies, because everybody who has ever seen the work done knows better, and 
we might as well dismiss it.</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: I am not so sure that some of the brethren are right in saying 
that we are all agreed on this question. I came in here the other day for the 
first time to attend the Conference, and I would hear the same man in the same 
talk say that we could not depend on this historical data that was given in the 
spirit of prophecy, and then assert his absolute confidence in the spirit of 
prophecy and in the Testimonies. And then a little further along there would be 
something else that he would not agree with. For instance, the positive 
testimony against butter was mentioned, and he explained that there are 
exceptions to that. Later he would again say, "I have absolute confidence in the 
inspiration of the spirit of prophecy." The question is, What is the nature of 
inspiration? How can we feel, and believe and know that there is an 
inconsistency there, - something that is not right, - and yet believe that the 
spirit of prophecy is inspired? Do you get the question?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, I get your question alright!</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: That is the difficulty we have in explaining this to young 
people. We may have confidence ourselves, but it is hard to make others believe 
it if we express this more liberal view. I can see how some might take advantage 
of this liberal view and go out and eat meat every meal, and say that part of 
the Testimonies is not reliable.</P>
<P>Question: Can't he do the same thing if he believes in the verbal 
inspiration?</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: Not quite so consistently. If he believed every word was 
inspired, he could not consistently sit down and eat meat.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: But I have seen them do it.</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: But not conscientiously. But now take a man who delves into the 
Scriptures, and he reads the Hebrew and the Greek, and he goes out and tells the 
people, If you understood the Greek, you would not get that meaning from the 
Bible, or If Sister White had understood the Greek, she would not have said 
that. Such a man can take a lot of license from this liberal view. Now, the 
question is running in my mind this way: In the very nature of the case, isn't 
there a human element in inspiration, because God had to speak through human 
instruments? And can we, either in the Bible or the Testimonies play upon a word 
and lay down the law and bind a man's conscience on a word instead of the 
general view of the whole scope of interpretation? I do not believe a man can 
believe in the general inspiration of the spirit of prophecy and still not 
believe that vegetarianism is the thing for mankind. I can understand how that 
testimony was written for individuals, and there are exceptions to it, and how 
Sister White in her human weakness could make a mistake in stating a truth, and 
still not destroy the inspiration of the spirit of prophecy; but the question is 
how to present these matters to the people. Brother Taylor may see no 
difficulty, but I see a lot of difficulty, not only in dealing with our 
students, but with our people in general.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: On the question of verbal inspiration?</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: Brother Benson's question is to the point. We had a council here 
a few weeks ago, and we laid down pretty straight some principles of education, 
and also some technicalities of education, and we based our conclusions on the 
authority of the spirit of prophecy, as it was written. Now we come to those 
historical questions, and we say, "Well, Sister White was mistaken about that, 
and that needs to be revised." The individual who did not quite see the points 
that we made at the educational council may say, "Well, possibly Sister White is 
wrong about the influence of universities," and it is hard to convince him that 
she was right, perhaps. I want, somehow, to get on a consistent basis 
myself.</P>
<P>Many years ago I was in a meeting where Dr. Kellogg and others were 
considering a business matter. Dr. Kellogg there took a position exactly 
contrary to something Sister White had said. When asked how he explained what 
she had said, he replied that she had been influenced to say it. He was running 
down the Testimonies there. A short time after that I read one of his articles 
in the paper, in which he was laying down the law on the basis of the 
Testimonies. That made me lose my confidence in Dr. Kellogg. On one point that 
he did not agree with, he said she had been influenced. Then he took this other 
thing that pleased him and he said it was from the Lord. Perhaps he thought one 
was from the Lord and the other was not. But we certainly do have difficulty in 
showing the people which is human and which is divinely inspired.</P>
<P>G. B. Thompson: Wouldn't that be true of the Bible?</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: That is why I propose that we discuss the nature of inspiration. 
I have a sort of feeling that Sister White was a prophet just as Jeremiah was, 
and that in time her work will show up like Jeremiah's. I wonder if Jeremiah, in 
his day, did not do a lot of talking and perhaps some writing which was, as Paul 
said, on his own authority. I wonder if, in those days, the people did not have 
difficulty in differentiating between what was from the Lord and what was not. 
But the people make it more difficult now because all of Sister White's articles 
and books are with us, and her letters, too, and many think that every word she 
has ever said or written is from the Lord. We have had sanitariums built on 
account of letters she has written from a depot somewhere. And undertakings 
involving great financial investments have been started because of a letter from 
her. There is no question but what many young people, and also ministers, have 
that idea, and it is a real problem with me. I wish we could get down to 
bedrock. I do not think we are there yet.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: I would like to ask if you think that, after his writings had 
been published a series of years, Jeremiah changed them because he was convinced 
that there were historical errors in them?</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: I can not answer that.</P>
<P>W. H. Wakeham: There is a real difficulty, and we will have it to meet. We 
may say that the people do not believe in the verbal inspiration of the 
Testimonies. Perhaps technically they do not know what it mean's. But that is 
not the question at all. They have accepted the Testimonies all over the 
country, and believe that every identical word that Sister White has written was 
to be received as infallible truth. We have that thing to meet when we get back, 
and it will be brought up in our classes just as sure as we stand here, because 
it has come to me over and over again in every class I have taught. It not only 
comes out in classes, but in the churches. I know we have a very delicate task 
before us if we meet the situation and do it in the way the Lord wants it done. 
I am praying very earnestly for help as I go back to meet some of the things I 
know I am going to meet.</P>
<P>W. B. Howell: Surely we are getting our difficulties aired well this morning, 
and that is perfectly proper; but we have only ten minutes left of the period in 
which to give some attention to the solution of those difficulties. We have 
invited men of much larger experience than we are to come in and help us and 
give us their counsel. It seems to me we ought to give them some time.</P>
<P>G. B. Thompson: It seems to me that if we are going to preach the Testimonies 
and establish confidence in them, it does not depend on whether they are 
verbally inspired or not. I think we are in this fix because of a wrong 
education that our people have had. [Voice: That is true.] If we had always 
taught the truth on this question, we would not have any trouble or shock in the 
denomination now. But the shock is because we have not taught the truth, and 
have put the Testimonies on a plane where she says they do not stand. We have 
claimed more for them than she did. My thought is this, that the evidence of the 
inspiration of the Testimonies is not in their verbal inspiration, but in their 
influence and power in the denomination. Now to illustrate: Brother Daniells and 
I were in Battle Creek at a special crisis, and word came to us that some 
special testimonies were on the way to us from Sister White, and for us to stay 
there until they came. When they came we found they were to be read to the 
people. They were of a very serious character. They had been written a year 
before and filed away. Brother Daniells and I prayed about it, and then we sent 
out the word to the people that a meeting was to be held at a certain time. When 
the time came, about 3,000 people came into the Tabernacle, and they filled it 
up, even away back up into the "peanut gallery." There were unbelievers and 
skeptics there, and all classes. Brother Daniells stood up there and read that 
matter to them, and I tell you there was a power went with it that gripped that 
whole congregation. And after the meeting was over, people came to us and told 
us that the Testimony described a meeting they had held the night before. I was 
convinced that there was more than ordinary power in that document. It was not 
whether it was verbally inspired or not, but it carried the power of the Spirit 
of God with it.</P>
<P>I think if we could get at it from that line, we would get along better. They 
are not verbally inspired, - we know that, - and what is the use of teaching 
that they are?</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: I would like to suggest that this question of verbal inspiration 
does not settle the difficulty.</P>
<P>C. M. Sorenson: Does Sister White use the word "inspiration" concerning her 
own writings, or is that merely a theory we have worked up ourselves? I ask for 
information? I have never seen that in her writings.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I hardly know where to begin or what to say. I think I must 
repeat this, that our difficulty lies in two points, especially. One is on 
infallibility and the other is on verbal inspiration. I think Brother James 
White foresaw difficulties along this line away back at the beginning. He knew 
that he took Sister White's testimonies and helped to write them out and make 
them clear and grammatical and plain. He knew that he was doing that right 
along. And he knew that the secretaries they employed took them and put them 
into grammatical condition, transposed sentences, completed sentences, and used 
words that Sister White did not herself write in her original copy. He saw that, 
and yet he saw some brethren who did not know this, and who had great confidence 
in the Testimonies, just believing and teaching that these words were given to 
Sister White as well as the thought. And he tried to correct that idea. You will 
find those statements in the Review and Herald, like the one Brother Wilcox read 
the other day. If that explanation had been accepted and passed on down, we 
would have been free from a great many perplexities that we have now.</P>
<P>F.M. Wilcox: Articles were published in those early Reviews disclaiming 
that.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, but you know there are some brethren who go in all over. 
We could mention some old and some young who think they cannot believe the 
Testimonies without just putting them up as absolutely infallible and 
word-inspired, taking the whole thing as given verbally by the Lord. They do not 
see how to believe them and how to get good out of them except in that way; and 
I suppose some people would feel that if they did not believe in the verbal 
inspiration of the Bible, they could not have confidence in it, and take it as 
the great Book that they now see it to be. Some men are technical, and can 
hardly understand it in any other way. Some other men are not so technical in 
logic, but they have great faith and great confidence, and so they can go 
through on another line of thought. I am sure there has been advocated an idea 
of infallibility in Sister White and verbal inspiration in the Testimonies that 
has led people to expect too much and to make too great claims, and so we have 
gotten into difficulty.</P>
<P>Now, as I have studied it these years since I was thrown into the controversy 
at Battle Creek, I have endeavored to ascertain the truth and then be true to 
the truth. I do not know how to do except that way. It will never help me, or 
help the people, to make a false claim to evade some trouble. I know we have 
difficulties here, but let us dispose of some of the main things first. 
Brethren, are we going to evade difficulties or help out the difficulties by 
taking a false position? [Voices: No!] Well, then let us take an honest, true 
position, and reach our end somehow, because I never will put up a false claim 
to evade something that will come up a little later on. That is not honest and 
it is not Christian, and so I take my stand there.</P>
<P>In Australia I saw "The Desire of Ages" being made up, and I saw the 
rewriting of chapters, some of them written over and over and over again. I saw 
that, and when I talked with Sister Davis about it, I tell you I had to square 
up to this thing and begin to settle things about the spirit of prophecy. If 
these false positions had never been taken, the thing would be much plainer than 
it is today. What was charged as plagiarism would all have been simplified, and 
I believe men would have been saved to the cause if from the start we had 
understood this thing as it should have been. With those false views held, we 
face difficulties in straightening up. We will not meet those difficulties by 
resorting to a false claim. We could meet them just for today by saying, 
"Brethren, I believe in the verbal inspiration of the Testimonies; I believe in 
the infallibility of the one through whom they came, and everything that is 
written there I will take and I will stand on that against all comers."</P>
<P>If we did that, I would just take everything from A to Z, exactly as it was 
written, without making any explanations to any one; and I would not eat butter 
or salt or eggs if I believed that the Lord gave the words in those Testimonies 
to Sister White for the whole body of people in this world. But I do not believe 
it.</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: You couldn't and keep your conscience clear.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: No, I couldn't; but I do not believe that; and I can enter 
upon an explanation of health reform that I think is consistent, and that she 
endeavored to bring in in later years when she saw people making a bad use of 
that. I have eaten pounds of butter at her table myself, and dozens of eggs. I 
could not explain that in her own family if I believed that she believed those 
were the Lord's own words to the world. But there are people who believe that 
and do not eat eggs or butter. I do not know that they use salt. I know plenty 
of people in the early days did not use salt, and it was in our church. I am 
sure that many children suffered from it.</P>
<P>There is no use of our claiming anything more on the verbal inspiration of 
the Testimonies, because she never claimed it, and James White never claimed it, 
and W. C. White never claimed it; and all the persons who helped to prepare 
those Testimonies knew they were not verbally inspired. I will say no more along 
that line.</P>
<P>D. A. Parsons: She not only did not claim it, but she denied it.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, she tried to correct the people.</P>
<P>Now on infallibility. I suppose Sister White used Paul's text, "We have this 
treasure in earthen vessels," as much as any other scripture. She used to repeat 
that often, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels," with the idea that she 
was a poor, feeble woman, a messenger of the Lord trying to do her duty and meet 
the mind of God in this work. When you take the position that she was not 
infallible, and that her writings were not verbally inspired, isn't there a 
chance for the manifestation of the human? If there isn't, then what is 
infallibility? And should we be surprised when we know that the instrument was 
fallible, and that the general truths, as she says, were revealed, then aren't 
we prepared to see mistakes?</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: She was an author and not merely a pen.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes; and now take that "Life of Paul," - I suppose you all 
know about it and knew what claims were put up against her, charges made of 
plagiarism, even by the authors of the book, Conybeare and Howson, and were 
liable to make the denomination trouble because there was so much of their book 
put into "The Life of Paul" without any credit or quotation marks. Some people 
of strict logic might fly the track on that ground, but I am not built that way. 
I found it out, and I read it with Brother Palmer when he found it, and we got 
Conybeare and Howson, and we got Wylie's "History of the Reformation," and we 
read word for word, page after page, and no quotations, no credit, and really I 
did not know the difference until I began to compare them. I supposed it was 
Sister White's own work. The poor sister said, "Why, I didn't know about 
quotations and credits. My secretary should have looked after that, and the 
publishing house should have looked after it."</P>
<P>She did not claim that that was all revealed to her and written word for word 
under the inspiration of the Lord. There I saw the manifestation of the human in 
these writings. Of course I could have said this, and I did say it, that I 
wished a different course had been taken in the compilation of the books. If 
proper care had been exercised, it would have saved a lot of people from being 
thrown off the track.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams: The secretary would know that she ought not to quote a thing 
without using quotation marks.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: You would think so. I do not know who the secretary was. The 
book was set aside, and I have never learned who had a hand in fixing that up. 
It may be that some do know.</P>
<P>B. L. House: May I ask one question about that book? Did Sister White write 
any of it?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: O, yes!</P>
<P>E. L. House: But there are some things that are not in Conybeare and Howson 
that are not in the new book, either. Why are those striking statements not 
embodied in the new book?</P>
<P>A. G.Daniells: I cannot tell you. But if her writings were verbally inspired, 
why should she revise them?</P>
<P>B. L. House: My difficulty is not with the verbal inspiration. My difficulty 
is here: You take the nine volumes of the Testimonies, and as I understand it, 
Sister White wrote the original matter from which they were made up, except that 
they were corrected so far as grammar, capitalization and punctuation are 
concerned. But such books as "Sketches of the Life of Paul," "Desire of Ages," 
and "Great Controversy, were composed differently, it seems to me, even by her 
secretaries than the nine volumes of the Testimonies. Is there not a difference? 
I have felt that the Testimonies were not produced like those other books.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I do not know how much revision she might have made in those 
personal Testimonies before she put them out.</P>
<P>B. L. House: Did any one else ever write anything that is found in the nine 
volumes of the Testimonies?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: No, I do not know that there are any quotations in the 
Testimonies.</P>
<P>B. L. House: Isn't there a difference, then, between the nine volumes of the 
Testimonies and those other books for which her secretaries were authorized to 
collect valuable quotations from other books?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: You admit that she had the right to revise her work?</P>
<P>B. L. House: O, Yes.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Then your question is, Why did she leave out of the revision 
some striking things that she wrote that it seems should have been put in?</P>
<P>B. L. House: Yes.</P>
<P>M. E. Kern: In the first volume of the spirit of prophecy there are some 
details given, if I am not mistaken, as to the height of Adam. It seems to me 
that when she went to prepare "Patriarchs and Prophets" for the public, even 
though that had been shown her, it did not seem wise to put that before the 
public.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: And she also left out of our books for the public that scene 
of Satan playing the game of life.</P>
<P>B. L. House: In that old edition of "Sketches of the Life of Paul," she is 
very clear about the ceremonial law. That is not in the new book, and I wondered 
why that was left out.</P>
<P>D. A. Parsons: I have an answer to that. I was in California when the book 
was compiled, and I took the old edition and talked with Brother Will White 
about this very question. He said the whole book, with the exception of that 
chapter, had been compiled for some time, and they had held it up until they 
could arrange that chapter in such a way as to prevent controversy arising. They 
did not desire the book to be used to settle any controversy, and therefore they 
eliminated most of these statements on the ceremonial law just to prevent a 
renewal of the great controversy over the ceremonial law in Galatians.</P>
<P>B. L. House: It is not a repudiation of what was written by her in the first 
volume, is it?</P>
<P>D. A. Parsons: No, not at all; but they just put enough in to satisfy the 
inquiring mind, but eliminated those striking statements to prevent a renewal of 
the controversy.</P>
<P>F. M. Wilcox: I would like to ask, Brother Daniells, if it could be accepted 
as a sort of rule that Sister White might be mistaken in details, but in the 
general policy and instruction she was an authority. For instance, I hear a man 
saying, I can not accept Sister White on this, when perhaps she has devoted 
pages to the discussion of it. A man said he could not accept what Sister White 
said about royalties on books, and yet she devotes pages to that subject, and 
emphasizes it again and again; and it is the same with policies for our schools 
and publishing houses and sanitariums. It seems to me I would have to accept 
what she says on some of those general policies or I would have to sweep away 
the whole thing. Either the Lord has spoken through her or He has not spoken 
through her; and if it is a matter of deciding in my own judgment whether He has 
or has not, then I regard her books the same as every other book published. I 
think it is one thing for a man to stultify his conscience, and it is another 
thing to stultify his judgment. It is one thing for me to lay aside my 
conscience, and it is another thing for me to change my judgment over some views 
that I hold.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: I think Brother Benson's question on historical and 
theological matters has not been dealt with yet, and I do not know that I am 
able to give any light. Perhaps some of you may know to what extent Sister White 
has revised some of her statements and references or quotations from historical 
writings. Have you ever gone through and made a list of them?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: I gave nearly an hour to that the other day, taking the old 
edition of "Great Controversy" and reading it and then reading the revised 
edition. But that did not cover all the ground.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: We did not create that difficulty, did we? We General 
Conference men did not create it, for we did not make the revision. We did not 
take any part in it. We had nothing whatever to do with it. It was all done 
under her supervision. If there is a difficulty there, she created it, did she 
not?</P>
<P>F. M. Wilcox: She assumed the whole responsibility for it.</P>
<P>M. F. Kern. But we have to meet it.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Well, now, which statement shall we take, the original or the 
revised?</P>
<P>B. L. House: My real difficulty is just here: Sister White did not write 
either the old edition or the revised, as I understand it.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: What do you mean by saying that she did not write either 
edition?</P>
<P>B. L. House: As I understand it, Elder J. N. Anderson prepared those 
historical quotations for the old edition, and Brother Robinson and Brother 
Crisler, Professor Prescott and others furnished the quotations for the new 
edition. Did she write the historical quotations in there?</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: No.</P>
<P>B. L. House: Then there is a difference between the Testimonies and those 
books.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Changes have been made in what was not historical extract at 
all.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Shall we not confine ourselves just now to this question of 
Brother Benson's and lead our way up to the real difficulty, and then deal with 
it? Do you have a clear conception of the way the difficulty arose? - that in 
making the first edition of "Great Controversy" those who helped her prepare the 
copy were allowed to bring forward historical quotations that seemed to fit the 
case. She may have asked, "Now, what good history do you have for that?" I do 
not know just how she brought it in, but she never would allow us to claim 
anything for her as a historian. She did not put herself up as a corrector of 
history, - not only did not do that, but protested against it. Just how they 
dealt in bringing the history along, I could not say, but I suspect that she 
referred to this as she went along, and then allowed them to gather the very 
best historical statements they could and submit them to her, and she approved 
of them.</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: This is my query, and it underlies all of her writings: How did 
she determine upon the philosophy of history? If she endorsed our interpretation 
of history, without any details, do we dare to set that aside? I understand she 
never studied medical science; but she has laid down certain fundamental 
principles; and that she has done the same with education and organization.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Sister White never has written anything on the philosophy of 
history.</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: No, but she has endorsed our 2300 day proposition, from 538 to 
1798.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: You understand she did that by placing that in her 
writings?</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: Yes.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, I suppose she did.</P>
<P>C. A. Shull: I think the book "Education" contains something along the line 
of the philosophy of history.</P>
<P>W. E. Howell: Yes, she outlines general principles.</P>
<P>C. M. Sorenson: Nobody has ever questioned Sister White's philosophy of 
history, so far as I know, - and I presume I have heard most of the questions 
raised about it, - along the line of the hand of God in human affairs and the 
way the hand of God has been manifested. The only question anybody has raised 
has been about minor details. Take this question as to whether 533 has some 
significance taken in connection with 538. She never set 533, but if there is a 
significance attached to it in human affairs, it certainly would not shut us out 
from using it, and that would not affect the 1260 years. Some people say 
antichrist is yet to come, and is to last for three and one-half literal years. 
If you change those positions, you will change the philosophy.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Do I understand Brother Benson's view is that such a 
statement as that in "Great Controversy," that the 1260 years began in 538 and 
ended in 1798, settles the matter infallibly?</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: No, only on the preaching of doctrines in general. If she 
endorses the prophetic part of our interpretation, irrespective of details, then 
she endorses it.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Then that settles it as being a part of that philosophy.</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: Yes, in this way: I do not see how we can do anything else but 
set up our individual judgment if we say we will discount that, because we have 
something else that we think is better evidence. It is the same with education 
and the medical science.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: You are touching exactly the experience through which I went, 
personally, because you all know that I contributed something toward the 
revision of "Great Controversy." I furnished considerable material bearing upon 
that question.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: By request.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Yes, I was asked to do it, and at first I said, "No, I will 
not do it. I know what it means." But I was urged into it. When I had gone over 
it with W. C. White, then I said, "Here is my difficulty. I have gone over this 
and suggested changes that ought to be made in order to correct statements. 
These changes have been accepted. My personal difficulty will be to retain faith 
on those things that I can not deal with on that basis." But I did not throw up 
the spirit of prophecy, and have not yet; but I have had to adjust my view of 
things. I will say to you, as a matter of fact, that the relation of those 
writings to this movement and to our work, is clearer and more consistent in my 
mind than it was then. But still you know what I am charged with. I have gone 
through the personal experience myself over that very thing that you speak of. 
If we correct it here and correct it there, how are we going to stand with it in 
the other places?</P>
<P>F. M. Wilcox: Those things do not involve the general philosophy of the 
book.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: No, but they did involve quite large details. For instance, 
before "Great Controversy" was revised, I was unorthodox on a certain point, but 
after it was revised, I was perfectly orthodox.</P>
<P>C. M. Sorenson: On what point?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: My interpretation was, (and I taught it for years in The 
Protestant Magazine) that Babylon stood for the great apostasy against God, 
which headed up in the papacy, but which included all minor forms, and that 
before we come to the end, they would all come under one. That was not the 
teaching of "Great Controversy." "Great Controversy" said that Babylon could not 
mean the romish church, and I had made it mean that largely and primarily. After 
the book was revised, although the whole argument remained the same, it said 
that it could not mean the Roman Church alone, just that one word added.</P>
<P>F.M. Wilcox: That helped you out.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Yes, but I told W. C. White I did not think anybody had any 
right to do that. And I did not believe anybody had any right to use it against 
me before or afterward. I simply went right on with my teaching.</P>
<P>J. W. Anderson: Would you not claim other portions of the book as on the same 
basis?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: No, I would refuse to do that. I had to deal with A. R. Henry 
over that question. He was determined to crush those men that took a wrong 
course concerning him. I spent hours with that man trying to help him. We were 
intimate in our work, and I used to go to his house and spend hours with him. He 
brought up this question about the authority of the spirit of prophecy and 
wanted me to draw the line between what was authoritative and what was not. I 
said, "Brother Henry, I will not attempt to do it, and I advise you not to do 
it. There is an authority in that gift here, and we must recognize it."</P>
<P>I have tried to maintain personal confidence in this gift in the church, and 
I use it and use it. I have gotten great help from those books, but I will tell 
you frankly that I held to that position on the question of Babylon for years 
when I knew it was exactly contrary to "Great Controversy," but I went on, and 
in due time I became orthodox. I did not enjoy that experience at all, and I 
hope you will not have to go through it. It means something.</P>
<P>C. L. Benson: That is the pivotal point. You had something that enabled you 
to take that position. What was it?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: I can not lay down any rule for anybody. What settled me to 
take that position was the Bible, not any secular authority.</P>
<P>J. N. Anderson: Your own findings must be your authority for believing and 
not believing.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: You can upset everything by applying that as a general 
principle.</P>
<P>C. P. Bollman: Could you tell, in just a few words, how the Bible helped 
you?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: That would involve the whole question of the beast.</P>
<P>Voice: To your knowledge, has Sister White ever made a difference between her 
nine volumes and her other books?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: I have never talked with her about it. In my mind, there is a 
difference between the works she largely prepared herself and what was prepared 
by others for sale to the public.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: You might as well state that a little fuller, the difference 
in the way they were produced.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: If I should speak my mind frankly, I should say that I have 
felt for years that great mistakes were made in handling her writings for 
commercial purposes.</P>
<P>C. M. Sorenson: By whom?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: I do not want to charge anybody. But I do think great 
mistakes were made in that way. That is why I have made a distinction as I have. 
When I talked with W. C. White about it (and I do not know that he is an 
infallible authority), he told me frankly that when they got out "Great 
Controversy," if they did not find in her writings anything on certain chapters 
to make the historical connections, they took other books, like "Daniel and the 
Revelation," and used portions of them; and sometimes her secretaries, and 
sometimes she herself, would prepare a chapter that would fill the gap.</P>
<P>C. A. Shull: I would like to ask if Brother Prescott wishes to be understood 
that his attitude is that wherever his own judgment comes in conflict with any 
statement in the spirit of prophecy, he will follow his judgment rather than the 
spirit of prophecy?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: No, I do not want anybody to get that understanding. That is 
the very understanding that I do not want anybody to get.</P>
<P>C. A. Shull: Then that was an exceptional case?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Yes, I was forced to that from my study of the Bible. When I 
made up my mind to that, I did not parade it before the people and say, "Here is 
a mistake in 'Great Controversy,' and if you study the Bible you will find it to 
be so." I did not attack the spirit of prophecy. My attitude has been to avoid 
anything like opposition to the gift in this church, but I avoid such a misuse 
of it as to set aside the Bible. I do not want anybody to think for a moment 
that I set up my judgment against the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Let us remember that, brethren, and not say a word that will 
misrepresent Brother Prescott.</P>
<P>B. L. House: Did Sister White herself write that statement that the term 
Babylon could not apply to the Catholic Church, or was that copied from some 
other author?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: That was in the written statement.</P>
<P>B. L. House: Has she ever changed any of the nine volumes of the 
Testimonies?</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: "Great Controversy" is the only book I know of that has been 
revised.</P>
<P>C. M. Sorenson: Hasn't "Early Writings" been revised? I understand some 
omissions have been made in the later editions.</P>
<P>W. W. Prescott: Perhaps some things have been left out, but I do not think 
the writing itself has been revised.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: You know there is a statement that the pope changed the 
Sabbath, and another one, that the papacy was abolished. What do you do with 
those?</P>
<P>B. L. House: There is no trouble with that.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Why not? The pope did not change the Sabbath?</P>
<P>B. L. House: But the pope stands for the papacy.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: There are people that just believe there was a certain pope 
that changed the Sabbath, because of the way they follow the words. She never 
meant to say that a certain pope changed the Sabbath; but do you know, I have 
had that brought up to me a hundred times in ministers' meetings.</P>
<P>B. L. House: I have never had any trouble on that.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: But you are only one. There are about 2,000 others. I have 
had to work with men just gradually and carefully and all the time keep from 
giving out the idea that I was a doubter of the Testimonies.</P>
<P>I know it is reported around that some of us men here at Washington, in 
charge of the general administrative work, are very shaky and unbelieving, but I 
want to tell you that I know better. I know that my associates have confidence 
right down on the solid platform of this whole question; and I know that if many 
of you had gone at this thing and experienced what we have, you would have 
passed through an experience that would have given you solid ground. You would 
have shaken a bit, and you are beginning to shake now, and some of you do not 
know where you are going to land. These questions show it. But that is not to 
say there is not a foundation. It is to say that you have not gone through the 
toils yet and got your feet on solid ground.</P>
<P>I want to make this suggestion, because with all these questions we can not 
follow one line of thought logically: We must use good sense in dealing with 
this whole question, brethren. Do not be careless with your words. Do not be 
careless in reporting or representing men's views. I have had this thing to deal 
with for years and years, as you know, in every ministers' meeting; and I have 
been called into college classes over and over again, and have had to say things 
that those ministers and students never heard before about this; and I have 
prayed for wisdom and for the Spirit of the Lord to direct them and to give 
faith and to cover up those things that would leave doubt. And I have never had 
it come back on me that a careful, cautious statement made in the fear of God 
has upset a single person. It may have done it, but it has never come back to 
me. You take our ministers: This brother [meaning Brother Waldorf] knows how 
much this was brought up in our ministers' meetings over in Australia, and we 
dealt with it plainly. We did not try to pull the wool over the people's eyes, 
and I believe you will find the Australian preachers and churches as firm 
believers in the spirit of prophecy and in Sister White's call by the Lord as 
you will find any place on the face of the earth. Take New Zealand: I brought 
them up there, and I think it is well known that there is not a place in the 
world where the people stand truer to this gift than they do there.</P>
<P>I do not believe it is necessary to dissemble a bit, but I do believe, 
brethren, that we have got to use wisdom that God alone can give us in dealing 
with this until matters gradually work over. We have made a wonderful change in 
nineteen years, Brother Prescott. Fifteen years ago we could not have talked 
what we are talking here today. It would not have been safe. This matter has 
come along gradually, and yet people are not losing their confidence in the 
gift. Last year we sold 5,000 sets of the Testimonies, and they cost eight or 
nine dollars a set. In one year our brethren and sisters, under the influence of 
the General Conference, and the union conference and local conference men and 
our preachers, - under their influence, without any compulsion, our brethren 
came along and spent forty or fifty thousand dollars for the Testimonies. What 
would you consider that an indication of?</P>
<P>Voice: Confidence.</P>
<P>A. G. Daniells: Yes, confidence, and a friendly attitude. They did not buy 
them as critics to tear them to pieces. We must be judged by our fruits. I want 
to tell you that the clearer view we get on the exact facts in the case, the 
stronger the position of our people will be in the whole thing.</P>
<P>Now, Brother Benson, I see the whole line running through there that you 
referred to. We can not correct that in a day. We must use great judgment and 
caution. I hope you Bible teachers will be exceedingly careful. I was called up 
here twice to speak on the spirit of prophecy to the Bible and pastoral training 
classes. They brought up this question of history. I simply said, "Now, boys, 
Sister White never claimed to be a historian nor a corrector of history. She 
used the best she knew for the matter she was writing on." I have never heard 
from a teacher that those boys buzzed around them and said, "Brother Daniells 
does not believe Sister White's writings are reliable." I believe the Lord will 
help us to take care of this if we will be careful and use good sense. I think 
that is all I can say in this sort of discussion.</P>
