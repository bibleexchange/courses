      <P>When she died she was in debt close to $90,000.00, nearly all of which 
      was for borrowed money. She had borrowed money from or owed fifty-eight 
      different persons or companies, ranging from a few hundred to over 
      $10,000.00. The General Conference took over her entire estate and paid 
      all of her debts, amounting in the average to $100,724.37.<SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"> </SPAN>When James White died his 
      estate was appraised at $22,000.00 all of which was surrendered to Mrs. 
      White.</P>
      <P>&nbsp; The appraised value of Mrs. White's estate was $65,721.87, 
      $40,000.00 of this was for her book plates, copyrights, and her 
      manuscripts, which the denomination published or would publish. Aside from 
      the estimated value of royalty on her books, her estate fell short 
      $63,230.40 of paying her debts.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Ellen White wrote, <B>"We should shun debt as we should shun the 
      leprosy."—</B> <I>Testimonies </I>Vol. 6 p 217<I><B>.</B></I> Maybe Ellen 
      left this large debt of $90,000.00 because she had a problem with her 
      understanding of how leprosy is transmitted, when she wrote, <I>"The 
      eating of pork has produced scofula, leprosy, and cancerous humors." 
      Councils on Diets and Foods </I>p. <I>393</I> DR. Wm. Van Alstine and 
      authority on animal diseases at Purdue University, "says that pigs cannot 
      get leprosy and they cannot transfer leprosy to humans." Ellen was just as 
      confused on making wills as "the law of God" as she was in the fact that 
      leprosy cannot be transmitted to humans by eating pork. As much pork that 
      is eaten in the world you would think there would be an epidemic of 
      leprosy. Perhaps pigs will be able to get leprosy when they learn to fly. 
      Whereever did Ellen get her false visions, certainly not from God! A good 
      guess would be from her uninspired plagiarized sources.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;<B>Unanswered Questions:<O:P> </O:P></B></P>
      <P>I wrote a letter to the Indiana Conference Trust Department in October 
      23, 1995 asking;</P>
      <P><I>" If Ellen White did not live up to the instruction that she claimed 
      that she received from God, wouldn’t it be appropriate for the Indiana 
      Conference to send its members a copy of Ellen’s will<B> </B>and let each 
      of you decide how to make up your will? It seems your choices will be, 1. 
      What Ellen preached. 2. What Ellen actually did. 3. Get your instructions 
      from the Bible, and see that God does not have a <B>"Law"</B> for 
      Christians on how to make wills."&nbsp; </I></P>
      <P>The Indiana Conference Trust Department has not responded to my 
      questions nor have they to my knowledge sent a copy of Ellen White’s will 
      to its constituency. They evidently do not believe it is important for 
      them to have a copy of her will. It is not hard to guess the reason why 
      they would not want them to see Ellen’s will. If they would see it, they 
      would see Ellen’s hypocrisy</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Isn’t it interesting that for 2000 years, God did not give 
      Christians a law to make a will. Then in the 1880, Ellen gave a, "law for 
      making wills" to the members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and not 
      to the Christians outside of Adventism. Does God make laws for just 
      Adventists? This is what cults do, follow non-biblical laws. It appears 
      that if SDA Christians break this law they would be lost. Does this law 
      apply equally to Ellen as well as Christians of other faiths? If 
      Christians of other faiths break "Ellen’s Law" are they sinning and will 
      they be lost? Because Ellen did not obey the law of God dealing with 
      wills, will she be lost? The Bible teaches that God will judge us as we 
      judge others.</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: purple">Isn’t God’s laws universal for all 
      Christians and not just for Seventh-day Adventists? Aren’t the laws of God 
      found only in the Bible? Can anyone find a law on wills for Christians in 
      the Bible? This is where Seventh-day Adventist separates themselves from 
      other Christians. Adventists must uphold Ellen G. White as a prophet and 
      her writings as if they were Scripture on any subject to hold employment 
      in the denomination and to hold church office. This is what cults are made 
      of.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
