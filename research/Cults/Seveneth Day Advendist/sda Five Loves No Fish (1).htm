      by permission" <BR></B><BR>By Skip Baker <BR>Former Photographer, <BR>for 
      the<BR><B>Seventh-day Adventist Church</B></P>
      <P align=left>I was raised and educated in one of the great American 
      Cults, and in mid-life found myself as one of the head Photographer at the 
      world Church headquarters, working on a photo aimed at using one of 
      Christ’s miracles for that year’s “Investment Project.” This time one of 
      the “Elders” at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists had come 
      up with the “5 Loaves and two fish” miracle where Christ had multiplied 2 
      fish and 5 loaves of bread, to feed the 5000 as a good theme to introduce 
      the concept that fall. <BR><BR>As I was working of this project, dark 
      clouds that threatened the very underpinnings of Seventh day Adventism 
      threatened to break into a storm between the theologians, and I was aware 
      of the tension between some professors of theology, especially one Desmond 
      Ford, and the Church leadership in the building next to ours at the Review 
      &amp; Herald Publishing Association Like Luther shaking the Catholic 
      Church to its foundation, Dr. Des Ford had done the same basic thing to 
      this little known cult in America by giving a “forum” sermon in which he 
      explained some of the holes in the church’s “Investigative Judgment 
      Doctrine” and how it wasn’t supported by the bible.<BR><BR>Although I 
      didn’t know it then, my “5 Loaves and No Fish Story” would be the catapult 
      that would eject me out of Adventism into a thinking mode that I’d never 
      dared to question until this assignment came up.<BR><BR>As my experiences 
      as a photographer widened, mostly learned on the job by trial and error, 
      at great expense to the Adventist Church, I’d begun to use larger and 
      larger cameras aimed at providing tack sharp photos for my “clients” that 
      were the various departments of Church Headquarters in Takoma Park, a 
      suburb of Washington DC. <BR><BR>Really getting into the authenticity of 
      this photo I had set up a 4x5 camera, gotten some old wood that would that 
      looked like the planks of a fishing vessel of the time of Christ, and 
      bought two large fish at the local Giant Food store. I even hired a woman 
      to bake 5 loaves of middle eastern bread, so my photo would look as 
      authentic as I could get it to look, and now all my labor was set before 
      the 4x5 camera ready for “the client” to come over and approve the 
      Polaroid's, now carefully laid out on the edge of the table<BR><BR>With 
      fishermen’s nets around the outside of the subject area, I’d set up what I 
      felt would be truly a classic portfolio shot, those rare special photos 
      that every photographer uses in his “book” to show art directors their 
      work, and I was sure this was going to be one of mine!<BR><BR>As the 
      “Elder” from the GC examined my set up I began to wonder what was taking 
      him so long to respond to what I felt was a “fail safe” set up that most 
      clients would be very excited about. He then said:<BR><BR>“Those fish have 
      got to go.”<BR><BR>“Say what?” I responded.<BR><BR>“Those fish have GOT TO 
      GO!” he said in no uncertain terms.<BR><BR>Then it hit me, and I realized 
      that since Ellen G. White, the founding “prophet” of Seventh-day 
      Adventists was said to have been a vegetarian, Jesus Himself must have 
      made some big mistake by multiplying all that “meat” for the people to eat 
      that day that He fed the 5000 so long ago. Imagine, the Son of God making 
      a mistake that was only caught by one of His “lesser lights” 1800 years 
      later because she was a vegetarian?<BR><BR>I begged and pleaded with the 
      GC Elder, pointing out that if you took out the fish, nobody would 
      understand that the photo was even ABOUT the “5 Loaves &amp; 2 Fish” at 
      all! We carried our argument down the hall into the office of the Art 
      Director, me thinking that surely he’d back me up and insist that the two 
      fish stayed in the photo! <BR><BR>Alas, he had to admit that <B>“the 
      client was always right”</B> and if the client didn’t want to show two 
      fish in “their photo”, then they had to go, and believe it or not, I took 
      OUT the two fish from the 5 Loaves and 2 Fish photo, that left it nothing 
      more than a picture of 5 odd looking loaves of bread that nobody could 
      connect to Christ’s miracle when it was printed. I recalled looking at the 
      photo in the General Church paper months later without the fish and seeing 
      how the people in the audience didn’t get the “investment” connection that 
      I had attempted to draw. They had no idea that the bread they saw, had any 
      connection to a miracle 2000 years ago in the time of Christ, because what 
      I didn’t know then, Christ was not the centerpiece of Seventh day 
      Adventism at all, and never had been in its entire history. How can one 
      grow up in a church and think that one is Christian, when Jesus wasn’t 
      even thought of as “Kosher” by the same church?<BR><BR>It was then as the 
      church was engaged in one of it’s worst doctrinal debates in it’s history 
      that all this came together, and I realized that I wasn’t even IN a 
      “Christian Church” if the judgment from HQ was that Christ had erred and 
      Ellen G. White had been right instead.<BR><BR>Suddenly, I realized that I 
      belonged to a cult, and there was just no way around it when all the 
      elements of the 5 Loaves and No Fish Picture were examined.<BR><BR>But it 
      wasn’t just this slavish devotion to Church Founder Ellen G. White that 
      was the only thing on my mind here because I had read a “transcript” from 
      the White Estate Vault that was said to be a copy of Ellen White’s hand 
      written letter to Joseph Bates dated May 13, 1847. <BR><BR>If that 
      transcript was true, then the very keel of the great Ship of Adventism had 
      a crack in it and was taking on water. The transcript seemed to be saying 
      that Ellen G. White had taught the Shut Door Doctrine over the decade of 
      the 1840s, and sighting “visions” to support her views! The Shut Door 
      taught that no more sinners could be saved after October 22, 1844. That 
      had been the day that a Baptist minister William Miller had said the end 
      of the world would come based on his study of Daniel 8:14, but since Jesus 
      didn’t return to earth that day, it became known as the Great 
      Disappointment. According to this “transcript” Ellen G. White had taught 
      that the shut door was true, and that indeed no more sinners could be 
      saved after October 1844!<BR><BR>When I pointed out what a problem this 
      transcript created for the church’s founder to my coworkers in the Art 
      Department, Tom Davis, the Book Editor spoke up and asked if I’d ever seen 
      the actual letter written by Ellen G. White. When I admitted that I hadn’t 
      seen the letter, and had no way to prove that it was true to Ellen White’s 
      actual hand written letter, I felt he had a good point, and I resolved not 
      to talk about the letter until I could look deeper into this 
      mess.<BR><BR>As it turned out another project that I had hanging in fire 
      in the studio, would soon bring about the resolution of this problem of 
      the Bates letter. Hanging in the studio I had a painting that the Ellen G. 
      White Estate had commissioned that they wanted to sell at the upcoming 
      General Conference Session that would be held in Dallas Texas that year, 
      1980. Ron Graybill, one of the officials of the E.G. White Estate called 
      me worried that they hadn’t gotten a transparency yet of the painting, and 
      reminded me how urgent it was for their deadline!<BR><BR>Tell you what 
      Ron” I said...<BR><BR>“Bring me the letter that Ellen White wrote to Bates 
      on May 13, 1847, and I’ll photograph your painting today!” I never dreamed 
      in a million years that he’d do such a thing, but the next thing out of 
      his mount was:<BR><BR>“Has that letter been released to the 
      scholars?”<BR><BR>When I told him that it had been in 1971, that seemed to 
      satisfy him and he seemed to see no problem with letting me see the 
      letter!<BR><BR>I could have fainted dead away when he showed up within the 
      hour with the letter, left it with me in the studio and then walked out 
      back up to the front of the department to speak with our Art Director 
      about something.<BR><BR>I couldn’t believe it, for in my hands I held the 
      OLDEST document on file in the entire Ellen G. White Estate Vault! This 
      would be like a Mormon getting irrefutable evidence from the Mormon Vault 
      in Salt Lake City that their founder, Joseph Smith, had forged the 
      signatures of the 12 men who said they’d seen the Golden Plates from which 
      the Book of Mormon was created!<BR><BR>My hands shook as I pulled the 
      three pages out of the envelope and laid the first one under the glass of 
      the copy table. If I worked fast, I could actually expose a roll of 120 
      film and put these original pages onto good negatives under cross 
      polarized lights with a red filter and that’s exactly what I did. I worked 
      fast and sloppy but then everything had been in place when I started so 
      there wasn’t any time wasted in setting up the shots! In a matter of one 
      minute I’d reeled off a role of 120 size Tri-X Film and now had the Bates 
      letter exposed on film. <BR><BR>I quickly folded the letter back up and 
      slipped them into the envelope thinking that Ron Graybill would walk in 
      anytime catching me at the copy stand!<BR><BR>He didn’t return for the 
      letter for three days!<BR><FONT color=#ff0000><B><BR>The original 
      photographs can be viewed here on the internet:</B></FONT><BR><B><A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/EGW_to_J.Bates_1847.htm">http://www.truthorfables.com/EGW_to_J.Bates_1847.htm</A> 
      <BR><BR></B>The information in the Bates letter was even more devastating 
      than I could ever have imagined! Not only was it exact, proving that the 
      “Scholar’s Transcript” was the truth, there were two hand written notes in 
      Bates own handwriting showing that he knew at some point, where Ellen had 
      gotten her information, proving that he knew she was stealing her materiel 
      even back then! The letter ends abruptly at page 3, so we know she wrote 
      more but what ever was in the rest of the letter was SO BAD that somebody 
      made sure it was destroyed. Evidently, the damming evidence in pages 4 and 
      beyond was so shocking that the editors failed to see the dynamite that 
      the first three pages offered!<BR><BR>Once any thinking Adventist comes in 
      contact with the letter that Ellen G. White wrote to Bates in 1847, he can 
      no longer maintain his or her faith in Ellen G. White as a true prophet of 
      God from then on. It becomes clear that she taught, based on her “first 
      visions” that the Shut Door was true, and that “no more sinners could be 
      saved” after October 22, 1844. She knew that Joseph Bates was a “Shut Door 
      Believer” himself, and she wanted to get her letter out to him to show him 
      that her “visions” agreed with his own Shut door view of the world! 
      <BR><BR>She even mentions that one of the early publications by Turner 
      “was in the house” regarding the very same subject, but that she didn’t 
      read it because reading at the time “injured” her head! But, oddly enough, 
      everything that Turner taught in his Day Star or the “Hope of Israel 
      Extra” is just what God had shown her in vision!<BR><BR>Now imagine, it’s 
      1845 and there’s no TV. No radio, no phones and very little reading aside 
      from the Bible, and yet she says she didn’t read Turner’s paper? That she 
      admits being left alone with in the house? And it all just happens to 
      agree with her “visions?”<BR><BR>Clearly, when we study the Bates letter 
      we can see that William Miller the great preacher about the Second Advent 
      has set New England on fire with his preaching that the end was going to 
      come in first 1843 and finally in 1844, on October 22. People sell off 
      their farms and wait all day to be taken up into heaven at the Second 
      Advent that didn’t happen, and it all became known as the “Great 
      Disappointment.”<BR><BR>But now a new wrinkle develops and some people 
      believe that what they’re seeing is just a momentary delay, that Christ 
      has shut the door of the Holy Place and moved into the Most Holy, and is 
      about to come any day now so there’s no use to get new converts because 
      “the door is shut” and that’s what Turner and Hale believed, as well as 
      Joseph Bates who Ellen G. White was writing to in this the oldest letter 
      in the White Estate Vault! So they now band together and cut themselves 
      off from the other churches, claiming that those churches that failed to 
      believe their false belief that the end was going to come on October 22, 
      were all lost and couldn’t be saved because they’d rejected “present 
      truth.” They were about to give up their view that the “Door was shut” but 
      along comes Ellen G. Harmon, and says she’s had “visions” proving that the 
      door is indeed Closed! So, they believe her vision and are “confirmed in 
      the shut door!”<BR><BR>One can only imagine me as a middle aged Seventh 
      day Adventist and having this explosive information falling into my hands 
      at the very time that the Church Elders are putting Dr. Des Ford on trial 
      for being a heretic because he believes that the Sanctuary Doctrine that 
      came out of the “Shut Door Doctrine” wasn’t biblical!<BR><BR>Of course it 
      wasn’t biblical, because only the false visions of Ellen G. White 
      supported it!<BR><BR>Now (IN 1980) 133 years after the Bates Letter was 
      written, the Seventh Day Adventist Church was putting Dr. Des Ford on 
      trial over many of these issues and everybody was digging into the history 
      of Adventism to find out what the “Investigative Judgment Doctrine” was 
      really based on, <B>the Bible or Ellen G. White?</B> That debate would in 
      the end see every thinking Seventh day Adventist leaving the church once 
      they could clearly see the issues at hand. The problem was how easy it was 
      for “The Church” to cover up the facts and how well they did just that. At 
      every point they mislead the laymen reading the <B>Adventist Review</B>, 
      so that most thinking Adventists had to turn to “SPECTRUM” an unofficial 
      magazine that was published by the church’s scholars. Suddenly, what would 
      have been a dry and difficult to read journal, became “Must reading” for 
      those who really wanted to know what was going on.<BR><BR>Dr. Raymond 
      Cottrell, who was an Associate Editor to the Adventist Review, was one of 
      the 120 scholars sent to Glacier View Camp in Colorado to attend the 
      hearing of Dr. Ford, and thankfully Dr. Cottrell knew shorthand and could 
      write it as fast as people talked, giving us a total outline of what went 
      on in secret behind closed doors that was at once printed in SPECTRUM 
      magazine, Vol. 11 #2. What it revealed was the outright duplicity and 
      fraud the Church’s leaders used to mislead the laymen. First, the scholars 
      voted in favor of Des Ford’s stand based on his thousand page outline 
      typed us as his “defense paper” that was by then made available to laymen 
      who wanted to read it.<BR><BR>It was shocking to see that when the 
      professors voted in favor of Dr. Ford, the ADMINISTRATORS flew back to 
      Washington DC, and printed just exactly the opposite of what happened, in 
      the Adventist Review! Those of us who had kept abreast of what was going 
      on were horrified to see our Church Leaders LYING about what was done and 
      said at that lynching of Dr. Ford behind closed doors. They couldn’t dare 
      tell the truth because the truth was that the Investigative Judgment 
      Doctrine could NOT be supported by Scripture alone, and required the 
      statements of Ellen G. White. It was only HER writings that saved the 
      doctrine, because it was HER writings that had forced the “Shut Door 
      Doctrine” onto the church when it was born, and then to hide and cover up 
      the Shut Door Doctrine, she used the borrowed work of another scholar of 
      the 19th Century to “Hide” the Shut Door by changing” it into the 
      Investigative Judgment doctrine!<BR><BR>It was that fatal mistake that the 
      “Secret Bates Letter” that I photographed that day in 1980 proved, and 
      shed light on what had really happened so long ago when Adventism was 
      formed. Here, the leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church had a chance 
      in 1980 to accept the BIBLE above the work of Ellen G. White, and rejected 
      it like that always had before the 5 other times it had nearly come to a 
      head behind closed doors.<BR><BR>In the Bible Conference of 1919 the 
      General Conference men and leaders of the Seventh-day Adventists nearly 
      accepted the “truth” and come clean on the I J. Then years before that in 
      1905, at the trial of Albian Ballenger, the President of the Conference in 
      Ireland, they also rejected the Bible and put Ellen G. White’s writings 
      above scripture. And each time they held these ‘behind closed door’ 
      meetings, they mislead the members and told them that “the heretic” had 
      been found wrong, when that wasn’t the case at all. How many other “cults” 
      have done the same thing each time their “sacred cow” was 
      threatened?<BR><BR>It’s how cults keep their members thinking that their 
      faith is based on solid scripture, when in fact it’s so often based on 
      lies about their history. Because I had a front row seat I was able to 
      watch the Adventist Church control “the facts” in such a way that the 
      laymen never had a chance of learning the truth, and once your eyes are 
      open to the deception around you, it’s hard to miss seeing it all around 
      us. In so many ways we “the public” or “the members” are being mislead in 
      so many ways, that learning how to see the lies is urgent for any 
      Christian who wants to avoid the pitfalls of cults in America.<BR><BR>And 
      so begins my story of how <B>“We studied out way out of the 
      truth!”<BR><BR>Skip Baker </B></P>
