              Adventism, Christian Science, and Theosophy have one thing in 
              common at least–they all had hysterical, neurotic women as their 
              Founders! Mrs. Ellen G. White was the founder of the "ism" of this 
              article, though she got her cue from one William Miller of Low 
              Hampton, N. Y., U.S. A. Concerning Mrs. White, "Dr. William 
              Russell, a chief physician in the Seventh-Day Adventist Sanatorium 
              at Battle Creek, long a Seventh-Day Adventist, wrote in 1869 that 
              Mrs. White's visions were the result of a diseased organization or 
              condition of brain or nervous system." Dr. Fairfield, likewise an 
              Adventist, and for years a physician in the same Sanatorium, wrote 
              in 1887 that he had no doubt that her visions were "simply 
              hysterical trances.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">which amount to blasphemy and

              Sabbath was given as a "sign" and "perpetual covenant" between

              style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </I>of condemnation," 
              "written and engraven in stone" (2 Cor. 3: 7, 9), which 
              ministration, the Holy Spirit tells us, is "done away" and 
              "abolished" (vers. 11, 13), and in its place we have "the 
              ministration of the Spirit" and "the ministration of 
              righteousness" (vers. 8, 9).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              Again we read in Colossians that the "handwriting of ordinances" 
              was "blotted out" and "nailed" to Christ's cross (as of old, bills 
              were nailed to the doorpost when when paid), for Christ has

                his lever.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is 
                said that the ceremonial law, and the civil law of Israel, have 
                been abolished but not the moral law, and that the Sabbath as 
                occurring in the Decalogue, is part of the unrevoked moral law 
                of God.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But (1) 
                most remarkably no inspired writer ever makes any such 
                distinction between "moral" and "ceremonial" law; the ceremonial 
                law <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">(e.g., </I>Lev. 19) 
                contains laws as purely moral as any in the Decalogue, and had 
                we been delivered from the ceremonial, while remaining under the 
                moral, Paul would most surely have said so—an utterance he never 
                makes. (2) The Sabbath, in-its nature, is itself a ceremonial 
                law: the moral law is all law which appeals to the conscience, 
                and needs no written revelation; but as to which day to observe, 
                or whether to observe any day at all, conscience is silent.<SPAN 
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If we aye to distinguish 
                between the moral and the ceremonial law, on the ground that one 
                is passed, and the other still in force, then–as the Sabbath is 
                purely ceremonial law–<I>it is passed</I><I 
                style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">.<SPAN 
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></I>But the most 
                important point still remains. (3) I, as a Christian, obey all 
                law that is moral in the Decalogue, not because it is in the 
                Law, <I>but because it is in the Gospel</I><I 
                style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">.<SPAN 
                style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></I>Worship of God only 
                is enjoined fifty times in the New Testament; idolatry is 
                forbidden twelve times; profanity four times; honor of father 
                and mother is commanded six times; adultery is forbidden twelve; 
                theft six<U>;</U> false witness four; and covetousness, nine 
                times.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>"The Ten

                and Christians, but only to the Jews." </SPAN>So therefore, 
                Paul, in all his fourteen epistles, never once names the 
                Sabbath–except in a single passage where, classing it with the 
                entire law, he declares it has been totally abolished.<SPAN
