<H1>Death: What does the Bible say about it?</H1>
<P>.The Bible talks about death as a sleep, refers to resurrections, the soul 
and spirit in death, and immortality.</P>
<P>A SLEEP - In John 11:11-14 (NIV) Jesus compares death to sleep. "'…Our friend 
Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.' His disciples 
replied, 'Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.' Jesus had been speaking of 
his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. So then he told 
them plainly, 'Lazarus is dead,.'" The Bible compares death to sleep over 50 
times.</P>
<P>We are told in I Thessalonians 4:15-16 (NIV) that those asleep in Jesus rise 
at His Second Coming. "According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who 
are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not 
precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from 
heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the 
trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."</P>
<P>RESURRECTIONS - There are two resurrections-one to life and one to eternal 
condemnation. John 5:28-29 (NIV). "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is 
coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out-those 
who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to 
be condemned."</P>
<P>Genesis 2:7 (KJV) records the creation of man in the beginning. "And the Lord 
God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the 
breath of life; and man became a living soul." God did not put a soul into man. 
It is like an equation: Dust + Breath = a living soul. If you were going to make 
a wooden box you could say: boards + nails = a box. You take a few wooden boards 
and nail them together to make a box. If you take them apart again and pull all 
the nails out of the wood and put the nails in a pile and the boards in a stack. 
What happened to the box? It just ceased to exist until you put it back together 
again. That is the way it is with death. You take away the breath, that spark of 
life which comes from God and the body will return to dust (or sometimes to 
ashes in the case of cremation). What happened to the soul? It just ceases to be 
until God comes at the resurrection and puts it back together again. At that 
time the dust and the breath of life are reunited and then you have a life, a 
live person or live soul again. </P>
<P>The interval between death and the resurrection is described in the Bible as 
"sleep." No consciousness of what is happening, or time passing, etc. Dying is 
like going to sleep and your next conscious thought-it will seem like the next 
moment-is when God resurrects you giving you back your life.</P>
<P>SOUL AND SPIRIT IN DEATH - Ecclesiastes 12:7 says the body returns to the 
dust and the spirit [or breath of life] returns to God. Job 27:3 tells us that 
the spirit is the same as God's breath of life or His power.</P>
<P>Psalm 146:4 (KJV) says, "When their spirit departs, they return to the 
ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing." The dead do not praise 
God, Psalm 115:17. The dead do not know anything, Ecclesiastes 9:5, "For the 
living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing."</P>
<P>IMMORTALITY - Human beings do not have immortality, only God does. (see I 
Timothy 6:16). We receive immortality when Jesus comes again. (see I Corinthians 
15:51-54). When Jesus comes His reward of eternal life will be with Him. (see 
Revelation 22:12).</P>
<P>The Bible says heaven is a real place in John 14:1-3 (NIV), "Do not let your 
hearts be troubled. Trust in God, trust also in me. In my Father's house are 
many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. And if I go and prepare a 
place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be 
where I am."</P>
<P>God will give us glorious immortal bodies. Philippians 3:21 and I Corinthians 
15:51-54. All physical deformities will be cured. (The eyes of the blind will be 
opened, the ears of the deaf unstopped and the crippled healed.) Isaiah 35:3-6. 
They will build houses and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards and eat the 
fruit of them. Isaiah 65:21-23. The wolf and lamb will feed together. God's New 
Kingdom will be one of tranquil peace. Isaiah 65:25. We will fellowship with 
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the greatest minds of the ages forever. Matthew 
8:11.</P>
<P>God Himself shall be with us and be our God. Revelation 21:3. We shall 
lovingly serve our God forever and enjoy the closest fellowship with Him. 
Revelation 22:3-4.</P></DIV>
