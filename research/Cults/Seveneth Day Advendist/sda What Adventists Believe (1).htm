            <P>As a Christian church, Seventh-day Adventists are a faith 
            community rooted in the beliefs described by the Holy Scriptures. 
            Adventists describe these beliefs in the following ways:</P>
            <P><B>God's greatest desire is for you to see a clear picture of His 
            character. When you see Him clearly, you will find His love 
            irresistible.</B></P>
            <P>For many, "seeing God clearly" requires that they see God's face. 
            However, how He looks is not the issue. Seeing and understanding His 
            character is what's most important. The more clearly we understand 
            Him, the more we will find His love irresistible. As we begin to 
            experience His love, our own lives will begin to make more 
sense.</P>
            <P>God most clearly reveals His character in three great events. The 
            first is His creation of man and woman--and His giving them the 
            freedom of choice. He created humans with the ability to choose to 
            love Him or to hate Him! The death of Jesus Christ, God's only Son, 
            on the cross as our substitute is the second great event. In that 
            act He paid the penalty we deserve for our hateful choices toward 
            God and His ways. Jesus' death guarantees forgiveness for those 
            choices and allows us to spend eternity with Him. The third event 
            confirms the first two and fills every heart with hope: Christ's 
            tomb is empty! He is alive, living to fill us with His love!</P>
            <P>Jesus' disciple John wrote that if everyone wrote all the stories 
            they knew about Jesus, the whole world could not contain them. Our 
            knowledge of God helps us understand His love, character, and grace. 
            Experiencing that love begins a lifelong adventure in growth and 
            service. This knowledge and experience powers our mission to tell 
            the world about His love and His offer of salvation.</P>
            <P><B>Scripture is a road map. The Bible is God's voice, speaking 
            His love personally to you today.</B></P>
            <P>The Bible speaks the Creator's directions to us, like a detailed 
            road map that clearly shows the exit ramp directly into heaven. It 
            is also much like an owner's manual for a life ready to be lived on 
            the cutting edge of liberty.</P>
            <P>Sometimes His voice speaks through stories, such as those of 
            David and Goliath, Ruth and Boaz, Naaman's little servant girl, 
            Christ on the cross, and fisherman Peter learning how to tend sheep. 
            Some of these stories teach us how to handle the troubles we face 
            each day. Others fill us with hope and peace. Each of them is like a 
            personal letter from God to you.</P>
            <P>Portions of Scripture are direct instructions and laws from God 
            such as the Ten Commandments, recorded in Exodus 20. These tell us 
            more about God and His expectations for us. When people asked Jesus 
            to summarize these commands, He focused on the way God's love 
            affects the way we live. "Love the Lord your God with all your 
            heart, mind, and soul," He said. "And love your neighbor as you love 
            yourself."</P>
            <P>On other pages the Bible gives God's practical advice and 
            encouragement through parables, lists, promises, and warnings. 
            Amazingly, though many different writers throughout thousands of 
            years wrote the Bible, each page describes the same God in ways we 
            can understand and apply in our lives today. This book is always His 
            voice talking personally to anyone who is willing to read and 
            hear.</P>
            <P>God loves us even when we choose to reject His love. In those 
            times He allows us to walk away into the life of our own choices. 
            Yet He is still there, always ready to redeem us from the results of 
            our decisions.</P>
            <P><B>Jesus is the one who never changes in a universe that always 
            does. Jesus is Creator, Sustainer, Saviour, Friend, God's Son, and 
            God Himself!</B></P>
            <P>Everything in this world is always changing, even our desires, 
            interests, skills, and body shapes. But Jesus? He's consistent. He's 
            always the same. Sure, He's always surprising us and touching our 
            lives in thousands of new and different ways, but His character is 
            unchanging. He's God's Son, the Creator, our Saviour, and Friend. 
            </P>
            <P>Jesus has promised to be all of that, and more, for each of us. 
            We can trust His promises because He is God. When the words of 
            Colossians say "in Him all things hold together" (1:17, NIV) that 
            includes everything in our lives. He keeps us whole when the enemy 
            is trying to make us fall apart.</P>
            <P>Seventh-day Adventists believe that Jesus is one of the three 
            persons, called the Trinity, who make up our one God. The Bible 
            describes Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit as each being 
            committed to our growth as Christians and to our salvation as their 
            children. They made this salvation possible when Jesus came to 
            Bethlehem as a human baby. He lived a life perfectly in accord with 
            God's will and then died innocently for all of our sins. He was 
            placed in a borrowed tomb, but He came back to life three days 
            later. Now he is in heaven interceding with the Father for us, 
            preparing for our deliverance from sin and death.</P>
            <P>When everything may be falling apart, when you feel totally alone 
            in the universe, Jesus is right there in the center of it all, 
            offering personal peace and hope. Allow Him into your life. He 
            immediately begins "remodeling" who you are and how you live. Jesus, 
            in fact, is busily transforming His followers into accurate 
            representatives of God's character.</P>
            <P>Look to Jesus, and you'll be looking into the understanding and 
            loving face of God.</P>
            <P><B>God's vision for you is life as He lives it! God loves you, 
            and wants to give you the highest quality of life 
imaginable.</B></P>
            <P>No, not a second-rate existence somewhere on earth, but the 
            highest quality of life imaginable, here and in eternity with Him! 
            That's what God wants us to have. The best!</P>
            <P>This is why He provides church families where we can belong. This 
            is why He gives each of us special gifts and talents, so we can live 
            life fully. Amazingly, this is why He's concerned about what you're 
            doing, when you're doing it, and how you relate to Him. God doesn't 
            want anything to get in the way of our friendship. He especially 
            doesn't want us to get involved in anything damaging or hurtful. 
            He's like a loving father or a good big brother. He's someone who 
            loves you so much that He's always looking out for you.</P>
            <P>When God designed you, He included special talents and skills 
            that will help you become a uniquely valuable individual. These may 
            be your ability to teach, your love for others, or your leadership 
            skills. Still, whatever special gifts you have received, God has 
            also provided all of the energy and wisdom necessary for you to use 
            them well.</P>
            <P>By the way, how God feels about death is part of the quality life 
            He offers. For followers of Christ, death holds no fear. Remember, 
            Jesus defeated death on Calvary and has given us freedom from death. 
            Cemeteries, then, are filled with followers of God who are in the 
            "peaceful pause before the resurrection." Yes, they are dead, but 
            that death holds no power over their future. Jesus is coming to take 
            them (and those of us who are still living) HOME! Death is almost 
            like a wintery promise of spring.</P>
            <P>The Seventh-day Adventist faith in today and in the future comes 
            from seeing this life "overflowing" with hope!</P>
            <P>Because love is the key aspect of His character, God is also 
            deeply into gratitude. Before we even finish saying thank you, He's 
            already busy sending more blessings.</P>
            <P><B>In the heart of God is a place you can experience as home. God 
            loves you, and wants to spend time with you personally, one on one, 
            as two close friends.</B></P>
            <P>Because you and God are friends, you will spend time together as 
            friends do. Each morning you'll share a hello and a hug and discuss 
            how you can face the day's events together. Throughout the day 
            you'll talk with Him about how you feel. You'll laugh with Him at 
            funny things and ache with Him over sadness and hurts. It's pleasant 
            being God's friend, able to snuggle comfortably into the safety of 
            your relationship. You can always trust Him to treat you well, 
            because He loves you.</P>
            <P>The seventh day (Saturday) is an extra-special part of the 
            relationship. The Bible, from Genesis through Revelation, describes 
            the seventh day as the one day God has set aside for focused 
            fellowship with His people. God has named that day "Sabbath" and 
            asked us to spend it with Him. "Remember the sabbath day," He says, 
            "to keep it holy." The Sabbath is a whole day to deepen our 
            friendship with the Creator of the universe! A day when we're 
            together, Jesus with us and us with Jesus.</P>
            <P>There's another great truth about friendship with God. It doesn't 
            end in a cemetery, for God is planning a homecoming better than 
            anything we can dream. A homecoming filled with angels, trumpets, 
            Jesus, and resurrections! He's promised to bring His followers, 
            those who have accepted the offer of His life-changing love, from 
            this earth to His home, a place He calls heaven. A place where our 
            friendship can go on growing forever, endlessly, joyfully!</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>God keeps a family album-and your picture is in it. God loves 
              you and has a plan for your life. </LI></UL>
            <P>God's love is about you. Personally.</P>
            <P>God made you and has a very special plan for your life. It's a 
            plan that will fill you with hope, love, peace, and activity. In 
            fact, when Christ paid the penalty for sin on the cross, that gave 
            Him the right to claim you as His own. As a result, you can 
            experience His love and priceless salvation freely and fully without 
            limit.</P>
            <P>By the way, pictures of everyone fill that album: Nepalese, 
            Brazilians, Nigerians, Yupiks, Germans, people of every nation, 
            culture, background, gender, hair color, and foot size. In God's 
            eyes all are equally "children of the King"!</P>
            <P>Salvation? God cleans away all our sins and replaces them with 
            His goodness. We don't have to be "good" for Him to accept us. 
            Nevertheless, we must accept His promise and allow Him to clean out 
            everything the enemy has left in us. Then we begin to experience the 
            transforming power of His love. It's like a giant war: one side 
            pulling us toward empty pleasure and destruction, and God urging us 
            to accept His offer of peace and purpose.</P>
            <P>Remember, Jesus has already won the war. He is victorious! We 
            celebrate His victory in our lives when we participate in the Lord's 
            Supper. This meal includes three symbols:</P>
            <UL>
              <LI>Foot washing (which symbolizes our commitment to love others 
              as Jesus loves us), 
              <LI>bread ("This bread is my flesh," Jesus said, "which I will 
              give for the life of the world," John 6:51, NIV), and 
              <LI>wine or grape juice ("Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my 
              blood has eternal life." John 6:54, NIV) </LI></UL>
            <P>To help us understand how God can transform us into His children, 
            Jesus modeled the process of baptism for us. Baptism symbolized 
            dying to self and coming alive in Jesus. Seventh-day Adventists 
            practice full immersion baptism because by being fully buried 
            beneath the water we symbolize that God's grace fully fills us with 
            His new life for the future. Through baptism we are truly born again 
            in Jesus.</P>
            <P>Eternal life, peace, purpose, forgiveness, transforming grace, 
            hope: Everything He promises is ours, because He's offering it and 
            He's shown we can trust Him to do exactly as He promises. Accept His 
            gifts, and you immediately become an active part of His family, and 
            He joyfully becomes part of yours.</P><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><IMG
