      <P>"...I have been as they say 'through the mill.' I became an Adventist 
      in Chicago under the labors of G. B. Starr, and was very zealous for what 
      is called 'Present Truth.' I truly believed it was the truth, the whole 
      truth, and nothing but the truth, and lived up to the testimonies with all 
      faithful&shy;ness discarding meat, butter, fish, fowl and the supper meal, 
      believing that as the 'Testimonies' say, 'No meat-eater will be 
      translated.' I had been faithfully instructed by Eld. Starr that the 
      testimonies came, as they were, written from God...<B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">I had been taught that oysters were abominable in God's 
      sight... </SPAN></B>I had several good openings for original writings at 
      the time which would have been more to my taste; but waived everything to 
      go with the 'prophet.'...I left to go with Sr. White on the very day when 
      my brother was to be married. At the depot Sr. White was not with her 
      party, so Eld. Starr hunted around till he found her behind a screen in 
      the restaurant <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red"><FONT size=4>very gratified in 
      eating big white raw oysters with vinegar, pepper and salt. 
      </FONT></SPAN></B>I was overwhelmed by this inconsistency and dumb with 
      horror. Eld. Starr hurried me out and made all sort of excuses and 
      justifications of Sr. White's action; yet I kept thinking in my heart, 
      'What does this mean? What has God said? <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">How 
      does she dare eat these abominations?'</SPAN></B> On the cars out to 
      California, W. C. White came into the train with a great thick piece of <B

      beefsteak</SPAN> </B>spread out on a brown paper and he bore it through

      of</SPAN> </B>it except myself and Marian Davis who I found out afterwards 
      was more the author of the books purported to be Sr. White's than she was 
      her&shy;self. I was with Mrs. White for seven and a half years like a soul 
      on a rock, because of all kinds of inconsistencies, injustices, and 
      chicaneries. <FONT color=#ff0000><B><FONT size=4>I have seen Sr. White eat

      etc. I cannot go into detail but Sr. Daniells told me she herself had 
      cooked meat for Sr. White on the campground. Eld. Horn told me his wife 
      had done the same thing. Sr. Rousseau told me that she too had done so.
