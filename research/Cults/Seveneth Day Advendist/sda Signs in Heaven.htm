      caused by God and a sign that he was about to return. The evidence will 
      show that she was mistaken. Because Ellen is the Adventist's prophet they 
      still teach this non Biblical doctrine from the book <I>Great 
      Controversy</I> by Ellen G. White and promote this book as a missionary 
      book. What Ellen saw in 1833, was the Leonid meteor shower that we will be

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">&nbsp;It has been 165 years from the stars 
      falling in 1833 to now, November 1998. How does the Bible describe the 
      falling stars and what events take place surrounding this end of the world 
      event? Does the Bible tell us we can expect many years between each sign 
      and all this will take place a great number of years before Christ's 
      second coming? If this was a sign of Christ's coming in 1833, what good 
      was it for the people that witnessed in 1833 as they are all dead? The 
      Bible teaches that the signs are to take place before people that are 
      alive to witness, just before Jesus comes. The people who are alive before 
      Jesus comes will witness the stars falling and the prophecy will be 
      fulfilled. It was not fulfilled 165 years ago in 1833 as all those people 
      are now dead! <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>

        in the sky fell to earth, as late figs drop from a fig tree when shaken 
        by a strong wind." 
        <LI>(Rev 6:14 NIV) "The sky receded like a scroll, rolling up, and every 
        mountain and island was <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">removed from its 
        place</SPAN></B>." 
        <LI>(Rev 6:15 NIV) "Then the <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">kings of the

        every slave and every free man <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">hid in

        they cried, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the 
        throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day of their wrath 
        has come, and who can stand?" </LI></UL>
      <P><B>Was there an earthquake just prior to the falling of the stars in 
      1833, that caused mountains and islands to move out of their places? The 
      answer is NO. <O:P></O:P></B></P>
      <P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Ellen G. White however says 
      yes:</SPAN></B><SPAN style="COLOR: red"> "These signs were witnessed 
      before the opening of the nineteenth century. In fulfillment of this 
      prophecy there occurred, in the year 1755, the most terrible earthquake 
      that has ever been recorded. Though commonly known as the earthquake of 
      Lisbon, it extended to the greater part of Europe, Africa, and America." 
      <I>Great Controversy</I>, p. 304. </SPAN>Does the Lisbon earthquake of 
      November 1, 1755 compare to the one described in Revelation 6 with 
      mountains and islands moving out of their places and the Kings of the 
      earth hiding in caves and rocks? No! Ellen was wrong.</P>
      <P><B>Was there a dark day just after the giant earthquake and before the 
      stars fell? No. </B>It is important to notice that Revelation 6:13 uses 
      the word "and" to connect the dark day "and" the stars falling. There is 
      no reference to gaps of many years between each of the signs. All four 
      signs are one big event taking place at one time at the end of the 
      world.</P>

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">"In a series of three articles (May 22, May 
      29, June 5, 1980) appearing in the <I>Adventist Review, </I>Merton E. 
      Springle conclusively demonstrated that the Dark Day of May 19, 1780 was 
      caused by smoke from huge forest fires burning in the New England states 
      combining with a dark storm front passing through the area. Furthermore, 
      if one locates the extent of the darkness on a globe, it is clear that the 
      area covered was virtually an infinitesimal portion of the earth's 
      surface, and thus certainly not the cosmic event described in Revelation 
      6." <I>Spectrum, </I>Volume 12, number 4, p. 7. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>

      </SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Ellen was wrong comparing this Dark Day to 
      Moses' day. In Moses time the Dark Day was a supernatural event, the Dark 
      Day of 1780 was a natural event caused by a forest fire and a storm.

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">"In the <I>Collegiate Quarterly</I> of 
      April-June 1980, pages 71-72, the same author (Merton Springle) has 
      pointed out that this meteor shower of November 1833 'was by no means a 
      singular event. In fact, it is a regular event occurring with records 
      going back as far back as 902 A.D.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">In the past, much has been said about the 
      1833</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue"> </SPAN><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: blue">shower being the greatest on record. LeRoy Froom, for 
      example, has a chart comparing some recent meteor showers. There he lists 
      the Leonids of 1833 at the rate of 60,000 meteors per hour, while the next 
      highest he lists the Giacobinids of 1933 at only 15,000 meteors per hour. 
      While accurate techniques for counting falling meteors have only been 
      developed recently, with considerable progress having been made since 
      1833, the descriptions of early records strongly remind one of popular 
      accounts of the 1833 shower found in Adventist literature.<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">For example, concerning the 902 A.D. Leonid 
      meteor shower, Arabic records state that "an infinite number of stars were 
      seen during the night, scattering themselves like rain to the right and 
      left." Then when observing the same system in 1202 A.D., it is recorded 
      that the meteors "flew against one another, like a scattering swarm of 
      locusts." Thus, there is no inherent reason to suppose that the 1833 
      shower must have been greater than anything ever seen. However, there is 
      even more precise, positive evidence that the1833 shower has been 
      surpassed. Scientific reports of the 1966 Leonid shower mention 
      rates</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue"> </SPAN><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: blue">up to 150,000 per hour, or two-and-a-half times the 
      rate of the 1833</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue"> 
      </SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">shower, according to Froom's figures. In 
      sum, both the 1833 meteor shower and the 1780 Dark Day have natural 
      causes, not, as commonly believed supernatural causes." <I>Spectrum,

      <UL type=disc>
        <LI>The Lisbon earthquake was not the quake of Revelation 6 that will be 
        world wide event, with the kings of the earth hiding in the rocks and 
        the mountains and islands moving from their places. <O:P></O:P>
        <LI>The Dark Day was a normal occurrence of a forest fire combined with 
        a storm front in a small section of north east United States. The Dark 
        Day of Revelation 6, is a global event that is witnessed by the world 
        and not by a few in United States that have long since died. <O:P></O:P>
        <LI>The falling Stars of 1833, were a normal occurrence that happens 
        every 33 years, with the first being recorded in 902 A. D. <O:P></O:P>
        <LI>These events happen together and not large gaps of years between 
        them as Adventists teach and people living will witness these events and 
        not those that have died over 200 years ago that saw the Lisbon quake. 
        <O:P></O:P>
        <LI>Ellen was in error on all the events of Revelation 6. </LI></UL>
