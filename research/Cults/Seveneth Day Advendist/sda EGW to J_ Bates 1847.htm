      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">This letter was hid from the members of the 
      Seventh-day Adventist Church and only part of the letter was used by 
      Adventist leaders that would suit their purpose which was not to let the 
      members know that Ellen believed in the shut door after 1845. The damaging 
      parts of the letter that showed that Ellen G. White believed in the "Shut 
      Door" after 1845, was never released to the public or members of the SDA 
      Church till 1980. Adventist Presidents and leaders had access to this 
      letter and cannot plead ignorance to its existence. An 1847 hand letter 
      written by Ellen G. White, would be a letter they could not refuse to read 
      or ignore, especially since Ellen was being accused of believing in the 
      shut door by vision after 1845. </SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: red">This 
      letter proves Ellen did not get her visions from God.</SPAN><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: blue"> The door of mercy was never closed to the world as 
      taught by William Miller and confirmed by Ellen's vision.

      </SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: red">of deception;</SPAN><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: blue"> from the book, <I>Ellen G. White and Her Critics, 
      </I>by Francis D. Nichol, p.621 in a footnote that states, "<I>This date 
      is established by a letter from Mrs. White to Joseph Bates, written from 
      Gorham, Maine, July 13, 1847."</I> Why didn't Nichol's print this letter? 
      His attempts to defend Ellen G. White visions against the charge they 
      taught Shut Door Doctrines, totally ignored the fact that Ellen did 
      believe in the shut door as revealed in the 1847 Bates' letter. At this 
      point in time the Shut Door meant that the door of mercy was closed to the 
      world as taught and renounced by William Miller. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Another example of deception;</SPAN><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: blue"> from <I>Life Sketches, </I>published in 1915, p.104, 
      where the publishers show a photograph of page one in Ellen's handwriting 
      of the Bates' letter. The White Estate had full knowledge of the fact that 
      Ellen believed in the shut door from her visions. This letter was put back 
      in the White Estate Vault after 1915 and never saw the light of day till 
      it was uncovered by Skip Baker in 1980, and later published in 
      <I>Adventist Currents</I>, in July 1984. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Robert Olson, of the White Estate;</SPAN><SPAN

      style="COLOR: blue">But she incorrectly concluded that no one could accept 
      Christ after October 22, that only the little flock remaining in the 
      household of faith would be saved, and that everyone else would be lost." 
      <I>One Hundred and One Questions, </I>1980,<I> </I>p. 58. Robert Olsen's 
      confession only came when the Bates' letter was uncovered. From 1847 till 
      1980 is 133 years of deception. Does this remind anyone of the 1919 Bible 
      Conference records that were hid 55 years till 1974, when found by Donald 
      Yost. This has been the history of Adventism, to hide, lie and cover up 
      the truth of Adventist history. Uncover the truth has never been approved 
      of by Adventist leaders, look at Rae, Ford, Veltman, Ron Numbers and the 
      list goes on. SDA apologists can no longer say that Ellen G. White did not 
      believe the "SHUT DOOR" meaning the door of mercy was closed to the world 
      by vision from God, as her own word's declare. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>

      </SPAN>"I believe it was just around the new year of 1979-80. 1 was a 
      photographer at the Review and Herald Publishing Association. A number of 
      us were in the art department discussing the transcript of a letter 
      written by Ellen G. White which someone had sent me the week before. The 
      book editor, Tom Davis, had just joined our conversation; and with some 
      warmth he was insisting that the transcript was not genuine, since it 
      indicated that Ellen White believed in the shut-door three and a half 
      years after the great disappointment. This was the meaning of the term 
      "shut door," held by the pioneers of Seventh-day Adventism until 1851: 
      that only those who had believed William Miller's mistaken message could 
      be saved. All others were lost since the bridegroom had come and "shut the 
      door" of probation.<O:P> </O:P></P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Elder Davis asked if I had seen the original letter; and when I 
      admitted that I had not, he said that I shouldn't talk about something 
      that I could not prove and knew very little about. I agreed completely and 
      realized how easy it would be for someone to fabricate the letter in an 
      attempt to discredit Sister White. I resolved then and there not to talk 
      about the letter until I could read the original in the Ellen G. White 
      Estate vault, if it existed at all.<O:P> </O:P></P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>In the photo studio at that time I had a large oil painting 
      attached to the wall waiting to be copied on 8xI0 sheet film for 
      reproduction. The White Estate had commissioned the artist, Elfred Lee, to 
      render a beautiful depiction of the fall of man, his redemption, and the 
      Second Coming of Christ; and they wanted to sell copies at the upcoming 
      General Conference session in Dallas. Ron Graybill called from the White 
      Estate to say how desperately they needed the transparency to meet their 
      printing deadline, and suddenly I had a flash: "Tell you what, Ron," I 
      said, "bring me Ellen White's July 13, 1847, letter to Joseph Bates; and I 
      will drop everything and photograph your painting today."<O:P> </O:P></P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"Has that letter been released?" he asked. And I told him that 
      Arthur White had released a transcript to the scholars in 1971. This 
      satisfied him, and later he arrived in my office with the letter, anxious 
      to get the painting shot and to the printers. When he left I took the 
      letter into the studio, thinking that if I worked fast there might be just 
      enough time to photograph it before he returned. My hand trembled as I 
      laid the 133-year-old letter on the copy table, adjusted the polarizing 
      lights, put a red filter on my 6x7 Pentax, and filled the viewfinder with 
      the letter. Due to the cross-polarized lights and red filter, the enlarged 
      photographs were easier to read than the original; and when I compared it 
      to the typed transcript, I discovered that the two were nearly 
      identical.<SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN><O:P></O:P></P>
      <P>The White Estate typescript is corrected for spelling, capitalization, 
      and punctuation. Punctuation and capitalization are all but missing from 
      Ellen White's handwritten original, and the White Estate has supplied 
      paragraphing where there is none in the original. The letter ends abruptly 
      because its closing page or pages apparently are not in the possession of 
      the White Estate."<O:P> </O:P></P>

      and by the grace of God he never shall. I know and feel my weakness, but I 
      have laid hold upon the strong arm of Jehovah, and I can say today I know 
      that my Redeemer liveth, and if He lives I shall live also. Oh how good it 
      would be to meet with a few of like precious faith to exhort and comfort

      <P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Brother Bates, you write in a 
      letter to James something about the Bridegroom's coming, as stated in the 
      first published visions. By the letter you would like to know whether I 
      had light on the Bridegroom's coming before I saw it in vision. I can 
      readily answer, No. The Lord showed me the travail of the Advent band and 
      midnight cry in December, but He did not show me the Bridegroom's coming 
      until February following. Perhaps you would like to have me give a 
      statement in relation to both visions. At the time I had the vision of the 
      midnight cry I had given it up in the past and thought it future, as also 
      most of the band had. I know not what time J. Turner got out his paper. I 
      knew he had one out and one was in the house, but I knew not what was in 
      it, for I did not read a word in it. I had been, and still was very sick, 
      I took no interest in reading, for it injured my head and made me nervous. 
      After I had the vision and God gave me light, He bade me deliver it to the 
      band, but I shrank from it. I was young, and I thought they would not 
      receive it from me. I disobeyed the Lord, and instead of remaining at 
      home, where the meeting was to be that night, I got in a sleigh in the 
      morning and rode three or four miles and there I found J. T. He merely 
      inquired how I was and if I was in the way of my duty. I said nothing, for 
      I knew I was not. I passed up chamber and did not see him again for two 
      hours, when he came up, asked if I was to be at meeting that night. I told 
      him, No. He said he wanted to hear my vision and thought it duty for me to 
      go home. I told him I should not. He said no more, but went away. I 
      thought, and told those around me, if I went I should have to come out 
      against his views, thinking he believed with the rest. I had not told any 
      of them what God had shown me, and I did not tell them in what I should 
      cut across his track.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      fear and trembling I told him all. After I had got through he said he had 
      told out the same last evening. I was rejoiced, for I expected he was 
      coming out against me, for all the while I had not heard any one say what 
      he believed. He said the Lord had sent him to hear me talk the evening 
      before, but as I would not, he meant his children should have the light in 
      some way, so he took him. There were but few out when he talked, so the

      God, received what God bade me to deliver to them.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      said it was entirely new to them. The Lord worked in mighty power setting 
      the truth home to their hearts. Sister Durben knew what the power of the

      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align=center>Gorham, Maine, July 13, 1847 
      <BR><BR>Dear Brother Bates: <BR><BR>As James is at work and sisters are 
      from home[,] thought I would employ myself in writing a line to you. My 
      health is quite good for me. My faith is still strong that that very same 
      Jesus that ascended up into heaven will so come in like manner as He went 
      up, and that very, very soon. I have had many trials of late; 
      discouragement at times has laid so fast hold upon me it seemed impossible 
      to shake it off. But thank God, Satan has not got the victory over me yet, 
      and by the grace of God he never shall. I know and feel my weakness, but I 
      have laid hold upon the strong arm of Jehovah, and I can say today I know 
      that my Redeemer liveth, and if He lives I shall live also. Oh how good it 
      would be to meet with a few of like precious faith to exhort and comfort 
      one another with words of holy cheer from the word of God. The sheep are 
      now scattered, but thank God, they are about to be gathered to a good 
      pasture. <BR><BR>Oh how sweet it will be to meet all the blood-washed 
      throng in the city of our God. 'Tis then we'll sing the song of Moses and 
      the Lamb as we march through the gates into the city, bearing the palms of 
      victory and wearing the crowns of glory. <BR><BR>Brother Bates, you write 
      in a letter to James something about the Bridegroom's coming, (#1) as 
      stated in the first published visions. By the letter you would like to 
      know whether I had light on the Bridegroom's coming before I saw it in 
      vision. I can readily answer, No. The Lord showed me the travail of the 
      Advent band and midnight cry in December, but He did not show me the 
      Bridegroom's coming until February following. Perhaps you would like to 
      have me give a statement in relation to both visions. At the time I had 
      the (#2) vision of the midnight cry I had given it up in the past and 
      thought it future, as also most of the band had. (#3) I know not what time 
      J. Turner got out his paper. I knew he had one out and one was in the 
      house, but I knew not what was in it, for I did not read a word in it. I 
      had been, and still was very sick, I took no interest in reading, for it 
      injured my head and made me nervous. After I had the vision and God gave 
      me light, He bade me deliver it to the band, but I shrank from it. I was 
      young, and I thought they would not receive it from me. (#4) I disobeyed 
      the Lord, and instead of remaining at home, where the meeting was to be 
      that night, I got in a sleigh in the morning and rode three or four miles 
      and there I found J. T. He merely inquired how I was and if I was in the 
      way of my duty. I said nothing, for I knew I was not. I passed up chamber 
      and did not see him again for two hours, when he came up, asked if I was 
      to be at meeting that night. I told him, No. He said he wanted to hear my 
      vision and thought it duty for me to go home. I told him I should not. He 
      said no more, but went away. I thought, and told those around me, if I 
      went I should have to come out against his views, thinking he believed 
      with the rest. I had not told any of them what God had shown me, and I did 
      not tell them in what I should cut across his track. 
      <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (#5) All that day I suffered much in body 
      and mind. It seemed that God had forsaken me entirely. I prayed the Lord 
      if he would give me strength to ride home that night, the first 
      opportunity I would deliver the message He had given me. He did give me 
      strength and I rode home that night. Meeting had been done some time, and 
      not a word was said by any of the family about the meeting. <BR><BR>(#6) 
      Very early next morning J. T. called, said he was in haste going out of 
      the city in a short time, and wanted I should tell him all that God had 
      shown me in vision. It was with fear and trembling I told him all. After I 
      had got through he said he had told out the same last evening. I was 
      rejoiced, for I expected he was coming out against me, for all the while I 
      had not heard any one say what he believed. He said the Lord had sent him 
      to hear me talk the evening before, but as I would not, he meant his 
      children should have the light in some way, so he took him. There were but 
      few out when he talked, so the next meeting I told my vision, and the 
      band, believing my visions from God, received what God bade me to deliver 
      to them. <BR><BR>(#7) The view about the Bridegroom's coming I had about 
      the middle of February, 1845. <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(#8) While 
      in Exeter, Maine in meeting with Israel Dammon, James, and many others, 
      many of them did not believe in a shut door. I suffered much at the 
      commencement of the meeting. Unbelief seemed to be on every hand. There 
      was one sister there that was called very spiritual. She had traveled and 
      been a powerful preacher the most of the time for twenty years. She had 
      been truly a mother in Israel. But a division had risen in the band on the 
      shut door. She had great sympathy, and could not believe the door was 
      shut. (I had known nothing of their differences.) Sister Durben got up to 
      talk. I felt very, very sad. At length my soul seemed to be in an agony, 
      and while she was talking (#9) I fell from my chair to the floor. It was 
      then I had a view of Jesus rising from His mediatorial throne and going to 
      the holiest as Bridegroom to receive His kingdom. They were all deeply 
      interested in the view. They all said it was entirely new to them. The 
      Lord worked in mighty power setting the truth home to their hearts. Sister 
      Durben knew what the power of the Lord was, for she had felt it many 
      times; and a short time after I fell she was struck down, and fell to the 
      floor, crying to God to have mercy on her. When I came out of vision, my 
      ears were saluted with Sister Durben's singing and shouting with a loud 
      voice. Most of them received the vision, and were settled upon the shut 
      door. Previous to this I had no light on the coming of the Bridegroom, but 
      had expected him to this earth to deliver His people on the tenth day of 
      the seventh month. I did not hear a lecture or a word in any way relating 
      to the Bridegroom's going to the holiest. <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      I had but very few privileges in 1842, 3 &amp; 4. My sisters both went to 
      the camp meetings in New Hampshire and Maine, while my health prevented me 
      from going to but one, in Maine. I know the light I received came from 
      God, it was not taught me by man. I knew not how to write so that others 
      could read it till God gave me my visions. I went to school but very 
      little on account of my health. I do not think I went to school a day 
      after I was twelve years old, and did not go then but a few days at a 
      time, when sickness would cause me to take my bed for weeks and sometimes

      <BR>__________________________<BR><B>Why this letter is so shocking for 
      <BR>Seventh-day Adventists!<BR>Breaking the Code:<BR>Understanding what 
      Ellen White was saying to Bates!<BR></B><BR>All through our history as 
      Adventists we were told that it was Ellen White’s two first visions that 
      corrected their wrong view of the Shut Door Doctrine, and that they led 
      the early church OUT of the Shut Door error. But as we will see here in 
      her Secret letter to Bates, just the opposite is the truth. <B><FONT 
      color=#ff0000>Let’s look at her letter point by point, and see what we 
      find. </FONT></B><BR><BR>(#1) we see that Bates had written to James White 
      and wanted to know if Ellen had read anything about “The Bridegroom’s 
      Coming” before she saw it in vision. And she is telling Bates that “no,” 
      she hadn’t read anything about that issue “before seeing it in vision” 
      from what we read here, in this the OLDEST document in the Ellen G. White 
      Estate vault. In fact as we’ll see, she will say that reading injured her 
      head so that even though she knew there was a copy of Turner’s paper in 
      the house, ON THAT VERY TOPIC, she still didn’t read it, something that 
      would have been of enormous interest to her and James White at that very 
      time that she is saying here in this letter that she was unable to read 
      about it, to make BATES believe that she got her information “from 
      visions” rather than any mere man made source! Ellen knew that BATES was a 
      “Shut Door Believer” and she wanted him to have faith in her “visions” so 
      she was quick to point out to him, that God had shown her that indeed the 
      door was shut!<BR><BR>(#2) “vision of the midnight cry I had given it up 
      in the past and thought it future, as also most of the band had.” Note 
      that she and the band had given up the midnight cry or Shut Door as being 
      something in the future, but as she will soon be telling Bates, it was 
      started on October 22, 1844. They had believed in the Shut Door, then gave 
      it up, but her visions” had reestablished the Shut Door as the Present 
      Truth and as she will tell Bates they were all settled upon the Shut Door! 
      <BR><BR>(#3) I know not what time J. Turner got out his paper. I knew he 
      had one out and one was in the house, but I knew not what was in it, for I 
      did not read a word in it. I had been, and still was very sick, I took no 
      interest in reading, for it injured my head and made me nervous.” Keep in 
      mind there was no radio for those long New England winter nights, no TV 
      and no Network News, so having something like Turner’s paper in the house 
      must have been tempting reading, yet Ellen White tells us that reading, 
      one of her favorite pastimes “injured” her head and made her “nervous”! 
      It’s clear that she didn’t want Bates to think she had picked up her “Shut 
      Door Doctrine” from Turner who’s paper was in the house so she made up 
      this statement that “reading injured” her head. But J. Bates wasn’t fooled 
      because he had written on his letter from Ellen White, the date that 
      Turner &amp; Hale’s paper had come out, showing that he knew where she had 
      gotten her views on the Shut Door after all.<BR><BR>(#4) “I disobeyed the 
      Lord, and instead of remaining at home, where the meeting was to be that 
      night, I got in a sleigh in the morning and rode three or four miles and 
      there I found J. T. He merely inquired how I was and if I was in the way 
      of my duty. I said nothing, for I knew I was not. I passed up chamber and 
      did not see him again for two hours, when he came up, asked if I was to be 
      at meeting that night. I told him, No. He said he wanted to hear my vision 
      and thought it duty for me to go home. I told him I should not.” Now our 
      credulity is stretched to the limit as she admits spending 2 hours at 
      Turner’s home, but goes on pretending that her “vision” wasn’t influenced 
      by Turner’s own stand on the Shut Door that he and Bates believed in. She 
      goes on to say she wouldn’t be at the meeting that was being held at her 
      own house that night, and tells “others” that she was afraid Turner would 
      come out against her, yet in his paper it was very clear that she was 
      right in line with what he had printed in his flyer! Oh what a tangled web 
      we weave when at first we practice to deceive.<BR><BR>(#5) “All that day I 
      suffered much in body and mind. It seemed that God had forsaken me 
      entirely. I prayed the Lord if he would give me strength to ride home that 
      night, the first opportunity I would deliver the message He had given me. 
      He did give me strength and I rode home that night. Meeting had been done 
      some time, and not a word was said by any of the family about the 
      meeting.” So, the “Shut Door Meeting” had been held, but we are to believe 
      that Ellen “missed” the meeting, and that nobody in her family told her 
      anything about this new and shocking “doctrine” that the door of mercy was 
      closed because the end of the world was so near. Now she has BATES 
      believing that her ONLY access to any information on the Shut Door, are 
      her two early visions. Let’s watch how these two “visions” lock the early 
      believers into believing that the Door of Mercy is closed forever, and 
      that no more sinners can be saved since time is so short.<BR><BR>(#6) 
      “Very early next morning J. T. called, said he was in haste going out of 
      the city in a short time, and wanted I should tell him all that God had 
      shown me in vision. It was with fear and trembling I told him all. After I 
      had got through he said he had told out the same last evening. I was 
      rejoiced, for I expected he was coming out against me, for all the while I 
      had not heard any one say what he believed.” How nice it is that they were 
      both in agreement. So! Ellen White says she stayed away from home the 
      night of a prayer meeting after being given a vision to give out, but 
      instead “JT” gives the sermon and says all the same things that he’d said 
      in his paper that Ellen had been left alone with, yet expects us to 
      believe she didn’t read because reading injured her head? But it gets much 
      better and as the reader will clearly see, Ellen White taught the Shut 
      Door Doctrine based on “visions” that were used for years in the early 
      Adventist Church. <BR><BR>(#7) “The view about the Bridegroom's coming I 
      had about the middle of February, 1845.” The very TERM “Bridegroom’s 
      coming” was just another name for the Shut Door because Jesus was the 
      bridegroom who had gotten up and “shut the door” that sealed probation for 
      sinners so that no more sinners could be saved except those who had 
      believed the false prediction that Jesus would come on October 22, 1844! 
      The little band of Adventists didn’t go out looking for converts because 
      according to Ellen’s visions, nobody else could be saved after that date 
      and this madness went on until 1851! But for now lets go back to Ellen’s 
      1847 letter to J. Bates that is so revealing:<BR><BR>(#8) “While in 
      Exeter, Maine in meeting with Israel Dammon, James, and many others, many 
      of them did not believe in a shut door. I suffered much at the 
      commencement of the meeting. Unbelief seemed to be on every hand. There 
      was one sister there that was called very spiritual. She had traveled and 
      been a powerful preacher the most of the time for twenty years. She had 
      been truly a mother in Israel. But a division had risen in the band on the 
      shut door. She had great sympathy, and could not believe the door was 
      shut. (I had known nothing of their differences.) Sister Durben got up to 
      talk. I felt very, very sad.” We ask ourselves WHY is it that sister White 
      felt very very sad? And low and behold, the reason is because Sister 
      Durben had great sympathy for the world and could not believe the shut 
      door! <BR><BR>(#9) I fell from my chair to the floor. It was then I had a 
      view of Jesus rising from His mediatorial throne and going to the holiest 
      as Bridegroom to receive His kingdom. They were all deeply interested in 
      the view. They all said it was entirely new to them. (Yet Ellen KNEW it 
      had been PRINTED by Turner &amp; Hale and that J. Bates she was writing 
      this letter to, were all “Shut Door Believers!) The Lord worked in mighty 
      power setting the truth home to their hearts. Sister Durben knew what the 
      power of the Lord was, for she had felt it many times; and a short time 
      after I fell she was struck down, and fell to the floor, crying to God to 
      have mercy on her. When I came out of vision, my ears were saluted with 
      Sister Durben's singing and shouting with a loud voice. </P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align=center>(#10) Let’s just look at point 
      ten: “Most of them received the vision, and were settled upon the shut 
      door.” We see that the entire thrust of the Bates Letter was to make sure 
      that Joe Bates knew that Ellen was a “Shut Door Believer” just like HIM, 
      and the letter does a fine job of doing just that. As a third generation 
      Seventh day Adventist in middle age I was dumbfounded to discover what 
      church officials had spent so much time and effort in keeping from me a 
      member, and it hasn’t changed in old age: Ellen G. White had taught a Shut 
      Door Doctrine that no more sinners could be saved throughout the entire 
      1840’s based on “visions” and that makes her a false prophet according to 
      the bible. See Jer. 14:14: “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. 
      I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are 
      prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination and the deceit of 
      their own minds.”<BR><BR>We must admit that no matter what a help we think 
      Ellen White may have been to our Christian walk, that she is no longer 
      that “help” for lying prophets have no place in the hearts of true 
      Christians. She must be rejected with all her other lies and we must stand 
      on the Bible and the Bible only.<BR><BR><B><?fontfamily?><?param Verdana?><?smaller?><?smaller?>Skip
