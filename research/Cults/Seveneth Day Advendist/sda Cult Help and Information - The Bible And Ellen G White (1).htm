<P>3 T (Example Vol.3 Testimonies For The Church)</P>"When a prophet speaketh in 
the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the 
thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken presumptuously 
thou shalt not be afraid of him" (Deut 18 :2 2)
<P><STRONG>WAS THE PLAN OF SALVATION MADE AFTER THE FALL?</STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P>BIBLE NO " For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible 
things as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition 
from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish 
and without spot Who verily was for-ordained before the foundation of the world, 
but was manifest in these last times for you (1 Pet. 1:18-20 KJV) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO " Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not 
according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was 
given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. (2 Tim.1:9) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised 
before the world began". (Titus 1: 2 KJV)</P>
<P>BIBLE NO "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the 
world. (Eph.1 : 4 KJV).</P>
<P>EGW YES "The kingdom of grace was instituted immediately after the fall of 
man when a plan was devised for the redemption of the guilty race"</P>
<P>(GC 347 , 1888 ed; See also EW 126, 149-151)</P>
<P><STRONG>AFTER THE FALL DID SATAN REPENT?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE Is silent on this matter.</P>
<P>EGW YES " After Satan was shut out of heaven, with those who fell with him, 
he realized that he had lost all the purity and glory of heaven forever. Then he 
repented and wished to be reinstated in heaven. He was willing to take his 
proper place, or any place that might be assigned him......He and his followers 
repented, wept and implored to be taken back into the favor of God. But no, 
their sin, their hate, their envy and jealousy, had been so great that God could 
not blot it out. It must remain to receive it's final punishment " (Spiritual 
Gifts Vol. 1 pp 18,19).</P>
<P><STRONG>WHY DID EVE FALL?</STRONG></P>
<P>EGW States that "Eve erred in wandering from her husband" (S.G.Vol.1, p 
20)</P>
<P>BIBLE "She took her husband of the fruit thereof and, did eat, and gave also 
unto her husband with her; and he did eat.". (Gen.3: 6 KJV)</P>
<P><STRONG>WHAT FURTHER ARE WE TOLD ABOUT THE PLAN OF SALVATION?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE "According as he hath chosen us before the foundation of the world 
".</P>
<P>(Eph. 1: 4)</P>
<P>EGW Writing on "The Plan of Salvation " we read, Sorrow filled heaven, as it 
was realized that man was lost, and the world that God created was to be filled 
with mortals doomed to misery, sickness and death, and there was, no way of 
escape for the offender. The whole family of Adam must die. I saw the lovely 
Jesus , and beheld an expression of sympathy and sorrow upon his countenance. 
Soon I saw him approach the exceeding bright light which enshrouded the Father. 
Said my accompanying angel," He is in close converse with the Father". The 
anxiety of the angels seemed to be intense while Jesus was communing with his 
Father. Three times he was shut in by the glorious light about the Father, and 
the third time he came from the Father, his person could be seen. His 
countenance was calm, free of all perplexity and trouble, and shone with 
benevolence and loveliness, such as words cannot express. He then made known to 
the angelic host that a way of escape had been made for lost man. He told them 
that he had been pleading with his Father, and had offered to give his life a 
ransom, and take the sentence of death upon himself, and through him man might 
find pardon. " (EW p . l 2 6 ; SG Vol. l, p.22,23)</P>
<P><STRONG>DID PAUL RECEIVE THE GOSPEL INDEPENDENT OF THE CHURCH ON 
EARTH?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of 
me is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, 
but by revelation of Jesus Christ. .But when it pleased God, who separated me 
from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace. to reveal his Son in me, that 
I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and 
blood Neither went I to up Jerusalem to then which were apostles before me; but 
I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. Then after three years I 
went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. But other of 
the apostles saw I none save James the Lord"s brother". (Gal 1:11- 19)</P>
<P>EGW NO "Paul must receive instruction in the Christian faith, and move 
understandingly. Christ sends him to the very disciples whom he had been so 
bitterly persecuting, to learn of them... . . From Christ all power a mercies 
were to flow; but he did not give Paul an experience, in his truth, independent 
of his church recently organized upon the earth. The marvelous light given Paul 
upon that occasion astonished and confounded him. He was wholly subdued. This 
part of the work man could not do for Paul; but there work still to be 
accomplished which the servants of Christ could do. Jesus directs him to his 
agents in the church for further knowledge of duty. Thus he give authority and 
sanction to his organized church. Christ had done the work of revelation and 
conviction, and now Paul was in a condition to learn of those whom God has 
ordained to teach the truth Christ directs Paul to his chosen servants, thus 
placing him in connection with his church. " (3T 430)</P>
<P><STRONG>CAN GOD TAKE THE SLAVE TO HEAVEN?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, 
for ye are all one in Christ Jesus" . (Gal 3 :28 KJV).</P>
<P>BIBLE YES "Each of us is apart of the one body of Christ. Some of us are 
Jews, some are Gentiles, some are slaves and some are free. But the Holy Spirit 
has fitted us all together into one body". (1 Cor.12: 13 LB)</P>
<P>BIBLE YES " Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall 
he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free" (Eph .6 : 8 KJ V) .</P>
<P>EGW NO "God cannot take the slave to heaven. He lets him be as though he had 
not been"(GC 193 , l958 ed.; EW 276)</P>
<P><STRONG>WILL KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS HELP US OBTAIN GOD 'S 
FAVOR?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO ".. those who the depend on Jewish laws to save them are under God's 
curse, for Scriptures point out very clearly, "cursed is everyone who at any 
time breaks a single one of these laws that are written in God's Book of the 
Law." Consequently, it is clear that no one can ever win God's favor by trying 
to keep the Jewish laws, because God has said that the only way we can be right 
in his sight is by faith. As the prophet Habakkuk says it , The man who finds 
life will find it through trusting God. How different from this way of faith is 
way of the law which says that a man is saved by obeying every law of God, 
without one slip. But Christ has brought us out from under the doom of that 
impossible system by taking the curse for our wrongdoings upon himself. ". (Gal. 
3: 10 - 13 L B) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO " We aren't saved from sin's grasp by knowing God's commandments, 
because we cant 't keep them, but God put in a different plan to save us . . . " 
(Rom. 8:3 LB).</P>
<P>BIBLE NO "And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from 
which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses" (Acts 13:39 . KJ V )</P>
<P>EGW YES "To obey the commandments of God is the only way to obtain His favor" 
(4T 28)</P>
<P><STRONG>ARE WE RECONCILED TO CHRIST BY OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO " ... we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, 
being reconciled we shall be saved by his life." (Rom. 5:10 KJV)</P>
<P>BIBLE NO "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us unto himself by 
Jesus Christ." (2 Cor. 5: l8 - 2 0 KJ V)</P>
<P>EGW YES "He (man) must be reconciled to God through obedience to His law" . 
(4T 294 - 5)</P>
<P><STRONG>DID JESUS DIE TO BRING US SALVATION?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES " But God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by 
our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us... " (l Thess 5 : 9, 10 KJ V ) .</P>
<P>EGW NO "Christ gave his life that man should have another trial, he did not 
die on the cross to abolish the law of God, but to secure for man a second 
probation" (TM 134). <EM>NOTE </EM>The word "probation" is not found in the 
Bible. It appears frequently in EGW and Joseph Smiths writings.</P>
<P><STRONG>IS THE HEALING OF CHRIST GIVEN FREELY TO ALL WHO ASK?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES, " When the he even was come, they brought unto him many that were 
possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word, and he healed 
all that were sick" (Matt. 8: 16 KJV) .</P>
<P>BIBLE YES "And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed 
them" (Matt. 21:14 KJV).</P>
<P>BIBLE YES " . . .and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all ". 
(Matt.12: 15 KJV) .</P>
<P>BIBLE YES "And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those who 
were lame, blind, dumb; maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' 
feet; and he healed them" (Matt. 15: 30 KJV).</P>
<P>BIBLE YES " And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved 
with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick" (Matt. 14: l 4 KJ V) 
.</P>
<P>EGW NO "PRAYER FOR THE SICK - We should first find out if the sick one has 
been with holding tithes or has made trouble. in the church "</P>
<P>(UT as quoted in HL 237)</P>
<P><STRONG>IS IT EVER PROPER TO STAND DURING PRAYERS?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES, " But the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even 
lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed, but beat upon his chest in sorrow, 
exclaiming, "God be merciful to me, a sinner. " I tell you, this sinner, not the 
Pharisee, returned home forgiven!" (Luke 18:13 LB)</P>
<P>BIBLE YES " And when we stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any 
. . . (Ma r k l l: 2 5 KJ V) .</P>
<P>EGW NO "Where have our brethren obtained the idea that they should stand upon 
their feet praying to God? One who had been educated about five years in Battle 
Creek was asked to lead in prayer before Sister White should speak to the 
people. But as I beheld him standing upright upon his feet while his lips were 
about to open in prayer to God, my soul was stirred within me to give him an 
open rebuke. Calling him by name, I said, "Get down on your knees. This is the 
proper position always. . . Both in public and private worship, it is our duty 
to bow down before God when we offer our petitions to Him. This act shows our 
dependence upon God... "</P>
<P>(Manuscript 84b, August 1,1897).</P>
<P>(Elder D.E.Robinson, one of Ellen White's secretaries from 19O2- 1915. 
reported " I have been present repeatedly at camp meetings and General 
Conference sessions in which Sister White herself has offered prayer with the 
congregation standing, and she and her self standing " (D.E.Robinson letter, 
March 4,1934, as quoted in 3 SM 266) . Emphasis supplied.</P>
<P><STRONG>DOES THE HOLY SPIRIT REVEAL NEW TRUTHS?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES " Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you 
into all truth; for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever shall hear, 
that shall he speak; and he will show you things to come" (John 16 : 12 , 13 KJ 
V) .</P>
<P>BIBLE YES "....I will ask the Father and he will give you another Comforter, 
and he will never leave you. He is the Holy Spirit who leads into all truth..." 
(John 14:17 LB).</P>
<P>BIBLE YES "But I will send you the Comforter - the Holy Spirit, the source of 
all truth.. (John 15: 26 LB).</P>
<P>EGW NO " It is not the office work of the Holy Spirit to reveal the truths" 
(SDA Bible Commentary, Vol .6, p. lO69).</P>
<P><STRONG>WERE SINS BLOTTED OUT AT CALVARY? </STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "For God was in Christ restoring the world to himself, no longer 
counting men's sins against them but blotting them out. This is the wonderful 
message given us to tell others. . . (2Cor . 6: 19 LB).</P>
<P>EGW NO "The work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out of sin is 
to be accomplished before the second advent of our Lord" (GC 4 58) .</P>
<P>EGW NO "At the time appointed for the judgment - the close of the 2300 days 
in 1844 - began the work of investigation and blotting out of sins." (Christ in 
His Sanctuary 122).</P>
<P><STRONG>CAN WE ATTAIN THE SINLESS STATE IN THIS LIFE?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is 
not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our 
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, 
we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. (1 Jo hn 1 : 8 - 10 KJ V .)</P>
<P>BIBLE NO "And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in 
heaven. . .give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins... ," </P>
<P>(Luke 11: 2 ,3 KJV) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO " . . .there is no man which sinneth not ," (2 Chron. 6 : 36 KJ V) 
.</P>

28, 1894).</P>

<P><STRONG>DOES CHRIST' S BLOOD CANCEL SIN?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "That is why Jesus suffered and died outside the city, where his 
blood washed our sins away"</P>

cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts ye shall eat". (Deut. 
14: 2-6 KJV).</P>
<P>EGW YES " . . .Will the people who are seeking to become holy, pure, refined, 
that they may be introduced into the society of heavenly angels, continue to 
take the life of God' s creatures and enjoy their flesh as a luxury? From what 
the Lord has shown me, this order of things will be changed, and God's peculiar 
people will exercise temperance in all things." (CDF 381)</P>
<P><STRONG>ARE MINISTERS AND CANVASSERS ALLOWED TO EAT MEAT WITH 
OTHERS?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "After these things the Lord appointed another seventy also , and 
sent them two by two before his face into every city and place whither he 
himself would come. Therefore he (Jesus) said unto them...in the same house 
remain, eating and drinking such things as they give for the Laborer is worthy 
of his hire. Go not from house to house. And whatsoever city you enter, and they 
receive you, eat such things as are set before you" (Luke l0: 1, 2, 7, 8 
KJV).</P>
<P><STRONG>ARE WE FREE TO TASTE AND TOUCH CERTAIN FOODS?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "Since you died, as it were, with Christ and this has set you free 
from following the world's ideas of how to be saved by doing good and obeying 
various rules why do you keep right on following them anyway, still bound by 
such rules as not eating, tasting, or even touching certain foods? Such rules 
are mere human teachings , for food was made to be eaten and used up . These 
rules may seem good, for rules of this kind require strong devotion and are 
humiliating and hard on the body, but they have no effect when it comes to 
conquering a person's evil thoughts and desires. They only make him proud" (Col. 
2: 20 -21 LB).</P>
<P>EGW NO "The Lord would bring his people into a position where they would not 
touch taste the flesh of dead animals" . (COF 411)</P>
<P><STRONG>ARE YOUR PRAYERS ACCEPTED IF YOU SERVE EGGS AND MEAT TO YOUR 
CHILDREN?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter"s brother, saith unto 
him, There is lad here which hath five small barley loaves, and two small fishes 
but what are they among so many? Then He (Jesus) took the five loaves and two 
fishes, and looking up in heaven he blessed them, and brake , and gave them to 
the deciples to set before the multitude. And they did eat and were filled. 
."</P>
<P>(John 6: 9; Luke 9: 12 17 KJ V) .</P>
<P>BIBLE YES "If a son asked bread of you that is a father, will he give him a 
stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? Or if he ask an egg will 
he give him a scorpion? If ye being evil know to give good things unto your 
children, how much more shall our heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them 
that ask him?"</P>
<P>(Luke 11: 11- 13 KJV) .</P>
<P>EGW NO "You place upon your tables butter, eggs and meat , and your children 
partake of them. They are fed with the very things that excite their animal 
passions, and then you come to meeting and ask God to bless and save your 
children. How high do your prayers go?" (CDF 366)</P>
<P><STRONG>WERE DANIEL AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS VEGETARIANS AFTER THREE WEEKS 
WERE PASSED?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "In those days I Daniel was in mourning three full weeks. I ate no 
pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint 
myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled, (Dan. 10: 2 , 3 KJ V) .</P>
<P>EGW YES "They decided that as flesh had not composed their diet in the past, 
it should not come into their diet in the future, and as wine had been 
prohibited to all who should engage in the service of God, they determined that 
they would not partake of it". (Youth Instructor, August 18, 1898, as quoted in 
RH December 23, 1954).</P>
<P><STRONG>DID THE ISRAELITES DIE OF GLUTTONY?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, 
the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the 
people with a very great plague . . . " (Num. 11: 33) .</P>
<P>EGW YES "God granted their desire, giving them flesh, and leaving them to eat 
till their gluttony produced a plague, from which many of them died". (CDF 148 
.)</P>
<P><STRONG>CAN WE LUST AFTER FLESH MEAT?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "When the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath 
promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, 
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. If the place which the Lord hath chosen to 
put his name there be too far from thee, and thou shall kill of thy herd and of 
thy flock, which the Lord hath given thee as I have commanded thee, and thou 
shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after " (Deut. 12: 20 KJV) 
.</P>
<P>EGW. NO "those who indulge in meat eating, tea drinking and gluttony are 
seeds for a harvest of pain and death . . .A diet off flesh meat tends to 
develop animalism. A development of animalism lessens spirituality rendering the 
mind incapable of understanding the truth . The word of God plainly warns us 
that unless we abstain from fleshly lusts the physical nature will be brought 
into conflict with the spiritual nature. Lustful eating wars against health and 
peace ." (C D F 382) .</P>
<P><STRONG>DID GOD COMMAND EATING OF MEAT?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "These are the statutes and judgments, which he shall observe to do 
in the land, which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it , all 
the days that ye live upon the earth. . .and thither ye shall bring your burnt 
offerings, and your sacrifices , and your tithes, and heave offerings, and of 
your hand, and your vows and your freewill offerings, and the first lings of 
your herds and of your flocks, and there ye shall eat before your God. . ."</P>
<P>BIBLE YES " . . . thou shall kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the 
Lord hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shall eat in thy gates 
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after" (Deut. 12: 21 KJ V) .</P>
<P>BIBLE YES "And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God ....the firstlings of 
thy herds and of thy flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God 
always" . (Deut. 14: 23 KJV).</P>
<P>EGW NO " I present the word of the Lord God of Israel. Because of 
transgression, the curse of God has come upon the earth itself, and upon the 
cattle, and upon all flesh. Human beings are suffering the result of their own 
course of action in departing from the commandments of God. The Lord will bring 
His people into a position where they will not touch the flesh of dead animals. 
There is no safety in the eating of the flesh of dead animals, and in a short 
time the milk of cows will also be excluded from the diet of God's commandment 
keeping people... the Lord will not be trifled with" (CDF 411)</P>
<P><STRONG>CAN WE BUY MEAT SOLD IN THE MARKET?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "You may eat anything sold in the meat market without raising 
questions of conscience"(1 Cor.. 10: 2 5 , 2 6 N E B) .</P>
<P>EGW NO " . . . Disease is contracted by the use of meat. The diseased flesh 
of these dead carcasses is sold in the marketplace and disease among men is the 
sure result. The Lord will bring His people to a position where they will not 
touch or taste the flesh of dead animals. (CDF 411) .</P>
<P><STRONG>DOES FOOD DEFILE US?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO " And he (Jesus) called the multitude and said unto them, Hear ye 
and understand not that which goes into the mouth defileith a man; but that 
which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man, (Matt . 15 :10-11 KJV) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO "And Jesus said are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not 
understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and 
is cast out into the draught? But those things which proceed out of the mouth 
come from the heart; and defileth the man. For out of the heart proceed evil 
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses, 
blasphemies These are the things which defile a man... "(Matt . 15 : 17 - 29 KJ 
V ) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO "And When he (Jesus) had called all the people unto him he said unto 
them, harken unto me every one of you, and understand There is nothing from 
without a man, that entereth into him can defile him but the things which come 
out him, those are they that defile the man" (Mark. 7: 14,15 KJV)</P>
<P>EGW YES "Man is very dear to God, because he was formed in his own image. 
This fact should impress us with the importance of teaching by precept and 
example the sin of defiling, by the indulgence of appetite, the body which is 
designed to represent God to the world" (HL 10).</P>
<P><STRONG>IF AN ANGEL PRESENTS ANOTHER GOSPEL CAN WE ACCEPT IT ?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into 
the grace of Christ unto another gospel . . . But though we or an angel from 
heaven preach any other gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto 
you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again , If any man 
preach any other gospel unto you, let him be accursed" (Gal. 1:6- 9 KJV).</P>
<P>EGW YES " The gospel of health is to be firmly linked with the ministry of 
the word. It is the Lord"s design that the restoring influence of health reform 
shall be of the last great effort to proclaim the gospel message. (CDF 750.</P>
<P>EGW YES "The gospel of health has able advocates, but their work has been 
made very hard because so many ministers, presidents of conferences, and others 
in positions of influence, have failed to give the question of health reform its 
proper attention". (6T 327) .</P>
<P><STRONG>DOES MEAT MAKE ONE LESS SPIRITUAL?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "And this shall be the priests due from the people, from them that 
offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give unto the priest 
the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. The first fruit also of thy corn 
of thy wine, and of thine oil and the first fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give 
unto him. For the Lord thy God hath him chosen him out of all thy tribes, to 
stand to minister in the name of the Lord, and his sons forever." (Deut. l8: l- 
5 KJ V)</P>
<P>EGW YES "A meat diet changes the disposition and strengthens animalism. When 
the animal part of the human agent is strengthened by meat eating, the 
intellectual power is diminished proportionately. A religious life can be more 
successfully maintained if meat is discarded, for this diet stimulates into 
intense activity lustful propensities and enfeebles the moral and spiritual 
nature". (CDF 389) .</P>
<P>EGW YES " By the use of flesh meats the animal nature is strengthened and the 
spiritual nature is weakened. . (C D F 383) .</P>
<P>EGW YES "The more largely flesh composes the diet of teachers and pupils, the 
less susceptible will be the mind to comprehend spiritual things". (CDF 395)</P>
<P><STRONG>CAN MEAT EATERS ENJOY THE COMPANY OF HEAVENLY ANGELS</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES " So he (Jesus) asked them, "Have ye anything to eat?" They offered 
him a piece of fish they had cooked, which he took and ate before their 
eyes....Then he led them out as far as Bethany and blessed them with uplifted 
hands; and in the act of blessing he parted from them, (Luke 24 : . 42 , 50 - 52 
NEB) .</P>
<P>EGW NO "How can those who are seeking to become pure and holy that they may 
have the companionship of heavenly angels...take the life of God's creatures 
that they may consume flesh? (CDF 380)</P>
<P><STRONG>DO WE TRANSGRESS GOD'S LAW WHEN WE EAT FRIED FOODS?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering it is most holy. 
Every male among the priest shall eat thereof ... all the meat offering that is 
baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying pan, and in the pan 
shall be the priest's that offered it ". (Lev. 7 :1, 6-9 KJV)</P>
<P>EGW YES "Your appetites are morbid, and because you do not relish a plain 
simple diet, composed of unbolted flour, vegetables and fruits prepared without 
spices or grease, you are continually transgressing the laws which God has 
established in your system (CDF 124)</P>
<P>EGW YES "You should keep grease out of your food. It defiles any preparation 
of food you may ma ke. (CDF 354)</P>
<P>EGW YES "Grains and fruits free from grease, and in as natural a condition as 
possible, should be the food for the tables of all who are preparing for 
translation to heaven... ," (CDF 64) .</P>
<P>EGW YES " Many healthful dishes can be prepared which are free from grease 
and from the flesh of dead animals.". (CDF 407)</P>
<P>EGW YES "Nothing should be taken to campmeeting except the most healthful 
articles, cooked in a simple manner, free of all spices and grease". (CDF 85) 
.</P>
<P><STRONG>IS CHEESE GOOD FOOD?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE YES "Then Abraham ran back to the tent and said to Sarah, "Quick! Mix 
up some pancakes! Use your best flour, and make enough for the three of them, 
(Angels) Then he ran out to the herd and selected a fat calf and told a servant 
to hurry and butcher it. Soon, taking them (angels) cheese and milk and the 
roast veal, he set it before the men and stood beneath the trees beside them as 
they ate" (Gen.18: 6-8 LB).</P>
<P>EGW NO "Cheese is still more objectionable it is wholly unfit for food . . 
.Cheese should never be introduced into the stomach" (CDF 368) .</P>
<P>EGW NO "The effect of cheese is deleterious. (CDF 236) .</P>
<P><STRONG>ARE HOT AND COLD DRINKS DEBILITATING?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "So then because thou are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will 
spue thee out of my mouth , (Rev. 3: l6 KJV)</P>
<P>BIBLE NO " As cold waters to a thirsty soul , so is good news from far 
country" (Prov . 25: 25 KJV) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO " And whomsoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a 
cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he 
shall in no wise lose his reward". (Matt 10: 42 KJ V) .</P>
<P>BIBLE NO " Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of 
the field? Or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be 
foresaken?(Jer. l8: l4 KJV).</P>
<P>EGW YES "Food should not be eaten very hot or very cold, if food is cold, the 
vital force of the stomach is drawn upon in order to warm it before digestion 
can take place. Cold drinks are injurious for the same reason while the free use 
of hot drinks is debilitating. (CDF lO6).</P>
<P><STRONG>DOES EATING BUTTER WEAKEN SPIRITUALLY?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO " Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call 
his name Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the 
evil and choose the good". (Isa. 7 : 14, 15 KJV).</P>
<P>EGW. YES "Butter and meat stimulate. They have injured the stomach and 
perverteded the taste. The sensitive nerves of the brain have been benumed, and 
the animal appetite strengthened at the expense of morals and intellectual 
faculties. These higher powers, which should control, have been growing weaker, 
so that eternal things have not been discerned. (CDF 48) .</P>
<P><STRONG>DOES GOD COMMAND US TO ABSTAIN FROM MEATS IN THE LATTER 
DAYS?</STRONG></P>
<P>BIBLE NO "Now the spirit speaketh expressly in the latter times, some shall 
depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 
forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created 
to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For 
every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it is sanctified by 
the word of God and prayer" (1Tim. 4: 1-4 KJV).</P>
<P>EGW YES "Among those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord, meat eating 
will eventually be done away; flesh will cease to form a part of their diet. 
(CDF 380) .</P>
<P>EGW YES "It is for their own good that the Lord counsels the remnant church 
to discard the use of flesh meats." (CDF 381) .</P>
<P><STRONG>SHOULD WE ACCEPT DOCTRINE WHICH CONTRADICTS THE BIBLE?</STRONG></P>

this word, it is because there is not light in them" (Isa. 8 : 2 0 KJV )
