      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>We are told that he made a great feast to a 
      thousand of his lords and drank wine before them. In those days a feast in 
      Eastern countries would sometimes last for six months. How long this feast 
      had been going on we are not told, but in the midst of it, he</FONT>

        which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and 
        his concubines, might drink therein. Then they brought the golden 
        vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was 
        at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his 
        concubines, drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of

      guests were more or less under the influence of drink; but they were not 
      so drunk but that they suddenly became sober as they saw something that 
      was supernatural- a handwriting on the wall, right over the golden

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>In haste he sent for his wisest men to come 
      and read that handwriting on the wall. They came in one after another and 
      tried to make it out; but they could not interpret it. The king promised 
      that whoever could read it should be made the third ruler in the kingdom; 
      that he should have gifts, and that a gold chain should be put around his 
      neck. But the wise men tried in vain. The king was greatly 
      troubled.<BR><BR>At last, in the midst of the consternation, the queen 
      came in, and she told the monarch, if he would only send for one who used 
      to interpret the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar, he could read the writing and 
      tell him the interpretation thereof. So Daniel was sent for. He was very 
      familiar with it. He knew his Father's handwriting.</FONT>

      </DD></DL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Darius and his army came marching down those 
      streets. There was a clash of arms. Shouts of war and victory rent the 
      air. That night the king's blood mingled with the wine of the banquet 
      hall. Judgment came upon him unexpectedly, suddenly: and probably 
      ninety-nine out of every hundred judgments come in this way. Death comes 
      upon us unexpectedly; it comes upon us suddenly.<BR><BR>Perhaps you say: 
      "I hope Mr. Moody is not going to compare me with that heathen 
      king."<BR><BR>I tell you that a man who does evil in these gospel days is 
      far worse than that king. We live in a land of Bibles. You can get the New 
      Testament for a nickel, and if you haven't got a nickel, you can get it 
      for nothing. Many societies will be glad to give it to you free. We live 
      in the full blaze of Calvary. We live on this side of the cross, but 
      Belshazzar lived more than five hundred years on the other side. He never 
      heard of Jesus Christ. He never heard about the Son of God. He never heard 
      about God except, perhaps, in connection with his father's remarkable 
      vision. He probably had no portion of the Bible, and if he had, probably 
      he didn't believe it. He had no godly minister to point Him to the Lamb of 
      God.<BR><BR>Don't tell me that you are better than that king. I believe 
      that he will rise in judgment and condemn many of us.<BR><BR>All this 
      happened long centuries ago. Let us get down to this century, to this 
      year, to ourselves. We will come to the present time. Let us imagine that 
      now, while I am preaching, down come some balances from the throne of God. 
      They are fastened to the very throne itself. It is a throne of equity, of 
      justice. You and I must be weighed. I venture to say this would be a very 
      solemn audience. There would be no tiring. There would be no indifference. 
      No one would be thoughtless.<BR><BR>Some people have their own balances. A 
      great many are making balances to be weighed in. But after all we must be 
      weighed in God's balances, the balances of the sanctuary. It is a favorite 
      thing with infidels to set their own standard, to measure themselves by 
      other people. But that will not do in the Day of Judgment. Now we will use 
      God's law as a balance weight. When men find fault with the lives of 
      professing Christians, it is a tribute to the law of God.<BR><BR>"Tekel." 
      It is a very short text. It is so short I am sure you will remember it: 
      and that is my object, just to get people to remember God's own 
      Word.</FONT></P>

      size=2><BR><B>GOD'S HANDWRITING</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Let me call your attention to the fact that 
      God wrote on the tables of stone at Sinai as well as on the wall of 
      Belshazzar's palace.<BR><BR>These are the only messages to men that God 
      has written with His own hand. He wrote the commandments out twice, and 
      spoke them aloud in the hearing of Israel.<BR><BR>If it were known that 
      God Himself were going to speak once again to man, what eagerness and 
      excitement there would be! For nearly nineteen hundred years He has been 
      silent. No inspired message has been added to the Bible for nearly 
      nineteen hundred years. How eagerly all men would listen if God should 
      speak once more. Yet men forget that the Bible is God's own Word, and that 
      it is as truly His message today as when it was delivered of old. The law 
      that was given at Sinai has lost none of its solemnity. Time cannot wear 
      out its authority or the fact of its authorship.<BR><BR>I can imagine 
      someone saying, "I won't be weighed by that law. I don't believe in 
      it."<BR><BR>Now men may cavil as much as they like about other parts of 
      the Bible, but I have never met an honest man that found fault with the 
      Ten Commandments. Infidels may mock the Lawgiver and reject Him who has 
      delivered us from the curse of the law, but they can't help admitting that 
      the commandments are right. Renan said that they are for all nations, and 
      will remain the commandments of God during all the centuries.<BR><BR>If 
      God created this world, He must make some laws to govern it. In order to 
      make life safe we must have good laws; there is not a country the sun 
      shines upon that does not possess laws. Now this is God's law. It has come 
      from on high, and infidels and skeptics have to admit that it is pure. 
      Legislatures nearly all over the world adopt it as the foundation of their 
      legal systems.</FONT>

      keeping these commandments? Have we fulfilled all the requirements of the

      and if we don't use it aright it would have been better for us if we had 
      never had it, for it will condemn us. We shall be found wanting. The law 
      is all right, but are we right?</FONT></P>

      size=2><BR><B>AN INFIDEL'S TESTIMONY</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>It is related of a clever infidel that he 
      sought an acquaintance with the truths of the Bible, and began to read at 
      the books of Moses. He had been in the habit of sneering at the Bible, and 
      in order to be able to refute arguments brought by Christian men, he made 
      up his mind, as he knew nothing about it, to read the Bible and get some 
      idea of its contents. After he had reached the Ten Commandments, he said 
      to a friend:</FONT> 
      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"I will tell you what I used to think. I 
        supposed that Moses was the leader of a horde of bandits; that, having a 
        strong mind, he acquired great influence over a superstitious people; 
        and that on Mount Sinai he played off some sort of fireworks to the 
        amazement of his ignorant followers, who imagined in their fear and 
        superstition that the exhibition was supernatural. I have been looking 
        into the nature of that law. I have been trying to see whether I could 
        add anything to it, or take anything from it, so as to make it better. 
        Sir, I cannot! It is perfect!<BR><BR>"The first commandment directs us 
        to make the Creator the object of our supreme love and reverence. That 
        is right. If He be our Creator, Preserver, and Supreme Benefactor, we 
        ought to treat Him, and none other, as such. The second forbids 
        idolatry. That certainly is right. The third forbids profanity. The 
        fourth fixes a time for religious worship. If there be a God, He ought 
        surely to be worshiped. It is suitable that there should be an outward 
        homage significant of our inward regard. If God be worshiped, it is 
        proper that some time should be set apart for that purpose, when all may 
        worship Him harmoniously, and without interruption. One day in seven is 
        certainly not too much, and I do not know that it is too little. 
        <BR><BR>"The fifth commandment defines the peculiar duties arising from 
        family relations. Injuries to our neighbor are then classified by the 
        moral law. They are divided into offenses against life, chastity, 
        property, and character; and I notice that the greatest offense in each 
        class is expressly forbidden. Thus the greatest injury to life is 
        murder; to chastity, adultery; to property, theft; to character, 
        perjury. Now the greatest offense must include the least of the same 
        kind. Murder must include the least of the same kind. Murder must 
        include every injury to life; adultery every injury to purity, and so of 
        the rest. And the moral code is closed and perfected by a command 
        forbidding every improper desire in regard to our neighbors.<BR><BR>"I 
        have been thinking. Where did Moses get that law? I have read history. 
        The Egyptians and the adjacent nations were idolaters; so were the 
        Greeks and Romans; and the wisest or best Greeks or Romans never gave a 
        code of morals like this. Where did Moses obtain that law, which 
        surpasses the wisdom and philosophy of the most enlightened ages? He 
        lived at a period comparatively barbarous; but he has given a law in 
        which the learning and sagacity of all subsequent time can detect no 
        flaw. Where did he obtain it? He could not have soared so far above his 
        age as to have devised it himself. I am satisfied where he obtained it. 
        It came down from heaven. It has convinced me of the truth of the 
        religion of the Bible."</FONT> </DD></DL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The former infidel remained to his death a 
      firm believer in the truth of Christianity.<BR><BR>We call it the "Mosaic" 
      law, but it has been well said that the commandments did not originate 
      with Moses, nor were they done away with when the Mosaic law was fulfilled 
      in Christ, and many of its ceremonies and regulations abolished. We can 
      find no trace of the existence of any lawmaking body in those early times, 
      no parliament, or congress that built up a system of laws. It has come 
      down to us complete and finished, and the only satisfactory account is 
      that which tells us that God Himself wrote the commandments on tables of 
      stone.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Some people seem to think we have got beyond 
      the commandments. What did Christ say?</FONT> 
      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"Think not that I am come to destroy the 
        Law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For 
        verily I say unto you, Till Heaven and Earth pass, one jot or one tittle 
        shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled." </FONT><FONT 
        color=#000000 size=1>(Matthew 5:17-18)</FONT> </DD></DL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The commandments of God given to Moses in 
      the Mount at Horeb are as binding today as ever they have been since the 
      time they were proclaimed in the hearing of the people. The Jews said the 
      law was not given in Palestine (which belonged to Israel), but in the 
      wilderness, because the law was for all nations.<BR><BR>Jesus never 
      condemned the law and the prophets, but He did condemn those who did not 
      obey them. Because He gave new commandments, it does not follow that He 
      abolished the old. Christ's explanation of them made them all the more 
      searching. In His Sermon on the Mount, He carried the principles of the 
      commandments beyond the mere letter. He unfolded them and showed that they 
      embraced more, that they are positive as well as prohibitive. The Old 
      Testament closes with these words:</FONT> 
      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"Remember ye the Law of Moses My servant, 
        which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the Statutes 
        and Judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the 
        coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the 
        heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to 
        their fathers, lest I come and smite the Earth with a 
        curse."</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=1> (Malachi 4:4-6)</FONT> 
</DD></DL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Does that look as if the law of Moses was 
      becoming obsolete? <BR><BR>The conviction deepens in me with the years 
      that the old truths of the Bible must be stated and restated in the 
      plainest possible language. I do not remember ever to have heard a sermon 
      preached on the commandments. I have an index of two thousand five hundred 
      sermons preached by Spurgeon, and not one of them selects its text from 
      the first seventeen verses of Exodus 20. The people must be made to 
      understand that the Ten Commandments are still binding, and that there is 
      a penalty attached to their violation. We do not want a gospel of mere 
      sentiment. The Sermon on the Mount did not blot out the Ten 
      Commandments.<BR><BR>When Christ came He condensed the statement of the 
      law into this form:</FONT> 
      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"Thou shalt love the LORD thy God with 
        all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with 
        all thy strength... [and] thy neighbour as thyself." </FONT><FONT 
        color=#000000 size=1>(Mark 12:30,31)</FONT> </DD></DL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Paul said:</FONT> 
      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"Love is the fulfilling of the 
        Law."</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=1> (Romans 13:10)</FONT> </DD></DL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>But does this mean that the detailed 
      precepts of the Decalogue are superseded and have become back numbers? 
      Does a father cease to give children rules to obey because they love him? 
      Does a nation burn its statute books because the people have become 
      patriotic? Not at all. And yet people speak as if the commandments do not 
      hold for Christians because they have come to love God. Paul said:</FONT> 
      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"Do we then make void the Law through

      primitive races of mankind reach out beyond the world of matter to a 
      superior Being. It is as natural for man to feel after God as it is for 
      the ivy to feel after a support. Hunger and thirst drive man to seek for 
      food, and there is a hunger of the soul that needs satisfying, too. Man 
      does not need to be commanded to worship, as there is not a race so high 
      or so low in the scale of civilization but has some kind of god. What he 
      needs is to be directed aright.<BR><BR>This is what the first commandment 
      is for. Before we can worship intelligently, we must know what or whom to 
      worship. God does not leave us in ignorance. When Paul went to Athens, he 
      found an altar dedicated to "The Unknown God," and he proceeded to tell of 
      Him whom we worship. When God gave the commandments to Moses, He commenced 
      with a declaration of His own character, and demanded exclusive 
      recognition.</FONT>

        thunder, and lightning, and hail, plagues on cattle, and plagues on men, 
        to punish the Egyptians and to compel them to let the children of Israel 
        go; they knew Him as the God whose angel had slain the firstborn of 
        their oppressors, and filled the land from end to end with death, and 
        agony, and terror. He was the same God, so Moses and Aaron told them, 
        who by visions and voices, in promises and precepts, had revealed 
        Himself long before to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We learn what men are 
        from what they say and from what they do. A biography of Luther gives us 
        a more vivid and trustworthy knowledge of the man than the most 
        philosophical essay on his character and creed. The story of his 
        imprisonment and of his journey to Worms, his Letters, his Sermons, and 
        his Table Talk, are worth more than the most elaborate speculations 
        about him. The Jews learned what God is, not from theological 
        dissertations on the Divine attributes, but from the facts of a Divine

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Remember to whom this commandment was given, 
      and we shall see further how necessary it was. The forefathers of the 
      Israelites had worshiped idols, not many generations back. They had 
      recently been delivered out of Egypt, a land of many gods. The Egyptians 
      worshiped the sun, the moon, insects, animals, etc. The ten plagues were 
      undoubtedly meant by God to bring confusion upon many of their sacred 
      objects. The children of Israel were going up to take possession of a land 
      that was inhabited by heathen, who also worshiped idols. There was 
      therefore great need of such a commandment as this. There could be no 
      right relationship between God and man in those days any more than today, 
      until man understood that he must recognize God alone, and not offer Him a 
      divided heart.<BR><BR>If He created us, He certainly ought to have our

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>This is one matter in which no toleration 
      can be shown. Religious liberty is a good thing, within certain limits. 
      But it is one thing to show toleration to those who agree on essentials, 
      and another, to those who differ on fundamental beliefs. They were willing 
      to admit any god to the Roman Pantheon. One reason the early Christians 
      were persecuted was that they would not accept a place for Jesus Christ 
      there. Napoleon is said to have entertained the idea of having separate 
      temples in Paris for every known religion, so that every stranger should 
      have a place of worship when attracted toward that city. Such plans are 
      directly opposed to the Divine One. God sounded no uncertain note in this 
      commandment. It is plain, unmistakable, uncompromising.<BR><BR>We may 
      learn a lesson from the way a farmer deals with the little shoots that 
      spring up around the trunk of an apple tree. They look promising, and one 
      who has not learned better might welcome their growth. But the farmer 
      knows that they will draw the life-sap from the main tree, injuring its 
      prospects so that it will produce inferior fruit. He therefore takes his 
      axe and his hoe, and cuts away these suckers. The tree then gives a more 
      plentiful and finer crop.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"Thou shalt not" is the pruning-knife that 
      God uses. From beginning to end, the Bible calls for wholehearted 
      allegiance to Him. There is to be no compromise with other gods.<BR><BR>It 
      took long years for God to impress this lesson upon the Israelites. He 
      called them to be a chosen nation. He made them a peculiar people. But you 
      will notice in Bible history that they turned away from Him continually, 
      and were punished with plague, pestilence, war, and famine. Their sin was 
      not that they renounced God altogether, but that they wanted to worship 
      other gods beside Him. Take the case of Solomon as an example of the whole 
      nation. He married heathen wives who turned away his heart after other 
      gods, and built high places for their idols, and lent countenance to their 
      worship. That was the history of frequent turnings of the whole nation 
      away from God, until finally He sent them into captivity in Babylon and 
      kept them there for seventy years. Since then the Jews have never turned 
      to other gods.<BR><BR>Hasn't the church to contend with the same 
      difficulty today? There are very few who in their hearts do not believe in 
      God, but what they will not do is give Him exclusive right of way. 
      Missionaries tell us that they could easily get converts if they did not 
      require them to be baptized, thus publicly renouncing their idols. Many a 
      person in our land would become a Christian if the gate was not so strait. 
      Christianity is too strict for them. They are not ready to promise full 
      allegiance to God alone. Many a professing Christian is a stumbling block 
      because his worship is divided. On Sunday he worships God; on weekdays God 
      has little or no place in his thoughts.</FONT></P>

      read his speech, do so. It is one of the best sermons in print. I know few 
      sermons in the Old or New Testament that compare with it.<BR><BR>I can see 
      Moses as he delivers this address. His natural activity has not abated. He 
      still has the vigor of youth. His long white hair flows over his

      pantheist, when I went to the funeral and in the presence of his friends, 
      said one word about that man's doctrine, they would feel insulted. Why is 
      it that in a trying hour, when they have been talking all the time against 
      God- why is it that in the darkness of affliction they call in believers 
      in that God to administer consolation? Why doesn't the atheist preach no

      an admission that "their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies

      have us worship anything, however sacred- the Bible, the crucifix, the 
      church- if only we do not worship God Himself.<BR><BR>You cannot find a 
      place in the Bible where a man has been allowed to bow down and worship 
      anyone but the God of heaven and Jesus Christ His Son. In the book of 
      Revelation when an angel came down to John, he was about to fall down and 
      worship him, but the angel would not let him. If an angel from heaven is 
      not to be worshiped, when you find people bowing down to pictures, to 
      images, even when they bow down to worship the cross, it is a sin. There 
      are a great many who seem to be carried away with these things.</FONT>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>This is precisely what is difficult for men 
      to do. The apostles were hardly in their graves before people began to put 
      up images of them, and to worship relics. People have a desire for 
      something tangible, something that they can see. That is why there is a 
      demand for ritualism. Some people are born Puritans; they want a simple 
      form of worship. Others think they cannot get along without forms and 
      ceremonies that appeal to the senses. And many a one whose heart is not 
      sincere before God takes refuge in these forms, and eases his conscience 
      by making an outward show of religion.<BR><BR>The second commandment is to 
      restrain this desire and tendency.<BR><BR>God is grieved when we are 
      untrue to Him. God is love, and He is wounded when our affections are 
      transferred to anything else. The penalty attached to this commandment 
      teaches us that man has to reap what he sows, whether good or bad; and not 
      only that, but his children have to reap with him. Notice that punishment 
      is visited upon the children unto the third or the fourth generation, 
      while mercy is shown unto thousands, or (as it is more correctly) unto the 
      thousandth generation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Think for a moment, and you will see how 
      idle it is to try to make any representation of God. Christians have tried 
      to paint the Trinity, but how can you depict the invisible? Can you draw a 
      picture of your own soul or spirit or will? Moses impressed it upon Israel 
      that when God spake to them out of the midst of the fire they saw no 
      manner of similitude, but only heard His voice.<BR><BR>A [manmade] picture 
      or [manmade] image of God must degrade our conception of Him. It fastens 
      us down to one idea, whereas we ought to grow in grace and in knowledge. 
      It makes God finite. It brings Him down to our level. It has given rise to 
      the horrible idols of India and China, because they fashion these images 
      according to their own notions. How would the president feel if Americans 
      made such hideous objects to resemble him as they make of their gods in 
      heathen countries? Isaiah bore down with tremendous irony upon the folly 
      of idol-makers: upon the smith who fashioned gods with tongs and hammers; 
      and upon the carpenter who took a tree, and used part of it for a fire to 
      warm himself and roast his meat, and made part of it in the figure of a 
      man with his rule and plane and compass, and called it his god and 
      worshiped it.</FONT>

      appeals to the senses is the origin of all idolatry. It leads directly to 
      image-worship. At first there may be no desire to worship the thing 
      itself, but it inevitably ends in that. As Dr. Mac Laren says:</FONT>

      who crucified Him. Not a solitary thing was left to be handed down among 
      His followers. Doesn't it look as if Christ left no relics lest they 
      should be held sacred and worshiped?<BR><BR>History tells us further that 
      the early Christians shrank from making pictures and statues of any kind 
      of Christ. They knew Him as they had seen Him after His resurrection, and 
      had promises of His continued presence that pictures could not make any 
      more real.<BR><BR>I have seen very few pictures of Christ that do not

        from the dead. He is at the right hand of God. If we pray to a dying 
        Christ, we are praying not to Christ Himself, but to a mere remembrance 
        of Him. The injury which the crucifix has inflicted on the religious 
        life of Christendom, in encouraging a morbid and unreal devotion, is

      how much more them of his household.<BR><BR>I asked where this man lived,

      said:<BR><BR>"It takes God to curse a man; man can only bring curses on 
      his own head."<BR><BR>I found out where he lived and went to see him. He 
      was the wealthiest man within a hundred miles of that place, and had a 
      wife and seven beautiful children. Just as I got to his gate I saw him 
      coming out of the front door. I stepped up to him and said:<BR><BR>"This 
      is Mr. ~, I believe?"<BR><BR>He said, "Yes, sir; that is my name." Then he

      what is it?"<BR><BR>"I am told that God has blessed you above all men in 
      this part of the country; that He has given you wealth, a beautiful 
      Christian wife, and seven lovely children. I do not know if it is true, 
      but I hear that all He gets in return is cursing and blasphemy"<BR><BR>He 
      said, "Come in; come in." I went in.<BR><BR>"Now," he said, "what you said 
      out there is true. If any man has a fine wife I am the man, and I have a 
      lovely family of children, and God has been good to me. But do you know, 
      we had company here the other night, and I cursed my wife at the table and 
      did not know it till after the company had gone. I never felt so mean and 
      contemptible in my life as when my wife told me of it. She said she wanted 
      the floor to open and let her down out of her seat. If I have tried once, 
      I have tried a hundred times to stop swearing. You preachers don't know 
      anything about it."<BR><BR>"Yes," I said,"I know all about it; I have been 
      a drummer."<BR><BR>"But," he said, "you don't know anything about a 
      businessman's troubles. When he is harassed and tormented the whole time, 
      he can't help swearing."<BR><BR>"Oh, yes," I said, "he can. I know 
      something about it. I used to swear myself."<BR><BR>"What! You used to 
      swear?" he asked. "How did you stop?" <BR><BR>"I never 
      stopped."<BR><BR>"Why, you don't swear now, do you?"<BR><BR>"No; I have 
      not sworn for years."<BR><BR>"How did you stop?"<BR><BR>"I never stopped. 
      It stopped itself."<BR><BR>He said, "I don't understand 
      this."<BR><BR>"No," I said, "I know you don't. But I came up to talk to 
      you, so that you will never want to swear as long as you live."<BR><BR>I 
      began to tell him about Christ in the heart; how that would take the 
      temptation to swear out of a man.<BR><BR>"Well," he said, "how am I to get 
      Christ?"<BR><BR>"Get right down here and tell Him what you 
      want."<BR><BR>"But," he said, "I was never on my knees in my life. I have 
      been cursing all the day, and I don't know how to pray or what to pray 
      for."<BR><BR>"Well," I said, "it is mortifying to have to call on God for 
      mercy when you have never used His name except in oaths; but He will not 
      turn you away. Ask God to forgive you if you want to be 
      forgiven."<BR><BR>Then the man got down and prayed- only a few sentences, 
      but thank God, it is the short prayers, after all, which bring the 
      quickest answers. After he prayed he got up and said: "What shall I do 
      now?"<BR><BR>I said, "Go down to the church and tell the people there that 
      you want to be an out-and-out Christian."<BR><BR>"I cannot do that," he 
      said; "I never go to church except to some funeral."<BR><BR>"Then it is 
      high time for you to go for something else,"I said.<BR><BR>After a while 
      he promised to go, but did not know what the people would say. At the next 
      church prayer meeting, the man was there, and I sat right in front of him. 
      He stood up and put his hands on the settee, and he trembled so much that 
      I could feel the settee shake. <BR><BR>He said:<BR><BR>"My friends, you 
      know all about me. If God can save a wretch like me, I want to have you 
      pray for my salvation."<BR><BR>That was thirty odd years ago. Sometime ago 
      I was back in that town, and did not see him; but when I was in 
      California, a man asked me to take dinner with him. I told him that I 
      could not do so, for I had another engagement. Then he asked if I 
      remembered him, and told me his name. "Oh," I said, "tell me, have you 
      ever sworn since that night you knelt in your drawing-room, and asked God 
      to forgive you?"<BR><BR>"No," he replied, "I have never had a desire to 
      swear since then. It was all taken away."</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>THERE HAS BEEN an awful letting-down in this 
      country regarding the Sabbath during the last twenty-five years, and many 
      a man has been shorn of spiritual power, like Samson, because he is not 
      straight on this question. Can you say that you observe the Sabbath 
      properly? You may be a professed Christian: are you obeying this 
      commandment? Or do you neglect the house of God on the Sabbath day, and 
      spend your time drinking and carousing in places of vice and crime, 
      showing contempt for God and His law? Are you ready to step into the 
      scales? Where were you last Sabbath? How did you spend it?<BR><BR>I 
      honestly believe that this commandment is just as binding today as it ever 
      was. I have talked with men who have said that it has been abrogated, but 
      they have never been able to point to any place in the Bible where God 
      repealed it. When Christ was on earth, He did nothing to set it aside; He 
      freed it from the traces under which the scribes and Pharisees had put it, 
      and gave it its true place.</FONT>

      this law on the tables of stone at Sinai. How can men claim that this one 
      commandment has been done away with when they will admit that the other 
      nine are still binding?<BR><BR>I believe that the Sabbath question today 
      is a vital one for the whole country. It is the burning question of the 
      present time. If you give up the Sabbath the church goes; if you give up 
      the church the home goes; and if the home goes the nation goes. That is 
      the direction in which we are traveling.<BR><BR>The church of God is

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"Sabbath" means "rest," and the meaning of 
      the word gives a hint as to the true way to observe the day. God rested 
      after creation, and ordained the Sabbath as a rest for man. He blessed it 
      and hallowed it. Remember the rest-day to keep it holy. It is the day when 
      the body may be refreshed and strengthened after six days of labor, and 
      the soul drawn into closer fellowship with its Maker.<BR><BR>True 
      observance of the Sabbath may be considered under two general 
      heads:</FONT> 
      <OL>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 size=2>cessation from ordinary secular work, 
        and</FONT>

      CESSATION FROM SECULAR WORK</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>A man ought to turn aside from his ordinary 
      employment one day in seven. There are many whose occupation will not 
      permit them to observe Sunday, but they should observe some other day as a 
      Sabbath. Saturday is my day of rest, because I generally preach on Sunday, 
      and I look forward to it as a boy does to a holiday. God knows what we 
      need.<BR><BR>Ministers and missionaries often tell me that they take no 
      rest-day; they do not need it because they are in the Lord's work. That is 
      a mistake. When God was giving Moses instructions about the building of 
      the tabernacle, He referred especially to the Sabbath, and gave 
      injunctions for its strict observance; and later, when Moses was conveying 
      the words of the Lord to the children of Israel, he interpreted them by 
      saying that not even were sticks to be gathered on the sabbath to kindle 
      fires for smelting or other purposes. Inspite of their zeal and haste to 
      erect the tabernacle, the workmen were to have their day of rest. The 
      command applies to ministers and others managed in Christian work today as 
      much as to those Israelite workmen of old.</FONT>

      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>In judging whether any work may or may 
        not be lawfully done on the Sabbath, find out the reason and object for 
        doing it. Exceptions are to be made for works of necessity and works of 
        emergency. By "works of necessity" I mean those acts that Christ 
        justified when He approved of leading one's ox or ass to water. 
        Watchmen, police, stokers on board steamers, and many others have 
        engagements that necessitate their working on the sabbath. By "works of 
        emergency" I mean those referred to by Christ when He approved of 
        pulling an ox or an ass out of a pit on the sabbath day. In case of fire 
        or sickness a man is often called on to do things that would not 
        otherwise be justifiable.<BR><BR>A Christian man was once urged by his 
        employer to work on Sunday. "Does not your Bible say that if your ass 
        falls into a pit on the Sabbath, you may pull him out?" "Yes," replied 
        the other;"but if the ass had the habit of falling into the same pit 
        every Sabbath, I would either fill up the pit or sell the 
        ass."<BR><BR>Every man must settle the question as it affects 
        unnecessary work, with his own conscience.<BR><BR>No man should make 
        another work seven days in the week. One day is demanded for rest. A man 
        who has to work the seven days has nothing to look forward to, and life 
        becomes humdrum. Many Christians are guilty in this respect.</FONT>

        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Take, for instance, the question of 
        Sabbath traveling. I believe we are breaking God's laws by using the 
        cars on Sunday and depriving conductors and others of their Sabbath. 
        Remember, the fourth commandment expressly refers to the "stranger that 
        is within thy gates." Doesn't that touch Sabbath travel?<BR><BR>But you 
        ask, "What are we to do? How are we to get to church?"<BR><BR>I reply, 
        on foot. It will be better for you. Once when I was holding meetings in 
        London, in my ignorance I made arrangements to preach four times in 
        different places one Sabbath. After I had made the appointments I found 
        I had to walk sixteen miles; but I walked it, and I slept that night 
        with a clear conscience. I have made it a rule never to use the cars, 
        and if I have a private carriage, I insist that horse and man shall rest 
        on Monday. I want no hackman to rise up in judgment against 
        me.<BR><BR>My friends, if we want to help the Sabbath, let business men 
        and Christians never patronize cars on the Sabbath. I would hate to own 
        stock in those companies, to be the means of taking the Sabbath from 
        these men, and have to answer for it at the day of judgment. Let those 
        who are Christians at any rate endeavor to keep a conscience void of 
        offense on this point.</FONT> </DD></DL>

        told that many street car companies would not pay if it were not for the 
        Sabbath traffic, and the Sabbath edition of newspapers is also counted 
        upon as the most profitable.<BR><BR>The railroad men of this country are 
        breaking down with softening of the brain, and die at the age of fifty 
        or sixty. They think their business is so important that they must run 
        their trains seven days in the week. Businessmen travel on the Sabbath 
        so as to be on hand for business Monday morning. But if they do so God 
        will not prosper them.<BR><BR>Work is good for man and is commanded,

        happiness produced by the return of the Sabbath, with its cessation from 
        work, cannot be overestimated. It is needed to repair and restore the 
        body after six days of work. It is proved that a man can do more in six 
        days than in seven. Lord Beaconsfield said: "Of all divine institutions, 
        the most divine is that which secures a day of rest for man. I hold it 
        to be the most valuable blessing conceded to man. It is the cornerstone 
        of all civilization, and its removal might affect even the health of the 
        people."<BR><BR>Mr. Gladstone recently told a friend that the secret of 
        his long life is that amid all the pressure of public cares he never 
        forgot the Sabbath, with its rest for the body and the soul. The 
        constitution of the United States protects the president in his weekly 
        day of rest. He has ten days, "Sundays excepted," in which to consider a 
        bill that has been sent to him for signature. Every workingman in the 
        republic ought to be as thoroughly protected as the president. If 
        workingmen got up a strike against unnecessary work on the Sabbath, they 
        would have the sympathy of a good many.<BR><BR>"Our bodies are seven-day 
        clocks," says Talmage, "and they need to be wound up, and if they are 
        not wound up they run down into the grave. No man can continuously break 
        the Sabbath and keep his physical and mental health. Ask aged men, and 
        they will tell you they never knew men who continuously broke the 
        Sabbath who did not fail in mind, body, or moral principles."<BR><BR>All 
        that has been said about rest for man is true for working animals. God 
        didn't forget them in this commandment, and man should not forget them 
        either.</FONT> </DD></DL>

      RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>But "rest" does not mean idleness. No man 
      enjoys idleness for any length of time. When one goes on a vacation, one 
      does not lie around doing nothing all that time. Hard work at tennis, 
      hunting, and other pursuits fills the hours. A healthy mind must find 
      something to do.<BR><BR>Hence the Sabbath rest does not mean inactivity. 
      "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do." The best way to 
      keep off bad thoughts and to avoid temptation is to engage in active 
      religious exercises.<BR><BR>As regards these, we should avoid extremes. On 
      the one hand we find a rigor in Sabbath observance that is nowhere 
      commanded in Scripture, and that reminds one of the formalism of the 
      Pharisees more than of the spirit of the Gospel. Such strictness does more 
      harm than good. It repels people and makes the Sabbath a burden. On the 
      other hand, we should jealously guard against a loose way of keeping the 
      Sabbath. Already in many cities it is profaned openly.<BR><BR>When I was a 
      boy, the Sabbath lasted from sundown on Saturday to sundown on Sunday, and 
      I remember how we boys used to shout when it was over. It was the worst 
      day in the week to us. I believe it can be made the brightest day in the 
      week. Every child ought to be reared so that he shall be able to say that 
      he would rather have the other six days weeded out of his memory than the 
      Sabbath of his childhood.</FONT>

        "There is a discrepancy," says John McNeill, "between our creed about 
        the Sabbath day and our actual conduct. In many families, at ten o'clock 
        on the Sabbath, attendance at church is still an open question. There is 
        no open question on Monday morning- 'John, will you go to work 
        today.'"<BR><BR>A minister rebuked a farmer for not attending church, 
        and said, "You know, John, you are never absent from 
        market."<BR><BR>"Oh," was the reply, "we must go to 
        market."<BR><BR>Someone has said that without the Sabbath, the Church of 
        Christ could not, as a visible organization, exist on earth. Another has 
        said that "we need to be in the drill of observance as well as in the 
        liberty of faith." Human nature is so treacherous that we are apt to 
        omit things altogether unless there is some special reason for doing 
        them. A man is not likely to worship at all unless he has regularly 
        appointed times and means for worship. Family and private devotions are 
        almost certain to be omitted altogether unless one gets into the habit 
        and has a special time set apart daily.</FONT> </DD></DL>

        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I remember blaming my mother for sending 
        me to church on the Sabbath. On one occasion the preacher had to send 
        someone into the gallery to wake me up. I thought it was hard to have to 
        work in the field all the week and then to be obliged to go to church 
        and hear a sermon I didn't understand. I thought I wouldn't go to church 
        anymore when I got away from home; but I had got so in the habit of 
        going that I couldn't stay away. After one or two Sabbaths, back again 
        to the house of God I went. There I first found Christ, and I have often 
        said since, "Mother, I thank you for making me go to the house of God 
        when I didn't want to go."<BR><BR>Parents, if you want your children to 
        grow up and honor you, have them honor the Sabbath day. Don't let them 
        go off fishing and getting into bad company, or it won't be long before 
        they will come home and curse you. I know few things more beautiful than 
        to see a father and mother coming up the aisle with their daughters and 
        sons, and sitting down together to hear the Word of God. It is a good 
        thing to have the children, not in some remote loft or gallery, but in a 
        good place, well in sight. Though they cannot understand the sermon now, 
        when they get older they won't desire to break away, they will continue 
        attending public worship in the house of God.<BR><BR>But we must not 
        mistake the means for the end. We must not think that the Sabbath is 
        just for the sake of being able to attend meetings. There are some 
        people who think they must spend the whole day at meetings or private 
        devotions. The result is that at nightfall they are tired out, and the 
        day has brought them no rest. The number of church services attended 
        ought to be measured by the person's ability to enjoy them and get good 
        from them, without being wearied. Attending meetings is not the only way 
        to observe the Sabbath. The Israelites were commanded to keep it in 
        their dwellings as well as in holy convocation. The home, that center of 
        so great influence over the life and character of the people, ought to 
        be made the scene of true Sabbath observance.</FONT> </DD></DL>

        or another to know what to do to entertain their children on the 
        Sabbath. The boys say, "I do wish 'twas night," or, "I do hate the 
        Sabbath," or, "I do wish the Sabbath were over." It ought to be the 
        happiest day in the week to them, one to be looked forward to with 
        pleasure. In order to this end, many suggestions might be followed. Make 
        family prayers especially attractive by having the children learn some 
        verse or story from the Bible. Give more time to your children than you 
        can give on weekdays, reading to them and perhaps taking them to walk in 
        the afternoon or evening. Show by your conduct that the Sabbath is a 
        delight, and they will soon catch your spirit. Set aside some time for 
        religious instruction, without making this a task. You can make it 
        interesting for the children by telling Bible stories and asking them to 
        guess the names of the characters. Have Sunday games for the younger 
        children. Picture books, puzzle maps of Palestine, and such things can 
        be easily obtained. Sunday albums and Sunday clocks are other devices. 
        Set aside attractive books for the Sabbath, not letting the children 
        have these during the week. By doing this, the children can be brought 
        to look forward to the day with eagerness and pleasure.</FONT> </DD></DL>

        pass away, and begrudging one day to the soul, which will live on and on

        Sunday editions of sixty pages. Many dirty pieces of scandal in this and 
        other countries are raked up and put into them. "Eight pages of fun!"- 
        that is splendid reading for Sunday, isn't it? Even when a so-called 
        sermon is printed, it is completely buried by the fiction and news 
        matter. It is time that ministers went into their pulpits and preached 
        against Sunday newspapers if they haven't done it already.<BR><BR>Put 
        the man in the scales that buys and reads Sunday papers. After reading 
        them for two or three hours he might go and hear the best sermon in the 
        world, but you couldn't preach anything into him. His mind is filled up 
        with what he has read, and there is no room for thoughts of God. I 
        believe that the archangel Gabriel himself could not make an impression 
        on an audience that has its head full of such trash. If you bored a hole 
        into a man's head, you could not inject any thoughts of God and 
        heaven.<BR><BR>I don't believe that the publishers would allow their own 
        children to read them. Why then should they give them to my children and 
        to yours?<BR><BR>A merchant who advertises in Sunday papers is not 
        keeping the Sabbath. It is a master-stroke of the devil to induce 
        Christian men to do this in order to make trade for Monday. But if a man 
        makes money, and yet his sons are ruined and his home broken up, what 
        has he gained?<BR><BR>Ladies buy the Sunday papers and read the 
        advertisements of Monday bargains to see what they can buy cheap. Just 
        so with their religion. They are willing to have it if it doesn't cost 
        anything. If Christian men and women refused to buy them, if Christian 
        merchants refused to advertise in them, they would soon die out, because 
        that is where they get most of their support.<BR><BR>They tell me the 
        Sunday paper has come to stay, and I may as well let it alone. Never! I 
        believe it is a great evil, and I shall fight it while I live. I never 
        read a Sunday paper, and wouldn't have one in my house. They are often 
        sent me, but I tear them up without reading them. I will have nothing to 
        do with them. They do more harm to religion than any other one agency I 
        know. Their whole influence is against keeping the Sabbath holy. They 
        are an unnecessary evil. Can't a man read enough news on weekdays 
        without desecrating the Sabbath? We had no Sunday papers till the war 
        came, and we got along very well without them. They have been increasing 
        in size and in number ever since then, and I think they have been 
        lowering their tone ever since. If you believe that, help to fight them

      seven. For four hundred and ninety years they disregarded that law. But 
      mark you, Nebuchadnezzar came and took them off into Babylon, and kept 
      them seventy years in captivity, and the land had its seventy sabbaths of

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The first four commandments deal with our 
      relations to God. They tell us how to worship and when to worship; they 
      forbid irreverence and impiety in word and act. Now God turns to our 
      relations with each other, and isn't it significant that He deals first 
      with family life? "God is going to show us our duty to our neighbor. How 
      does He begin? Not by telling us how kings ought to reign, or how soldiers 
      ought to fight, or how merchants ought to conduct their business, but how 
      boys and girls ought to behave at home."<BR><BR>We can see that if their 
      home life is all right, they are almost sure to fulfill the law in regard 
      to both God and man. Parents stand in the place of God to their children 
      in a great many ways until the children arrive at years of discretion. If 
      the children are true to their parents, it will be easier for them to be 
      true to God. He used the human relationship as a symbol of our 
      relationship to Him both by creation and by grace. God is our Father in 
      heaven. We are His offspring.<BR><BR>On the other hand, if they have not 
      learned to be obedient and respectful at home, they are likely to have 
      little respect for the law of the land. It is all in the heart; and the 
      heart is prepared at home for good or bad conduct outside. The tree grows 
      the way the twig is bent.<BR><BR>"Honour thy father and thy mother." That 
      word <I>honor</I>, means more than mere obedience- a child may obey 
      through fear. It means love and affection, gratitude, respect. We are told 
      that in the East the words "father" and "mother" include those who are 
      "superiors in age, wisdom and in civil or religious station," so that when 
      the Jews were taught to honor their father and mother it included all who 
      were placed over them in these relations, as well as their parents. Isn't 
      there a crying need for that same feeling today? The lawlessness of the 
      present time is a natural consequence of the growing absence of a feeling

      professed to be a Christian, who was brought before the magistrate for not 
      supporting his aged father. He had let him go to the workhouse. My 
      friends, I'd rather be content with a crust of bread and a drink of water 
      than let my father or mother go to the workhouse. The idea of a professing 
      Christian doing such a thing! God have mercy on such a godless 
      Christianity as that! It is a withered-up thing, and the breath of heaven 
      will drive it away. Don't profess to love God and do a thing like 
      that.<BR><BR>A friend of mine told me of a poor man who had sent his son 
      to school in the city. One day the father was hauling some wood into the 
      city, perhaps to pay his boy's bills. The young man was walking down the 
      street with two of his school friends, all dressed in the very height of 
      fashion. His father saw him, and was so glad that he left his wood, and 
      went to the sidewalk to speak to him. But the boy was ashamed of his 
      father, who had on his old working clothes, and spurned him, and said: 
      <BR><BR>"I don't know you."<BR><BR>Will such a young man ever amount to 
      anything?<BR><BR>Never!<BR><BR>I remember a very promising young man whom 
      I had in the Sunday school in Chicago. His father was a confirmed 
      drunkard, and his mother took in washing to educate her four children. 
      This was her eldest son, and I thought that he was going to redeem the 
      whole family. But one day a thing happened that made him go down in my 
      estimation.<BR><BR>The boy was in the high school, and was a very bright 
      scholar. One day he stood with his mother at the cottage door- it was a 
      poor house, but she could not pay for their schooling, and feed and clothe 
      her children, and hire a very good house too, out of her earnings. When 
      they were talking a young man from the high school came up the street, and 
      this boy walked away from his mother. Next day the young man 
      said:<BR><BR>"Who was that I saw you talking to yesterday?"<BR><BR>"Oh, 
      that was my washerwoman."<BR><BR>I said: "Poor fellow! He will never 
      amount to anything."<BR><BR>That was a good many years ago. I have kept my 
      eye on him. He has gone down, down, down, and now he is just a miserable 
      wreck. Of course he would go down. Ashamed of his mother who loved him and 
      toiled for him, and bore so much hardship for him! I cannot tell you the 
      contempt I had for that one act. Let us look at...</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Some years ago I heard of a poor woman who 
      sent her boy to school and college. When he was to graduate, he wrote his 
      mother to come, but she sent back word that she could not because her only 
      skirt had already been turned once. She was so shabby that she was afraid 
      he would be ashamed of her. He wrote back that he didn't care how she was 
      dressed and urged so strongly that she went. He met her at the station, 
      and took her to a nice place to stay. The day came for his graduation, and 
      he walked down the broad aisle with that poor mother dressed very 
      shabbily, and put her into one of the best seats in the house. To her 
      great surprise he was the valedictorian of the class, and he carried 
      everything before him.<BR><BR>He won a prize, and when it was given to 
      him, he stepped down before the whole audience, and kissed his mother, and 
      said:<BR><BR>"Here, mother, here is the prize. It is yours. I would not 
      have had it if it had not been for you."<BR><BR>Thank God for such a 
      man!<BR><BR>The one glimpse the Bible gives us of thirty out of the 
      thirty-three years of Christ's life on earth shows that He did not come to 
      destroy this fifth commandment. The secret of all those silent years is 
      embodied in that verse in Luke's Gospel-</FONT>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I have read of one heathen custom in China, 
      which would do us credit in this so-called Christian country. On every New 
      Year's morning each man and boy, from the emperor to the lowest peasant, 
      is said to pay a visit to his mother, carrying her a present varying in 
      value according to his station in life. He thanks her for all she has done 
      for him and asks a continuance of her favor another year. Abraham Lincoln 
      used to say: "All I have I owe to my mother."<BR><BR>I would rather die a 
      hundred deaths than have my children grow up to treat me with scorn and 
      contempt. I would rather have them honor me a thousand times over than 
      have the world honor me. I would rather have their esteem and favor than 
      the esteem of the whole world. And any man who seeks the honor and esteem 
      of the world, and doesn't treat his parents right, is sure to be 
      disappointed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Young man, if your parents are still living, 
      treat them kindly. Do all you can to make their declining years sweet and 
      happy. Bear in mind that this is the only commandment that you may not 
      always be able to obey. As long as you live, you will be able to serve 
      God, to keep the sabbath, to obey all the other commandments; but the day 
      comes to most men when father and mother die. What bitter feelings you 
      will have when the opportunity has gone by if you fail to show them the 
      respect and love that is their due! How long is it since you wrote to your 
      mother? Perhaps you have not written home for months, or it may be for 
      years. How often I get letters from mothers urging me to try to influence 
      their sons!<BR><BR>Which would you rather be- a Joseph or an Absalom? 
      Joseph wasn't satisfied until he had brought his old father down into 
      Egypt. He was the greatest man in Egypt, next to Pharaoh; he was arrayed 
      in the finest garments; he had Pharaoh's ring on his hand, and a gold 
      chain about his neck, and they cried before him, "Bow the 
      knee."</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=1> (Genesis 41:43)</FONT><FONT 
      color=#000000 size=2> Yet when he heard Jacob was coming, he hurried out 
      to meet him. He wasn't ashamed of the old man with his shepherd's clothes. 
      What a contrast we see in Absalom. That young man broke his father's heart 
      by his rebellion, and the Jews are said to throw a stone at Absalom's 
      pillar to the present day, whenever they pass it, as a token of their 
      horror of Absalom's unnatural conduct.<BR><BR>Come, now, are you ready to 
      be weighed? If you have been dishonoring your father and mother, step into 
      the scales and see how quickly you will be found wanting. See how quickly 
      you will strike the beam. I don't know any man who is much lighter than 
      one who treats his parents with contempt. Do you disobey them just as much 
      as you dare? Do you try to deceive them? Do you call them old-fashioned, 
      and sneer at their advice? How do you treat that venerable father and 
      praying mother?<BR><BR>You may be a professing Christian, but I wouldn't 
      give much for your religion unless it gets into your life and teaches you 
      how to live. I wouldn't give a snap of my finger for a religion that 
      doesn't begin at home and regulate your conduct- toward your 
      parents.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I USED TO SAY: "What is the use of taking up 
      a law like this in an audience where, probably, there isn't a man who ever 
      thought of, or ever will commit murder?" But as one gets on in years, he 
      sees many a murder that is not outright killing. I need not kill a person 
      to be a murderer. If I get so angry that I wish a man dead, I am a 
      murderer in God's sight. God looks at the heart and says he that hateth 
      his brother is a murderer.<BR><BR>First, let us see what this commandment 
      does not mean.</FONT> 
      <OL>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 size=2>It does not forbid the killing of animals 
        for food and for other reasons. Millions of rams and lambs and 
        turtledoves must have been killed every year for sacrifices under the 
        Mosaic system. Christ Himself ate of the Passover lamb, and we are told 
        definitely of cases where He ate fish and provided it for His disciples 
        and the people to eat.<BR><BR></FONT>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 size=2>It does not forbid the killing of 
        burglars or attackers in self-defense. Directly after the giving of the 
        Ten Commandments, God laid down the ordinance that if a thief be found 
        breaking in and be smitten that he die, it was pardonable. Did not 
        Christ justify this idea of self-defense when He said: "If the goodman 
        of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have 
        watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken 
        up."</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=1> (Matthew 24:43)</FONT><FONT 
        color=#000000 size=2>?<BR><BR></FONT>
        <LI><FONT color=#000000 size=2>It does not forbid capital punishment. 
        God Himself set the death penalty upon violations of each of the first 
        seven commandments, as well as for other crimes. God said to Noah after 
        the deluge, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be 
        shed."</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=1> (Genesis 9:6)</FONT><FONT 
        color=#000000 size=2>; and the reason given is just as true today as it 
        was then- "for in the image of God made he man."</FONT> </LI></OL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>What it does forbid is the wanton, 
      intentional taking of human life under wrong motives and circumstances. 
      Man is made in God's image. He is built for eternity. He is more than a 
      mere animal. His life ought therefore to be held sacred. Once taken, it 
      can never be restored. In heathen lands human life is no more sacred than 
      the life of animals; even in Christian lands there are heartless and 
      selfish men who hold it cheap; but God has invested it with a high value. 
      An infidel philosopher of the eighteenth century said: "In the sight of 
      God, every event is alike important; and the life of a man is of no 
      greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster... Where is the 
      crime," he asked, "of turning a few ounces of blood out of their channel?" 
      Such language needs no answer.</FONT></P>

      <DL>
        <DD><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"A friend of mine visited the Fiji 
        Islands in 1844, and what do you suppose an infidel was worth there 
        then? You could buy a man for a musket, or if you paid money, for seven 
        dollars, and after you had bought him you could feed him, starve him, 
        work him, whip him, or eat him- they generally ate them, unless they 
        were so full of tobacco they could not stomach them! But if you go there 
        today you could not buy a man for seven million dollars. There are no 
        men for sale there now. What has made the difference in the price of 
        humanity? The twelve hundred Christian chapels scattered over that 
        island tell the story. The people have learned to read that Book which 
        says: 'Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and 
        gold... but with the precious blood of Christ' </FONT><FONT

        there."</FONT> </DD></DL>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Men tell me that the world is getting so 
      much better. We talk of our American civilization. We forget the alarming 
      increase of crime in our midst. It is said that there is no civilized 
      country on the globe where murder is so frequently committed and so seldom 
      punished.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>There is that other kind of murder that is 
      increasing at an appalling rate among us- suicide. There have been 
      infidels in all ages who have advocated it's a justifiable means of 
      release from trial and difficulty; yet thinking men, as far back as 
      Aristotle, have generally condemned it as cowardly and unjustifiable under 
      any conditions. No man has a right to take his own life from such motives 
      any more than the life of another.<BR><BR>It has been pointed out that the 
      Jewish race, the people of God, always counted length of days as a 
      blessing. The Bible does not mention one single instance of a good man 
      committing suicide. In the four thousand years of Old Testament history it 
      records only four suicides, and only one suicide in the New Testament. 
      Saul, king of Israel, and his armorbearer, Ahithophel, Zimri and Judas 
      Iscariot are the five cases. Look at the references in the Bible to see 
      what kind of men they were.</FONT></P>

      size=2><BR><B>OTHER KINDS OF MURDER</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>But I want to speak of other classes of 
      murderers that are very numerous in this country, although they are not 
      classified as murderers. The man who is the cause of the death of another 
      through criminal carelessness is guilty. The man who sells diseased meat; 
      the saloonkeeper whose drink has maddened the brain of a criminal; those 
      who adulterate food; the employer who jeopardizes the lives of employees 
      and others by unsafe surroundings and conditions in harmful occupations- 
      they are all guilty of blood where life is lost as a 
      consequence.<BR><BR>When I was in England in 1892, I met a gentleman who 
      claimed that they were ahead of us in the respect they had for the law. 
      "We hang our murderers," he said, "but there isn't one out of twenty in 
      your country that is hung." I said, "You are greatly mistaken, for they 
      walk about these two countries unhung." "What do you mean?" "I will tell 
      you what I mean," I said; "the man that comes into my house and runs a 
      dagger into my heart for my money, is a prince compared with a son that 
      takes five years to kill me and the wife of my bosom. A young man who 
      comes home night after night drunk, and when his mother remonstrates, 
      curses her grey hairs and kills her by inches, is the blackest kind of a 
      murderer."<BR><BR>That kind of thing is going on constantly all around us. 
      One young man at college, an only son, whose mother wrote to him 
      remonstrating against his gambling and drinking habits, took the letters 
      out of the post office, and when he found that they were from her, he tore 
      them up without reading them. She said, "I thought I would die when I 
      found I had lost my hold on that son."<BR><BR>If a boy kills his mother by 
      his conduct, you can't call it anything else than <I>murder</I>. And he is 
      as truly guilty of breaking this sixth commandment as if he drove a dagger 
      to her heart. If all young men in this country who are killing their 
      parents and their wives by inches, should be hung this next week, there 
      would be a great many funerals.<BR><BR>How are you treating your parents? 
      Come, are you killing them? This sixth commandment follows very naturally 
      after the fifth, "Honor thy father and dry mother." Don't put any thoughts 
      in their pillows and make their last days miserable. Bear in mind that the 
      commandment refers not only to shooting a man down in cold blood; but he 
      is the worst murderer who goes on, month after month, year after year, 
      until he has crowded the life out of a sainted mother and put a godly 
      father under the sod.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>This commandment is God's bulwark around 
      marriage and the home. Marriage is one of the institutions that existed in 
      Eden; it is older than the Fall. It is the most sacred relationship that 
      can exist between human beings, taking precedence even of the relationship 
      of the parent and child. Someone has pointed out that as in the beginning 
      God created one man and one woman, this is the true order for all ages. 
      Where family ties are disregarded and dishonored, the results are always 
      fatal. The home existed before the church, and unless the home is kept 
      pure and undefiled, there can be no family religion, and the church is in 
      danger. Adultery and licentiousness have swept nation after nation out of 
      existence. Did it not bring fire and brimstone from heaven upon Sodom and 
      Gomorrah? What carried Rome into ruin? The obscene frescoes and statues at 
      Pompeii and Naples tell the tale.<BR><BR>Where there is no sacredness 
      around the home, population dwindles; family virtues disappear; the 
      children are corrupt from their very birth [i.e., are trained in 
      corruption "from their very birth"</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=1> 
      --WStS</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=2>]; the seeds of sure decay are 
      already planted. In 1895 there were twenty-five thousand divorces in this 
      country. I was on one of the fashionable streets of a prominent city some 
      time ago, where every family except two on the whole street had either a 
      son or a daughter that had been divorced. Divorce and debauchery go hand 
      in hand. We are not gaining much in turning away from this old law, are 
      we?</FONT></P>

      size=2><BR><B>THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I think that the most infernal thing that 
      shines on in America is the way a woman is treated after she has been 
      ruined by a man, often under fair promises of marriage. Someone said that 
      when the prodigal son came home he had the best robe and the fatted calf, 
      but what does the prodigal daughter get? Although she may have been more 
      sinned against than sinning, she is cast out and ostracized by society. 
      She is condemned to an almost hopeless life of degradation and shame, 
      sinking step by step into a loathsome grave, unless she hurries her doom 
      by suicide. But the wretch who has ruined her in body and soul holds his 
      head as high as ever, and society attaches no stain to him. If he had 
      failed to pay his gambling debts, or was detected cheating at cards, he 
      would promptly be dropped by society; but he may boast of his impure life, 
      and his companions will think nothing of it. Parents who would not allow 
      their daughters to become acquainted with a man who is rude in manners, 
      sometimes do not hesitate to accept the society of men who are known to be 
      impure.<BR><BR>Talk about stealing- a man who steals the virtue of a woman 
      is the meanest thief that ever was on the face of the earth! One who goes 
      into your house and steals your money is a prince compared with a vile 
      libertine who takes the virtue of your sister, or steals the affection of 
      your wife, and robs you of her; no sneak thief that ever walked the earth 
      is so mean as he. How men pass laws to protect their property, but when 
      that which is far nearer and dearer to them than money is taken, it is 
      made light of! If a man should push a young lady into the river and she 
      should be drowned, the law would lay hold of him, and he would be tried 
      for murder and hung. But if he wins her affection and ruins her, and then 
      casts her off, isn't he worse than a murderer? There are some sins that 
      are worse than murder, and that is one of them. If someone should treat 
      your wife or sister so, you would want to shoot him as you would a dog. 
      Why do you not respect all women as you do your mother and sister? What 
      law of justice forgives the obscene bird of prey, while it kicks out of 
      its path the soiled and bleeding dove?</FONT></P>

      never dies," and the memory is never cleansed of obscene stories and 
      unclean acts. Even if a man repents and reforms he often has to fight the 
      past.<BR><BR>Lust gave Samson into the power of Delilah, who robbed him of 
      his strength. It led David to commit murder and called down upon him the 
      wrath of God, and if he had not repented he would have lost heaven. I 
      believe that if Joseph had responded to the enticement of Potiphar's wife, 
      his light would have gone out in darkness.<BR><BR>It ends in one or other 
      of two ways: either in remorse and shame because of the realization of the 
      loss of purity, with a terrible struggle against a hard taskmaster; or in 
      hardness of heart, brutalizing of the finer senses, which is a more 
      dreadful condition.<BR><BR>We hear a good deal about intemperance 
      nowadays. That sin advertises itself; it shows its marks upon the face and 
      in the conduct. But this hides itself away under the shadow of the night. 
      A man who tampers with this evil goes on step by step until his character 
      is blasted, his reputation ruined, his health gone, and his life made as

      the conductor came to the Institute and asked the student to come to see

      a number of others around there were converted as a result of that one 
      act.<BR><BR>You can hardly take up a paper now without reading of some 
      cashier of a bank who has become a defaulter, or of some large swindling

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The stream generally starts at home and in 
      the school. Parents are woefully lax in their condemnation and punishment 
      of the sin of stealing. The child begins by taking sugar, it may be. The 
      mother makes light of it at first, and the child's conscience is violated 
      without any sense of wrong. By and by it is not an easy matter to check 
      the habit, because it grows and multiplies with every new 
      commission.<BR><BR>The value of the thing that is stolen has nothing to 
      say to the guilt of the act. Two people were once arguing upon this point, 
      and one said: "Well, you will not contend that a theft of a pin and of a 
      dollar are the same to God?" "When you tell me the difference between the 
      value of a pin and of a dollar to God," said the other, "I will answer 
      your question."<BR><BR>The value or amount is not what is to be 
      considered, but whether the act is right or wrong. Partial obedience is 
      not enough: obedience must be entire. The little indulgences, the small 
      transgressions are what drive religion out of the soul. They lay the 
      foundation for the grosser sin. If you give way to little temptations, you 
      will not be able to resist when great temptations come to you.</FONT></P>

      order to make sure of their speaking the truth? As a legal offense, 
      perjury- the bearing of false witness when under oath- is one of the most 
      serious crimes that can be committed. Nearly every civilized nation visits

      have heard that in Siam they sew up the mouth of a confirmed liar. I am 
      afraid if that was the custom in America, a good many would suffer. 
      Parents should begin with their children while they are young and teach

      witness against you, or help to ruin your character or reputation; then 
      why should you do it to others? How public men are slandered in this 
      country! None escape, whether good or bad. Judgment is passed upon them, 
      their family, their character, by the press and by individuals who know 
      little or nothing about them. If one-tenth that is said and written about 
      our public men were true, half of them should be hung. Slander has been 
      called "tongue murder." Slanders are compared to flies that always settle 
      on sores, but do not touch a man's good parts.<BR><BR>If the archangel 
      Gabriel should come down to earth and mix in human affairs, I believe his 
      character would be assailed inside of forty-eight hours. Slander called 
      Christ a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber. He claimed to be the Truth, but 
      instead of worshiping Him, men took Him and crucified Him.<BR><BR>When 
      anyone spoke evil of another in the presence of Peter the Great, he used 
      promptly to stop him, and say: "Well, now, has he not got a bright side? 
      Tell me what you know good of him. It is easy to splash mud, but I would 
      rather help a man to keep his coat clean."<BR><BR>I need not stop to run 
      through the whole catalog of sins that are related to these three. False 
      rumor, exaggeration, misrepresentation, insinuation, gossip, equivocation, 
      holding back of the truth when it is due and right to tell it, 
      disparagement, perversion of meaning: these are common transgressions of 
      this ninth commandment, differing in form and degree of guilt according to 
      the motive or manner of their expression. They bear false witness against 
      a man before the tribunal of public opinion-court whose judgment none of 
      us escapes. As so much of our life is passed in public view, any untruth 
      that leads to a false judgment is a grievous wrong.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>"But, Mr. Moody," you say, "how can I check 
      myself? How can I overcome the habit of lying and gossip?" A lady once 
      said to me that she had got so into the habit of exaggerating, that her 
      friends said they could never understand her.<BR><BR>The cure is simple, 
      but not very pleasant. Treat it as a sin, and confess it to God and the 
      man whom you have wronged. As soon as you catch yourself lying, go 
      straight to the person and confess you have lied. Let your confession be 
      as wide as your transgression. If you have slandered or lied about anyone 
      in public, let your confession be public. Many a person says some mean, 
      false thing about another in the presence of others, and then tries to 
      patch it up by going to that person alone. That is not making restitution. 
      I need not go to God with confession until I have made it right with that 
      person, if it is in my power to do so; He will not hear me.<BR><BR>Hannah 
      Moore's method was a sure cure for scandal. Whenever she was told anything 
      derogatory of another, her invariable reply was: "Come, we will go ask if

      talebearer was taken aback, stammered out a qualification, or begged that 
      no notice might be taken of the statement. But the good lady was 
      inexorable. Off she took the scandalmonger to the scandalized to make 
      inquiry and compare accounts.<BR><BR>It is not likely that anybody

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I believe this sin is much stronger now than 
      ever before in the world's history. We are not in the habit of calling it 
      a sin. In his first epistle to the Thessalonians Paul speaks of a "cloak 
      of covetousness"</FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=1> (2:5)</FONT><FONT 
      color=#000000 size=2>. Covetous men use it as a cloak and call it prudence 
      and foresight. Who ever heard it confessed as a sin? I have heard many 
      confessions, in public and private, during the past forty years, but never 
      have heard a man confess that he was guilty of this sin. The Bible does 
      not tell of one man who ever recovered from it, and in all my experience I 
      do not recall many who have been able to shake it off after it had 
      fastened on them. A covetous man or woman generally remains covetous to 
      the very end.<BR><BR>We may say that covetous desire plunged the human 
      race into sin. We can trace the river back from age to age until we get to 
      its rise in Eden. When Eve saw that the forbidden fruit was good for food 
      and that it was desirable to the eyes, she partook of it, and Adam with 
      her. They were not satisfied with all that God had showered upon them, but 
      coveted the wisdom of gods which Satan deceitfully told them might be 
      obtained by eating the fruit. She saw, she desired, then she took! Three 
      steps from innocence into sin.</FONT></P>

      COMMANDMENT</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>It would be absurd for such a law as this to 
      be placed upon any human statute book. It could never be enforced. The 
      officers of the law would be powerless to detect infractions. The outward 
      conduct may be regulated, but the thoughts and intents of a man are beyond 
      the reach of human law.<BR><BR>But God can see behind outward actions. He 
      can read the thoughts of the heart. Our innermost life, invisible to 
      mortal eye, is laid bare before Him. We cannot deceive Him by external 
      conformity. He is able to detect the least transgression and shortcoming, 
      so that no man can shirk detection. God cannot be imposed upon by the 
      cleanness of the outside of the cup and the platter.<BR><BR>Surely we have 
      here another proof that the Ten Commandments are not of human origin, but 
      must be divine.<BR><BR>This commandment, then, did not, even on the 
      surface, confine itself to visible actions, as did the preceding 
      commandments. Even before Christ came and showed their spiritual sweep, 
      men had a commandment that went beneath public conduct and touched the 
      very springs of action. It directly prohibited- not the wrong act, but the 
      wicked desire that prompted the act. It forbade the evil thought, the 
      unlawful wish. It sought to prevent- not only sin, but the desire to sin. 
      In God's sight it is as wicked to set covetous eyes as it is to lay 
      thieving hands upon anything that is not ours.<BR><BR>And why? Because if 
      the evil desire can be controlled, there will be no outbreak in conduct. 
      Desires have been called "actions in the egg." The desire in the heart is 
      the first step in the series that ends in action. Kill the evil desire, 
      and you successfully avoid the ill results that would follow upon its 
      hatching and development. Prevention is better than cure.<BR><BR>We must 
      not limit covetousness to the matter of money. The commandment is not thus 
      limited; it reads, "Thou shalt not covet ... anything." That word 
      "anything" is what will condemn us. Though we do not join the race for 
      wealth, have we not sometimes a hungry longing for our neighbor's goodly 
      lands, fine houses, beautiful clothes, brilliant reputation, personal 
      accomplishments, easy circumstances, comfortable surroundings? Have we not 
      had the desire to increase our possessions or to change our lot in 
      accordance with what we see in others? If so, we are guilty of having 
      broken this law.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Notice that the covetous are named between 
      thieves and drunkards. We lock up thieves and have no mercy on them. We 
      loathe drunkards and consider them great sinners against the law of God as 
      well as the law of the land. Yet there is far more said in the Bible 
      against covetousness than against either stealing or 
      drunkenness.<BR><BR>Covetousness and stealing are almost like Siamese 
      twins- they go together so often. In fact we might add lying, and make 
      them triplets. The covetous person is a thief in the shell. The thief is a 
      covetous person out of the shell. Let a covetous person see something that 
      he desires very much; let an opportunity of taking it be offered; how very 
      soon he will break through the shell and come out in his true character as 
      a thief. The Greek word translated covetousness means "an inordinate 
      desire of getting." When the Gauls tasted the sweet wines of Italy, they 
      asked where they came from and never rested until they had overrun

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The Revised Version translates it- "a root 
      of all kinds of evil." This tenth commandment has therefore been aptly 
      called a "root-extractor," because it would tear up and destroy this root. 
      No one but God can rid us of it. Matthew tells us that the deceitfulness 
      of riches chokes the Word of God. Like the Mississippi river, which chokes 
      up its mouth by the amount of soil it carried down. Isn't that true of 
      many businessmen today? They are so engrossed with their affairs that they 
      have not time for religion. They lose sight of their soul and its eternal 
      welfare in their desire to amass wealth. They do not even hesitate to sell 
      their souls to the devil. How many a man says, "We must make money, and if 
      God's law stands in the way, brush it aside."<BR><BR>The word "lucre" 
      occurs five times in the New Testament, and each time it is called "filthy 
      lucre."<BR><BR>"A root of all kinds of evil." Yes, because what will not 
      men be guilty of when prompted by the desire to be rich? Greed for gold 
      leads men to commit violence and murder, to cheat and deceive and steal. 
      It turns the heart to stone, devoid of all natural affection, cruel, 
      unkind. How many families are wrecked over the father's will! The scramble 
      for a share of the wealth smashes them to pieces. Covetous of rank and 
      position in society, parents barter sons and daughters in ungodly 
      marriage. Bodily health is no consideration The uncontrollable fever for 
      gold makes men renounce all their settled prospects and undertake 
      hazardous journeys- no peril can drive them back.<BR><BR>It destroys faith 
      and spirituality, turning men's minds and hearts away from God. It 
      disturbs the peace of the community by prompting to acts of wrong. 
      Covetousness has more than once led nation to war against nation for the 
      sake of gaining territory or other material resources. It is said that 
      when the Spaniards came over to conquer Peru, they sent a message to the 
      king, saying, "Give us gold, for we Spaniards have a disease that can only 
      be cured by gold."<BR><BR>Dr. Boardman has shown how covetousness leads to 
      the transgression of every one of the commandments, and I cannot do better 
      than quote his words:</FONT>

      gentleman who had a confidential clerk and insisted on his going down 
      Sunday morning to work on his books. The young man had a good deal of 
      principle, and at first refused; but he was anxious to keep in the good 
      graces of his employer and finally yielded. He had not done that a great 
      while before he speculated in stocks, and became a defaulter for one 
      hundred and twenty thousand dollars. The employer had him arrested and put 
      in the penitentiary for ten years, but I believe he was just as guilty in 
      the sight of God as that young man, for he led him to take the fist step 
      on the downward road. You remember the story of a soldier who was smuggled

      yourself,<BR><BR>"If we are to be judged by these laws, how are we going 
      to be saved? Nearly every one of them has been broken by us- in spirit, if 
      not in letter."<BR><BR>I almost hear you say:<BR><BR>"I wonder if Mr. 
      Moody is ready to be weighed. Would he like to put those tests to 
      himself?"<BR><BR>With all humility I reply that if God commanded me to 
      step into the scales now, I am ready.<BR><BR>"What!" you say, "haven't you 
      broken the law?"<BR><BR>Yes, I have. I was a sinner before God, the same 
      as you; but forty years ago I pled guilty at His bar. I cried for mercy, 
      and He forgave me. If I step into the scales, the Son of God has promised 
      to be with me. I would not dare to step in without Him. If I did, how 
      quickly the scales would fly up!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Christ kept the law. If He had ever broken 
      it, He would have to die for Himself; but because He was a Lamb without 
      spot or blemish, His atoning death is efficacious for you and me. He had 
      no sin of His own to atone for, and so God accepted His sacrifice. Christ 
      is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth. We are 
      righteous in God's sight, because the righteousness of God which is by 
      faith in Jesus Christ is unto all and upon all them that 
      believe.<BR><BR>If we had to live forever with our sins in the handwriting 
      of God on the wall, it would be hell on earth. But thank God for the 
      Gospel we preach! If we repent, our sins will all be blotted out.</FONT>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>It is the height of madness to turn away and 
      run the risk of being called by God to judgment and have no hope in 
      Christ. Now is the day and hour to accept salvation, and then He will be 
      with you. Do you step aside and say: "I'm not ready yet. I want a little 
      more time to prepare, to turn the matter over in my mind"? Well, you have 
      time, but bear in mind it is only the present; you do not know that you 
      will have tomorrow. Wasn't Belshazzar cut off suddenly? Would he have 
      believed that that was going to be his last night, that he would never see 
      the light of another sun? That banquet of sin didn't close as he expected. 
      As long as you delay you are in danger. If you don't enter into the 
      kingdom of heaven by God's way, you cannot enter at all. You must accept 
      Christ as your Saviour, or you will never be fit to be weighed.<BR><BR>My 
      friend, do you have Him? Will you remain as you are and be found wanting, 
      or will you accept Christ and be ready for the summons?</FONT>
