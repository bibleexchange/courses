      of the wicked as the second death (Rev. 20:14) in support of their 
      view.&nbsp; Since a person loses consciousness of this world at the first 
      death (physical death), it is argued that the second death will involve 
      unconsciousness in the world to come.</SPAN><SPAN

      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Everlasting 
      Destruction.&nbsp; Scripture speaks of the wicked being 
      destroyed.&nbsp; Paul said:&nbsp; This will happen when the Lord Jesus 
      is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.&nbsp; He 
      will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our 
      Lord Jesus.&nbsp; They will be punished with <I>everlasting 
      destruction</I> and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the 
      majesty of his power (2 Thess.1:7b-9).&nbsp; Annihilationists insist that 
      the figure destruction is incompatible with a continued conscious 
      existence.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><I>Perdition</I>.&nbsp; 
      The wicked are said to go into perdition (KJV) or destruction (NIV) (2 
      Peter 3:7), and Judas is called the son of perdition (John 7:12).&nbsp; 
      The word <I>perdition (apoleia)</I> means to perish.&nbsp; This, 
      annihilationists argue, indicates that the lost will perish or go out of 
      existence.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      said of Judas, who was sent to perdition, that It would be better for him 
      if he had not been born (Mark 12:21).&nbsp; Before one is conceived they 
      do not exist.&nbsp; Thus, for hell to be like the prebirth condition it 
      must be a state of nonexistence.</SPAN><SPAN

      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><I>The Wicked 
      Will Perish</I>.&nbsp; Repeatedly, the Old Testament speaks of the wicked 
      perishing.&nbsp; The psalmist wrote:&nbsp; But the wicked will 
      perish:&nbsp; The Lords enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, 
      they will vanishvanish like smoke ) Ps. 37:20; cf. 68:2; 112:10).&nbsp; 
      But to perish implies a state of nothingness.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      Scripture</SPAN><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">.&nbsp; When 
      examined carefully in context, none of the above language proves 
      annihilationism.&nbsp; At some points language may <I>permit </I>such a 
      construction, but nowhere does the text demand annihilationism.&nbsp; In 
      context and comparison with other Scriptures, the concept must be rejected 
      in every case.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><I><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Separation, Not 
      Extinction</SPAN></I><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">.&nbsp; The 
      first death is simply the separation of the soul from the body (James 
      2:26), not the annihilation of the soul.&nbsp; Scripture presents death as 
      conscious separation.&nbsp; Adam and Eve died spiritually in the moment 
      they sinned, yet they still existed and could hear Gods voice (Gen. 
      3:10).&nbsp; Before one is saved, he is dead in trespasses and sins 
      (Eph. 2:1), and yet he still carries Gods image (Gen. 1:27; cf Gen. 9:6; 
      James 3:9).&nbsp; Though unable to come to Christ without the intervention 
      of God, the&nbsp; <BR>spiritually dead are sufficiently aware that 
      Scripture holds them accountable to believe (Acts 16:31), and repent (Acts 
      17:30).&nbsp; Continued awareness, but with separation from God and the 
      inability to save oneselfthese constitute Scriptures vision of the 
      second death.</SPAN><SPAN

      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><I><SPAN

      Nonexistence.&nbsp; </SPAN></I><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Everlasting 
      destruction would not be annihilation, which only takes an instant and is 
      over.&nbsp; If someone undergoes everlasting destruction, then they have 
      to have everlasting existence.&nbsp; The cars in a junkyard have been 
      destroyed, but they are not annihilated.&nbsp; They are simply beyond 
      repair or unredeemable.&nbsp; So are the people in hell.</SPAN><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Since the word 
      <I>perdition</I> means to die, perish, or to come to ruin, the same 
      objections apply.&nbsp; In 2 Peter 3:7 <I>perdition </I>is used in the 
      context of judgment, clearly implying consciousness.&nbsp; In our junkyard 
      analogy, ruined cars have perished, but they are still junkyard 
      cars.&nbsp; In this connection, Jesus spoke of hell as a dump where the 
      fire would not cease and where a persons resurrected body would not be 
      consumed (Mark 9:48).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In addition to 
      comments on <I>death </I>and <I>perdition</I> above, it should be noted 
      that the Hebrew word used to describe the wicked perishing in the Old 
      Testament (<I>abad</I>) is also used to describe the righteous perishing 
      (see Isa. 57:1; Micah 7:2).&nbsp; But even the annihilationists admit that 
      the righteous are not snuffed out of existence.&nbsp; That being the case, 
      they should not conclude that the wicked will cease to exist based on this 
      term.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The same word 
      (<I>abad</I>) is used to describe things that are merely lost but then 
      later found (Deut. 22:3), which proves that lost does not mean 
      nonexistent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><I>It Would 
      Have Been Better</I>&nbsp;&nbsp; When he says that it would have been 
      better if Judas had not been born, Jesus is not comparing Judass 
      perdition to his nonexistence before conception but to his existence 
      before <I>birth</I>.&nbsp; This hyperbolic figure of speech would almost 
      certainly indicate the severity of his punishment, not a statement about 
      the superiority of nonbeing over being.&nbsp; In a parallel condemnation 
      of the Pharisees, Jesus said Sodom and Gomorrah would have repented had 
      they seen his miracles (Matt. 11:23-24).&nbsp; This does not mean that 
      they actually would have repented or God would have shown them these 
      miracles2 Peter 3:9.&nbsp; It is simply a powerful figure of speech 
      indicating that their sin was so great that it would be <I>more 
      tolerable</I> in the day of judgment for Sodom than for them (vs. 
      24).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Further, nothing 
      cannot be better than something, since they have nothing in common to

      being.&nbsp; To assume otherwise is a category mistake.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      parables which have no real persons in them, Jesus told the story of an 
      actual beggar named Lazarus who went to heaven and of a rich man who died 
      and went to hell and was in conscious torment (Luke 16:22-28).&nbsp; He 
      cried out, Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the

      but now he is comforted here and you are in agony (vss. 24-25).&nbsp; 
      The rich man then begged that his brothers be warned, so that they will 
      not also come to this place of torment (vs. 27).&nbsp; There is not hint 
      of annihilation in this passage;&nbsp; he is suffering constant and 
      conscious torment.</SPAN><SPAN

      they are made in Gods image and likeness, which is everlasting (Gen. 
      1:27).&nbsp; Animals are often killed to alleviate their pain.&nbsp; But 
      (the euthanasia movement notwithstanding) we do not do the same for humans

      image in them.&nbsp; Since free choice is morally good, being part of the 
      image of God, then it would be a moral evil to take it away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      effigy by destroying his image-bearers.&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN

      a petty thief, though both crimes affront Gods infinite holiness.&nbsp; 
      Certainly not all judgment proportionate to the sin is meted out in this 
      life.&nbsp; The Bible speaks of degrees of punishment in hell (Matt. 5:22;

      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Just as 
      universalism is the rage in liberal Christianity, so too annihilation is 
      gaining momentum in conservative Christian circles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The

      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">First, common 
      sense dictates that a God of love and justice does not arbitrarily 
      annihilate the crowning jewels of his creation.&nbsp; Far from rubbing us 
      out, He graciously provides us the freedom to choose between redemption 
      and rebellion.&nbsp; It would be a horrific evil to think that God would 
      create people with freedom of choice and then annihilate them because of 
      their choices.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoTitle style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Furthermore, 
      common sense leads to the conclusion that nonexistence is not better than 
      existence since nonexistence if nothing at allas Norman Geisler aptly 
      puts it, to affirm that nothing can be better than something is a 
      gigantic category mistake.&nbsp; It also is crucial to recognize that not 
      all existence in hell is equal.&nbsp; We may safely conclude that the 
      torment of Hitlers hell will greatly exceed the torment experienced by a 
      garden-variety pagan.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
