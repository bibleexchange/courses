            <P>The General Conference Executive Committee has never voted an 
            official statement regarding the Seventh-day Adventist relationship 
            to the ecumenical movement as such. A book has been written dealing 
            at length with the subject (B. B. Beach, <I>Ecumenism-Boon or 
            Bane?</I> [Review and Herald, 1974]) and a number of articles have 
            appeared over the years in Adventist publications, including the 
            <I>Adventist Review</I>. Thus, while there is not exactly an 
            <I>official</I> position, there are plenty of clear indications 
            regarding the Seventh-day Adventist viewpoint.</P>
            <P>Generally, it can be said that while the Seventh-day Adventist 
            Church does not completely condemn the ecumenical movement and its 
            main organizational manifestation, the World Council of Churches, 
            she has been critical of various aspects and activities. Few would 
            wish to deny that ecumenism has had laudable aims and some positive 
            influences. Its great goal is visible Christian unity. No Adventist 
            can be opposed to the unity Christ Himself prayed for. The 
            ecumenical movement has promoted kinder interchurch relations with 
            more dialogue and less diatribe and helped remove unfounded 
            prejudices.</P>
            <P>Through its various organizations and activities, the ecumenical 
            movement has provided more accurate and updated information on 
            churches, spoken for religious liberty and human rights, combated 
            against the evils of racism, and drawn attention to socioeconomic 
            implications of the gospel. In all this the intentions have been 
            good and some of the fruit palatable. However, in the total picture, 
            the banes tend to outweigh the boons. We shall examine some of 
            these.</P>
            <P><B><I>Adventism a Prophetic Movement</I></B></P>
            <P>The Seventh-day Adventist Church stepped upon the stage of 
            history-so Adventists firmly believe-in response to God's call. 
            Adventists believe, it is hoped without pride or arrogance, that the 
            Advent Movement represents the divinely appointed instrument for the 
            organized proclamation of the "eternal gospel," God's last message, 
            discerned from the prophetic vantage point of Revelation 14 and 18. 
            In the focalized light of its prophetic understanding, the 
            Seventh-day Adventist Church sees herself as the eschatologically 
            oriented "ecumenical" movement of the Apocalypse. She begins by 
            "calling out" God's children from "fallen" ecclesial bodies that 
            will increasingly form organized religious opposition to the 
            purposes of God. Together with the "calling out" there is a positive 
            "calling in" to a united, worldwide-that is, ecumenical-movement 
            characterized by "faith of Jesus" and keeping "the commandments of 
            God" (Rev. 14:12). In the World Council of Churches the emphasis is 
            first of all on "coming in" to a fellowship of churches and then 
            hopefully and gradually "coming out" of corporate disunity. In the 
            Advent Movement the accent is first on "coming out" of Babylonian 
            disunity and confusion and then immediately "coming in" to a 
            fellowship of unity, truth, and love within the globe-encircling 
            Advent family.</P>
            <DIV></DIV><BR clear=all>
            <DIV>
            <P>In understanding the Adventist attitude toward ecumenism and 
            other mainline churches, it is helpful to remember that the 
            early-Advent movement (characterized by the Millerites) had 
            ecumenical aspects: it arose in many churches. Thus, Adventists came 
            from many denominations. However, the churches generally rejected 
            the Advent message. Adventists were not infrequently 
            disfellowshipped. Sometimes Adventists took with them portions of 
            congregations. Relations became embittered. False stories were 
            circulated, some of which unfortunately still persist today. The 
            pioneers had strong views, and their opponents were no less 
            dogmatic. They tended to look more for what separates than what 
            unites. That was an understandable development. Today, of course, 
            the interchurch climate tends to be more irenic and benign.</P>
            <P>What are some of the problems Adventists have with ecumenism? 
            Before we endeavor to give a summary answer to this question, it 
            needs to be pointed out that the ecumenical movement is not 
            monolithic in its thinking, and one can find all kinds of views 
            represented in its ranks (that in itself, of course, is a problem!). 
            We will try to make reference to what can be considered mainstream 
            thinking within the World Council of Churches (WCC), an organization 
            now representing more than three hundred different churches and 
            denominations.</P>
            <P><B><I>Ecumenical Understanding of Unity</I></B></P>
            <P>The New Testament presents a qualified church unity in 
            <I>truth</I>, characterized by <I>holiness, joy, faithfulness</I>, 
            and <I>obedience</I> (see John 17:6, 13, 17, 19, 23, 26). 
            "Ecumenthusiasts" (to coin a word) seem to take for granted the 
            eventual organic unity and communion of the great majority of the 
            churches. They emphasize the "scandal of division," as if this were 
            really the unpardonable sin. Heresy and apostasy are largely 
            ignored. However, the New Testament shows the threat of 
            anti-Christian penetration within "the temple of God" (2 Thess. 2:3, 
            4). The eschatological picture of God's church prior to the Second 
            Coming is not one of a megachurch gathering all humankind together, 
            but of a "remnant" of Christendom, those keeping the commandments of 
            God and having the faith of Jesus (see Rev. 12:17).</P>
            <P>There is clearly a point at which unorthodoxy and un-Christian 
            lifestyle justify separation. The WCC misses this point. Separation 
            and division in order to protect and uphold that purity and 
            integrity of the church and her message are more desirable than 
            unity in worldliness and error.</P>
            <P>Furthermore, Adventists are uncomfortable with the fact that the 
            WCC leaders seem to give little emphasis to personal sanctification 
            and revival. There are indications that some may view such emphasis 
            as a quaint pietistic hangover, not a vital ingredient of a dynamic 
            Christian life. They prefer to soft-pedal personal piety in favor of 
            social morality. However, in Adventist understanding, personal 
            holiness of life is such stuff as the morality of society is made 
            (with apologies to Shakespeare). Without genuinely converted 
            Christians, any formal organizational unity is really of a plastic 
            nature and of little relevance.</P>
            <P><B><I>Ecumenical Understanding of Belief</I></B></P>
            <P>In many church circles broad-mindedness is seen as an ecumenical 
            virtue. The ideal ecumenist, it is suggested, is not dogmatic in 
            belief and is somewhat fluid in doctrinal views. He greatly respects 
            the beliefs of others, but is less than rigid about his own belief. 
            He appears humble and not assertive about doctrinal beliefs-except 
            those regarding ecumenical unity. He has a sense of partial knowing. 
            To show religious doctrinal arrogance is, ecumenically, especially 
            sinful.</P></DIV><BR clear=all>
            <DIV>
            <P>All this has a laudable side. Humility and meekness are Christian 
            virtues. Indeed, Peter tells us to always be ready to answer and 
            give a reason for our faith, but this must be done with humility, 
            respect, and a good conscience (1 Peter 3:15, 16). However, there is 
            in ecumenical ranks an almost inbuilt danger of softness and 
            relativization of belief. The whole concept of heresy is questioned. 
            Lately, questions are even raised regarding the idea of 
            "paganism."</P>
            <P>Typical of some ecumenical presuppositions is the idea that all 
            denominational formulations of truth are time-conditioned and 
            relative, and therefore partial and inadequate. Some ecumenists 
            would even go so far as to advocate the need of doctrinal synthesis, 
            bringing together various Christian beliefs in a kind of cocktail 
            approach. We are told that each church is imbalanced and it is the 
            task of ecumenism to restore balance and harmony. Within the 
            reconciled diversity of the ecumenical movement, presumably 
            everyone, in the words of Frederick the Great, "will be saved in his 
            own way."</P>
            <P>Adventists believe that without strong convictions, a church has 
            little spiritual power. There is the danger that ecumenical 
            quicksands of doctrinal softness will suck churches into 
            denominational death. Of course, this is precisely what ecumenical 
            enthusiasts hope for. However, Adventists feel that such doctrinal 
            irresolutions must be vigorously resisted, otherwise spiritual 
            self-disarmament will be the result and a truly post-Christian age 
            would be upon us.</P>
            <P><B><I>Ecumenical Understanding of Scripture</I></B></P>
            <P>Adventists see the Bible as the infallible revelation of God's 
            will, the authoritative revealer of doctrinal truth, and the 
            trustworthy record of the mighty acts of God in salvation history 
            (see Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists: 1. The Holy 
            Scriptures). Adventists see the Bible as a unity. For many WCC 
            leaders the Bible is not normative and authoritative in itself. The 
            emphasis is on Biblical diversity, including at times 
            demythologization of the Gospels. For a large number of ecumenists, 
            as is the case for liberal Christianity in general, inspiration lies 
            not in the Biblical text but in the experience of the reader. 
            Propositional revelation is out; experience is in.</P>
            <P>Apocalyptic prophecy is given practically no time-of-the-end 
            role. Pro forma references to the Parousia are made, but have no 
            implications for urgency and make little measurable impact on the 
            ecumenical concept of evangelistic mission. There is here the danger 
            of eschatological blindness.</P>
            <P>Seventh-day Adventists see the Biblical picture of sin and 
            redemption within the framework of the "great controversy" between 
            good and evil, between Christ and Satan, between God's Word and the 
            lies of the impostor, between the faithful remnant and Babylon, 
            between the "seal of God" and the "mark of the beast."</P>
            <P>Adventists are, first and foremost, people of the Word. While 
            believing in the unconditional authority of the Scriptures, 
            Adventists recognize that the Bible was "written by inspired men, 
            but it is not God's mode of thought and expression. It is that of 
            humanity. God, as a writer, it not represented. . . . The writers of 
            the Bible were God's penmen, not His pen.<I>Selected Messages</I>, 
            book 1, p. 21. Many ecumenists would say that the Biblical text is 
            not the word of God but contains this word as <I>men</I> respond and 
            <I>accept</I> it. In contrast, Adventists would say that the 
            utterances of the Bible writers "are the word of God" 
            (<I>ibid</I>.). God is not on trial; neither is His Word, form 
            criticism notwithstanding. It is man vis-à-vis the Bible who is on 
            trial.</P></DIV><BR clear=all>

            <P><B><I>Ecumenical Understanding of Mission and 
            Evangelism</I></B></P>
            <P>The traditional understanding of mission highlights evangelism, 
            that is, the verbal proclamation of the gospel. The ecumenical 
            approach sees mission as involving the establishment of 
            <I>shalom</I>, a kind of social peace and harmony. Adventists have 
            problems with any tendency to downplay the primary importance of 
            announcing the good news of redemption from the stranglehold of sin. 
            In fact, the traditional, including Adventist, view of salvation has 
            always been the saving of individuals from sin and for eternity. 
            Ecumenical evangelism sees salvation as primarily saving society 
            from oppressive regimes, from the ravages of hunger, from the curse 
            of racism, and from the exploitation of injustice.</P>
            <P>The Adventist understanding of conversion means for a person to 
            experience radical changes through spiritual rebirth. The majority 
            emphasis in WCC circles appears to be on changing-converting-the 
            unjust structures of society.</P>
            <P>As we see it, in the area of evangelism and foreign missionary 
            work the fruits (or maybe we should say lack of fruits) of ecumenism 
            have often been less evangelism (as we understand it-from Paul to 
            Billy Graham), less growth and more membership decline, fewer 
            missionaries sent out, proportionally less financial support coming 
            in. In fact, the missionary outreach has shifted away from mainline 
            "ecumenical" churches to conservative evangelicals. It is sad to see 
            such a large evangelistic potential lost to the missionary movement, 
            especially at a time of increasingly active and militant Islamic 
            outreach and the awakening of Eastern and indigenous religions.</P>
            <P>The recent and successful Seventh-day Adventist One Thousand Days 
            of Reaping campaign ran counter to the ecumenical low-key "joint 
            mission" approach. The latter may sound good in an ecumenical study 
            paper, but soul-winning results are really not there. The paraphrase 
            of an old saying has some relevance here: "The proof of the 
            ecumenical pudding lies in the evangelistic eating."</P>
            <P><B><I>Ecumenical Understanding of Sociopolitical 
            Responsibility</I></B></P>
            <P>Admittedly, the whole question of Christian social and political 
            responsibility is a complicated one. The WCC and other councils of 
            churches (such as the National Council of Churches in the United 
            States) are heavily involved in what are usually seen as political 
            questions. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is very much more 
            circumspect in this area (in comparison to evangelism, where the 
            tables are turned!).</P>
            <P>Much ecumenical thinking in the area of political responsibility 
            includes or involves: (1) a secularization of salvation; (2) a 
            postmillennial view advocating the gradual political improvement and 
            social betterment of humankind and the establishment through human 
            effort, as divine agents, of God's kingdom on earth; (3) adaptation 
            of Christianity to the modern world; (4) evolutionary utopian faith 
            in progress; and (5) socialistic collectivism, favoring some form of 
            egalitarianism and the welfare state, but not Communist 
            materialism.</P></DIV><BR clear=all>
            <DIV>
            <P>Presumably, ecumenical social activists consider Adventism as a 
            utopian vision of pie in the apocalyptic sky by and by; this is 
            wrong. Faced with the many problems of society, Adventists cannot 
            be, and generally are not, apathetic or indifferent. Witness this: 
            extensive hospital-clinic-health institutions serving millions of 
            people every year; a large educational system circling the globe 
            with nearly five thousand schools; Adventist Development and Relief 
            Agency-a rapidly expanding worldwide service of the church in areas 
            of acute and chronic need. Several other service activities could be 
            referred to.</P>
            <P>The Seventh-day Adventist Church believes it is necessary to 
            distinguish between sociopolitical activity of individual Christians 
            as citizens and involvement on the corporate church level. It is the 
            church's task to deal with moral principles and to point in a 
            <I>Biblical direction</I>, not to advocate <I>political 
            directives</I>. The WCC has at times been involved in political 
            power plays. While Adventism will sow seeds that will inevitably 
            <I>influence</I> society and politics, it does not wish to be 
            <I>entangled</I> in political controversies. The church's Lord did 
            state: "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36), and like her 
            Lord the church wishes to go "about doing good" (Acts 10:38). She 
            does not wish to run the government, either directly or 
            indirectly.</P>
            <P><B><I>Ecumenical Understanding of Religious Liberty</I></B></P>
            <P>In the early years of the WCC, beginning with its first assembly 
            at Amsterdam in 1948, religious liberty was placed on the ecumenical 
            agenda. Religious liberty was seen as a vital prerequisite for 
            ecumenical unity. In 1968 a religious liberty secretariat was set up 
            at WCC headquarters. However, in more recent years, the WCC 
            religious liberty stance has been somewhat ambiguous. In 1978 the 
            secretariat was closed down, mainly for what was seen as a lack of 
            funds. This, of course, in itself speaks regarding the priority 
            given to religious liberty in the organized ecumenical movement.</P>
            <P>Today the ecumenical tendency is to view religious liberty as 
            simply one of the human rights instead of the fundamental right that 
            undergirds all other human rights. This is, of course, the approach 
            used by the secular mind. Secularists or humanists refuse to 
            recognize religious belief as something apart or above other human 
            activities. There is here the danger that religious liberty will 
            lose its unique character that makes it the guardian of all true 
            freedoms.</P>
            <P>It must not be forgotten that historically it has been the 
            balance of power and denominationalism that have neutralized 
            religious intolerance and worked for religious liberty. Formal 
            religious unity has existed only with force. There is thus in 
            society an inbuilt tension between unity and religious liberty. In 
            fact, the eschatological picture of the final events is a dramatic 
            tableau of religious persecution, as the massive forces of 
            apocalyptic Babylon try to squeeze the church of the remnant into 
            the mold of united apostasy.</P>
            <P>Finally, the religious liberty outlook becomes increasingly 
            clouded when it is realized that certain ecumenical activists accept 
            fairly easily religious liberty restrictions affecting believers of 
            a different religiopolitical stamp, who are exerting what is 
            perceived to be a negative social stance. Furthermore, some 
            ecumenical leaders are quite willing, in revolutionary situations, 
            to see religious liberty interfered with and "temporarily shut 
            down," in order to promote unity, nation building, and the "good" of 
            society as a whole.</P>
            <P><B><I>The Influence of Prophetic 
            Understanding</I></B></P></DIV><BR clear=all>
            <DIV>
            <P>What we have written so far highlights some of the reservations 
            Adventists have regarding involvement in the organized ecumenical 
            movement. The general attitude of the Seventh-day Adventist Church 
            toward other churches and the ecumenical movement is decisively 
            influenced by the above considerations and determined by prophetic 
            understanding. <I>Looking back</I>, Adventists see centuries of 
            persecution and anti-Christian manifestations of the papal power. 
            They see discrimination and much intolerance by state or established 
            churches. <I>Looking forward</I>, they see the danger of Catholicism 
            and Protestantism linking hands and exerting religiopolitical power 
            in a domineering and potentially persecuting way. They see the 
            faithful church of God not as a jumbo church, but as a remnant. They 
            see themselves as the nucleus of that remnant and as not willing to 
            be linked with the expanding Christian apostasy of the last 
days.</P>
            <P><I>Looking to the present</I>, Adventists see their task as 
            preaching the everlasting gospel to all men, calling for worship of 
            the Creator, obedient adherence to the faith of Jesus, and 
            proclaiming that the hour of God's judgment has come. Some aspects 
            of this message are not popular. How can Adventists best succeed in 
            fulfilling the prophetic mandate? It is our view that the 
            Seventh-day Adventist Church can best accomplish her divine mandate 
            by keeping her own identity, her own motivation, her own feeling of 
            urgency, her own working methods.</P>
            <P><B><I>Ecumenical Cooperation?</I></B></P>
            <P>Should Adventists cooperate ecumenically? Adventists should 
            cooperate insofar as the authentic gospel is proclaimed and crying 
            human needs are being met. The Seventh-day Adventist Church wants no 
            entangling memberships and refuses any compromising relationships 
            that might tend to water down her distinct witness. However, 
            Adventists wish to be "conscientious cooperators." The ecumenical 
            movement as an agency of cooperation has acceptable aspects; as an 
            agency for organic unity of churches, it is much more suspect.</P>
            <P><B><I>Relationships With Other Religious Bodies</I></B></P>
            <P>Back in 1926, long before ecumenism was in vogue, the General 
            Conference Executive Committee adopted an important statement that 
            is now a part of the <I>General Conference Working Policy</I> (O 
            75). This declaration has significant ecumenical implications. The 
            concern of the statement was for the mission field and relationships 
            with other "missionary societies." However, the statement has now 
            been broadened to deal with other "religious organizations" in 
            general. It affirms that Seventh-day Adventists "recognize every 
            agency that lifts up Christ before men as a part of the divine plan 
            for the evangelization of the world, and . . . hold in high esteem 
            the Christian men and women in other communions who are engaged in 
            winning souls to Christ." In the church's dealings with other 
            churches, "Christian courtesy, friendliness, and fairness" are to 
            prevail. Some practical suggestions are made in order to avoid 
            misunderstandings and occasion for friction. The statement makes it 
            very clear, however, that the "Seventh-day Adventist people" have 
            received the special "burden" to emphasize the Second Coming as an 
            event "even at the door," preparing "the way of the Lord as revealed 
            in Holy Scripture." This divine "commission" makes it, therefore, 
            impossible for Adventists to restrict their witness "to any limited 
            area" and impels them to call the gospel "to the attention of all 
            peoples everywhere."</P></DIV><BR clear=all>
            <DIV>
            <P>In 1980 the General Conference set up a Council on Interchurch 
            Relations in order to give overall guidance and supervision to the 
            church's relations with other religious bodies. This council has 
            from time to time authorized conversations with other religious 
            organizations where it was felt this could prove helpful.</P>
            <P>Adventist leaders should be known as bridge builders. This is not 
            an easy task. It is much simpler to blow up ecclesiastical bridges 
            and serve as irresponsible "Christian commandos." Ellen White has 
            said: "It requires much wisdom to reach ministers and men of 
            influence. <I>Evangelism</I>, p. 562. Adventists have not been 
            called to live in a walled-in ghetto, talking only to themselves, 
            publishing mainly for themselves, showing a sectarian spirit of 
            isolationism. It is, of course, more comfortable and secure to live 
            in a Seventh-day Adventist fortress, with the communication 
            drawbridges all drawn up. In this setting one ventures from time to 
            time into the neighborhood for a quick evangelistic campaign, 
            capturing as many "prisoners" as possible, and then disappearing 
            with them back into the fortress. Ellen White did not believe in the 
            isolationist mentality: "Our ministers should seek to come near to 
            the ministers of other denominations. Pray for and with these men, 
            for whom Christ is interceding. A solemn responsibility is theirs. 
            As Christ's messengers we should manifest a deep, earnest interest 
            in these shepherds of the flock.<I>Testimonies</I>, vol. 6, p. 
            78.</P>
            <P><B><I>Usefulness of Observer Relationships</I></B></P>
            <P>Experience has taught that the best relationship to the various 
            councils of churches (national, regional, world) is that of 
            <I>observer-consultant</I> status. This helps the church to keep 
            informed and to understand trends and developments. It helps to know 
            Christian thinkers and leaders. Adventists are provided the 
            opportunity to exert a presence and make the church's viewpoint 
            known. Membership is not advisable. Those ecumenical organizations 
            are usually not "neutral." They often have quite specific goals and 
            policies and play sociopolitical advocacy roles. There would be 
            little point in being halfhearted members (at best) or pro forma 
            members (as many member churches are) or often in opposition (as 
            inevitably would be the case).</P>
            <P>On local levels, dealing with more practical and less theological 
            issues, one could envision some forms of Seventh-day Adventist 
            membership, with caution, however. We are thinking of such organized 
            relationships as ministerial associations/fraternals, local church 
            organizations, Bible study groups, specific groups or networks to 
            study community needs and help solve local problems. Adventists must 
            not be perceived as simply opting out of any Christian 
            responsibility for the local community.</P>
            <P>In recent years, Adventist leaders and theologians have had 
            opportunities for dialogue with other church representatives. These 
            experiences have been beneficial. Mutual respect has been 
            engendered. Worn-out stereotypes and inaccurate and untrue doctrinal 
            perceptions have been removed. Prejudices have been unceremoniously 
            laid to rest. Theological tools and understandings have been 
            sharpened. New dimensions have been recognized and new vistas of 
            outreach opened up. First of all, however, their faith in the Advent 
            message has been enhanced. There is no reason for Adventists to have 
            an inferiority complex. It is a wonderful privilege to be a 
            Seventh-day Adventist and to know that the theological and 
            organizational foundation of the church are sure and secure.</P>

            <DIV>
            <P>Adventists are heralds of the only true and lasting 
            <I>oikoumene</I>. In Hebrews reference is made to "the world [Greek: 
            <I>oikoumene</I>] to come" (chap. 2:5, N.E.B.), the coming universal 
            kingdom of God. In the final analysis, it is this "ecumenism" 
            Adventists are working for. Every other ecumenical movement is 
            ephemeral. In the meantime, it is a Christian duty to "concentrate 
            on being completely devoted to Christ" in one's heart. "Be ready at 
            any time to give a quiet and reverent answer to any man who wants a 
            reason for the hope that you have within you. Make sure that your 
            conscience is perfectly clear" (1 Peter 3:15, 16, Phillips).</P>
