      a cow? <B>Please be concerned </B>if the baby starts mooing. The low

        <P align=left><I>We know that Wm. Miller became a Mason in 1853, five 
        years before EGW pronounced him coming forth in the resurrection. This 
        is important becasue EGW made it clear those that belonged to the Masons 
        would lose their souls. Why did God tell Ellen that Miller would be 
        saved and then give her another vision that those belonging to Masons 
        would lose their souls? Any rational person can see EGW never received 
        visions from God.</I></P>
        <P align=left>In 1853, Sylvester&nbsp; Bliss noted in his <I>Memoirs of 
        William Miller, pp. 21, 22: </I>“It was here [Poultney, Vermont] that 
        Miller became a member of the Masonic fraternity, in which his 
        perseverance, if nothing else, was manifested; for he advanced to the 
        highest degree which the lodges in the country, or in any in that 
        region, could confer.” </P>
        <P class=MsoFooter><I>There is no doubt that Mrs. White took every 
        opportunity to degrade men who became Freemasons.&nbsp; Read the words 
        she wrote regarding Brother Faulkhead:</I> “The Lord also revealed to me 
        Brother Faulkhead's connection with the <B>FreeMasons</B>, and I plainly 
        stated that <B><I>unless he severed every tie that bound him to these 
        associations he would lose his soul.</I></B><I> Selected Messages,

        <P align=left><I>Now which is it, will Wm. Miller will be resurrected 
        with the saints or he will lose his soul because he was a Mason?
