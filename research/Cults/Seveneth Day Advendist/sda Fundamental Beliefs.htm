            the Bible as their only creed and hold certain fundamental beliefs 
            to be the teaching of the Holy Scriptures. These beliefs, as set 
            forth here, constitute the church's understanding and expression of 
            the teaching of Scripture. Revision of these statements may be 
            expected at a General Conference session when the church is led by 
            the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth or finds 
            better language in which to express the teachings of God's Holy 
            Word. 
            <P><STRONG><BR>1. Holy Scriptures:<BR></STRONG>The Holy Scriptures, 
            Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine 
            inspiration through holy men of God who spoke and wrote as they were 
            moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to man the 
            knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the 
            infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of 
            character, the test of experience, the authoritative revealer of 
            doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history. (2 
            Peter 1:20, 21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 
            8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; Heb. 4:12.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>2. Trinity:<BR></STRONG>There is one God: Father, Son, 
            and Holy Spirit, a unity of three co-eternal Persons. God is 
            immortal, all-powerful, all-knowing, above all, and ever present. He 
            is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through His 
            self-revelation. He is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and 
            service by the whole creation. (Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 
            13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2; 1 Tim. 1:17; Rev. 14:7.)<BR></P>
            <P><STRONG>3. Father:</STRONG> <BR>God the eternal Father is the 
            Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign of all creation. He is 
            just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding 
            in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers 
            exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also revelations of the 
            Father. (Gen. 1:1; Rev. 4:11; 1 Cor. 15:28; John 3:16; 1 John 4:8; 1 
            Tim. 1:17; Ex. 34:6, 7; John 14:9.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>4. Son: </STRONG><BR>God the eternal Son became incarnate 
            in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character 
            of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and 
            the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly man, 
            Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of 
            the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation as a human 
            being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. 
            By His miracles He manifested God's power and was attested as God's 
            promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for 
            our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to 
            minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again 
            in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration 
            of all things. (John 1:1-3, 14; Col. 1:15-19; John 10:30; 14:9; Rom. 
            6:23; 2 Cor. 5:17-19; John 5:22; Luke 1:35; Phil. 2:5-11; Heb. 
            2:9-18; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4; Heb. 8:1, 2; John 14:1-3.) </P>
            <P><STRONG>5. Holy Spirit:</STRONG> <BR>God the eternal Spirit was 
            active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and 
            redemption. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ's 
            life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who 
            respond He renews and transforms into the image of God. Sent by the 
            Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends 
            spiritual gifts to the church, empowers it to bear witness to 
            Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all truth. 
            (Gen. 1:1, 2; Luke 1:35; 4:18; Acts 10:38; 2 Peter 1:21; 2 Cor. 
            3:18; Eph. 4:11, 12; Acts 1:8; John 14:16-18, 26; 15:26, 27; 
            16:7-13.) </P>
            <P><STRONG>6. Creation</STRONG>: <BR>God is Creator of all things, 
            and has revealed in Scripture the authentic account of His creative 
            activity. In six days the Lord made "the heaven and the earth" and 
            all living things upon the earth, and rested on the seventh day of 
            that first week. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual 
            memorial of His completed creative work. The first man and woman 
            were made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, 
            given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to 
            care for it. When the world was finished it was ``very good,'' 
            declaring the glory of God. (Gen. 1; 2; Ex. 20:8-11; Ps. 19:1-6; 
            33:6, 9; 104; Heb. 11:3.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>7. Nature of Man</STRONG>: <BR>Man and woman were made in 
            the image of God with individuality, the power and freedom to think 
            and to do. Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity 
            of body, mind, and spirit, dependent upon God for life and breath 
            and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied 
            their dependence upon Him and fell from their high position under 
            God. The image of God in them was marred and they became subject to 
            death. Their descendants share this fallen nature and its 
            consequences. They are born with weaknesses and tendencies to evil. 
            But God in Christ reconciled the world to Himself and by His Spirit 
            restores in penitent mortals the image of their Maker. Created for 
            the glory of God, they are called to love Him and one another, and 
            to care for their environment. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7; Ps. 8:4-8; Acts 
            17:24-28; Gen. 3; Ps. 51:5; Rom. 5:12-17; 2 Cor. 5:19, 20; Ps. 
            51:10; 1 John 4:7, 8, 11, 20; Gen. 2:15.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>8. Great Controversy</STRONG>: <BR>All humanity is now 
            involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding 
            the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the 
            universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, 
            endowed with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, 
            God's adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels. He 
            introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam 
            and Eve into sin. This human sin resulted in the distortion of the 
            image of God in humanity, the disordering of the created world, and 
            its eventual devastation at the time of the worldwide flood. 
            Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the 
            universal conflict, out of which the God of love will ultimately be 
            vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends 
            the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and sustain 
            them in the way of salvation. (Rev. 12:4-9; Isa. 14:12-14; Eze. 
            28:12-18; Gen. 3; Rom. 1:19-32; 5:12-21; 8:19-22; Gen. 6-8; 2 Peter 
            3:6; 1 Cor. 4:9; Heb. 1:14.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>9. Life, Death, and Resurrection of 
            Christ</STRONG>:<BR>In Christ's life of perfect obedience to God's 
            will, His suffering, death, and resurrection, God provided the only 
            means of atonement for human sin, so that those who by faith accept 
            this atonement may have eternal life, and the whole creation may 
            better understand the infinite and holy love of the Creator. This 
            perfect atonement vindicates the righteousness of God's law and the 
            graciousness of His character; for it both condemns our sin and 
            provides for our forgiveness. The death of Christ is substitutionary 
            and expiatory, reconciling and transforming. The resurrection of 
            Christ proclaims God's triumph over the forces of evil, and for 
            those who accept the atonement assures their final victory over sin 
            and death. It declares the Lordship of Jesus Christ, before whom 
            every knee in heaven and on earth will bow. (John 3:16; Isa. 53; 1 
            Peter 2:21, 22; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4, 20-22; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15, 19-21; Rom. 
            1:4; 3:25; 4:25; 8:3, 4; 1 John 2:2; 4:10; Col. 2:15; Phil. 
            2:6-11.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>10. Experience of Salvation</STRONG>: <BR>In infinite 
            love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, 
            so that in Him we might be made the righteousness of God. Led by the 
            Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of 
            our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Lord and Christ, 
            as Substitute and Example. This faith which receives salvation comes 
            through the divine power of the Word and is the gift of God's grace. 
            Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God's sons and 
            daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the 
            Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our 
            minds, writes God's law of love in our hearts, and we are given the 
            power to live a holy life. Abiding in Him we become partakers of the 
            divine nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the 
            judgment. (2 Cor. 5:17-21; John 3:16; Gal. 1:4; 4:4-7; Titus 3:3-7; 
            John 16:8; Gal. 3:13, 14; 1 Peter 2:21, 22; Rom. 10:17; Luke 17:5; 
            Mark 9:23, 24; Eph. 2:5-10; Rom. 3:21-26; Col. 1:13, 14; Rom. 
            8:14-17; Gal. 3:26; John 3:3-8; 1 Peter 1:23; Rom. 12:2; Heb.

            <P><STRONG>11. Growing in Christ:</STRONG><BR>By His death on the 
            cross Jesus triumphed over the forces of evil. He who subjugated the 
            demonic spirits during His earthly ministry has broken their power 
            and made certain their ultimate doom. Jesus' victory gives us 
            victory over the evil forces that still seek to control us, as we 
            walk with Him in peace, joy, and assurance of His love. Now the Holy 
            Spirit dwells within us and empowers us. Continually committed to 
            Jesus as our Saviour and Lord, we are set free from the burden of 
            our past deeds. No longer do we live in the darkness, fear of evil 
            powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of our former way of life. In 
            this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow into the likeness 
            of His character, communing with Him daily in prayer, feeding on His 
            Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His praises, 
            gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of 
            the Church. As we give ourselves in loving service to those around 
            us and in witnessing to His salvation, His constant presence with us 
            through the Spirit transforms every moment and every task into a 
            spiritual experience. (Ps 1:1, 2; 23:4; 77:11, 12; Col 1:13, 14; 
            2:6, 14, 15; Luke 10:17-20; Eph 5:19, 20; 6:12-18; 1 Thess 5:23; 2 
            Peter 2:9; 3:18; 2 Cor. 3:17, 18; Phil 3:7-14; 1 Thess 5:16-18; Matt 
            20:25-28; John 20:21; Gal 5:22-25; Rom 8:38, 39; 1 John 4:4; Heb 
            10:25.)</P><STRONG>12. Church</STRONG>: <BR>The church is the 
            community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. 
            In continuity with the people of God in Old Testament times, we are 
            called out from the world; and we join together for worship, for 
            fellowship, for instruction in the Word, for the celebration of the 
            Lord's Supper, for service to all mankind, and for the worldwide 
            proclamation of the gospel. The church derives its authority from 
            Christ, who is the incarnate Word, and from the Scriptures, which 
            are the written Word. The church is God's family; adopted by Him as 
            children, its members live on the basis of the new covenant. The 
            church is the body of Christ, a community of faith of which Christ 
            Himself is the Head. The church is the bride for whom Christ died 
            that He might sanctify and cleanse her. At His return in triumph, He 
            will present her to Himself a glorious church, the faithful of all 
            the ages, the purchase of His blood, not having spot or wrinkle, but 
            holy and without blemish. (Gen. 12:3; Acts 7:38; Eph. 4:11-15; 
            3:8-11; Matt. 28:19, 20; 16:13-20; 18:18; Eph. 2:19-22; 1:22, 23; 
            5:23-27; Col. 1:17, 18.) 
            <P><STRONG>13. Remnant and Its Mission</STRONG>: <BR>The universal 
            church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the 
            last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called 
            out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This 
            remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims 
            salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second 
            advent. This proclamation is symbolized by the three angels of 
            Revelation 14; it coincides with the work of judgment in heaven and 
            results in a work of repentance and reform on earth. Every believer 
            is called to have a personal part in this worldwide witness. (Rev. 
            12:17; 14:6-12; 18:1-4; 2 Cor. 5:10; Jude 3, 14; 1 Peter 1:16-19; 2 
            Peter 3:10-14; Rev. 21:1-14.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>14. Unity in the Body of Christ</STRONG>:<BR>The church 
            is one body with many members, called from every nation, kindred, 
            tongue, and people. In Christ we are a new creation; distinctions of 
            race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between 
            high and low, rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive 
            among us. We are all equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has bonded 
            us into one fellowship with Him and with one another; we are to 
            serve and be served without partiality or reservation. Through the 
            revelation of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures we share the same faith 
            and hope, and reach out in one witness to all. This unity has its 
            source in the oneness of the triune God, who has adopted us as His 
            children. (Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; Matt. 28:19, 20; Ps. 
            133:1; 2 Cor. 5:16, 17; Acts 17:26, 27; Gal. 3:27, 29; Col. 3:10-15; 
            Eph. 4:14-16; 4:1-6; John 17:20-23.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>15. Baptism</STRONG>:<BR>By baptism we confess our faith 
            in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our 
            death to sin and of our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we 
            acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are 
            received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union 
            with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the 
            Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an 
            affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It 
            follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their 
            teachings. (Rom. 6:1-6; Col. 2:12, 13; Acts 16:30-33; 22:16; 2:38; 
            Matt. 28:19, 20.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>16. Lord's Supper</STRONG>:<BR>The Lord's Supper is a 
            participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an 
            expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour. In this experience 
            of communion Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people. As 
            we partake, we joyfully proclaim the Lord's death until He comes 
            again. Preparation for the Supper includes self-examination, 
            repentance, and confession. The Master ordained the service of foot 
            washing to signify renewed cleansing, to express a willingness to 
            serve one another in Christlike humility, and to unite our hearts in 
            love. The communion service is open to all believing Christians. (1 
            Cor. 10:16, 17; 11:23-30; Matt. 26:17-30; Rev. 3:20; John 6:48-63; 
            13:1-17.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>17. Spiritual Gifts and Ministries</STRONG>:<BR>God 
            bestows upon all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts 
            which each member is to employ in loving ministry for the common 
            good of the church and of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy 
            Spirit, who apportions to each member as He wills, the gifts provide 
            all abilities and ministries needed by the church to fulfill its 
            divinely ordained functions. According to the Scriptures, these 
            gifts include such ministries as faith, healing, prophecy, 
            proclamation, teaching, administration, reconciliation, compassion, 
            and self-sacrificing service and charity for the help and 
            encouragement of people. Some members are called of God and endowed 
            by the Spirit for functions recognized by the church in pastoral, 
            evangelistic, apostolic, and teaching ministries particularly needed 
            to equip the members for service, to build up the church to 
            spiritual maturity, and to foster unity of the faith and knowledge 
            of God. When members employ these spiritual gifts as faithful 
            stewards of God's varied grace, the church is protected from the 
            destructive influence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that is 
            from God, and is built up in faith and love. (Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 
            12:9-11, 27, 28; Eph. 4:8, 11-16; Acts 6:1-7; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 1 Peter 
            4:10, 11.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>18. The Gift of Prophecy</STRONG>:<BR>One of the gifts of 
            the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the 
            remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen. G. White 
            . As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and 
            authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, 
            guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the 
            Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be 
            tested. (Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 
            19:10.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>19. Law of God</STRONG>: <BR>The great principles of 
            God's law are embodied in the Ten Commandments and exemplified in 
            the life of Christ. They express God's love, will, and purposes 
            concerning human conduct and relationships and are binding upon all 
            people in every age. These precepts are the basis of God's covenant 
            with His people and the standard in God's judgment. Through the 
            agency of the Holy Spirit they point out sin and awaken a sense of 
            need for a Saviour. Salvation is all of grace and not of works, but 
            its fruitage is obedience to the Commandments. This obedience 
            develops Christian character and results in a sense of well-being. 
            It is an evidence of our love for the Lord and our concern for our 
            fellow men. The obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ 
            to transform lives, and therefore strengthens Christian witness. 
            (Ex. 20:1-17; Ps. 40:7, 8; Matt. 22:36-40; Deut. 28:1-14; Matt. 
            5:17-20; Heb. 8:8-10; John 15:7-10; Eph. 2:8-10; 1 John 5:3; Rom. 
            8:3, 4; Ps. 19:7-14.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>20. Sabbath</STRONG>:<BR>The beneficent Creator, after 
            the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted 
            the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth 
            commandment of God's unchangeable law requires the observance of 
            this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry 
            in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the 
            Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and 
            one another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of 
            our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of 
            our eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath is God's perpetual 
            sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful 
            observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to 
            sunset, is a celebration of God's creative and redemptive acts. 
            (Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Luke 4:16; Isa. 56:5, 6; 58:13, 14; Matt. 
            12:1-12; Ex. 31:13-17; Eze. 20:12, 20; Deut. 5:12-15; Heb. 4:1-11; 
            Lev. 23:32; Mark 1:32.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>21. Stewardship</STRONG>: <BR>We are God's stewards, 
            entrusted by Him with time and opportunities, abilities and 
            possessions, and the blessings of the earth and its resources. We 
            are responsible to Him for their proper use. We acknowledge God's 
            ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellow men, and by 
            returning tithes and giving offerings for the proclamation of His 
            gospel and the support and growth of His church. Stewardship is a 
            privilege given to us by God for nurture in love and the victory 
            over selfishness and covetousness. The steward rejoices in the 
            blessings that come to others as a result of his faithfulness. (Gen. 
            1:26-28; 2:15; 1 Chron. 29:14; Haggai 1:3-11; Mal. 3:8-12; 1 Cor. 
            9:9-14; Matt. 23:23; 2 Cor. 8:1-15; Rom. 15:26, 27.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>22. Christian Behavior</STRONG>: <BR>We are called to be 
            a godly people who think, feel, and act in harmony with the 
            principles of heaven. For the Spirit to recreate in us the character 
            of our Lord we involve ourselves only in those things which will 
            produce Christlike purity, health, and joy in our lives. This means 
            that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest 
            standards of Christian taste and beauty. While recognizing cultural 
            differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting 
            those whose true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but in 
            the imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also 
            means that because our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we 
            are to care for them intelligently. Along with adequate exercise and 
            rest, we are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain 
            from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures. Since alcoholic 
            beverages, tobacco, and the irresponsible use of drugs and narcotics 
            are harmful to our bodies, we are to abstain from them as well. 
            Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our thoughts and bodies 
            into the discipline of Christ, who desires our wholesomeness, joy, 
            and goodness. (Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 John 2:6; Eph. 5:1-21; Phil. 4:8; 2 
            Cor. 10:5; 6:14-7:1; 1 Peter 3:1-4; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31; Lev. 
            11:1-47; 3 John 2.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>23. Marriage and the Family</STRONG>:<BR>Marriage was 
            divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong 
            union between a man and a woman in loving companionship. For the 
            Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, 
            and should be entered into only between partners who share a common 
            faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the 
            fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, 
            closeness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His 
            church. Regarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces 
            a spouse, except for fornication, and marries another, commits 
            adultery. Although some family relationships may fall short of the 
            ideal, marriage partners who fully commit themselves to each other 
            in Christ may achieve loving unity through the guidance of the 
            Spirit and the nurture of the church. God blesses the family and 
            intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete 
            maturity. Parents are to bring up their children to love and obey 
            the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them 
            that Christ is a loving disciplinarian, ever tender and caring, who 
            wants them to become members of His body, the family of God. 
            Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks of the final 
            gospel message. (Gen. 2:18-25; Matt. 19:3-9; John 2:1-11; 2 Cor. 
            6:14; Eph. 5:21-33; Matt. 5:31, 32; Mark 10:11, 12; Luke 16:18; 1 
            Cor. 7:10, 11; Ex. 20:12; Eph. 6:1-4; Deut. 6:5-9; Prov. 22:6; Mal. 
            4:5, 6.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>24. Christ's Ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary</STRONG>: 
            <BR>There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle which the 
            Lord set up and not man. In it Christ ministers on our behalf, 
            making available to believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice 
            offered once for all on the cross. He was inaugurated as our great 
            High Priest and began His intercessory ministry at the time of His 
            ascension. In 1844, at the end of the prophetic period of 2300 days, 
            He entered the second and last phase of His atoning ministry. It is 
            a work of investigative judgment which is part of the ultimate 
            disposition of all sin, typified by the cleansing of the ancient 
            Hebrew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In that typical service 
            the sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animal sacrifices, but 
            the heavenly things are purified with the perfect sacrifice of the 
            blood of Jesus. The investigative judgment reveals to heavenly 
            intelligences who among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, 
            in Him, are deemed worthy to have part in the first resurrection. It 
            also makes manifest who among the living are abiding in Christ, 
            keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and in Him, 
            therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. 
            This judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving those who 
            believe in Jesus. It declares that those who have remained loyal to 
            God shall receive the kingdom. The completion of this ministry of 
            Christ will mark the close of human probation before the Second 
            Advent. (Heb. 8:1-5; 4:14-16; 9:11-28; 10:19-22; 1:3; 2:16, 17; Dan. 
            7:9-27; 8:13, 14; 9:24-27; Num. 14:34; Eze. 4:6; Lev. 16; Rev. 14:6, 
            7; 20:12; 14:12; 22:12.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>25. Second Coming of Christ</STRONG>:<BR>The second 
            coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the grand climax 
            of the gospel. The Saviour's coming will be literal, personal, 
            visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be 
            resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be 
            glorified and taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. The 
            almost complete fulfillment of most lines of prophecy, together with 
            the present condition of the world, indicates that Christ's coming 
            is imminent. The time of that event has not been revealed, and we 
            are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times. (Titus 2:13; Heb. 
            9:28; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11; Matt. 24:14; Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:43, 
            44; 1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 2 Thess. 1:7-10; 2:8; Rev. 
            14:14-20; 19:11-21; Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; 1 
            Thess. 5:1-6.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>26. Death and Resurrection</STRONG>:<BR>The wages of sin 
            is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant eternal life to 
            His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for all 
            people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected 
            righteous and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up 
            to meet their Lord. The second resurrection, the resurrection of the 
            unrighteous, will take place a thousand years later. (Rom. 6:23; 1 
            Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 
            1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>27. Millennium and the End of Sin</STRONG>:<BR>The 
            millennium is the thousand-year reign of Christ with His saints in 
            heaven between the first and second resurrections. During this time 
            the wicked dead will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, 
            without living human inhabitants, but occupied by Satan and his 
            angels. At its close Christ with His saints and the Holy City will 
            descend from heaven to earth. The unrighteous dead will then be 
            resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will surround the city; 
            but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. The 
            universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever. (Rev. 20; 1 
            Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 
            19.)</P>
            <P><STRONG>28. New Earth</STRONG>: <BR>On the new earth, in which 
            righteousness dwells, God will provide an eternal home for the 
            redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, love, joy, 
            and learning in His presence. For here God Himself will dwell with 
            His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. The great 
            controversy will be ended, and sin will be no more. All things, 
            animate and inanimate, will declare that God is love; and He shall 
            reign forever. Amen. (2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; 
            Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.) </P><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><IMG
