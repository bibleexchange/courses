            width=46 align=left border=0>lthough the exact word, "rapture," 
            isn't in the Bible, millions of prophecy-minded Christians have 
            nevertheless been taught that soon God's Church will disappear from 
            Planet Earth without a trace. Headlines are predicted to read: 
            "Multitudes Missing, Chaos Sweeps Globe!" "All Children Have 
            Disappeared!" "Massive Traffic Snarls Due to Evaporated Drivers!" 
            "Planes Crash, Trains Wreck, as Pilots and Engineers Vanish!" 
            Perhaps you've seen bumper stickers reading: "In case of Rapture, 
            this vehicle will be unmanned." 
            <P><IMG height=128 alt="" 
            src="sda Adventist Review Special to ADVENTIST REVIEW NEWS-ANALYSIS_files/author.jpg" 
            width=100 align=right border=0>In the last few years, the number-one 
            promoter of the rapture idea has been the New York Times bestselling 
            Left Behind series, coauthored by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. A 
            high-speed, 12-book sequence of novels about the end times, Left 
            Behind teaches that the return of Jesus Christ takes place in two 
            distinct phases. First, Jesus comes invisibly to remove His Church 
            before a seven-year tribulation during which the rest of humanity 
            must face the antichrist. This is the rapture. At the end of those 
            seven years, Jesus will again return visibly to deliver those who 
            became Christians during the tribulation--after being given a 
            "second chance" to be saved-and to pulverize the invading enemies of 
            Israel at Armageddon. This is the second coming. Thus it's rapture 
            first, then seven years with the antichrist, then the visible second 
            coming of Jesus Christ. 
            <P>These popular concepts--rapture, seven years of horror, future 
            antichrist--have also been taught in many apocalyptic Christian 
            films, such as A Thief in the Night, Image of the Beast, Tribulation 
            Force, The Omega Code, Left Behind: The Movie, and Megiddo. Because 
            the rapture teaching has been promoted so heavily in our society, 
            even among those outside the Church, a rumor has circulated that 
            some higher-ups at American Airlines want at least one non-Christian 
            pilot aboard each flight--just in case! 
            <P><IMG height=148 alt=""

            width=100 align=left vspace=3 border=0>The real question is: 
            Although "rapture" isn't a biblical word, is the doctrine there? If 
            not, could it be an end time delusion? Let's find out. 
            <P>First of all, the Bible certainly does teach the exciting truth 
            that Jesus Christ will return for His people. Our Lord Himself said, 
            "I will come again and receive you to Myself" (John 14:3). All 
            Christians should believe Christ's promise and long to meet Him on 
            that great day. 
            <P>But will He come invisibly? Will the Church disappear? Does the 
            Bible really teach vanishing Christians? Without a doubt, the most 
            quoted passage used to support the rapture concept is 1 
            Thessalonians 4:17. Lots of Christians know this verse by heart, and 
            it is cited in Left Behind: The Movie. There Paul wrote that true 
            believers will someday be "caught up… in the clouds to meet the Lord 
            in the air" (1 Thessalonians 4:17). But does "caught up" mean 
            disappear? Is Paul describing a silent return of Jesus Christ before 
            an apocalyptic seven-year tribulation? We don't need to guess. The 
            answer is in the context, and you don't need to have a four-year 
            degree to grasp the truth. 
            <P>Have you ever driven down a highway without realizing how fast 
            you were going, and then, when you finally looked down at your 
            speedometer, you thought to yourself, I'm going too fast and must 
            slow down!? This is what we need to do with 1 Thessalonians 4. We 
            must slow down and take a full look. 
            <P>Here is what Paul actually wrote: For the Lord Himself will 
            descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, 
            and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 
            Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with 
            them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall 
            always be with the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).

            width=220 align=right border=0>Rapture teachers interpret this event 
            as silent and secret, yet doesn't it seem rather loud and visible? 
            There is a shout, a voice, a trumpet. Have you ever heard of a 
            silent trumpet? The truth is, 1 Thessalonians 4:16 is one of the 
            noisiest verses in the Bible! Look carefully: Jesus Christ comes 
            down from Heaven shouting and blowing a trumpet. The dead rise. Then 
            true believers are "caught up." Honestly, do you see anything here 
            about vanishing Christians prior to the tribulation? Rapture 
            promoters interpret "caught up" to mean disappear because this view 
            fits their tightly-meshed prophetic system, yet it must be admitted 
            that the text doesn't say this. 
            <P>Two thousand years ago, at the end of His earthly life, Jesus 
            Christ was also "taken up," (Acts 1:9). This doesn't mean He 
            disappeared, leaving His clothes on earth. Instead, in full view of 
            His wondering disciples, "while they watched, He was taken up, and a 
            cloud received Him out of their sight" (Acts 1:9, emphasis added). 
            This event was highly visible. Luke said Jesus Christ was "taken 
            up," and then clouds are mentioned, just like Paul wrote about 
            believers being "caught up…in the clouds." 
            <P>Notice carefully the full context of Acts 1:9: Now when He had 
            spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a 
            cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked 
            steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by 
            them in white apparel, who also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you 
            stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from 
            you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you have seen Him go 
            into heaven" (Acts 1:9-11, emphasis added). 
            <P>Here we have holy angels--in the form of men in white 
            robes--explaining the simple truth about Jesus Christ's return. They 
            told the disciples that just as Jesus was literally and visibly 
            "taken up" into the clouds, even so would He "come in like manner as 
            [they had seen] Him go into heaven." Although these angels never 
            attended a seminary, there's no doubt they had their theology 
            straight. They taught no secret coming or vanishing Christians. 
            Everything will be highly visible, just like the ascension of Jesus 
            Christ. 
            <P>Let's return to 1 Thessalonians and take a look at the 
            thief-in-the-night idea: For the Lord Himself will descend from 
            heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the 
            trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who 
            are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the 
            clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with 
            the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words. But 
            concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need 
            that I should write to you. For you yourselves know perfectly that 
            the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. For when they 
            say, "Peace and safety!" then sudden destruction comes upon them, as 
            labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape (1 
            Thessalonians 4:16-5:3, emphasis added). 
            <P><IMG height=212 alt="" 
            src="sda Adventist Review Special to ADVENTIST REVIEW NEWS-ANALYSIS_files/story5-intext1.jpg" 
            width=220 align=left border=0>Here Paul compares the coming of Jesus 
            Christ to the arrival of a midnight thief. Rapture promoters 
            interpret this to mean Jesus will come like a silent thief to snatch 
            believers off this earth before seven years of chaos--then 
            driverless cars will crash, pilotless planes will collide, and 
            babies will be found missing from their cribs. The Christian film, A 
            Thief in the Night, which is similar to Left Behind: The Movie, 
            portrays this dramatically. Yet is this really what Paul is saying? 
            <P>Again, let's slow down and take a closer look at our biblical 
            speedometers. First of all, the day when Jesus comes as a thief is 
            clearly the very same day in which He descends with a shout and a 
            trumpet blast. Secondly, it comes as "a thief in the night" only 
            upon the unprepared. When it hits, "sudden destruction comes upon 
            them [the lost], as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they 
            shall not escape." 
            <P>Do you see what Paul is really saying? Jesus' coming as a "thief 
            in the night" does not mean He will come quietly and invisibly to 
            steal believers out of this world, as is taught in rapture movies 
            and New York Times bestselling books. Rather, it means He will come 
            unexpectedly, bringing "sudden destruction" upon the unsaved. Thus 
            it is not a secret coming, but only a sudden one. Will the 
            unprepared get a "second chance" to be saved during a subsequent 
            seven-year tribulation? Paul answered this question when he wrote, 
            "They shall not escape" (verse 3). 
            <P>Here's a simple summary of what 1 Thessalonians 4:16-5:3 really 
            says: <BR>
            <LI>Jesus Christ will literally descend from Heaven with a shout and 
            a trumpet blast. <BR>
            <LI>The dead in Christ will rise first and true believers will be 
            "caught up," just like Jesus Christ Himself was visibly "taken up" 
            into the sky almost 2,000 years ago. <BR>
            <LI>This cataclysmic "day of the Lord" will burst upon the 
            unprepared like the unexpected arrival of a midnight thief. <BR>
            <LI>"Sudden destruction" will overwhelm the lost, "and they shall 
            not escape." 
            <P>When taken literally, these words describe the visible second 
            coming of Jesus Christ, not a secret rapture. 
            <P>Immediately after his solemn prediction of Christ's return as a 
            midnight thief, Paul wrote to true believers: "But you, brethren, 
            are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a 
            thief. You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of 
            the night nor of darkness" (1 Thessalonians 5:4-5). 
            <P>Remember the Blackout of 2003? It left 50 million North Americans 
            in darkness because a massive system failure short-circuited our 
            electrical power grid. At least when it comes to 1 Thessalonians 
            4:16-5:3, we have just witnessed another system failure. The popular 
            doctrine of a silent, secret return of Jesus Christ and vanishing 
            Christians is just not there. 
            <P>Again, Paul wrote, "You are all sons of light and sons of the 
            day. We are not of the night nor of darkness" (1 Thessalonians 5:5). 

            <P>God wants us to avoid truth outages. 
            <P>He wants the lights on.
