      was using in her books. Ellen knew if word got out she was using secular 
      sources, people would no longer believe she was getting her material

      <P>. . . I have to some degree believed that Sr. White was a prophet of 
      God; but some things in connection with using matter from other writers 
      and the editorial relation that were out of harmony with my early school 
      training and the maxim's applicable to secular literature and uninspired 
      literature, started doubt and questioning as to <FONT color=#ff0000>why 
      this relation was not thoroughly acknowledged, and the sources of 
      quotation credited as in the authors of the world.</FONT></P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Sr White writes about quotations in the last 
      page of the preface of Great Controversy as follows: "The events which 
      have marked the progress of reform are matters of history. . . In some 
      cased where a historian has so grouped together events as to afford, in 
      brief, a comprehensive view of the subject, or has summarized details in a 
      convenient manner, his words have been quoted; but except in a few 
      instances no specific credit has been given, since they are not quoted for 
      the purpose of citing authority, but because his statements affords a 
      ready and forcible presentation of the subject.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><FONT color=#ff0000>This uncredited matter 
      and an unacknowledged editorial relation with some human frailties in Sr. 
      White, with dull spiritual perception and a distorted vision of 
      truth,</FONT> caused me to lose sight of the sacred character of the work, 
      and I lost to a great extent my realization that the work through Sr. 
      White was "the testimony of Jesus." <SPAN style="COLOR: red">I tried for 
      years to harmonize what seemed to me inconsistency in the work with a 
      worldly literary maxim that requires an author to acknowledge his editors 
      and to give credit to all works from which he quotes. In contending that 
      Sr. White was not open and honest about this matter, I supposed myself 
      standing for a principle of ordinary justice and literary honesty. . . 
      .<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>. . . . Three times I was dismissed from Sr White's work because of 
      relating my trouble, many times in honest effort to find some one to give 
      me a harmonious explanation of the tormenting perplexity. My sorrow and 
      anguish at the anguish it caused was not feigned, and yet, not 
      understanding the cause of my removal, I made confessions that did not 
      touch the point, because I was blinded to it, and though confessing that I 
      had in some way done harm to the work, I held to the position in my mind 
      that Sr. White should acknowledge her editors and every source from which 
      she obtained suggestion or expression . . . . . I rebelled in heart 
      against what I considered the taking of undue credit on the part of Sr. 
      White in receiving unqualified commendation for books or articles which 
      Marian Davis, myself and others had expended editorial work. My rebellion 
      on this point, together with poor health, finally led me to leave the work 
      in Australia . . . . .</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">. . . . Sr White wrote me a very sharp 
      testimony, declaring that she had been shown that I was an enemy to her 
      work, that I had misrepresented her and caused the ruin of my own 
      influence.</SPAN> In spite of this dreadful testimony, I persisted in 
      thinking that it was not the position I had taken or the words I had 
      spoken; but the spirit I had cherished that had caused the misgivings, and 
      thus far I confessed to Sr. White. When I was cut off from the work, shut 
      out of the papers, and looked upon as an enemy to the truth, I felt 
      terribly misjudged, and drew the sympathy of many by relating my trials 
      and disseminating my perplexities . . . . . . I have asked many persons to 
      explain the supposed inconsistencies in connection with this gift, and 
      have found but few who could give me any light. I am largely indebted to 
      Elders Irwin, Olson and Rupert, whose spiritual insight and kind words and 
      prayers have helped me in my time of need.</P>
      <P>. . . . . The individual work I will do as God opens it to my mind. 
      <SPAN style="COLOR: red">In the past I have confessed to brother Prescott 
      and others that I had misrepresented S. White, not because I was 
      convicted, but because Sr. White had said so, and because I was urged to 
      do so upon that ground whether I saw it or not.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>. . . I rejoice today in the "Testimony of Jesus" I thank God that he 
      has kept Sr. White from following my suppressed superior wisdom and 
      righteousness and has kept her from acknowledging editors or authors; but 
      has given to the people the unadulterated expression of God's mind. <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">Had she done as I wished her to do, the gift would have 
      been degraded to a common authorship, its importance lost, its authority 
      underminded and its blessing lost to the world. </SPAN>I have thought her 
      words very hard when she said that "Satanic influences" worked through me, 
      but I can see today that in the attack made through me, I have been the 
      deceived tool of the dragon who hates the commandments of God and the 
      Testimony of Jesus Christ.</P>
      <P>. . . . As for reconciliation with Sr. White it will come in God's own 
      time. I have prayed for the healing of the breach between us, and someday 
      the mists will all be cleared away . . . . . . For four years I have been 
      without the camp. I am reconciled to stay there and bear my reproach 
      patiently.</P>
