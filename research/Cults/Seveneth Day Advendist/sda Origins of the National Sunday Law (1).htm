  <P><IMG src="sda Origins of the National Sunday Law_files/miller.jpg" 
  align=right> In order to understand the origin of the National Sunday law, one 
  must go back to the turbulent 1840s. This was an era of unprecedented 
  religious controversy in the Northeastern United States. The controversy 
  centered around the date of Christ's return. It all began when a 
  farmer-turned-preacher named <A 
  href="http://www.ellenwhiteexposed.com/miller.htm">William Miller</A> set out 
  on a campaign to warn communities in his region that, according to his own 
  Biblical calculations, Christ's return was imminent. As Miller's popularity 
  grew, other end-time revivalist preachers jumped on the band-wagon to spread 
  the cry of alarm. Although Miller and his associates suffered a serious 
  setback when Christ failed to return as predicted in 1843, it was quickly 
  discovered that a "mistake" had been made in Miller's calculations. A new date 
  of October 22, 1844, was finally agreed upon by Miller's followers, and the 
  leaders of the movement went around to the local churches and communities 
  trying once again to stir people up with the warning of Christ's imminent 
  return. 
  <P>While most Christians and serious Bible students dismissed Miller as a 
  misguided fanatic, some were impressed by his so-called Biblical "proofs" and 
  they wanted to know if the Bible had indeed set a date for Christ's return. 
  Christians began to call upon Bible scholars to examine Miller's "proofs" to 
  determine if they were indeed accurate. Scholars familiar with Bible prophecy 
  and the original languages of the Bible examined Miller's 15 "proofs" and 
  found them to be fatally flawed. Scholars pointed to numerous unfulfilled 
  Biblical prophecies as proof that Christ's return was not yet imminent. They 
  explained how Miller was standing upon dangerous ground in ignoring Christ's 
  explicit instruction that no one knows the day of His return (Matthew 25:13). 
  [For more info on how Miller was refuted by Bible scholars, <A 
  href="http://www.ellenwhiteexposed.com/egw11.htm">click here</A>] 
  <P>Concerned pastors began warning their flocks of the deceptions and 
  falsehoods of Miller's teachings. As Christians became more widely aware of 
  the serious errors in Miller's teachings the churches began closing their 
  doors to him. Accusations began to fly between the two groups and antagonism 
  began developing. Millerites claimed that other Christians did not want the 
  Lord to return, while the other Christians derided the Millerites as deluded 
  fanatics. Some Millerites who were members of mainstream churches made such a 
  nuisance of themselves that their churches felt compelled to expel them from 
  their congregations, creating animosity on both sides. 
  <P>Millerites were scoffed at, lampooned, ridiculed, and ostracized. Hooligans 
  released greased pigs in their camp meeting crowds and collapsed tents on 
  them. As the awaited hour approached, the Millerites became increasingly 
  aggressive in their attacks on the churches and the clergy. Millerite Charles 
  Fitch did his part in raising the level of animosity by writing: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>If you are a Christian, come out of Babylon. If you intend 
    to be found a Christian when Christ appears, come out of Babylon, and come 
    out now...</B>"<SUP>1</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Although William Miller initially captured the attention of some Christians 
  in the early 1840s, by 1843 the movement had begun to crumble. As Bible 
  scholars exposed the errors in Miller's proofs the tide began to turn against 
  him and his fanatical teachings. Pastors were so successful in exposing the 
  flaws in Miller's teachings that the movement began losing momentum. Miller's 
  efforts to recruit new adherents to his doctrine were thus stymied and he and 
  his associates reacted angrily. They denounced the Christian churches as 
  "fallen Babylon," falsely accused them of not desiring Christ to return, and 
  they withdrew themselves from the Christian churches and began meeting in 
  homes and rented halls. Bitter animosity blossomed between the two groups with 
  each side deserving part of the blame for the ensuing hostility. 
  <P>As the date for Christ's return approached, many Millerites sold their 
  farms and businesses and invested their life's savings with Miller and his 
  associates to spread the message of Christ's soon return. By October 22, 1844, 
  the movement had managed to garner close to 50,000 followers, almost entirely 
  in the northeastern United States. As with all fanatical movements, this 
  movement appears to have held a special attraction for the uneducated, the 
  young, and those prone to follow after the latest religious excitement. 
  <P>When the October 22, 1844, date passed without event, Miller's followers 
  were severely disappointed. Many had suffered financial loss and ruin. Many 
  had sold their means of making a livelihood. Now they were poor, destitute, 
  and miserable. There were some who were so devastated that they committed 
  suicide. The movement disintegrated and Miller finally admitted he was in 
  error. His followers gradually began returning to their former churches. 
  However, there was a small group that refused to return to their former 
  churches for various reasons. Some were not ready to swallow their pride and 
  return to churches they had so recently condemned as being synagogues of 
  Satan. Some did not desire to face the censure and reprimands of their former 
  brethren. These people began forming their own churches which eventually 
  became known as the Adventist churches. 
  <P>The split between the "Adventists" and the "non-Adventists" would form the 
  foundation upon which the Sunday law teaching would later be built. After the 
  Disappointment, the "Adventists" needed an issue upon which they could 
  differentiate themselves from other Christians whom they referred to as 
  <I>Babylon</I>. It was here that Joseph Bates stepped in and made his mark in 
  Adventist history, developing a doctrine which would eventually lead to the 
  National Sunday Law teaching. 
  <P><IMG src="sda Origins of the National Sunday Law_files/bates.jpg" 
  align=right> 
  <H3><FONT face=arial color=#900000>Joseph Bates, father of the Sunday 
  Law</FONT></H3>
  <P>One small group of Adventists was led by sea captain Joseph Bates. Bates 
  felt burdened to understand the reason for the great disappointment of 1844. 
  So he began studying Bible prophecy. Having no formal training in the 
  principles of Biblical interpretation, Bates took an approach that differed 
  widely from traditional scholarly work. For example, Bates took non-prophetic 
  passages of the Old Testament and "discovered" end-time prophecies in those 
  passages. He also assumed that the Book of Revelation was unfolding in the 
  events of the Millerite movement. 
  <P>Bates learned the Sabbath doctrine from a tract written by a Millerite 
  preacher named Thomas M. Preble who is thought to have learned it from Rachel 
  Oakes, a Seventh Day Baptist. When Bates discovered that the true day of 
  worship was Saturday, not Sunday, he finally found what he believed to be a 
  credible reason for why Adventists had been separated from the other Christian 
  churches. They had been separated so that they could more readily adopt the 
  Sabbath teaching of the Seventh Day Baptists. 
  <P>
  <H3><FONT face=arial color=#900000>Joseph Bates and the Shut Door</FONT></H3>
  <P>By 1845, the Adventists began splintering off into separate groups, and one 
  of these groups became known as the "shut door Adventists." This group would 
  later develop into the Seventh-day Adventist church. Joseph Bates was a leader 
  among the "shut door Adventists." He believed that the door of salvation had 
  been shut on all those who rejected the 1844 teachings of William Miller. In 
  1847, Bates published a book in which he quotes Miller: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"We have done our work in warning sinners and trying to awake a 
    formal church. God in his providence has shut the door. We can only stir one 
    another up to be patient. Never since the days of the Apostles has there 
    been such a division line drawn, as was drawn about the 10th, or 23d day of 
    the 7th Jewish month. Since that time they say 'they have no confidence in 
    us.' We have now need of patience after we have done the will of God, that 
    we may receive the promise; for he says, 'Behold I come quickly, to reward 
    every one as his work shall be.'"<SUP>2</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Even though Miller 
  had earlier repudiated this belief, Bates continued to hold that there was a 
  division line drawn between the Adventists and non-Adventists. He believed 
  that the Adventists were the only ones who could be saved and the door of 
  salvation had been shut to the Christian churches who had rejected Miller. 
  Bates regarded the "nominal churches" as being part of Babylon: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"And last, the cry is made in the <B>Protestant churches</B>, 
    'Come out of her, my people.' What is now the response? Thousands on 
    thousands dissolve their connection, and out they come, under the full 
    conviction that this loud cry is to them, and the churches which they are 
    leaving <B>are fallen Babylon</B>, because they have rejected the message 
    which preceded this. 'The hour of his judgment is come.' Their houses which 
    they have closed against this second advent message, are left unto them 
    desolate. God has left them in their own confusion. ... The advent doctrine 
    was the last, and crowning test which God ever gave his people to come away 
    and separate themselves from all unrighteous unbelievers."<SUP>3</SUP> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>Bates' bitter animosity against the mainstream Protestant 
  churches is evident as he uses the derisive terms "desolate," "confusion," and 
  "unrighteous" to describe them. Amazingly, Bates decreed the Protestant 
  churches to be Babylon simply because they rejected a message that even the 
  originator of the message himself admitted was a falsehood! In essence, 
  <B>Bates was claiming the Protestant churches were lost because they had 
  rejected a false teaching!</B> 
  <P>Bates held to the belief that the labor of Christians for lost souls had 
  ended in 1844, and he made no personal effort to save lost souls: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Here then of course ended the 2300 days of the vision, because 
    there is to be a tarrying after. Don't forget this, neither. 'For at the 
    time appointed the end shall be.' <B>Here too ended our last work in warning 
    the world; and our labor ceased</B>. Why? Because the messages ceased, and 
    left us entirely destitute of labor. And there was silence in heaven for the 
    space of half an hour, a whole week or seven and a half days. Here we say 
    our glorious High Priest began the cleansing of the sanctuary, and 'received 
    his kingdom, dominion, and glory,' the 'New Jerusalem.'"<SUP>4</SUP> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>In 1847, when Bates wrote the book quoted above, he believed the 
  Adventist people were in the midst of a "seven day" period, which he taught 
  was a seven-year period during which God would "test" the Adventist 
  people--those who had been part of the 1844 Millerite movement. How did Bates 
  arrive at this seven-year period? From a non-prophetic passage in the book of 
  Leviticus. Here is how he describes it in his book: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The <B>seven spots of blood on the Golden Altar</B> and before 
    the mercy seat, I fully believe, <B>represent the duration</B> of the 
    judicial proceedings on the living saints in the Most Holy, all of which 
    time they will be in their affliction, even <B>seven years</B>; God by his 
    voice will deliver them, 'for it is the blood that maketh the atonement for 
    the soul' (Lev. 17:11). Then the number seven will finish the day of 
    atonement (not redemption)."<SUP>5</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Somehow, in Bates' mind, 
  those "seven spots of blood" on the altar became seven years. <B>It is 
  impossible to rationally explain how Bates came to this conclusion!</B> 
  Following in the footsteps of William Miller's questionable Bible scholarship, 
  Bates apparently had his own methods of interpreting the Bible which remain a 
  mystery to this day. 
  <P>According to Bates, over those seven years, from 1844 to 1851, God intended 
  to "test" the Adventists to determine which of them would accept the Seventh 
  Day Baptist's Sabbath teaching. Bates claimed: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"...this message was urged on God's people, to test their 
    sincerity and honesty in the whole word of God..."<SUP>6</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>At 
  the culmination of this seven-year period, in 1851, Christ would return to the 
  earth. Those who accepted the Sabbath would receive the "Seal of God" and 
  would be saved. Those Adventists who rejected the Sabbath would rejoin the 
  Sunday keeping churches and receive the "Mark of the Beast." Bates' teachings 
  on the Seal of God and Mark of the Beast would later become the foundation of 
  Seventh-day Adventist doctrine on end-time events. 
  <P>
  <H3><FONT face=arial color=#900000>Bates and the end of the world</FONT></H3>
  <P>While to most candid observers there was no evidence of the imminent end of 
  the world, Bates found evidence everywhere he looked. We must remember that 
  Bates assumed large portions of the book of Revelation were being fulfilled in 
  his day. Therefore, Bates tried to match current events to certain passages of 
  Bible prophecy. His efforts reveal how truly flawed was his understanding of 
  Bible prophecy. In every fire, in every storm, he saw another <I>sign of the 
  end</I> being fulfilled: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Here lies before me a pamphlet of 83 pages, entitled, <I>the 
    voice of God, or an account of the unparalleled Fires, Hurricanes, Floods, 
    and Earthquakes, beginning with 1845; also Pestilence, Famine, and Crime</I> 
    - compiled by Thomas M. Preble. Since this work was issued at the beginning 
    of this year, the periodicals of foreign countries and those of our own 
    boasted happy Republic, show that these calamities among men are still 
    increasing to a fearful extent. The inhabitants of many nations are at their 
    wits' end."<SUP>7</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Bates warned that the third woe of 
  Revelation was falling upon the world: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"...and tell me if you can what all these calamities mean. If it 
    is not the third wo [sic] that is rumbling through the nations of the earth, 
    and hastening greatly to form its focal centre for 'such a time of trouble 
    as never was since there was a nation.'"<SUP>8</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Bates warns 
  of fires... 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The entire loss by fires of the last two years amounts to about 
    65 millions of dollars, about 45 millions in this country. In 1845, about 31 
    millions of dollars' worth was destroyed in something like 38 cities and 
    towns; in a majority of cases the heart, or business part, was destroyed; 
    besides the multitude of small fires under twenty-five thousand dollars, and 
    also thousands of acres of woodland, probably swelling the amount to about 
    forty millions of dollars, and according to numerous accounts, in a majority 
    of instances they raged beyond the control of man."<SUP>9</SUP> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>...and floods... 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Sea and waves roaring. - The tremendous gales and storms of 
    1845, and many in '46, certainly have not been surpassed in past ages. ... 
    Floods and inundations in 1845-6 - Since the days of Noah I believe we have 
    no such records."<SUP>10</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>...and, of course, earthquakes... 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Earthquakes. - I will not stop here to enumerate. The 
    <I>Scientific American</I> records upwards of fifty in 1846."<SUP>11</SUP> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>...and pestilences... 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Pestilence. - The Asiatic cholera, a dreadful pestilence, God's 
    flying messenger with a drawn sword in his hand..."<SUP>12</SUP> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>As for famines, Bates turned to the apocryphal book of Esdras 
  which he apparently believed to be inspired... 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Esdras says, 'the seed shall fail through blasting and hail.' 
    xv. same prophet says, 'provision shall be cheap, (they have been) and 
    suddenly the sown places appear unsown, ( seed rotted under the clods,) the 
    full storehouses suddenly be found empty.' Here is the fulfillment: hundreds 
    on hundreds of our ships almost constantly leaving our shores, laden with 
    provisions from the store-houses, to supply the famine in Europe. If 
    accounts respecting the famine be true, they will continue to go until our 
    store-houses be emptied. This is neither fancy nor fable, but history and 
    <B>the word of the Lord our God</B>. The <B>prophecy of Esdras</B> begins to 
    search and burn like fire."<SUP>13</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>After reading these 
  "fulfillments" of prophecy, it quickly becomes evident that Bates was wresting 
  the Scriptures, trying to make the "square pegs" of current events fit into 
  the "round holes" of Bible prophecy. There is no hiding the fact that <B>his 
  prophetic interpretations were based more upon his own personal theories about 
  Christ's imminent return than upon actual facts</B>. Furthermore, it calls 
  into question Bates' entire prophetic theology. Here are some other examples 
  of Bates' unusual teachings on prophecy, all of which were rejected by later 
  generations of Seventh-day Adventists: 
  <P>Bates claimed the third angel's message completed in the fall of 1844: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I ask you to look back to the summer and fall of 1844, where 
    you see the fulfillment of this 3d angel's message in a most wonderful and 
    striking manner in almost every town and city throughout New 
    England."<SUP>14</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>In answering the question of why the 1844 
  movement [3rd angel's message] was largely restricted to the United States 
  instead of the whole world, Bates contends that only the first angel's message 
  went into all the world: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"If you will look at the 14, ch. again, you will see that it was 
    the first messenger only that sent his message to every nation, kindred, 
    tongue and people."<SUP>15</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Bates claimed that Christ 
  received His kingdom in 1844: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Here then is positive corroborated proof of Christ's receiving 
    his dominion and glory and kingdom or as in the parable of the ten virgins 
    the Bridegroom came to the marriage under the sounding of the seventh 
    trumpet, and after the third angel's message, and before six of the seven 
    plagues are poured out."<SUP>16</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Most astounding of all, 
  Bates claimed the Sabbath could not be kept prior to 1844... 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Says the reader, why did not the people 'keep the commandments 
    of God,' as in the text, before the fall of 1844? Because the message had 
    not been presented, nor could not be until the third angel's message (9th to 
    11th v.) had made this separation, for they could not keep the fourth 
    commandment, the seventh day Sabbath, while they were united with the 
    nominal church, (Babylon,) hence the separation."<SUP>17</SUP> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>Bates' interpretation of the three angels' messages (Rev. 14) 
  forces him to the conclusion that the keepers of the commandments of God did 
  not exist before 1844. This ironic conclusion ignores the fact that Bates 
  himself learned about the Sabbath from the Seventh Day Baptists, a large group 
  of Christian Sabbath-keepers who were presenting the "message" of the Sabbath 
  to Sunday-keeping Christians for over 100 years! 
  <P>
  <H3><FONT face=arial color=#900000>Joseph Bates: Can you trust this man's 
  prophetic theories?</FONT></H3>
  <P>Let us review what we know about Joseph Bates and Bible prophecy. 
  <OL>
    <LI>He claimed that 7 drops of blood on the alter in Leviticus 17 indicated 
    that Adventists were going to go through 7 years of testing on the Sabbath 
    truth. At the conclusion of that 7 years, in 1851, Christ would return to 
    take home those Adventists who had the Seal of God (Sabbath observance).
    <P></P>
    <LI>He claimed that minor disasters that occurred in the late 1840s were 
    signs of the imminent end of the world.
    <P></P>
    <LI>He claimed the gospel message for the lost ended in 1844. </LI></OL>Can 
  you see a pattern beginning to emerge? It is a pattern of prophetic 
  miscalculation, bungling, distortion, and outright error. It is a pattern of a 
  man who was self-deceived about the return of Christ and the meaning of Bible 
  prophecy. The ultimate example of Bates' delusion is found in his claim that 
  the gospel message itself ended in 1844! This quote alone should be sufficient 
  evidence to any Christian that this man was not guided by the Spirit of God in 
  his teachings: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Now let this door be shut, and the preaching of this gospel 
    will have no effect. This is just what we say is the fact. <B>The gospel 
    message ended at the appointed time with the closing of the 2,300 days; and 
    almost every honest believer that is watching the signs of the times will 
    admit it</B>."<SUP>18</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE><IMG

  <B><FONT face=arial color=#d00000>How can we possibly trust a man who 
  developed such warped and perverted understandings of Bible prophecy? Yet, 
  Bates' teachings became the foundation upon which the National Sunday Law 
  would later develop!</B></FONT> Any Adventist will recognize that Bates' 
  teachings about Babylon, the Sabbath, the Seal of God, the Mark of the Beast, 
  and the "remnant" are the same prophetic teachings that form the core of 
  Seventh-day Adventist Bible prophecy.<SUP>19</SUP> Bates laid the foundation 
  for the National Sunday Law teaching and later Adventists have built upon his 
  foundation. 
  <P>Naturally, these bizarre teachings generated some resistance from the 
  Christian churches in the 1840s. This resistance was interpreted by 
  Sabbath-keeping Adventists as persecution and yet further evidence that the 
  Christian denominations were fallen and lost. Bates' theories were easily shot 
  to pieces by Biblical scholars, and the Sabbath-keeping Adventists gained few 
  adherents. Bates needed some help to keep his sinking theories afloat and he 
  soon found the help he needed in the young and impressionable prophetess Ellen 
  G. White. <IMG src="sda Origins of the National Sunday Law_files/egwsun.jpg" 
  align=right> 
  <P>
  <H3><FONT face=arial color=#900000>Bates finds a friend</FONT></H3>
  <P>Who was Ellen White? At the time they met, she was a frail 
  nineteen-year-old girl who had been a devoted follower of William Miller. She 
  had serious health problems resulting from a childhood <A 
  href="http://www.ellenwhiteexposed.com/headinjury.htm">brain injury</A>. 
  Later, she claimed to be receiving visions from God although <A 
  href="http://www.ellenwhiteexposed.com/egw18.htm">many who witnessed her 
  visions felt they were more the product of her ill health than 
  inspiration</A>. Sister White and her family were among the fanatics who had 
  been ejected from a Methodist church in September of 1843 for causing 
  disturbances during church services. According to the Methodist Church... 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The reason for their dismissal was <B>not</B> that they 
    preached the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is a tenant of our 
    orthodox faith which is confirmed from the Articles of Religion 1784.Their 
    dismissal was occasioned by their breach of discipline in proclaiming the 
    views of William Miller's time-setting. …<B>after much quiet counsel to 
    refrain from their disruptive behavior in church meetings</B> the members of 
    Chestnut Street Church took what they believed to be their only recourse, to 
    dismiss the Harmon Family."<SUP>20</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Ellen White's ejection 
  from the Methodist church and subsequent events led her to believe the same 
  thing Bates believed: The Protestant churches were Babylon. Mrs. White lost no 
  opportunity to blast the Christian preachers who had opposed Miller's 
  time-setting:<BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Many shepherds of the flock, who professed to love Jesus, said 
    that they had no opposition to the preaching of Christ's coming, but they 
    objected to the definite time. God's all-seeing eye read their hearts. They 
    <B>did not love Jesus</B> near. They knew that their <B>unchristian 
    lives</B> would not stand the test, for they were <B>not walking in the 
    humble path</B> marked out by Him."<SUP>21</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>It was not long 
  before Ellen White and Joseph Bates had linked up in their battle against the 
  hated Sunday-keeping churches. Although Biblical evidence for Bates' teachings 
  was severely lacking, the deficiency of inspiration was soon supplied by 
  Sister White, who began having "visions" supporting the theories Bates had 
  fabricated. Although the "visions" were merely repetitions of what Bates had 
  already been promulgating, this put the prophetic seal of approval on his 
  teachings. Bates, in turn, accepted Ellen White as a prophet, which gave the 
  Whites a much-needed boost in their own efforts to establish Sister White's 
  claim to be the Spirit of Prophecy of the book of Revelation. 
  <P>By 1850, Bates, Ellen White, and her husband James White had managed to 
  convince several hundred followers that Bates' teaching about the Sabbath was 
  God's last message to the world. However, the group fell on hard times in 
  1851, when Christ failed to materialize as Bates had promised. As the date 
  approached and it became increasingly obvious Christ was not coming, the 
  Whites began distancing themselves from Bates. When 1851 passed without event, 
  the Bates and the Whites suffered a humiliating defeat. The Adventists began 
  turning against Bates and the Whites. They questioned how a prophet of God 
  could not have foreseen how Bates was wrong about the 1851 date. The Whites, 
  disappointed that many of their followers had turned against them, decided to 
  put some distance between Bates and themselves, and so they moved to the 
  Midwest where they were not so well known. 
  <P>While they discarded Bates' teachings about the 7-year period of testing, 
  they continued preaching that the Sabbath was the <B>final test</B> for 
  mankind. Mrs. White wrote, 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The light of the Sabbath was seen, and the people of God were 
    tested, as the children of Israel were tested anciently, to see if they 
    would keep God's law."<SUP>22</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>As Bates faded into the 
  background, the Whites took charge of the work and managed to gather a small 
  following and formed the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1863. 
  <P>The Seventh-day Adventists soon gained a reputation among other Christians. 
  They became known for their efforts to recruit members from out of other 
  Christian denominations. They were also known for referring to Catholicism as 
  <I>Babylon</I>, and Protestants as <I>Apostate Protestantism</I>. The Whites 
  were still convinced all other Christian churches were apostate because they 
  had rejected Miller's fanatical time-setting movement. Needless to say, the 
  Adventists' hostility towards other Christian denominations generated plenty 
  of animosity between the groups. Ellen White describes her displeasure with 
  the "fallen" Christian denominations:<BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I saw that the nominal churches have fallen; that coldness and 
    death reign in their midst."<SUP>23</SUP> 
    <P>"The sins of the popular churches are whitewashed over. Many of the 
    members indulge in the grossest vices and are steeped in iniquity. Babylon 
    is fallen and has become the cage of every foul and hateful bird! The most 
    revolting sins of the age find shelter beneath the cloak of 
    Christianity."<SUP>24</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>Ellen White and her angel were so 
  upset with Sunday-keeping Christians that they were prepared to pour out the 
  wrath of God upon them: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>I saw</B> that since Jesus left the holy place of the 
    heavenly sanctuary and entered within the second veil, the churches have 
    been filling up with every unclean and hateful bird. I saw great iniquity 
    and vileness in the churches; yet their members profess to be Christians. 
    Their profession, their prayers, and their exhortations are an abomination 
    in the sight of God. Said the angel, "God will not smell in their 
    assemblies. Selfishness, fraud, and deceit are practiced by them without the 
    reprovings of conscience. And over all these evil traits they throw the 
    cloak of religion." I was shown the pride of the nominal churches. God is 
    not in their thoughts; their carnal minds dwell upon themselves; they 
    decorate their poor mortal bodies, and then look upon themselves with 
    satisfaction and pleasure. Jesus and the angels look upon them in anger. 
    Said the angel, "Their sins and pride have reached unto heaven. Their 
    portion is prepared. Justice and judgment have slumbered long, but will soon 
    awake. Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord." The fearful 
    threatenings of the third angel are to be realized, and all the wicked are 
    to drink of the wrath of God. An innumerable host of evil angels are 
    spreading over the whole land and crowding the churches. These agents of 
    Satan look upon the religious bodies with exultation, for the cloak of 
    religion covers the greatest crime and iniquity."<SUP>25</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>In 
  Ellen White's mind the non-Adventist Christian churches were full of sin. In 
  her mind, their worst enemies were not atheists, pagans, and infidels. 
  <B>Their worst enemies were Sunday-keeping Christians!</B> 
  <P>
  <H3><FONT face=arial color=#900000>Ellen White devises National Sunday Law 
  teaching</FONT></H3>
  <P>In the mid-1800s there were a series of incidents where Seventh-day 
  Adventists ran into trouble with the law because they worked on Sunday. In 
  many states there were "blue laws" forbidding work on Sunday. It was against 
  this background of persecution by the state that prophet Ellen White describes 
  the coming persecution of Sabbath-keepers in a series of books and articles. 
  She wrote: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Then I saw the leading men of the earth consulting together, 
    and Satan and his angels busy around them. I saw a writing, copies of which 
    were scattered in different parts of the land, giving orders that unless the 
    saints should yield their peculiar faith, give up the Sabbath, and observe 
    the first day of the week, the people were at liberty after a certain time 
    to put them to death."<SUP>26</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>In 1884, the end-time 
  scenario is said to be brought about by the "superhuman" efforts of the 
  clergy, who prevail upon the legislators to enact laws enforcing Sunday 
  observance, with each subsequent set of laws gradually increasing in severity: 

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The clergy put forth almost superhuman efforts to shut away the 
    light, lest it should shine upon their flocks. By every means at their 
    command they endeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital questions. 
    The church appeals to the strong arm of civil power, and in this work, 
    papists are solicited to come to the help of Protestants. The movement for 
    Sunday enforcement becomes more bold and decided. The law is invoked against 
    commandment-keepers. ... 
    <P>"In the last conflict the Sabbath will be the special point of 
    controversy <B>throughout all Christendom</B>. Secular rulers and religious 
    leaders will unite to enforce the observance of the Sunday; and as milder 
    measures fail, the most oppressive laws will be enacted. It will be urged 
    that the few who stand in opposition to an institution of the church and a 
    law of the land ought not to be tolerated, and a decree will finally be 
    issued denouncing them as deserving of the severest punishment, and giving 
    the people liberty, after a certain time, to put them to 
    death."<SUP>27</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>By the late 1880s the end appeared 
  imminent to Adventists. The reason they believed the end was imminent was 
  because a law was being considered before the United States Congress in the 
  late 1880s which would have made Sunday a nationally recognized holiday. In 
  1886, Mrs. White warned of the soon-coming end: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The end of all things is at hand. The time of trouble is about 
    to come upon the people of God. Then it is that the decree will go forth 
    forbidding those who keep the Sabbath of the Lord to buy or sell, and 
    threatening them with punishment, and even death, if they do not observe the 
    first day of the week as the Sabbath."<SUP>28</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Then the 
  unexpected happened. The Sunday law was defeated by Congress. While there may 
  have been more than one reason the law was rejected, it was apparent that some 
  in Congress felt the law would violate the separation between church and 
  state. Besides, if the law was enacted, it would have likely been struck down 
  by the Supreme Court. After this event, the Sunday Law movement lost steam and 
  gradually turned its attention to other issues. By the early 1900s it was 
  beginning to appear unlikely that a Sunday law was going to be passed any time 
  in the near future. Adventists now had a dilemma on their hands. They needed 
  to come up with an explanation as to how a Sunday law could possibly be passed 
  given the current circumstances. By 1904, the former scenario of an organized 
  movement of religious leaders pushing Sunday legislation through Congress 
  seemed unrealistic. Since a Sunday law now appeared extremely unlikely to 
  occur under <I>ordinary</I> circumstances, there must be some 
  <I><B>extraordinary</B></I> external events that trigger it. Thus, Ellen White 
  concocts a <B>new</B> scenario in which the United States is faced with a 
  sudden, terrible crisis. If the United States does not act to kill the 
  Sabbath-keepers, there will be a terrible national catastrophe: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"They will point to calamities on land and sea--to the storms of 
    wind, the floods, the earthquakes, the destruction by fire--as judgments 
    indicating God's displeasure because Sunday is not sacredly observed. These 
    calamities will increase more and more, one disaster will follow close upon 
    the heels of another; and those who make void the law of God will point to 
    the few who are keeping the Sabbath of the fourth commandment as the ones 
    who are bringing wrath upon the world. This falsehood is Satan's device that 
    he may ensnare the unwary."<SUP>29</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>During this horrific 
  crisis the Sunday law will be justified by politicians who would, under normal 
  circumstances, reject the law. However, in a crisis situation, they are 
  convinced to pass a Sunday law in order to prevent the whole nation from being 
  "thrown into confusion and lawlessness."<SUP>30</SUP> 
  <P>While this is certainly a creative scenario, Mrs. White gives no Bible 
  evidence for this new scenario, nor does she explain how killing the Sabbath 
  keepers could prevent the nation from being thrown into confusion and 
  lawlessness. The assumption here being that political leaders stop thinking 
  rationally during a crisis and pass laws which make no sense to anyone. While 
  it made sense to few, if any, outside the SDA Church, the followers of Ellen 
  White gobbled it up and the unlikely scenario eventually found its way into 
  the prophet's major book on end-time events, the <I>Great Controversy</I>. 
  <P>In earlier years Mrs. White talked as if only "Christendom" would pass 
  Sunday laws, but by 1911, she had once again changed her scenario, this time 
  to include the entire world. Mrs. White writes in her landmark book, <I>Great 
  Controversy</I>, published in 1911: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"The powers of earth, uniting to war against the commandments of 
    God, will decree that "all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and 
    bond" (Revelation 13:16), shall conform to the customs of the church by the 
    observance of the false Sabbath. All who refuse compliance will be visited 
    with civil penalties, and it will finally be declared that they are 
    deserving of death."<SUP>31</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>This "universal" Sunday Law is 
  further expounded upon in Mrs. White's final book published in 1917, a year 
  following her death: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"In this our day, many of God's servants, though innocent of 
    wrongdoing, will be given over to suffer humiliation and abuse at the hands 
    of those who, inspired by Satan, are filled with envy and religious bigotry. 
    Especially will the wrath of man be aroused against those who hallow the 
    Sabbath of the fourth commandment; and at last a <B>universal</B> decree 
    will denounce these as deserving of death."<SUP>32</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Thus we 
  find the doctrine of the Sunday Law continually evolving and changing over the 
  years to meet the particular challenges of that generation. After the death of 
  the prophetess Ellen White in 1916, the position of the church on the National 
  Sunday Law became frozen, and has remained relatively unchanged. This is 
  understandable, since there is no longer anyone with prophetic authority in 
  the church to modify the teaching. The church continues to teach the same 
  doctrine today that was taught in the early 1900s.
