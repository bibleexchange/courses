            Adventist Church</STRONG></P>
            <P align=left>In fulfillment of the divine plan, the Advent Movement 
            began its prophetic journey toward the kingdom in the year 1844. Few 
            in number, often with unhappy memories of having been cast out of 
            their churches because they had accepted the Advent doctrine, the 
            Movement’s pioneers walked uncertainly at first. They were sure of 
            the doctrines they held, but unsure as to the form of organization, 
            if any, that they should adopt. Indeed, most of them so sharply 
            remembered how strong, well-organized church bodies had used that 
            strength to oppose the Advent truth, that they instinctively feared 
            any centralized order and government. Nevertheless, certain pioneer 
            leaders saw with increasing clarity that some kind of government was 
            imperative if good order was to prevail and the Movement grow 
            strong. Their conviction was greatly strengthened by messages coming 
            from the pen of Ellen G. White.</P>
            <P>The result was that in 1860 a church name, Seventh-day Adventist, 
            was chosen and a legal body created to hold church property. This 
            was followed, in 1861, by the organization of our first conference, 
            Michigan. This involved the organizing of local churches, with the 
            members signing a church covenant, and the organizing of the various 
            churches into one united body to constitute what is now called a 
            local conference. Action was also taken to give identifying papers 
            to the ministers, thus protecting the churches against impostors who 
            might seek to prey upon them.</P>
            <P>In 1863 the General Conference was organized, thus gathering into 
            one organization a number of local conferences which had been 
            created by that time. This set the Advent Movement on a coordinated, 
            organized course.</P>
            <P align=center><STRONG>Historical Development of the Church 
            Manual</STRONG></P>
            <P>As the General Conference met year by year, in session, actions 
            were taken on various matters of church order in an endeavor to 
            spell out the proper rules for different situations in church life. 
            The 1882 General Conference Session voted to have prepared 
            “instructions to church officers, to be printed in the <EM>Review 
            and Herald</EM> or in tract form.”— <EM>Review and Herald</EM>, Dec. 
            26, 1882. This action revealed the growing realization that church 
            order was imperative if church organization was to function 
            effectively, and that uniformity in such order required its guiding 
            principles to be put into printed form. Accordingly the articles 
            were published. But at the 1883 General Conference Session, when it 
            was proposed that these articles be placed in permanent form as a 
            church manual, the idea was rejected. The brethren feared that it 
            would possibly formalize the church and take from its ministers 
            their freedom to deal with matters of church order as they might 
            individually desire.</P>
            <P>But this fear—doubtless reflecting the opposition that had 
            existed twenty years before to any kind of church 
            organization—evidently soon departed. The annual General Conference 
            sessions continued to take actions on matters of church order. In 
            other words, they slowly but surely were producing material for a 
            church manual. At times certain prominent brethren sought to gather 
            together in book or booklet form the generally accepted rules for 
            church life. Perhaps the most impressive of such endeavors was a 
            184-page book by none other than the pioneer J. N. Loughborough, 
            entitled, The Church, Its Organization, Order and Discipline, which 
            was published in 1907. Elder Loughborough’s book, though in a sense 
            a personal undertaking, dealt with many of the topics now covered by 
            the Church Manual and long held an honored place in the 
Movement.</P>
            <P>Meanwhile the Movement continued to grow rapidly both at home and 
            abroad. It was therefore in the best interests of the very order and 
            proper uniformity that had long been our goal, that the General 
            Conference Committee took action in 1931 to publish a church manual. 
            J. L. McElhany, then vice-president of the General Conference for 
            North America, and later president of the General Conference for 
            fourteen years, was asked to prepare the manuscript. This manuscript 
            was carefully examined by the General Conference Committee and then 
            published in 1932. The opening sentence of the preface of that first 
            edition observes that “it has become increasingly evident that a 
            manual on church government is needed to set forth and preserve our 
            denominational practices and polity.” Note the word preserve. Here 
            was no attempt at a late date to suddenly create a whole pattern of 
            church government. Rather it was an endeavor first to preserve all 
            the good actions taken through the years, and then to add such 
            regulations as the church’s increasing growth and complexity might 
            require<BR></P>
            <P>See Chapter 1, “Authority of the Church and the Church Manual,” 
            with respect to the role of the Church Manual in the Seventh-day 
            Adventist Church.</P>
            <P align=center><STRONG>Content of the Church Manual</STRONG></P>
            <P>The 2000 General Conference Session authorized the 
            reclassification of some existing Church Manual material and 
            approved the process for making modifications to such. The content 
            of this Church Manual, as it is presented in chapters and sections 
            within the chapters, is divided into two types of material. The main 
            content of each chapter is of worldwide value and applicable to 
            every church. Recognizing the need for some variations, additional 
            material which is explanatory in nature appears as Notes at the end 
            of some chapters and is given as guidance. The Notes have 
            subheadings which correspond to chapter subheadings and correlate to 
            specific page numbers.</P>
            <P align=center><STRONG>Procedure for Changes in the Church 
            Manual</STRONG></P>
            <P>Realizing increasingly how important it is that everything “be 
            done decently and in order” in our worldwide work, and that actions 
            on church government should not only express the mind but have the 
            full authority of the church, the 1946 General Conference Session 
            adopted the following procedure: “All changes or revisions of policy 
            that are to be made in the Manual shall be authorized by the General 
            Conference session.”—<EM>General Conference Report</EM>, No. 8, p. 
            197 (June 14, 1946).<BR></P>
            <P>However, local conditions in different parts of the world 
            sometimes call for special actions. Accordingly, the 1948 Autumn 
            Council, which had taken action to submit suggested revisions of the 
            <EM>Church Manual</EM> to the 1950 General Conference Session, also 
            voted:<BR></P>
            <P>“That each division, including the North American Division of the 
            world field, prepare a ‘Supplement’ to the new Church Manual not in 
            any way modifying it but containing such additional matter as is 
            applicable to the conditions and circumstances prevailing in the 
            division; the manuscripts for these Supplements to be submitted to 
            the General Conference Committee for endorsement before being 
            printed.”—<EM>Autumn Council Actions</EM>, 1948, p. 19.</P>
            <P>Changes in or revisions of the <EM>Church Manual</EM>, the Notes 
            excepted (see below), can be made only by action of a General 
            Conference session in which delegates of the world body of believers 
            are assembled and have a voice in making revisions. If revisions in 
            the Church Manual are considered necessary by any of the constituent 
            levels (see p. 26), such revisions should be submitted to the next 
            constituent level for wider counsel and study. If approved, the 
            suggested revisions are then submitted to the next constituent level 
            for further evaluation. Any proposed revisions shall then be sent to 
            the General Conference Church Manual Committee. This committee will 
            consider all recommended amendments or revisions and, if approved, 
            prepare them for presentation at an Annual Council and/or General 
            Conference session.</P>
            <P>If revisions to the Notes at the end of some chapters of the 
            <EM>Church Manual</EM> are considered necessary by any of the 
            constituent levels (see p. 26), such revisions should be submitted 
            to the next constituent level for consideration. If approved, the 
            suggested revisions should continue on through the next constituent 
            levels for further evaluation until they are received by the Church 
            Manual Committee. The Church Manual Committee will process the 
            request and, if approved, the revisions will be acted upon by the 
            General Conference Executive Committee at the final Annual Council 
            of the quinquennium to coordinate them with the changes of the main 
            content that the General Conference Executive Committee will 
            recommend to the next General Conference session. However, the 
            General Conference Executive Committee may address changes to the 
            Notes at any Annual Council.</P>
            <P>A new edition of the <EM>Church Manual</EM> is published after 
            every General Conference session. It is recommended that leaders at 
            all levels of the church should always work with the most recent 
            edition of the <EM>Church Manual</EM>.</P>
            <P align=center><STRONG>Clarification of Meaning</STRONG></P>
            <P>Churches should look to the local conference for advice 
            pertaining to the operating of the church or on questions arising 
            from the <EM>Church Manual</EM>. If mutual understanding or 
            agreement is not reached, the matter should be referred to the union 
            for clarification.</P><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><IMG height=1
