      2000 <BR>Votes to Promotes EGW "More Aggressively" <BR>to the Church and 
      the World</FONT></B></P>
      <P align=left>Many SDAs have written me that their church does not promote 
      EGW in order to separate themselves from her and say, they preach the 
      Bible only. These SDAs have deluded themselves. EGW name may not be 
      mentioned from the pulpit in some cases, but rest assured her non- 
      biblical doctrines are still preached. This resolution makes it clear that 
      the SDA Denomination still remains a cult with a false prophetess.</P>
      <H2>Resolution to promote and Defend Spirit of Prophecy More Aggressively 
      Passed</H2>

      <P>July 2, 2000 </P>
      <P>The business meeting came to order shortly after 9:30 on Sunday morning 
      in the Skydome. Phil Follett, General Conference (GC) General Vice 
      President, acted as chairman with Harold Baptiste, GC Associate Secretary, 
      as secretary, and Athol H. Tolhurst, GC Undersecretary, as advisor. </P>
      <P>Early in the session, Resolution #214 came to the floor for 
      consideration. <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: red">Resolution #214 
      is a six-part resolution strongly affirming and promoting the "Spirit of 
      Prophecy" in every level of church work. </SPAN>Bert Haloviak, Director of 
      GC Archives and Statistics, succeeded in amending the original wording of 
      the resolution so that it referred to the "Spirit of Prophecy through the 
      ministry of Ellen White." This change was urged because the spirit of 
      prophecy is also contained in the Bible. </P>
      <P><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: purple">The following is a 
      summary of its main points: </SPAN></B></P>
      <OL style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in" type=1>
        <LI class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: red">An expression of thanks for 
        the wonderful gift of prophecy to the church. </SPAN>
        <LI class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: red">A call to intensify efforts 
        to instill in youth an appreciation for the Spirit of Prophecy (SOP). 
        </SPAN>
        <LI class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: red">All ministers should 
        promote SOP more to members </SPAN>
        <LI class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Church administrators are 
        to promote SOP more than they are. </SPAN>
        <LI class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Churches are to have annual 
        SOP days. </SPAN>
        <LI class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Schools are to have annual 
        Adventist Heritage weeks. </SPAN></LI></OL>
      <P>It was difficult to get the names of all those who spoke on the issue 
      because some did not use the mike well, and their names appeared on the 
      screen for only a few seconds. However, the discussion that followed has 
      been reconstructed below as accurately as possible under the 
      circumstances. </P>
      <P>One of the first to come to the mike was Jurrien den Hollander of the 
      Dutch Union. While he supported the resolution, he asked if there had ever 
      been a similar resolution on behalf of the Bible. If not, he felt that a 
      similar one for the Bible must be passed if we were going to do one for 
      SOP. As he later explained, if there were no Bible, there could be no SOP. 
      </P>
      <P>He was assured by the chair that he would be given a chance to propose 
      a resolution on behalf of the Bible if the resolution under consideration 
      passed. </P>
      <P>Kenneth Wood, who had attended his first GC in 1927, spoke on behalf of 
      the resolution and requested that enforcement "teeth" be put into the 
      resolution. He further expressed concern over websites that were attacking 
      Ellen White. </P>
      <P>Someone asked if a similar resolution had been passed previously. After 
      some consultation, Tolhurst replied that although similar resolutions had 
      been passed, this one was sufficiently different to justify proceeding. 
      </P>
      <P>A man from the Inter American Division spoke in favor of the 
      resolution, saying this would be a clear repudiation of the idea that SOP 
      was an ecclesiastical faux pax. </P>
      <P>Kit Watts spoke in favor of the resolution, but asked the White Estate 
      to use gender inclusive language. </P>
      <P>A South Pacific Division delegate endorsed the resolution, but stated 
      that it must be accompanied by education on the proper relationship 
      between the Spirit of Prophecy and Scripture. </P>
      <P><STRONG><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: red">An African delegate 
      implored that something be done to counter the critics of Ellen White; 
      especially those on the internet. </SPAN></STRONG></P>
      <P>John Fowler, an associate in the GC Education department originally 
      from India, supported the idea. Those in academic circles, he lamented, 
      consider Ellen White an embarrassment. But this resolution was essential 
      in his opinion for unity. <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">We must embrace SOP 
      and give the trumpet a certain sound. A "lesser light" is still important. 
      </SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Jim Zackrison, GC Sabbath School Director, spoke in favor and assured 
      the delegates that the Sabbath School materials were all written in a 
      manner consistent with the resolution. </P>
      <P>A Spanish speaking woman from South American Division endorsed 
      resolution, but also supported the idea of passing a similar resolution in 
      favor of the Bible as soon as this resolution was passed. </P>
      <P>A South Asian Pacific Division delegate spoke in support, while also 
      taking care to promote the Bible. <SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; COLOR: red">He then expressed concern about 
      internet critics of Ellen White and implored the White Estate to counter 
      them. </SPAN></P>
      <P>A delegate from the African-Indian Ocean Division also spoke in favor. 
      He mentioned that he used to see copies of Answers to Objections, and 
      recommended that it be brought back to combat the critics. He also 
      recommended that the copyright to Ellen White books be released to 
      publishers in countries where they could be printed less expensively than 
      in America. </P>
      <P>A Nigerian spoke up to endorse the idea of publishing in countries that 
      could do it less expensively. </P>
      <P>A young Caucasian woman from the Euro-African Division speaking through 
      a translator, spoke against the resolution, saying that she and others 
      with exposure to the ideas of Luther, would object to that kind of 
      pressure. She wondered if such a resolution were necessary in light of 
      similar previous resolutions. While claiming to be supportive of Ellen 
      White, she questioned whether Ellen White herself would endorse the 
      resolution under consideration. </P>
      <P>Robert Kloosterhuis, G.C. General Vice President, moved the question. 
      <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">His motion passed, and the resolution itself 
      was voted a few minutes later with no visible opposition. </SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Following the passing of the resolution, delegate Hollander was invited 
      to submit his proposed resolution to promote the Bible in the same way to 
      Robert Kloosterhuis and his committee for preparation. </P>
