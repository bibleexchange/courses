      taught that we should not teach our children fairy tales such as the 
      Easter Bunny with colored eggs and Santa Clause because it was fiction and 
      we would be deceiving our children. Ellen White was always sited as an 
      authority for not teaching fiction or reading fiction. So as a loyal 
      prophet believing Adventist, we did not have fictional books in our home 
      neither did we teach Santa and the Easter Bunny to our one child. Neither 
      was it taught in Sabbath School or Church School. I was shocked to later 
      find that Ellen plagiarized some of her material for her books from 
      fictional books and had the seat of honor by the Christmas tree with 
      Willie White her son, dressed as Santa in her home each Christmas.&nbsp; 
      Why did the Adventist leaders hide the fact that Ellen enjoyed the Santa 
      Clause tradition? </SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">This document is a transcript from a tape by 
      Geraldine Hess. It was presented at Sabbath School Program, December 7, 
      1991 at the Seventh-day Adventist Walker Memorial Church, Avon Park, FL. 
      My family and I attended this service. Look for the BOLD RED with Willie 
      White as Santa. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P><B>"Introduction:</B> This morning we have a very special treat for 
      you. This is Geraldine Hess, and she is from Orlando. She is a friend of 
      Crystal Bishop, who called me a few days ago and asked me if I had planned 
      my Sabbath school program. And I said, "Well, not in its entirety," and so 
      she told me that Mrs. Hess had a very special thing she does about 
      Christmas at the White home. And so this morning let her share with us. 
      OK? Thank you.</P>
      <P>Geraldine Hess: Good morning. Are you looking forward to Christmas? I 
      am. And would you like to know how the family of Mrs. White spent 
      Christmas? I always wondered, because you see for so many years I read 
      everything that Mrs. White said in such a negative vein. Let me tell you. 
      In Adventist Home, the chapter on Christmas, this way I read it: 
      "'Christmas is coming,' is the note that is sounded throughout our world, 
      from east to west and from north to south. With youth, those of mature 
      age, and even the aged, it is a period of great gladness." And then I went 
      on, and I read all the things that you shouldn't do, and I felt very mixed 
      feelings when Christmas came.</P>
      <P>Then we moved to California and got involved in the restoration of 
      Elmshaven, Mrs. White's home. Like now, we are with William Miller's home 
      in New York. But in the process of it I got to meet and become friends 
      with, and talk, and talk, and talk with <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Grace 
      Scott, Mrs. White's granddaughter, the only living person. She is still 
      living, and she is going to be 93</SPAN></B> and is still telling the 
      stories very clearly. But she is the only living person that remembers. 
      The descendant that remembers Mrs. White.</P>
      <P>She was 15 years old when Mrs. White died. So what I am telling you is 
      about the last 15 years of Mrs. White's life and first 15 years of Aunt 
      Grace, and you remember how much you remember of your years up to 15 and 
      your Christmases.</P>
      <P>Well, I was cynical, and I would ask her questions, wanting to know, 
      and she would tell me. She is such a delightful person. She would just put 
      you at ease with her clear laughter.</P>
      <P>….How many of you have ever been to Elmshaven? Ah, quite a few. How 
      many of you know what the building is that is now called Rosehaven? Right 
      above it there is now a nursing home. A few of you do. That was Willie 
      White's home, built just above her home. So what I'm telling you took 
      place up at their place, not down at Elmshaven; and I asked Aunt Gracie. I 
      said , Why?" She said, "Well, Grandma was old by then, past 70, and she 
      was so busy. She didn't have any children. She was always a part of all 
      the family celebrations, but she wasn't a part of the preparation in doing 
      it for them at that age." They would put tables out under the trees and 
      have their Thanksgiving dinner out there, and all enjoyed being 
      together.</P>
      <P>Now, what happens after Thanksgiving? Now you hear about it long before 
      Thanksgiving, don't you? Well, this I was anxious to hear is "what did you 
      do?" She said, "Well, my brothers, her twin brothers, they had looked all 
      over their 69 or 70 acres to find the perfect Christmas tree. So the first 
      time after Thanksgiving that Willie was home, and that wasn't often, 
      because he traveled a lot with his mother, he would go out with the twins, 
      and they would cut the Christmas tree and bring it home." She said, "I 
      thought that would be such fun until one year I went with them. I found 
      out it was nothing but hard work, and after that I figured that they could 
      do it without me.</P>
      <P>"So they'd bring the Christmas tree home, and they would take it up and 
      put it in the third floor room, which was the boys' room."</P>
      <P>"You didn't want it in the parlor, because people would come and see 
      "it then?" I asked her. "Oh, no! The parlor was small, and people were 
      always going and coming there," she replied. "We had all of our family 
      celebrations in the third floor room."</P>
      <P>"The boys had pushed their beds off to one side. We had this great big 
      room. There was room for everybody. We couldn't have all gotten into the 
      parlor. So they had planned and they had measured. You know how your top 
      room is like this. They measured so the tree could be clear up there. Then 
      they started decorating it. What did they decorate it with? I told you 
      that they had taken the walnuts and opened them carefully. Then you glue 
      them back together with a ribbon or a string or a wire and paint them 
      various colors. Then you<U> </U>have Christmas tree ornaments.</P>
      <P>"And of course they made colored chains, and they made popcorn strings. 
      Along with the popcorn strings they had a berry in it." What kind of 
      berries did they have? I expected that, and that is a trick question. 
      Cranberries are East Coast; they couldn't have afforded to put cranberries 
      on a string on a tree. They used wild red mountain berries. So<I> </I>you 
      use what you have near you. And they cut pretty pictures and you know, 
      like the origami, and they made all kinds of ornaments and decorated the 
      tree. The last thing they put on the tree was the old candle, and they 
      were ready to go. Well, they made presents.</P>
      <P>She said her sister was very artistic, and she said, "I wasn't, and I 
      couldn't do pretty things like she did." She said one year she made a 
      pillow for grandma, grandma being Mrs. White, a black velvet pillow with a 
      pink rose painted on it. We used to see those a great deal. You can 
      sometimes see them in antique shops or maybe down in Mexico, but that was 
      quite a popular thing for a while, painting on velvet, and that is what 
      her sister Mable did for grandma.</P>
      <P>The boys, what did they do? "Well, you know, with all the traveling 
      that grandma and daddy, which was Mrs. White and Willie, did, they sent 
      home what? Postcards, of course. And the boys would take these postcards, 
      and they'd put them on wood and burn around them., and we would call that 
      decoupage. That was some of the gifts they made. They were busy making 
      things, hiding things, having lots of fun getting ready for Christmas.</P>
      <P>Christmas was Christmas Eve. That's when they celebrated. They came up 
      to the room interesting, to the upper room and they had their dinner 
      first." And I said, "What did you have for dinner?" "Well," she said, "oh, 
      lots of things. Four things." Three things she always remembered for 
      Christmas. She said, "Mother made dainty sandwiches a lot, but three 
      things were always for Christmas. One was dates, stuffed with nuts. The 
      other was fruitcake that was left. They made enough for Thanksgiving to 
      have some for Christmas, and it was always glazed." You have to be as old 
      as I am or older to remember glazed fruitcake. "And the third thing was 
      divinity candy, with a piece of nut in it, a half of walnut."</P>
      <P>I said, "Divinity? That's all sugar." She said, "Sure." Oh, I was 
      horrified! She said, "We only got it maybe two or three times a year, and 
      maybe one or two pieces at the most for that." She said to have it for 
      something special was all right. It's just that nowadays we could have it 
      so much that it's gotten out of hand.</P>
      <P>I thought, Hmmm. Maybe I need to think some things through and make 
      logic out of it instead of taking whatever is said and magnifying it.</P>
      <P>"After they ate, they cleared away the table of everything. They sat 
      down for their Christmas program, and grandma always had her rocking chair 
      right by the tree. It was her seat of honor, so she could see her whole 
      family. She loved to be with them, and to hear them, and to know what they 
      were saying and doing."</P>
      <P>I said, "Well, did you have to carry her upstairs? That's up to the 
      third story. "She said , No, until she broke her hip just a few months 
      before she died, she could go up and down steps as well as anybody. So 
      then they had this Christmas, a typical Christmas.</P>
      <P>"The boys, with dad's robe and cane and mother's dish towels, became 
      instant shepherds. Right? And they said their poems, sang their songs, and 
      glorified God in their little program. Then, after the program, everything 
      kind of got still, and then you heard, <B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">'Ho-ho-ho-ho. And Santa Claus came and, "I about fell 
      off my chair. I said, "No, not Santa Claus!"<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>She said , "Of course. <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">It's just a harmless 
      old tradition.</SPAN></B> We knew who'd get the gifts; we'd made them for 
      each other. We knew that. It was just a fun way of delivering them.</P>
      <P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">"Who was Santa Claus? Daddy, Willie White. 
      Red bathrobes, pillows, cotton beard,</SPAN></B> <B><FONT 
      color=#ff0000>toys, coming in with his eyes twinkling, just like you could 
      imagine, pointing to say, 'Little boy, I know you don't get anything for 
      Christmas. You just get colds, 'cause you weren't good.' And they'd all 
      laugh."</FONT></B></P>
      <P>I said, "What did grandma give as Christmas presents?" She said, "She 
      always gave books. She loved books, and she gave books." And I said, "Her 
      books?" "Oh no, not her books to us. She didn't write children's books. 
      She gave us children's books that we would like." "Very practical, lovely 
      lady. "Eloe, the Eagle," "Uncle Ben's Cobblestones." Some of these you can 
      still read. Those were favorite books when she was little, and Mrs. White 
      loved having them in her library to lend to children. After the Christmas 
      presents were given away, everything was settled on the tree. They would 
      then very carefully light the candles and sing Christmas carols until time 
      to go home."…</P>
      <P><FONT color=#008000>What I find amusing is the fact that some SDAs have 
      a website denouncing Christians that observe Christmas, the Christmas Tree 
      and Santa Clause because they believe it is worshipping pagan 
      gods.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#008000>Now that the supporters of&nbsp; Ellen White know 
      that she celebrated Christmas each year with her family and with Santa 
      Clause and the Christmas tree, will they condemn her for what they 
      perceive as pagan actions?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#008000>Those that oppose the Christmas tree use this text 
      from Jeremiah as their proof? When God was speaking to Jeremiah he was not 
      talking about a Christmas tree. God was talking about those that cut down 
      a tree and worshipped it as a god. Jeremiah pointed out these tree idols 
      had to be carried because they cannot walk and not fear them because they 
      cannot talk.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#008000>Do you fear your Christmas tree because it some 
      kind of a god and might do you harm?&nbsp; I have never seen or heard of 
      any Christian bowing before a CHRISTMAS TREE and worshipping it as a 
      god.<BR></FONT><BR>Jer. 10:3 through Jer. 10:5 (NIV) <FONT

      <P><FONT color=#008000>Some Christians will have nothing to do with 
      Christmas because of some pagan element attached to it.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But so does the calendar and the 
      cross. When Christians celebrate Christmas they are not worshiping idols, 
      but celebrating the Lord Jesus Christ's birth. Many people have accepted 
      Christ by attending a Christmas Pageant. Christmas is a biblical event 
      that took place 2000 years ago. Getting together with family and friends 
      at Christmas is a great way to uplift our Savior and to those that have 
      not accept Christ as their Savior.<O:P> </FONT></P>
      <P><O:P><FONT color=#008000>Always let your children know that Santa is a 
      fairy tale tradition like the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. If we lead 
      the children to believe fictional characters are for real then we are 
      lying to them.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
