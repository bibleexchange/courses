      <P>E. S. Ballenger wrote three booklets: The First Angel's Message,<A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/The_Second_Angel_by_Ballenger.htm"> The 
      Second Angel's Message</A>, and <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/The_Third_Angel_by_Ballenger.htm">The 
      Third Angel's Message</A>. They are paged the same as the originals and by 
      chapters and page numbers. These are very rare books and are really worth 
      reading to understand Adventism and their false teachings.

      <P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; COLOR: red">&nbsp;</SPAN>The battle of 
      Armageddon represents the last of a series of <I>judgments </I>which 
      terminate with the second coming of Christ at the beginning of the 
      thousand years, or the millennium.</P>
      <P>This series of judgments is announced by a solemn but joyful message 
      recorded in Rev. 14:6, 7.</P>
      <P>"And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, <I>having eternal good 
      tidings to proclaim </I>unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every 
      nation and tribe, and tongue, and people; and he said with a great voice, 
      Fear <B>God and give </B>him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: 
      and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and the sea and 
      fountains of waters. " A. S. V.</P>
      <P>The common version which reads "Having the, everlasting gospel to 
      preach," is not in harmony with the original. The text has no reference to 
      the gospel of salvation from sin through the death of Christ. This angel's 
      good tiding is something very different.</P>
      <P>The word "gospel" which appears in our common version occurs 
      seventy-seven times in the New Testament, but this</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>2</P>
      <P>is the <I>only </I>instance where it appears without the definite 
      article "the" or some other definite modification like "my gospel," "our 
      gospel," or "gospel of God." Here the Greek <B>word "euaggelion" 
      </B>stands alone and is faithfully translated by the version quoted 
      above.</P>
      <P>If the term "eternal good news," or gospel, does not refer to salvation 
      from sin, to what does it refer?</P>
      <P>Bear in mind that the Greek word from which "gospel" is translated 
      means <I>good news, </I>or <I>good tidings. </I>There are many kinds of 
      good news, but not all good news is the gospel of salvation from sin. 
      David said that Ahimaaz "is a good man, and cometh with good tidings, " (2 
      Sam. 18:27) but he did not<B> </B>bring the gospel of salvation from sin. 
      The lepers who entered the abandoned camp of the Syrian army said, "This 
      day is a day of good tidings, "but it was not the good news of salvation 
      from sin; no, it was salvation from starving to death. (2 Kings 7:9.)</P>
      <P>If a parent in any live Christian family should say to a child, "Bring 
      me the book," the child without inquiry would bring the Bible. Without, 
      the definite article "the" a child could bring any book and obey the 
      request of the parent. Seventh-day Adventists have a phrase which is more 
      common to their parlance than "the gospel" is to the New Testament. "The 
      truth " is proverbial among them in print, pulpit, and pew. It means "the 
      third angel's message." If</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>3</P>
      <P>a stranger should bear testimony in one of their social meetings and 
      use the expression, " I love truth," would they consider him a faithful S. 
      D. A? But if he said, "I love the truth," he would be classified at once 
      as one of them.</P>
      <P>If a man should declare that he loved and obeyed "the truth" but did 
      not keep the seventh-day Sabbath, they would at once accuse him of bearing 
      false testimony; but if he said "truth" they would consider him a good 
      prospect. The omission of the definite article "the" from the expression 
      "the truth," is very significant to every S. D. A., and rightly so 
      according to their creed. It is no less significant when omitted from 
      before "gospel" in the first angel's message.</P>
      <P>The angel tells exactly what his good news is. Refer back to the 
      scripture as quoted and it will be clear to the careful reader what the 
      good news of the message is. No, it is not " Fear God and give glory to 
      Him," for that is not good news, but an <I>exhortation </I>in view of the 
      good news. No, it is not worship Him that made heaven and earth," for that 
      also is an <I>exhortation. </I>The good news is couched in seven words of 
      everlasting glad tidings, <I>"the hour of His judgment is come."<O:P> 
      </O:P></I></P>
      <P>This good news is not salvation from the <I>sins </I>of a wicked world, 
      but from its <I>sinners. </I>That the announcement, "the hour of <I>His 
      judgment is come" </I>is<I> </I>indeed good</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>4</P>
      <P>news is, abundantly shown in the same book of Revelation. Notice the 
      following:</P>
      <P>"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls 
      of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which 
      they held: and they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O Lord, 
      holy and true, dost thou not <I>judge </I>and <I>avenge </I>our <I>blood 
      on them </I>that dwell on the earth?" Rev. 6:9, 10.</P>
      <P>This loud cry of the blood of the martyrs for <I>punitive judgment 
      </I>is<I> </I>answered with the statement that they "that dwell on the 
      earth" will kill the brethren of these martyrs for a "little season," yet 
      future, and then the cry for <I>judgment </I>will be answered.</P>
      <P>When the hour comes for this bloody work of killing the saints to be 
      ended forever in the destruction of those who have drunk their blood, will 
      not the announcement that this <I>judgment hour has come </I>be indeed 
      good news to the saints of both heaven and earth? And this is the <I>good 
      news </I>of the first angel's message.</P>
      <P>Notice that the souls under the altar are <I>not </I>begging the Lord 
      to start an investigation to see whether an atonement should be made at 
      the mercy-seat to silence the claims of a broken law for their death as 
      transgressors of that law; but they are crying to God with a loud voice 
      petitioning Him to <I>"judge . . . them that dwell on the earth," 
      </I>those who</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>5</P>
      <P>had slain them "for the word of God and for the testimony which they 
      held."</P>
      <P>Let us now notice those scriptures which record the <I>answer </I>of 
      God to the cry of the martyrs for <I>judgment upon </I>their persecutors, 
      and the joy and rejoicing which follows.</P>
      <P>"And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains 
      of waters; and they became blood. I heard the angel of the waters say, 
      Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because 
      thou hast <I>judged thus. </I>For they have shed the blood of saints and 
      prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. 
      And I heard another out<I> </I>of the altar say, Even so, Lord God 
      Almighty, true and righteous are thy <I>judgments." </I>Rev. 16:4-7.</P>
      <P>"And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and 
      talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will show unto thee the 
      <I>judgment </I>of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters." Rev. 
      17:1.</P>
      <P>This promised judgment is pictured in the 18th chapter.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the nations whom Babylon has made drunk with the wine of 
      her fornication, God says:</P>
      <P>"Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double 
      according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her 
      double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so 
      much <I>torment </I>and <I>sorrow<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>6</P>
      <P>give<B><I> </I></B>her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and 
      am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall, her plagues come in 
      one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned 
      with fire; for strong is the Lord God who <I>judgeth </I>her." . . .</P>
      <P>"Alas, alas, that great city Babylon. that mighty city! For in one hour 
      is thy <I>judgment come." </I>Rev. 18:6-10.</P>
      <P>"Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye 
      prophets; for God hath <I>judged </I>your <I>judgment </I>on her. " Rev. 
      18:20, Revised Version<I>.<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P>"And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, 
      saying, <I>Alleluia; Salvation, </I>and glory, and honor, and power, unto 
      the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his <I>judgments</I>: for<I> 
      </I>he<I> </I>hath <I>judged<B> </B></I>the great whore, which did corrupt 
      the earth with her fornication, and hath <I>avenged </I>the blood of his 
      servants at her hand. And again they said, <I>Alleluia. </I>And her smoke 
      rose up for ever and ever." Rev. 19:1-3.</P>
      <P>The word "judgment" or "judgments" in Rev. 18:10 and 19:2 certainly 
      means God's punishment on the wicked, and not an investigation. By what 
      authority can any one affirm that "judgment" in the first angel's message 
      means something else, when they are all translated from the same Greek 
      word?</P>
      <P>By this time the reader must be deep-</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>7</P>
      <P>ly impressed with the truth that the announcement that the hour of 
      God's <I>judgment is come, is </I>indeed <I>"eternal good tidings," 
      </I>and it is good tidings because it announces the destructive 
      <I>judgments </I>of God upon the persecutors of His saints and their 
      eternal deliverance thereby. But the shouting has only begun.</P>
      <P>"And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts [living creatures] 
      fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, <I>Amen; 
      Alleluia. </I>And a voice came out of the throne, saying, <I>Praise 
      </I>our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and 
      great. And I heard as it were the voice of a <I>great multitude, </I>and 
      as the voice of <I>many waters, </I>and as the voice of <I>mighty 
      thunderings, </I>saying, <I>Alleluia </I>for the, Lord God omnipotent 
      <I>reigneth." </I>Rev<I>. </I>19:4-6.</P>
      <P>Who has been reigning? "The woman which thou sawest is that great city, 
      which reigneth over the kings of the earth." Rev. 17:18.</P>
      <P>Notice that all this tremendous rejoicing in heaven and earth, of the 
      twenty-four elders and the four living creatures and the saints "small and 
      great," is over the fact that <I>the hour of God's judgment has come 
      </I>and He has by His <I>punitive judgments </I>delivered His saints from 
      those who were persecuting them.</P>
      <P>The first angel's message is therefore plainly<I>, eternal good tidings 
      </I>from</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>8</P>
      <P>God, when it announces that "the <I>hour</I> of his <I>judgment is 
      come."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P>The first angel will deliver his message when Babylon begins to declare 
      "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow ": when, "all 
      that dwell upon the earth shall worship" the beast, "saying, Who is like 
      unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?" When all the world, 
      except the faithful "remnant, "are intoxicated with admiration for the 
      glory of the beast and the woman seated upon him, it will be considered 
      high treason to declare that God is about to destroy that wicked 
      combination. It will take men of more than ordinary faith and courage to 
      give the first angel's message, and it will take more than human power to 
      prevent these messengers from being wiped off the earth. But God will have 
      faithful servants to deliver His message when the time comes and He will 
      take care of them.</P>

      <P>The first angel's message or "judgment message," as it is called in 
      Advent parlance, was given by Wm. Miller and his followers prior to Oct. 
      22, 1844. They gave the correct interpretation of this message. The idea 
      that a cleansing work was to take place in heaven never entered their 
      minds. They taut that the judgment of the first message was the</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>9</P>
      <P>destruction of the wicked.</P>
      <P>After the great disappointment of Oct. 22, 1844, they lived in almost 
      daily expectation of the Lord's return. As they continued to look and wait 
      they were plunged into deeper and deeper perplexity. Explanations of their 
      disappointment multiplied. As new theories were advanced the Advent band 
      was divided into many factions. There were two outstanding differences of 
      interpretation which resulted in parting the Advent believers into two 
      very hostile camps. These two teachings related to the close of probation 
      and the termination of the 2,300 days. The seventh-day Sabbath came in a 
      little later which widened the breach between the two factions.</P>
      <P>Early in 1845 one group began teaching that they had made a mistake in 
      their reckoning and therefore the 2,300 days did not end in 1844. They 
      readjusted their figures and continued to set dates for the termination of 
      the prophetic periods and the coming of the Lord. For a time they also 
      taut the "shut door" but in April, 1845 they met in conference at Albany, 
      N. Y., and repudiated the "shut door," and went to work to convert 
      sinners. This group<B> </B>turned against the seventh-day Sabbath and, 
      were therefore called First-day Adventists.</P>
      <P>The other group, led by James White and wife, Joseph Bates, and others, 
      continued to stand stoutly for the termination of the 2,300 days in 1844, 
      the "shut<B> <O:P></O:P></B></P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>10</P>
      <P>door" and later, for the Sabbath. They of course were called 
      Seventh-day Adventists. These outstanding differences which distinguished 
      the two groups no well informed, honest Adventist will deny.</P>
      <P>Both factions continued to set time for the Lord to return: the one by 
      readjusting the time of the termination of the 2,300 days; the other by 
      speculating on what was going on in heaven.</P>
      <P>The followers of the Whites never varied from their teaching that the 
      2,300 days terminated Oct. 22, 1844. Having fixed the date their only 
      explanation lay in the event that took place in 1844. Both groups were 
      blessed with fertile imaginations and they made good use of them. One ran 
      wild on shifting dates for the beginning and ending of the prophetic 
      periods, while the other kept pace by portraying heavenly scenes and by 
      this means shifted dates for the Lord to come.</P>
      <P>Early in their disappointment the S. D. A.'s taut that Christ went into 
      the presence of the Father to receive His kingdom and would therefore 
      return to the earth after the coronation. This was of short life. Then He 
      had gone into the most holy to make atonement: later they had to be sealed 
      with the Sabbath. The last and most permanent theory, the one still taut, 
      is known as the investigative judgment.</P>
      <P><I>The investigative judgment as, taut by the denomination is an 
      invention</I>, and</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>11</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">The 
      Investigative Judgment Defined</SPAN></B></P>
      <P>not a discovery. It was the outgrowth<B> </B>of a series of very 
      grievous disappointments.</P>
      <P>We will let James White and Mrs. E. G. White define what they mean by 
      the investigative judgment.</P>
      <P>"The investigative judgment takes place prior to the second advent, and 
      the resurrection of the just, that it may be known who are worthy of the 
      first resurrection." James White, <I>Life Incidents</I>, p.323.</P>
      <P>"This work of examination of character, of determining who are prepared 
      for the kingdom of God, is that of the investigative judgment, the closing 
      work in the sanctuary above." Mrs. E. G. White, <I>Great Controversy,</I> 
      p. 428.</P>
      <P>For brevity we will use I. J. for investigative judgment.</P>
      <P>With these plain statements before them the Review and Herald, Oct. 29, 
      1931, affirms that the 1. J. is not to inform God, because He knows, 
      "because He is infinite; but men and angels do not know because they, both 
      men and angels, are finite. The reason for a judgment, then, is that 
      finite beings may not only <I>believe </I>that God is just, but that we 
      may <I>know </I>both the perfection of His justice and the depth of His 
      mercy."<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P>In this statement the denominational paper puts itself squarely against 
      their own prophet in two points. First, Mrs. White and all the 
      denominational litera-</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>12</P>
      <P>ture teach that the I. J. is for the purpose of informing God; and 
      second, Mrs. White repeatedly states that the angels <I>do know. </I>In 
      <I>Test</I>. Vol. 1, p. 544, she says: "Heavenly angels are acquainted 
      with our words and actions, and even with the thoughts and intents of the 
      heart." See also Vol. 2, pp. 181, 442, <I>G. C</I>. p. 486.</P>
      <P>The R&amp;H teaches that the dead are unconscious until the 
      resurrection, therefore no I. J. can inform the dead till after the coming 
      of Christ when they are returned to life. Also, the denomination including 
      Mrs. White, teach that the I. J. is finished before the resurrection, that 
      God "may know who are worthy of the first resurrection." If the I. J. is 
      all finished before the first resurrection, then poor, finite men will 
      never have the privilege of knowing either "the perfection of his justice" 
      or "depth of His mercy."</P>
      <P>Then how inconsistent to teach that an I. J. began in 1844, if God and 
      the angels know "every secret sin" and "the thoughts and intents of the 
      heart" and dead are unconscious till the I. J. is all finished.</P>

      style="COLOR: red">James White Stoutly Opposed the Investigative 
      Judgment<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>The theory of the I. J. is not only contrary to the Scriptures, but is 
      also contrary to the teachings of the pioneers including Mrs. White. Capt. 
      Bates taut the I. J. not many years after the disappointment, but James 
      White vigorously combated Bates' theory. After quoting Matt. 25:31-33, he 
      says:</P>
      <P>"This scripture evidently points out the most important events of the 
      day of Judgment. That day will be 1000 years long. —2 Pet. 3:7, 8. The 
      event which will introduce the Judgment day, will be the coming of the Son 
      of Man, to raise the sleeping saints, and to change those that are alive 
      at that time....</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">"It is not necessary that the final sentence 
      should be given before the first resurrection, as some have taught; for 
      the names of the saints are written in heaven, and Jesus, and the angels 
      will certainly know whom to raise, and gather to the New Jerusalem." James 
      White in <I>Word to the Little Flock</I>, p. 24.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>This was published in May, 1847, yet Brother Bates continued to teach 
      his theory of the I. J. To meet this heresy of Capt. Bates, Mrs. White had 
      a vision Jan. 5, 1849, in confirmation of her husband's position on the 
      judgment. In this vision she says;</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>14</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">I. 
      J. Contrary to the "Visions"<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>"I, saw that the anger of the nations, the wrath of God, and the time 
      to judge the dead, were separate and distinct, one following the other." 
      <I>Early Writings</I> p. 36.</P>
      <P>These quotations show that James White and his wife did not believe the 
      I. J. would begin until after the first resurrection.</P>
      <P>Mrs. White defined the wrath of God to mean the seven last plagues. 
      (See <I>Early Writings, </I>p. 64). We can therefore substitute the "seven 
      last plagues" in the above quotation for "the wrath of God."</P>
      <P>It would then read, "I saw that the anger of the nations, the seven 
      last plagues, and the time to judge the dead, were <I>separate and 
      distinct, one following the other."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P>This was given Jan. 5, 1849. Therefore, the seven last plagues must 
      have come before this date, or the I. J. had not commenced.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">I. 
      J. Without Foundation In the Word of God<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>But we have more positive evidence on part of James White against the 
      I. J. In the <I>Advent Review</I> of Sept. 1850, James White says: "Some 
      have contended that the day of judgment was prior to the second advent. 
      <I>This view is certainly without foundation in the word of God....<O:P> 
      </O:P></I></P>
      <P>"Daniel, 'in the night visions' saw that 'judgment was given to the 
      Saints of the Most High,' but not to mortal</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>15</P>
      <P>saints—not 'until the Ancient of days<B> </B>came,' and the 'little 
      horn' ceased prevailing, which will not be until he is destroyed by the 
      brightness of Christ's coming.</P>
      <P>" 'I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge 
      the quick and the dead at [not before] his appearing and his kingdom. —2 
      Tim. 4:1.</P>
      <P>"The advent angel [Rev. 14-0, 7] 'saying with a loud voice, Fear God 
      and give glory to him: for the hour of judgment is come,' does not prove 
      that the day of judgment came in 1840, nor in 1844, nor that it will come 
      prior to the second advent."</P>
      <P>Language could not be stronger to show that the Whites did not believe 
      in an investigative judgment up to the close of 1850, six years after the 
      disappointment. Notice some of the strong expressions in this article: 
      <I>"that the day of judgment was prior to the second advent </I>... is 
      <I>certainly without foundation in the word of God." </I>Notice that he 
      also states most positively that the first angel's message <I>"does not 
      prove that the day of judgment came in 1840, or 1844, nor that it will 
      come prior to the second advent."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>

      style="COLOR: red">Daniel 7:9, 10, 13, 14.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Also it is worthy of note that Elder White uses Dan. 7:9-11 to prove 
      that the judgment could not begin prior to the second coming of Christ. 
      For eighty-eight years this scripture has been used</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>16</P>
      <P>by the denomination to prove that the I. J. began in 1844; while 
      <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Brother White uses it as forcefully to prove 
      that it could not begin prior to the first resurrection.<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Since about 1857 till a few years ago the denomination has been united 
      <I>in </I>teaching that Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14 announced the beginning of 
      the I. J. Of the many proofs in support of this fact we cite but one. 
      After quoting the above scripture Mrs. White says: "Thus was presented to 
      the prophet's vision the opening of the investigative judgment." <I>Spirit 
      of Prophecy,</I> Vol. 4. p. 307.</P>
      <P>Some of the Bible students in the denomination have recognized the 
      shallowness of such an application and have tried to correct the 
      blunder.</P>
      <P>In the <I>Sabbath School Quarterly</I> for third quarter, 1927, page 
      30, is found a lesson on the I. J. We reproduce two questions from this 
      study: "Question 17. Who are to be judged <I>after the saints are taken 
      with Jesus to Heaven? </I>1Cor. 6:2,3, 2 Pet. 2:9 [<I>Emphasis 
      ours</I>].</P>
      <P>"Question 18. How is this judgment scene described? Rev. 20:4; Dan. 
      7:9,10."</P>
      <P>This is the true interpretation of Dan. 7-9, 10, and agrees with the 
      position of James White in 1850.</P>
      <P>The S. S. Lesson teaches that Dan. 7:9-14 describes a judgment scene 
      <I>"after the saints are taken with Jesus <O:P></O:P></I></P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>17</P>
      <P><I>to heaven." </I>Have the saints been taken to heaven yet? Then the 
      judgment scene in 7:9-14 is still future. In spite of the honest efforts 
      of the writers of the S. S. lessons to correct this aged error the 
      denomination continues to teach the old blunder.</P>
      <P>The I. J. is based on a more palpable error than the wrong application 
      of Dan. 7:9-14—that is, the meaning of the term "within the vail." This 
      will be considered in the next chapter.</P>

      <P>The investigative judgment as it is held today, was not introduced into 
      the denominational literature aside from Capt. Bates' privately published 
      pamphlets, for at least ten years after the disappointment. In the spring 
      of 1854<B> </B>Elder Loughborough suggested the idea of the I. J. in a 
      private letter. The idea seemed to strike Uriah Smith, Assistant Editor of 
      the RH, favorably, as his published comments on Elder L's letter indicate. 
      The idea lay dormant for about three years before it received any 
      consideration in the R &amp; H. Smith and Loughborough were not among the 
      pioneers until 1852, both being too young to take any part in the '44 
      movement. Evidently they were not conversant with the position taken by 
      James White and endorsed by Mrs. White in vision regarding this subject 
      before they connected with the work.</P>

      therefore, for about three years before endorsing the suggestion.</P>
      <P>In the R. &amp; H. of Jan. 29, 1857, James White reversed himself and 
      endorsed the teaching of an I. J. For a number of years after the 1851 
      disappointment they floundered without any definite message regarding the 
      advent. They felt most keenly the lack of something to mark the close of 
      the 2300 days. Every explanation thus far had proved to be a dismal 
      failure. The First-day Adventists were teaching that the 2300 days did not 
      terminate in 1844. This the S. D. A.'s most stoutly combated. The people 
      were demanding an explanation of what <I>did </I>take place in 1844 if the 
      2300 days ended at that time. They answer were completely without an 
      answer. They<I> had </I>to find something to mark the termination of this 
      long period, or capitulate to their most bitter enemies, the First-day 
      Adventists. The I. J. offered their only escape. Therefore James White 
      shut his eyes to his former position, and enthusiastically supported the 
      I. J. which a few years before he had stoutly combated.</P>
      <P>After James White had reversed him-</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>19</P>
      <P>self and was teaching, the I. J., Mrs. White had another vision which 
      she was shown that the<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>I. J. began in 1844. Her husband reversed himself in 1857, and Mrs. 
      White followed suit in vision in 1858. <I>Spiritual Gifts</I> Vol. 1

      <P>In order to bolster their false teaching on the I. J. they move God 
      from the most holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary to the holy, or 
      first apartment. Wherever the Bible speaks of the position of God it 
      always represents Him as being in the most holy place. James White and 
      Uriah<B> </B>Smith taught that God moved His throne into the first 
      apartment at the ascension of Christ and remained there until 1844.

      Battle Creek College.</P>
      <P>Elder S. N. Haskell gives a glowing account of this movement. "October, 
      1903, is the fifty-ninth anniversary of one of the greatest events that 
      has ever transpired. The overthrow or the establishment of earthly thrones 
      is as nothing compared to it.</P>
      <P>"Prior to October, 1844, the glorious throne of the Creator of the 
      universe had been in the first apartment of the heavenly sanctuary . . 
      .</P>
      <P>"In 1844 the throne was placed in holy of holies<I>." Bible Training 
      School, </I>Oct. 1903, p. 68.</P>
      <P>"Fifty-nine years ago the Investigative Judgment began. Christ arose, 
      and the throne of God moved from the outer apartment in the heavenly 
      sanctuary into</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>20</P>
      <P>the most holy place. He was escorted by more than 100,000,000 angels. 
      It was the grandest scene that heaven had ever witnessed. The Father rose 
      from His throne in the outer apartment, and in a flaming chariot entered 
      the holy of holies and sat down. Then Jesus rose up, and in a cloudy 
      chariot, with wheels like flaming fire was borne to the holiest where the 
      Father sat." Id p. 73.</P>
      <P>It is a notorious fact that none of the positions held by the 
      denomination were revealed to them thru the visions of Mrs. White. In 
      every case when she was shown any point of doctrine it was always after 
      some of the pioneers had discovered some point of truth, or what they 
      supposed was the truth, after which she went into vision and saw simply 
      what her fellow-workers were teaching previous to her vision. Whatever the 
      pioneers taut whether truth or error, if her husband endorsed it, she 
      without exception supported it in vision.</P>
      <P>This fact is admitted by James White. In the <I>R. &amp; H. </I>of Oct. 
      16, 1855, he says, <I>"It should be here, understood that all these views 
      as held by the body of Sabbath-keepers, were brot out from the Scriptures 
      before Mrs. W. had any view in regard to them."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>

      <P>The L J. stands or falls on the meaning of the term "within the vail." 
      For over 88 years the denomination has taut that "within the vail" meant 
      in the holy, or first apartment of the heavenly temple. Proof of this is 
      legion, but because of limitation of space we will introduce but one 
      testimony —but one which no S. D. A. will dare to dispute.<B> </B>We quote 
      from <I>G. C.</I> p. 420.</P>
      <P>"The ministration of the priest throughout the year in the first 
      apartment of the sanctuary, 'within the vail' which formed the door and 
      separated the holy place from the outer court, represents the work of 
      ministration upon which Christ entered at His ascension."</P>
      <P>But if it can be shown from the Scriptures that the expression "within 
      the vail" is applied to the most holy apartment of the sanctuary, then 
      Christ entered the most holy at His ascension and the argument that He 
      waited till Oct. 22, 1844 before entering the most holy apartment of the 
      heavenly sanctuary falls to the ground.</P>
      <P>"Within the vail" is a Bible therefore we must go to the Bible to what 
      it means. My S. D. A. brother, are you willing to test your interpretation 
      by this standard and abide by the evidence?</P>
      <P>The phrase "within the vail" found</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>22</P>
      <P>but once in the New Testament, but it appears five times in the Old. It 
      being a borrowed term from the time of the tabernacle service we must 
      necessarily go to the Old Testament for an explanation of its meaning. For 
      the convenience of the reader we reproduce every example of its use in the 
      O. T. in the order in which they appear.</P>
      <P>Ex. 26:33. "And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou 
      mayest bring in thither <I>within the vail </I>the ark of the testimony: 
      and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most 
      holy."</P>
      <P>Lev. 16:2. "And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, 
      that he come not at all times into the holy place <I>within the vail 
      </I>before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I 
      will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat."</P>
      <P>Lev. 16:12. "And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire 
      from off the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense 
      beaten small, and bring it <I>within the vail."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P>Lev. 16:15. "Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is 
      for the for the people, and bring his blood <I>within the vail, </I>and do 
      with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it 
      upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat."</P>
      <P>Num. 18:7. "Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your 
      priest's</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>23</P>
      <P>office for every thing of the altar, and <I>within the vail."<O:P> 
      </O:P></I></P>
      <P>Here we have five verses in which "within the vail" occurs, and there 
      are, no other examples in the O. T. In every case, without a single 
      exception, the term, refers to the most holy place. We challenge any one 
      to deny this fact.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">Without the Vail<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>If <I>within the vail </I>refers to the second apartment then 
      <I>without the vail must </I>apply to the first apartment in which were 
      located the candlestick, the altar<B> </B>of incense, and the table of 
      shewbread. This expression is found four times in the Bible. We reproduce 
      them all. Ex. 26:35. " And thou shalt set the table <I>without the vail, 
      </I>and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the 
      tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north 
      side."</P>
      <P>Ex. 27:20,21. "And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they 
      bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn 
      always. In the tabernacle of the congregation <I>without the vail, 
      </I>which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it."</P>
      <P>Ex.40:22. "And he put the table the tent of the congregation, upon side 
      of the tabernacle northward, <I>without the vail."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P>Lev. 24:3. <I>"Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of 
      the congregation,</I><B> </B>shall Aaron order it [the</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>25</P>
      <P>lamp] from the evening unto the morning before the Lord 
      continually."</P>
      <P>As truly as the term "within the vail" refers to the most holy place, 
      the term "without the vail," refers to the holy place. There are no 
      exceptions.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">Before the Vail<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>"Before the vail," like "without the vail" always refers to the first 
      apartment. It is used but four times, as follows:</P>
      <P>Ex. 30:6. "And thou shalt put it [the altar of incense,] <I>before the 
      vail </I>that is by the ark of the testimony."</P>
      <P>Ex. 40,26. " And he put the golden altar in the tent of the 
      congregation <I>before the vail."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P>Lev. 4:6. "And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and 
      sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, <I>before 'the vail 
      </I>of the sanctuary." Verse 17 is a duplicate of the 6th.</P>
      <P>The word "vail" as applied to the tabernacle is found 22 times in the 
      Old Testament, and in every case it is applied to the curtain between the 
      first and second apartments. True, the door the tabernacle was a curtain, 
      but the O. T. writers never called it a <I>vail, much less "the vail." 
      </I>It is called "the hanging for the door" or "the door of the 
      tabernacle," and "before the door of the tabernacle" always refers to the 
      court, in front of the tabernacle.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">The 
      Vail In the New Testament<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>The word " vail " (or veil, as it is</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>25</P>
      <P>spelled) referring to the temple is found six times in the New 
      Testament. In Matt. 27:51, Mark 15:38,<I> </I>and Lu. 23:45<I> </I>we find 
      the account of the rending of the veil at the death of Christ. That the 
      veil in these three gospels refers to the curtain between the first and 
      the second apartments no loyal S. D. A. will dare deny, for Mrs. White 
      says, "At the moment in which Christ died, there were priests ministering 
      in the temple before the vail which separated the holy from the most holy 
      place. Suddenly they felt the earth tremble beneath them, and the vail of 
      the temple, a strong, rich drapery that had been renewed yearly, was rent 
      in twain from top to bottom by the same bloodless hand that wrote the 
      words of doom upon the walls of Belshazzar's palace. The most holy place, 
      that had been sacredly entered by human feet only once a year, was 
      revealed to the common gaze." <I>Spirit of Prophecy,</I> Vol. 3, pp. 166, 
      167. See also <I>Desire of Ages</I>, pp. 165, 756.</P>
      <P>These citations show that Mrs. White taut that when the N. T. uses the 
      term "the vail" without qualification, it means the curtain between the 
      two, apartments. And let no one try to dodge the force of this fact by 
      affirming that the temple in the time of Christ had but one curtain, for 
      Mrs. White, at least twice speaks of the curtain that was rent at the time 
      of Christ, as "the inner<I> </I>veil." See <I>Desire</I> <I>of Ages, 
      </I>pp. 165,</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>26</P>
      <P>765. If it was "the inner veil"<I> </I>then have been an outer 
veil.</P>
      <P>The other three uses of the veil in the N. T. are found in the epistle 
      to the Hebrews. Heb. 9:3. "And after the second veil, the tabernacle which 
      is called the Holiest of all." All agree that this refers to the most holy 
      place. The fact that it calls it the second veil" has no significance, 
      whatever, only to show that there was a curtain at the door, which no one 
      denies.</P>
      <P>Heb. 10:20. "By a new and living<B> </B>way, which he hath consecrated 
      for us, through the vail, that is to say his flesh." The 19<SUP>th</SUP> 
      verse shows that it applies to "the holiest."</P>
      <P>We now come climax of the "the controversy; what does "within the veil 
      mean in Heb. 6:19, 20? It reads <I>"Which entereth into that within the 
      veil</I>; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an 
      high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec."</P>
      <P>In every place where the phrase "within the vail" is used in the entire 
      Bible, without exception refers to the holy place. Wherever the word or 
      "veil" or "veil" is found in the entire Bible, used in connection with the 
      sacrificial services, it also, without exception, means the curtain 
      between the first and second apartment, unless it is this one in Heb. 
      6:19. Mrs. White herself defines 'the veil" without qualification, as the 
      curtain dividing</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>27</P>
      <P>the two apartments.</P>
      <P>With all this array of evidence, what authority has any one to teach 
      that "within the veil" in Heb. 6:19 refers to the first apartment? There 
      isn't a heresy in all the religious world so hopelessly without Bible 
      foundation as the, teaching that "within the veil" means in the first 
      apartment. If the S. D. A.'s have a right to teach that "within the veil" 
      means in the first apartment, then the Sunday advocate has an equal or 
      greater right to teach that "Sabbath" in the N. T. means the first day of 
      the week. And my brother, they may drive you into a very uncomfortable 
      corner unless you correct this outstanding blunder.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">What Does It Mean?<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>If "within the veil" means in the most holy place of the heavenly 
      sanctuary, then Christ was in the most holy place when Paul wrote the 
      letter to the Hebrews. If Christ was in the most holy place in the days of 
      Paul, then He <I>did not move from the holy to the most holy in 1844.<O:P> 
      </O:P></I></P>
      <P>The idea that Christ waited till 1844 to go into the presence of the 
      Father is not only an unadulterated piece of imagination, without even the 
      shadow support in the entire Bible, but is contrary to the united 
      teachings of the Scriptures. Whenever the position of Christ in the 
      heavenly sanctuary is mentioned, He is always placed in the holy of 
      holies. Mark says, "He was received</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>28</P>
      <P>up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. Mark 16:19. Peter 
      places Him "by the right hand of God exalted." Acts 2:33; 1 Pet. 3:22. 
      Stephen saw Him " standing on the right hand of God. " Acts 7:55. Paul, no 
      less than seven times recognizes Christ at "the right hand of God. " See 
      Rom. 8:34; Eph. 1:20; Col. 3:1; Heb. 1:3; 8:1; 10:12;12:2.</P>
      <P>No Bible student this side of John, aside from S. D. A.'s, ever thot of 
      retaining Christ in the first apartment of the heavenly sanctuary a single 
      day after His ascension. All the apostles, reformers, and Bible teachers 
      recognized Him "at the right band of God," in the very presence of the 
      Father; and there they directed their prayers. Mrs. White most certainly 
      told the truth when she wrote that Satan answered all the prayers that 
      were directed to the first apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, (see <I>E. 
      W</I>. p. 261) for no well informed Christian ever thot <I>of directing 
      his prayers to any other place than the very presence of God, who has 
      always been in the most holy place.</I> To accuse any one who has ever 
      prayed of directing his prayers to the first apartment is an insult to his 
      intelligence; and for any one to teach that Christ remained in the first 
      apartment till 1844 and then moved into the second apartment is a disgrace 
      to his intelligence.</P>

      <P>The "book of life" has an important bearing on the study of the 
      investigate judgment. It is found eight times in the N. T. and seven of 
      these are in the book of Revelation.</P>
      <P>God promises the "overcomer" that He "will not blot out his name out of 
      the book of life" (Rev. 3:5); but warns<B> </B>that be "will take away his 
      part out of the book of life" whoever takes anything is away from the 
      words of the book of this prophecy." Rev. 22:19.</P>
      <P>"All that dwell upon the earth shall wonder" (17:8) and "worship" the 
      beast, "whose names are not written in the book of life" (13:8) ; and 
      "whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the 
      lake of fire" (20:15). "They which are written in the Lamb's book of life" 
      will have the privilege of entering into the, city. (2:27). The book of 
      life is opened at the time the dead are judged. (20:12).</P>
      <P>The third angel's message is a warning against "the worship of the 
      beast and his image." This warning is given before the close of probation. 
      The giving of this message completes the division of the world into two 
      classes: those whose names are written in the book of life, and those who 
      worship the beast</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>30</P>
      <P>and his image. The book of life determines who are to be saved without 
      any investigation.</P>

      <P>When the disciples returned from their missionary tour they rejoiced 
      that the devils were subject to them thru the name of Christ. He said unto 
      them, "Rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather 
      rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. Lu. 10:20. When were 
      they to rejoice? When were their names written in heaven? Surely they were 
      privileged to rejoice then, because their names were at that time on 
      record in the book of life.</P>
      <P>Paul wrote to the Philippians to "Help those women which labored with 
      me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, 
      whose names are in the book of life." Phil. 4:3. When were their names 
      written in the book of life? Evidently before the apostle Paul wrote that 
      letter. If they remained faithful unto death, then their names are still 
      there. Then has God been obliged to examine every deed of their lives to 
      determine whether they "are worthy to have part in the first 
      resurrection?"</P>
      <P>Daniel says, "At that time thy people shall be delivered, every one

      style="COLOR: red">"The Books Were Opened"<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>The Word plainly teaches that there shall be a judgment, and that books 
      are to be used in that judgment. This fact is made plain in both the New 
      And the Old Testaments. John gives us a picture of this judgment with 
      associated events, in Rev. 11:18, "And the nations were angry, and thy 
      wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and 
      that thou shouldst give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the 
      saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldst destroy 
      them which destroy the earth."</P>
      <P>This judgment is again pictured in Rev. 20:12. "And I saw the dead, 
      small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another 
      book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out 
      of those things which were written in the books, according to their 
      works." Daniel draws another picture of the same scene. See Dan. 7:9, 
      10.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P>Notice, it is the dead and the dead only that are to be judged when the 
      books are opened. James White taut the truth when he wrote that this 
      judgment did not begin till after the first resurrection. This judgment 
      does not</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>32</P>
      <P>begin till after Heaven declares, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust 
      still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is 
      righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be 
      holy still. And behold I come quickly." Rev. 22:11, 12. This fiat goes 
      forth before the return of the Master and certainly settles every case as 
      to their salvation; therefore when the books are opened it is not for the 
      purpose of deciding who are to be saved.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">For 
      What Purpose Are the Books Kept?<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>If the books are not kept for the purpose of determining who are to be 
      saved then what are they for? Certainly God does not need a set of books 
      to guide Him in making decisions, for as Elder White said, "The names of 
      the saints are written in heaven, and Jesus and the angels will certainly 
      know who to raise and gather to the New Jerusalem."</P>
      <P>"We are made a theatre unto the world, and to angels, and to men." 
      1Cor. 4:9, margin. The intelligences of heaven not only understand our 
      actions but they can read the thots and motives which prompt our actions. 
      Not so with man; he is not able to go behind the actions, nor is he able 
      to see the strivings of the spirit of God with sinful men. Many men and 
      women appear to us as very saintly, while they are most corrupt at heart. 
      If, when we get to heaven, some of our dear ones or friends, who seemed to 
      us to be honest Christians,</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>33</P>
      <P>are not there, we will be perplexed to know why. If we bad no means of 
      learning the facts we would have cause to wonder whether God was just in 
      excluding them. The books are for the purpose of enlightening the 
      redeemed; and when we have examined their records, and have seen how God 
      put forth every effort to save them and they rejected all His efforts, 
      then we will be, satisfied with the justice of God and will unite in 
      singing, "Righteous art thou' O Lord, and upright are thy judgments." Ps. 
      119:137.</P>
      <P>The saints are to have part in the judgment. (See 1 Cor. 6:3.) This 
      fact forces us to one of two conclusions, either the people to whom Paul 
      was writing went to heaven before 1844, or else the I. J. does not begin 
      till after the resurrection.</P>
      <P>I hear some one quote Rom. 14:10, "We shall all stand before the 
      judgment seat of Christ," and from that argue that the righteous as well 
      as the wicked must be judged. If a seat had only the function of 
      investigating or weighing evidence, such an application would be 
      warranted; but a judgment seat is a place of sentence as well as a place 
      of investigation. We must all stand before Christ for the purpose of 
      receiving our sentence.</P>
      <P>The righteous receive their crowns and the wicked their death sentence. 
      If you object to this explanation because the two events are</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>34</P>
      <P>a thousand years apart, then explain Jn. 5:28, 29, "The hour is coming, 
      in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall 
      come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and 
      they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." Here the 
      two resurrections which are a thousand years apart, are spoken of as 
      taking place in one hour. It is worthy of note that the word "damnation" 
      in this text is translated from the same Greek word from which "judgment" 
      is translated in the first angel's message.</P>

      <P>One who believes the investigative judgment as taut by the denomination 
      can have no conception of the gospel much less can he enjoy its blessings. 
      The two are as opposite to each other as sin and righteousness.</P>
      <P>The gospel is the good news of salvation from sin thru faith in the 
      redeeming merits of Christ. Every one who knows and accepts the gospel has 
      the assurance that he is "accepted in the Beloved;" he knows that he has 
      salvation. How can one enjoy the good news so long as he must wait till 
      God examines the books to see whether he is worthy of salvation? If God 
      does not know who are to be saved till He ex-</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>35</P>
      <P>amines the books, then certainly none of His children can know it till 
      after the I. J. makes its report.</P>
      <P>This is one of the reasons—if not <I>the</I> reason—the denomination 
      never knew anything about "righteousness by faith, for forty-four years, 
      and then when it was presented to them at the Minneapolis Conference, in 
      1888, they did not accept it. (That it was rejected, see <I>"Christ Our 
      Righteousness,"</I> p. 86 <I>Testimonies to Ministers,</I> pp. 79, 80, 97, 
      401.) Those who rejected "righteousness by faith" exercised good judgment 
      so long as they believed and taut the I. J.</P>
      <P>Reader, ask the leaders to harmonize their theory of the I. J. with the 
      following texts:</P>
      <P>"He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God 
      hath not life." 1 Jn. 5:12.</P>
      <P>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath 
      everlasting life." Jn. 6:47.</P>
      <P>"He that believeth on the Son bath everlasting life: and he that 
      believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on 
      him." Jn. 3:36.</P>
      <P>"He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath 
      been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only 
      begotton Son of God." Jn. 3:18, A. S.V.</P>
      <P>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth 
      him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but 
      hath</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>36</P>
      <P>passed out of death into life." Jn. 5:24, A. S. V.</P>
      <P>The two verses from the American Standard Version are true to the 
      Greek. "Condemnation" in Jn. 5:24, in the Authorized Version is translated 
      from the same Greek word from which "judgment" is translated in the first 
      angel's message.</P>
      <P>"He that believeth on the Son<I> hath everlasting life," </I>and 
      <I>"shall not come into judgment;" </I>while "he that believeth not the 
      Son <I>shall not see life," </I>and <I>"hath been judged already." 
      </I>This is a present condition, when one "believes," and not something to 
      be longed for after the investigative judgment.</P>
      <P>If the believers have "everlasting life" already, and the unbelievers 
      are "Judged already," God must know it; then what is the use of God 
      spending over a hundred years examining the books to "determine who are 
      prepared for the kingdom of God," as the denomination teaches?</P>
      <P>The I. J. robs one of the joy of the gospel and belittles God; reducing 
      Him to a mere man, and a second rate man at that, for every well regulated 
      business keeps the accounts of its servants or patrons strictly up to 
      date.</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Mrs. White in speaking of the I. J. says: "As 
      the books of record are opened in the judgment the lives of all who have 
      believed on Jesus come in review before God. Beginning with those who 
      first lived upon the earth, our Ad-<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">vocate presents the cases of each successive 
      generation, and closes with the living. Every name is mentioned, every 
      case closely investigated."<I> G. C. </I>p. 493. According to this the 
      names of all the worthies from Abel to John will have to be passed on in 
      the I. J. which began in 1844.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>According to Paul, Abel knew nothing of the I. J. or else he had the 
      wrong "witness." <SPAN style="COLOR: red">Listen to Paul's 
      testimony</SPAN>: "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent 
      sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous." 
      Heb. 11 :4. In fact the same is said of the entire list mentioned in this 
      eleventh chapter. The R. V. and the A. S. V. render the 39th verse, "And 
      these all, having had witness borne to them thru their faith." Was that 
      false witness? "God forbid." How ridiculous to teach that Abel, Abraham, 
      Joseph, Moses, the two Johns, Peter, Paul, Timothy, and all the others 
      whom God used mightily must have their names come up in the I. J. to 
      determine whether they are "prepared for the kingdom of God." Even more 
      ridiculous to think that God bad to wait till after Oct. 22, 1844 to know 
      whether Abraham. Moses and Paul were "prepared for the kingdom."</P>
      <P>If the Bible writers had known of the I. J. they certainly would have 
      put a codicil to some statements. Paul should have said, "Whosoever shall 
      call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" if</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>38</P>
      <P>he doesn't fall down in the I. J. Rom. 10:13.</P>
      <P>"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course. I have kept the 
      faith' henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness," if I 
      don't lose it in the I. J. 2 Tim. 4:7, 8.</P>
      <P>And John should have said, "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord 
      if they get thru the I. J. Rev. 14:13.</P>
      <P>"I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word 
      of God, and for the testimony which they held. . . . And white robes were 
      given unto every one of them" after 1844 if they pass the I. J. Rev. 6:9, 
      11.</P>
      <P>No doubt some of our critics will accuse us of being sacrilegious; but 
      if applying a dogma is sacrilegious, what about the dogma that 
      necessitates such an application? In no other way can these and many other 
      scriptures be made to conform to the dogma of the I. J.</P>
      <P>If the I. J. is a fact, then Christians thru the ages have been 
      deceived in rejoicing in God's promises. What good are the following 
      promises to one who believes the I. J.?</P>
      <P>"As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our 
      transgressions from us." Ps. 103:12.</P>
      <P>"I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy<B> </B>transgressions, and, 
      as a cloud, thy<B> </B>sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee." 
      Is. 44:22.</P>
      <P>"Let the wicked forsake his way, and</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>39</P>
      <P>the unrighteous man his thoughts:<B> </B>and let him return unto the 
      Lord, and he<B> </B>will have mercy upon him; and to our<B> </B>God, for 
      he will abundantly pardon." Is. 55:7. This promise is intended to apply 
      while the penitent is able to think,<B> </B>and is not restricted to the 
      period after 1844.</P>
      <P>"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our 
      sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 Jn. 1:9. When? Most 
      certainly when one confesses, and not in the I. J. If a sinner is forgiven 
      and cleansed when he confesses must he and God wait till after his case is 
      decided in the I. J. before rejoicing in the fact?</P>
      <P>When is there "rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repenteth," 
      when he repents or after he passes the I. J.?</P>

      </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>S. D. A.'s have been confirmed in their mistake by a superficial study 
      of Acts 3:19. "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may 
      be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence 
      of the Lord." Upon this unfortunate translation they have fortified their 
      belief that the sins of the righteous were not blotted out until just 
      before the coming of the Lord, or during the I. J. Had they consulted any 
      reliable translation they</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>40</P>
      <P>would have discovered their mistake. The R. V. and the A. S. V. render 
      it, "Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted 
      out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the 
      Lord." To this agree no less than a dozen other translations we have 
      consulted; in fact the Catholic translation is the only one that agrees 
      with the Authorized Version.</P>
      <P>"The seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord" is an 
      immediate and frequent blessing to every Christian and not a future event 
      associated only with the coming of the Lord. One who has never experienced 
      a "season of refreshing from the Lord" and is putting it off till the 
      Master comes, knows little of the joy of the Christian life.</P>
      <P>Mrs. White says in <I>Gospel Workers</I> p. 302:<I> "We are to be 
      established in the </I>faith, in the light of the truth given us in our 
      early experience ... We would search the Scriptures with much prayer, and 
      the Holy Spirit would bring the truth to our minds . . . The power of God 
      would come upon me, and I was enabled clearly to define what is truth and 
      what is error.</P>
      <P>"As the points of our faith were thus established, our feet were placed 
      upon a solid foundation. We accepted the truth point by point, under the 
      demonstration of the Holy Spirit. I would be taken off in vision, and 
      explanations would be given<B> </B>me."</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>41</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">Here we have a picture of the pioneers, 
      including Mrs. White, spending as she says, whole nights in prayer and 
      study of the Word, and then the Holy Spirit would bring the truth to their 
      minds, and Mrs. White would go into vision and would be enabled "clearly 
      to define what is truth and what is error." </SPAN>Mr. and Mrs. White and 
      others studied the Scriptures with much prayer, and, as they claim, the 
      Holy Spirit revealed to them that the I. J. "is certainly without 
      foundation in the word<B> </B>of God; " <B><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">and 
      that those who were teaching that such a judgment began in1840 or 1844 
      were mistaken; that the Holy Spirit revealed to them that it was revealed 
      to Daniel (7:9-11) that the judgment could not begin till the saints were 
      made immortal and the "Ancient of days came,"</SPAN></B> and the " 'little 
      horn' ceased to prevail, which will not be until he is destroyed by the 
      brightness of Christ's coming;" that the Lord revealed to Paul that "the 
      Lord Jesus Christ shall judge the quick and the dead at (not before) his 
      appearing;" and therefore the <B><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">first angel's 
      message "does not prove that the day of judgment came in 1840, or 1844, 
      nor that it will come prior to the second advent."<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>Thus was established in the "early days of the message" by "the 
      pioneers" under "the power of the Holy Spirit," and was confirmed by Mrs. 
      White in vision, as well as by Paul<B> </B>and by Daniel,</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>42</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">that the I. J. "is certainly without 
      foundation in the word of God," and that the first angel's message does 
      not teach that the I. J. will come "prior to the second advent" because 
      such a judgment is unnecessary, for Jesus, and the angels will certainly 
      know whom to raise, and gather to the New Jerusalem, without an 
      investigative judgment.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>So it is plain to be seen from their own teachings that we are on the 
      "firm foundation," established by "the pioneers " in the " early days of 
      the message" and are "contending earnestly for the faith once delivered 
      "to the pioneers, while the Whites and their followers, since 1858, are 
      the "heretics," who have departed from the sure foundation established by 
      the pioneers and their prophet. It is against them that a warning should 
      be sounded for being unsound in the faith, instead of against "the 
      Gathering Call heretics."</P>
      <P>According to their present-day teaching, the only event that marked the 
      termination of the great prophetic period, the 2300 days, was the 
      announcement of Christ's moving from the first to the second apartment of 
      the heavenly sanctuary to begin the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary 
      and an I. J. This according to their teaching, is the most important 
      prophetic period of the entire Bible. It inaugurated "the greatest and 
      most important religious movement this world has ever witnessed."</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>43</P>
      <P>Yet the great cornerstone of this greatest movement in the history of 
      the world was not believed or taut by the body for twelve years after the 
      termination of this great period. This great movement had gone into 
      history twelve years, before the body endorsed the invention of the I. 
      J.</P>
      <P>According to their present position the great religious awakening which 
      God instituted under the leadership of William Miller, the movement which 
      God so marvelously blessed and directed, which marked the beginning of the 
      "greatest religious movement this world has ever witnessed," never even 
      caught sight of the great event which marked the termination of the 2300 
      days until years after the movement had gone into history as a great 
      delusion. It was not only not given to the world, but was stoutly combated 
      by the pioneers for at least six years after 1844; and was not taut by the 
      body for twelve years after the great event had passed into history. Could 
      anything be more inconsistent? Could God be put in a more ridiculous 
      position than to record in His Word the longest and most important 
      prophetic period in the entire Bible, and then launch a great world-wide 
      movement to proclaim the termination of that period and not reveal to His 
      messengers who were heralding this message to the world the event which 
      God intended to mark the close of this "greatest and most important" 
      period for twelve</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>44</P>
      <P>years after the period terminated? Then<B> </B>when they did settle 
      upon an event to mark the close of this period twelve years after the 
      failure of the great awakening, it was "without foundation in the Word of 
      God." It was not only without foundation in the Word of God, but is 
      directly contrary to the spirit of the Gospel. The fact should not be lost 
      sight of that according to their own present teaching the only event which 
      marks the close of the 2300 days is the I. J. It should also be remembered 
      that James White used all of the scriptures which they now use in support 
      of the I. J. to show that no judgment began in 1840 or 1844.</P>
      <P>The unscriptural invention of the I. J. has led many intelligent men to 
      most inexcusable blunders. In fact their position on the first angel's 
      message has brot forth a bountiful hatch of untenable positions. Chief 
      among these is their position on the atonement, which leads them to teach 
      that: The day of atonement began in 1844.</P>
      <P>"The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanctuary above is 
      as essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross." 
      <I>G. C. </I>p. 489.</P>

      <P>We have shown that no kind of judgment began in 1844; that no kind of 
      angelic message was given during the Miller movement: therefore the first 
      angel's message has never been given, and consequently there is nothing to 
      mark the close of any prophetic period in 1844. <B><SPAN

      James White in 1847. It contains Mrs. White's first Vision complete 
      including portions left out of all editions of Early Writings.</P>
      <P><B>The Present Truth:</B> a series of eleven numbers of an 8-page 
      periodical, edited by James White from July 1849 to Nov. 1850. It also 
      contains some of Mrs. White's visions, which have never been republished 
      complete in any of her books.</P>
      <P><B>The Advent Review:</B> published by James White and four other 
      pioneers, in 1850. It contains 48 pages, and is largely given to accusing 
      First-day Adventists of departing from the truth because they refused to 
      believe the "door of mercy" was closed to all the world, Oct. 22, 1844, 
      and were working for the salvation of sinners.</P>

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">The Investigative Judgment has been going on 
      for 155 years as of 1999 according to the non biblical teaching of Ellen 
      G. White. Do you really believe that it takes God 155 years or more to 
      judge the world and determine who will be saved and who will be lost? Did 
      you notice the saints listed in Hebrews 11, were Judged worthy to enter 
      the City that was built without hands before Ellen G. White's 
      Investigative Judgment, Eph. 1:4 makes it plain God knows the saved before 
      the creation of the world. </SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: red">(Eph 1:4 NIV)
