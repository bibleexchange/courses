      <P>Camden, N. Y. June 29, 1851</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">"The</SPAN> <SPAN style="COLOR: red">Lord 
      shewed </SPAN>that he had, in answer to prayer, removed his frown from 
      this band, and that they could have the smiles of Jesus, if they would 
      live very humble, and walk carefully before the Lord, and know that in 
      every step that they took that God was guiding them, and the band would be 
      strong and would be a terror to their enemies; and the band must press 
      together. Then <SPAN style="COLOR: red">I saw</SPAN> Bro. Wing and Bro. 
      Hyatt—that the enemy had been trying to destroy them—that they were 
      praying for light upon a few texts of Scripture, and the more they prayed 
      the darker they grew, and the enemy was shutting down a network of 
      darkness over them; and just about as they were getting entirely shut in, 
      they were delivered—the net was broken, and they escaped. <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">I saw</SPAN> the true light on these texts &amp;c. 
      <SPAN style="COLOR: red">I saw</SPAN> that this rebuke was given by Jesus 
      to the Pharisees and Jews, who were filled with self-righteousness, and 
      would only speak to or greet those who were just as full of 
      self-righteousness and hypocrisy as they themselves were; and they 
      entirely neglect and pass by those who; did not make quite as much, and 
      who did not receive greeting in the market as they did. <SPAN

      time—that we are now living in. <FONT color=#0000ff><B><I><A

      <P>(Signed) E. G. White.</P>
      <P>Copied by R. R. Chaplin</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt">What to Notice<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>1. E. G. White is instructing the band not to pray for the "<I>wicked 
      world whom God had rejected." </I>"Because Jesus prayed for his enemies" 
      E. G. White counsels us not to pray for the wicked world, whom God had 
      rejected. God has not rejected this world, if fact Jesus died to save it. 
      If we understand this correctly she is saying, "do not follow Jesus’ 
      example of praying for his enemies, but follow my vision and do not pray 
      for them as they cannot be benefited by our prayers." This was one of her 
      precious rays of light to contradict Jesus’ example. <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">"But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those 
      who persecute you," (Matthew 5:44 NIV)<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>2. Ellen tells us, (Jesus’) <I>"spirit and sympathy were withdrawn from 
      the world; and our sympathy must be withdrawn from the ungodly." </I>Where 
      in the Bible does it tell us that God has withdrawn his spirit from the 
      world and that we should withdraw our sympathy from the ungodly? Did 
      probation for the world end in June 29, 1851 when Ellen wrote this?</P>
      <P>3. <I>"I saw that the wicked could not be benefitted by our prayers 
      now."<BR></I>If you believe this statement then it is useless to pray for 
      our non-Christian relatives and friends.<I> </I>Do you really believe that 
      Ellen received light from the throne of God when she blatantly contradicts 
      Him? The Bible says: <SPAN style="COLOR: red">"For if, when we were God's 
      <B>enemies,</B> we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, 
      how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his 
      life!" (Romans 5:10 NIV)<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>Was it possible that from 1844 till the Camden Vision of 1851 that 
      there was no hope for the wicked, then after 1851 there was hope<I> 
      </I>for the wicked and we could start praying for them again? What 
      nonsense! Are we to believe what Ellen was telling us came from the throne 
      of God, who does not change?</P>
      <P>4. <I>"I saw that scripture did not mean the wicked whom God had 
      rejected that we must love." </I>This vision must have really put a smile 
      on Satan’s face as he saw this deluded woman and her little flock 
      rejecting God’s Word by not praying for the ungodly and not taking the 
      Gospel of salvation to them. After 1844 the White’s, Bates, and other 
      leaders splintered off of the main Millerite body, and thought that the 
      door of mercy was closed for the world and they could not be saved. They 
      then devoted their energies trying to win the Millerite back to their 
      "shut door" theory. After 1851 the Whites’ opened the door and started 
      preaching to the world.</P>
      <P>After the 1844 fiasco William Miller denounced his calculations as an 
      error and said that nothing happened to fulfilled prophecy in 1844. He and 
      his group started preaching the Gospel to the world, both he and his 
      followers was condemned by E. G. White as having a false reformation 
      because they would not accept Ellen G. White's shut door for the world 
      doctrine.</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal 
      style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto">5. Ellen 
      used the term <SPAN style="COLOR: red">"I saw" </SPAN>ten times in the 
      Camden vision. She was attempting to impresses her readers that she was in 
      holy vision. There was no truth in this vision making her a false 
      prophet.</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: red; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">White 
      Estate responds to the Camden Vision<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P>The White Estate sent me a document on the Camden Vision. It is 
      identified as, Ms 1a 1851. They do not have an original copy of the Camden 
      Vision. They point out that Uriah Smith considered it authentic as he used 
      it in his defense of E. G. White’s visions in his book, <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/Camden_Vision.htm"><I>"The Visions of 
      Mrs. E. G. White</I>" </A>1868 p. 28.</P>
      <P>I have the original book by Smith with his Camden quotes. Ellen White 
      must have thought that his defense of her vision was accurate since James 
      and Ellen sold many copies of Smith’s book at camp meeting. If Uriah Smith 
      was in error, why didn't Ellen correct him? Back in 1868 Ellen was 
      defending her visions as being true by way of Smith’s book. SDAs always 
      compare E.G. White to the Bible prophets. But I ask, what Bible prophets 
      ever sold their visions? What Bible prophet re-interpreted their visions?
