      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Seventh-day Adventists won't tell you 
      they are behind the <B>"Revelation Seminars" </B>they sponsor. They act 
      all" interdenominational" if questioned. Watch out for these SDA 
      outreaches as well: <B>Voice of Prophecy, Faith for Today, It is Written, 
      The Quiet Hour, Amazing Facts etc</B>. They also hide behind Heath 
      oriented shows on the networks, and sponsor stop-smoking clinics etc, all 
      as introductions to Seventh-day Adventism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Often, the only tip-off that what you 
      are reading originates with them is that it is published by <B>"Pacific 
      Press".</B> They produce bright and colorful Children's books, often seen 
      in medical and dental offices, and of course, unsuspecting Church 
      libraries.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>They very much want to be perceived as 
      Evangelical Christians, seeking a place on the ministerial fellowships. 
      All this is good PR for them, but what do they really believe?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>What facts won't they tell 
      you?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>They won't tell you that they consider 
      themselves to be the only, true, remnant Church. Their prophetess, Ellen 
      G. White, whom they revere and believe without question has told them that 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...Satan has taken full possession 
      of the Churches". </B>(Spiritual Gifts V.l,p.189-90) They also believe our 
      prayers are an <B>"abomination"</B> to God. (Spiritual Gifts, V1 p.190). 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>That is what they think of you and your 
      church, even if they won't say it out loud in public, or to your 
      face.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>They revere their founding prophetess, 
      Ellen G. White, and made this statement in their <B>"Ministry" Magazine 
      </B>of Oct. 1981 and have never retracted it:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"We believe the revelation and 
      inspiration of both the Bible and Ellen White's writings to be of equal 
      quality. The superintendence of the Holy Spirit was just as careful and 
      thorough in one case as in the other".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>They won't tell you too much about Ellen 
      G. White at their public seminars, but their goal is to bring the person 
      attending to the point of conversion and baptism. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Their 2000 baptismal certificate poses 
      questions to which the candidate must answer "yes". Question 8 says, 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"Do you accept the biblical teaching 
      of spiritual gifts and believe that the gift of prophecy is one of the 
      identifying marks of the remnant church". </B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>If the candidate says "yes" and is 
      baptised, they soon learn that the "gift of prophecy" is Ellen G. White's 
      writings. Point 13 has them accepting that the SDA Church is the remnant 
      church of Bible Prophecy. They have been baptized into an exclusive group, 
      but they don't know how exclusive it is, yet!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>No doubt they will be urged to avail 
      themselves of a <B>"Clear Word Bible". </B>This publication of theirs has 
      inserted the words and doctrines of Ellen G. White right into the Bible 
      text, insuring that the person studying it will have the mind of Ellen G. 
      White.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Slowly, but surely, the new SDA will 
      come to believe these extra-biblical doctrines that set the SDA church 
      apart from Evangelical Christianity.</FONT></P>

      Christ</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Seventh-day Adventists, in the early 
      days, denied the Trinity, but now they accept it. However, they have 
      "leftovers" from this heresy. Ellen G. White wrote in Patriarchs and 
      Prophets, page 761, "...He (Jesus) was revealed to them as the Angel of 
      Jehovah, the Captain of the Lord's Host, Michael the 
Archangel".</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Adventists, you can't have it both ways! 
      Either Jesus Christ is God, or He is some kind of an Angel. You can't talk 
      out of both sides of your mouth to try to cover up embarrassing statements 
      by Ellen G. White. They won't tell you she was wrong - when its "her or 
      the Bible", she always wins!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>If you receive Christ as your Saviour 
      through the SDA's, only your past sins, up to that moment are forgiven. 
      Now you must get to work to earn your salvation. Ellen G. White said in 
      the <B>Advent Review and Sabbath Herald </B>of 10-26-1897 this statement, 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...The terms of salvation for every 
      son and daughter of Adam are here outlined. It is plainly stated that the 
      condition of gaining eternal life is obedience to the commandments of 
      God".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Of course, it is the fourth commandment 
      that is stressed, since Ellen saw this one glowing in one of her visions. 
      Salvation now becomes dependent on which day of the week one observes. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Modern Adventists keep sundown Friday to 
      sundown Saturday as the Sabbath, but earlier in their history they kept 6 
      p.m. Friday to 6 p.m. Saturday. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>The rest of us "Sunday keepers" are 
      doomed to receive the "mark of the beast" and lose our eternal life. (The 
      Spirit of Prophecy V. 4, p. 505). They sure don't say this at their 
      seminars!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Christ exclaimed <B>"It is finished"</B> 
      when He died for our sins, but it is not finished in Seventh-day 
      Adventism! EGW wrote in "<B>The Faith I Live By"</B> p. 211, </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"At the time appointed for the 
      judgement - the close of the 2300 days, in 1844&amp;endash;began the work 
      of investigation and blotting out of sins...both the living and the dead 
      are to be judged "out of those things which were written in the books, 
      according to their works".</B> (Rev. 20:12".</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>People are never told at Seminars that 
      if they become SDA's and are baptized, a recording angel is watching their 
      every move to determine their salvation eventually. EGW issues this 
      warning in <B>The Faith I Live By</B>, page 210,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"Every man's work passes in review 
      before God...Opposite each name in the books of heaven is entered, with 
      terrible exactness, every wrong word, every selfish act, every unfulfilled 
      duty, and every secret sin, with every artful dissembling. Heaven-sent 
      warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted moments, unimproved opportunities, 
      the influence exerted for good or for evil, with its far-reaching results, 
      all are chronicled by the recording angel."</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>It's not much fun being an Adventist and 
      being watched constantly by that recording angel with his <B>"terrible 
      exactness".</B> Prepare to become very uptight.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Christians will say, "sure we slip 
      sometimes into unintentional sin, but we have a mediator in Christ Jesus". 
      No, you don't in Seventh-day Adventism. Be prepared for this SDA doctrine 
      by Ellen G. White:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...Those who are living on the earth 
      when the intercession of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above are to 
      stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their robes must be 
      spotless, their characters must be purified from sin by the blood of 
      sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own diligent effort they 
      must be conquerors in the battle with evil....". </B>(The Great 
      Controversy p. 425).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>Obviously they have chosen EGW's 
      doctrine over that stated in the Bible in Hebrews 7:25,</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"Wherefore he is able also to save 
      them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to 
      make intercession for them".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Where would we all be without Christ as 
      our mediator, EVER making intercession for us?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>Christ bore our own sins in his body 
      on the tree according to the Bible. 1 Peter 2:24 says, "Who his own self 
      bare our sins in his own body on the tree...". </B>Become a SDA, and it 
      will be Satan who will eventually bear your sins! Ellen G. White 
      wrote,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...so Christ will place all these 
      sins upon Satan, the originator and instigator of sin...so Satan, bearing 
      the guilt of all the sins which he has caused God's people to commit, will 
      be for a thousand years confined to the earth, which will then be 
      desolate...".</B>(The Great Controversy p. 485). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>You won't hear this one at the Seminars! 
      They keep their radical teachings for later.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Seventh-day Adventism grew despite 
      endorsing a false date for Christ's return. What a dubious 
      beginning!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Ellen G. White endorsed a false prophecy 
      by William Miller that Christ would return, first in 1843 and then 1844. 
      Miller repented when Christ didn't show up on his date but Ellen didn't 
      want to be viewed as a false prophetess for endorsing him through her 
      visions. The idea was concocted by one of her followers that the date was 
      right, but the event was wrong. Ellen eagerly accepted this "out", and 
      this explanation was offered to explain away the false 
prophecy:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Christ didn't come visibly to earth, but 
      He, invisibly, in heaven, changed compartments from the Holy to the Most 
      Holy in 1844 and began the work of "investigative judgment" that we have 
      discussed previously.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>This false date and its failure 
      triggered other heresies on the atonement of Christ which continues to 
      this day. Honest-hearted SDA's who have pointed out the error of the 1844 
      investigative judgment have been shown the door by their Conference. You 
      sure won't be told the true history behind the 1844 doctrine by 
      SDA's!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Embarrassing false prophecies by EGW 
      have been, altered, covered up, and locked up by the SDA's. You won't be 
      told about them, but here are a couple. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>One false prophecy done in the name of 
      the Lord marks that one as a false prophet (See Deut. chapter 
      18).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Ellen G. White said people alive in 1856 
      would be translated at the 2nd coming of Jesus. (Testimonies, V1, p 
      131,132).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She said in Testimonies for the Church, 
      Volume 1, p. 259, that the United States would be <B>"...humbled into the 
      dust"</B> by England during the Civil War.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>No wonder Jesus told us to <B>"Beware of 
      the false prophets".</B> Time is their enemy. These false prophecies will 
      never be mentioned by the SDA's.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>You won't be told at the SDA Seminars 
      about the things they have in common with the Jehovah's Witnesses and 
      Mormons.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>SDA's share their early history with the 
      Jehovah's Witnesses. An early Adventist, N. H. Barbour co-published with 
      Charles Taze Russell. They had a falling out over (what else?) dates for 
      the end of the world! (1844 and 1874), and parted company.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Both, however, kept heretical doctrines 
      to this day like Jesus being Michael the Archangel, the denial of Hell, 
      and both still advocate soul sleep. Both invented invisible occurrences in 
      heaven for their failed dates for Christ's visible return, investigative 
      judgment for the SDA's and Christ's invisible "presence" for Jehovah's 
      Witnesses.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>There is Mormon link also for the SDA's. 
      It is a proven fact that Ellen G. White plagiarized most of her writings. 
      The Church has been challenged by Walter Rea, author of the White Lie to 
      prove that even 20% of her writings are original. They can't. Their weak 
      defense was that there were no copyright laws in Ellen's day, so what she 
      did was legal. You will never be told of her plagiarism by the 
      SDA's.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>As Ellen was rising to prominence, 
      Joseph Smith had just died. Her writings contain many phrases used by 
      Joseph Smith. Mind you, he has also been accused of plagiarism. I have a 
      thick file of similarities, but time does not permit details at this time, 
      but it does illustrate just how far her "borrowing" went. You will 
      definitely not be told of her similarities to Joseph Smith at the 
      Seminars!

      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=+1><B>Consulting the 
      Dead</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>You really won't be told about Ellen G. 
      White's engaging in necromancy, communication with the dead, expressly 
      forbidden by God in Deuteronomy 18:10-12</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"There shall not be found among you 
      anyone...who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls 
      up the dead. For whoever does these things is detestable to the 
      Lord..."</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>This particular necromancy occurred 
      after the death of her husband James, whom she called "Father". She 
      recounts the experience in a letter to her son published in <B>"The 
      Retirement Years"</B> p. 161 - 163.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She begins her letter by stating that 
      she was seeking God regarding her future,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"A few days since I was pleading with 
      the Lord for light in regard to my duty"...</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>It is evident she believed this dream 
      was in response to her prayers to God. James (whom she called "Father") 
      appeared beside her as she was in a carriage. She reported he looked "very 
      pale, but calm and composed". (After all, he was dead!) </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She says,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...I saw you die; I saw you buried. 
      Has the Lord pitied me and let you come back...?"</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>We are not to have conversations with 
      the dead, but Ellen and James converse back and forth about church matters 
      and their health. At one point James foretells the future for 
      Ellen,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...Now, Ellen, calls will be made as 
      they have been, desiring you to attend important 
      meetings...".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>James, her dead husband, goes on to tell 
      her she must avoid taxing her strength by going to meetings and retire and 
      write instead. He tells her "<B>...Make this your first 
      business".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Ellen now makes an agreement with her 
      dead husband to stay in touch,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"Well, said I, James you are always 
      to stay with me now and we will work together".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>This would involve further communication 
      with the dead. Ellen recounts that she then awoke and took the whole 
      matter as being from the Lord in these words,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...I feel no duty to go to Battle 
      Creek...I have no duty to stand in General Conference. THE LORD FORBIDS 
      ME. That is enough."</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Well, that is enough to conclude, not 
      only the letter, but the fact that Ellen consulted the dead and took it 
      all as coming from the Lord. She indicated she wanted to continue this 
      practice. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Can we trust this dream? No, of course 
      not. How then are we to trust her other 200 or so "inspired by God" dreams 
      and visions that occurred over her lifetime? We can't, if we judge matters 
      by the word of God. You won't be told EGW practised necromancy at the 
      Seminars!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=+1><B>Assorted 
      Silliness</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Often, cult research is tedious and 
      boring. I am grateful to EGW for being humorous, ridiculous, and just 
      plain silly. Her writings bearing her name are 17 times as long as the 
      Bible&amp;endash;plagiarized or not.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Many of them have to do with her 
      doctrines on health and food.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>As an SDA you will be encouraged to 
      become a vegetarian. Ellen indicated that your salvation could be 
      dependent on giving up meat . No meat-eaters will be "translated" at 
      Christ's coming (Counsels on Diet and Foods p. 380).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>You won't be told this scripture by 
      SDA's </B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...he who is weak in faith eats 
      vegetables only..." (Romans 14:2). (Fun to read to 
      vegetarians).</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She taught in Counsels on Diet ..on p. 
      390 (some editions) that </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...if we subsist largely upon the 
      flesh of dead animals, we shall partake of their nature". </B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Partake of their nature? This is against 
      God's creation laws of "kind", and Impossible. Also conveniently forgotten 
      is Paul view,<B> "Eat anything that is sold in the meat market, without 
      asking questions for conscience' sake." </B>( 1 Cor. 10:25). Obviously no 
      vegetarians evident in the early church!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Most of EGW's concerns over diet were in 
      an effort to control what she considered to be an excessive sex drive in 
      the male. She devoted endless pages to discussing <B>"secret vice"</B> 
      (masturbation) and blamed the practice for a wide range of diseases. Here, 
      in <B>"Solemn Appeal" </B>page 12 are a few of the diseases said to be 
      caused by "secret vice"</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"...dyspepsia, spinal complaint, 
      headache, epilepsy, impaired eyesight, palpitation of the heart, pain in 
      the side, bleeding at the lungs, spasms of the heart and lungs, diabetes, 
      incontinence of urine, fluor albus or whites, inflammation of the urinary 
      organs... rheumatism, affected perspiration, consumption, asthma, 
      catarrah, polypus of the heart, affection of the bones, fevers, ..etc. 
      etc.</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>The cure for secret vice was even 
      funnier. The perpetrator was to sit in a sitz bath at as low a temperature 
      as possible. At the same time, he was to have a hot foot bath, while 
      applying cold cloths to his forehead. He was also to wear an abdominal 
      bandage or wet girdle at night "to good advantage". </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She concludes, <B>"Cool bathing of the 
      parts affected is also beneficial".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>To those SDA's who write me that I must 
      be endorsing masturbation by making this public, let me assure you that 
      this is not the case. Why don't they charge their leader with the same 
      accusation? She wrote about it much more than I ever have! I am merely 
      exposing her silliness in health matters. You'll never hear these 
      ridiculous topics from the Adventists!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Thanks to Ellen White's influence, the 
      Kellogg brothers were inspired to develop cold corn flakes, as hot 
      porridge could <B>"heat the blood" </B>with undesirable 
results!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She sternly warned against using feather 
      beds for the same reasons, but I found a letter from her asking someone to 
      send her her featherbed! (EGW Vol 3, p. 341).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She also developed a "<B>reform dress" 
      </B>on instructions from God, which was a bulky affair with pants under a 
      long dress. She gave up on wearing hers finally, and so did the other 
      women, after years of suffering discomfort.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Other assorted nonsense included Angels 
      needing golden cards as gate passes to get in and out of heaven. (Early 
      Writings p. 37-39), </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She also "travelled" to other planets in 
      her visions, and also claimed to have met Enoch (more necromancy). (EGW: 
      The Early Years Vol.1 p. 114; p.157).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>She taught that certain races of men are 
      the result of amalgamation between man and beast. (SG Vol 3, p. 64,75). 
      Which races? You won't be told this one at the Seminars, or even 
      later!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Her silliness extended to wigs as well. 
      Any woman daring to wear one would <B>"...lose their reason and go 
      hopelessly insane"</B>. (Christian Mothers, # 2, p. 121). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Well, that's about enough of the 
      silliness. We could go on, but won't.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>In conclusion, it is amazing to me that 
      the SDA Church reveres Ellen G. White, choosing her visions, dreams, 
      doctrines and teachings above the Bible. Other women had better run for 
      cover, however, as they wouldn't dream of ordaining a woman in their 
      denomination which is totally male dominated.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>Adventists love to quote Walter Martin 
      who was "had" by them as a young man and believed their statements without 
      checking matters out closely, to prove they are not a cult. However, 
      before he died, he made this statement on the John Ankerberg 
      Show:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000><B>"I fear that if they continue to 
      progress at this rate, then the classification of a cult can't possibly 
      miss being reapplied to Seventh-day Adventism, because once you have an 
      interpreter of Scripture, a final court of appeal that tells you what 
      Scripture means, as soon as you judge Scripture by that, as soon as you 
      have someone who has made doctrinal errors in the past, even on the deity 
      of Christ and the doctrine of the atonement and other things, and that 
      person is raised to that position or authority, you have polarization 
      around that person".</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000>By their own actions and stubborn 
      clinging to Ellen G. White, her extra-biblical teachings, visions, and 
      doctrines, the Seventh-day Adventists have placed themselves in the 
      category of a cult. They certainly won't tell you this fact! They are a 
      cult!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=+1><B>IN CONCLUSION</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=+1><B>SDA's often make every effort to appear 
      "evangelical", joining in with inter-ministry groups and trying to "blend 
      in" with the Christian community.</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=+1><B>However, make no mistake about it, they 
      believe they are exclusively correct because they recognize and follow 
      Ellen G. White. Among themselves, they mock the Christian's beliefs, 
      calling our concept of salvation, "cheap grace". They privately consider 
      themselves to be spiritually superior to the rest of us. The sources of
