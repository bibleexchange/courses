<CENTER><B>"IT'S HEADED STRAIGHT TOWARD YOU...and you can't outrun 
it!"</B></CENTER></H3>
<P align=justify><B>Page 2:</B> Note: The SECRET RAPTURE so commonly believed 
and taught today is not in the Bible.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction:</B> The words "caught up" come from the Greek 
word "rapturos" meaning rapture.</P>
<P align=justify>Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together 
with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be 
with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:17.</P>
<P align=justify><B></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 2: </B>Who will come with Jesus at His second coming 
and why? Answer: All the angels of heaven will come with Jesus at His second 
coming. As the cloud nears the earth Jesus will send His angels and they will 
quickly gather all of the righteous people together in preparation for the trip 
back to heaven.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction: </B>When Jesus returns visibly, He returns to 
the earth (Revelation 19) with the saints after the rapture (Revelation 4) and 
tribulation (Revelation 6).</P>
<P align=justify>Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men 
also, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to 
execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their 
ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh 
things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him." Jude 14-15.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Note:</B> After the resurrection, children of God will be 
like angels.</P>
<P align=justify>"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in 
marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven." Matthew 22:30.</P>
<P align=justify><B></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 3: </B>What is the purpose of Jesus' second coming to 
this earth? Answer: Jesus is coming back to this earth again to reward His 
people as He promised and to take them to the beautiful home He has prepared for 
them.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction:</B> The return of Jesus Christ to the earth is 
for judgment.</P>
<P align=justify>Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from 
Bozrah, this One who is glorious in His apparel, traveling in the greatness of 
His strength? "I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save." Why is Your 
apparel red, and Your garments like one who treads in the winepress? "I have 
trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with Me. For I have 
trodden them in My anger, and trampled them in My fury; their blood is sprinkled 
upon My garments, and I have stained all My robes." Isaiah 63:1-3.</P>
<P align=justify>Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who 
sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and 
makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. 
He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a 
robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies in 
heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. 
Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the 
nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the 
winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. Revelation 19:11-15.</P>
<P align=justify><B></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 3:</B> What will happen to the righteous people when 
Jesus comes the second time? Answer: The righteous dead will raised from their 
graves, given perfect immortal bodies like that of Christ, and caught up into 
the clouds to meet the Lord. Then the righteous living will also be given bodies 
like Christ and will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. And Jesus will 
take the righteous to heaven with Him.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction:</B> The above answer is a description of the 
rapture not the second coming of Jesus Christ to the earth.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 3: </B>Note that Jesus does not touch the earth at His 
second coming.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction:</B> Jesus Christ will touch the earth at His 
second coming.</P>
<P align=justify>Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as 
He fights in the day of battle. And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount 
of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east.</P>
<P align=justify>Zechariah 14:3-4.</P>
<P align=justify><B></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 4:</B> A Great Persecution or Tribulation Prophecy: 
"For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the 
world." Fulfillment: This great long period of tribulation took place during the 
dark ages and was sponsored by the apostate church.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction: </B>Only a partial quoting of Matthew 24:21 was 
made!</P>
<P align=justify>"For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been 
since the beginning of the world until this time, NO, NOR EVER SHALL BE." 
Matthew 24:21.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Note:</B> More Christians have died in this century than all 
prior centuries combined.</P>
<P align=justify><B></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 4:</B> The Sun Turned Into Darkness Prophecy: 
"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened." 
Matt. 24:29. Fulfillment: This was fulfilled by a day of supernatural darkness 
on May 19, 1780. And the Moon Will Be Turned "Into Blood" Prophecy: "The sun 
shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into darkness, and the moon into 
blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come." Joel 2:31. 
Fulfillment: The moon became as red as blood on the night of the "dark day", May 
19, 1780.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction:</B> Then why didn't Jesus Christ return on May 
20, 1780?</P>
<P align=justify>"THEN the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and 
then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man 
coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Matthew 24:30.</P>
<P align=justify><B></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 4:</B> The Stars Shall Fall from Heaven Prophecy: "And 
the stars shall fall from heaven." Matt. 24:29. Fulfillment: The great star 
shower took place on the night of November 13, 1833.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction:</B> Then why didn't Jesus Christ return on 
November 14, 1833? (Matthew 24:30)</P>
<P align=justify><B></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Page 5:</B> A special message to the world in the very last 
days. "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a 
witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."</P>
<P align=justify>Matt 24:14. The great solemn last-warning message of Christ's 
second coming is now being presented in over 900 languages and nearly 99% of the 
world has access to this message.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Correction: </B>The gospel is not about the return of Jesus 
Christ. It is about the death of Jesus for the sins of the world, His burial, 
and His resurrection from the dead to confirm everything He said.</P>
<P align=justify>Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I 
preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also 
you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you, unless you 
believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also 
received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He 
was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. 1 
Corinthians 15:1-4.</P>
<P align=justify>And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is vain and your 
faith is also vain. 1 Cor. 15:14.</P>
