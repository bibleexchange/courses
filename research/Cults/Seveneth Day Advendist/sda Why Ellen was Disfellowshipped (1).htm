      Disfellowshipped From The Methodist Church</O:P> </FONT></SPAN></P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>By Robert K. Sanders</P>
      <P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">&nbsp;<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN>When 
      I read Ellen G. White's account of why she was disfellowshipped from the 
      Methodist Church from Spiritual Gifts Vol. II, pp. 21-26. I thought it 
      very strange that the Methodist Church would disfellowship the Harmon 
      family because they believed that Jesus was coming soon. After all this 
      was a Biblical teaching and also a fundamental teaching of most 
      Evangelical churches including the Methodist Church.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>I am indebted to Mr. Keith Moxon, who provided me the Seventh-day 
      Adventist research from Australia. This research includes records from the 
      Methodist church that shows the real reasons the Harmon family was 
      disfellowshipped. Mr. Moxon points out Ellen G. White, avoided saying she 
      and the rest of the Harmon family were disfellowshipped for believing and 
      teaching time-setting doctrines of William Miller that all terminated in 
      October 1843. And not for the reason of believing in the soon coming of 
      Jesus as Ellen portrays in <I>"Spiritual Gifts."</I><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>She 
      did believe in William Millers' time setting in 1843 and also in 1844 and 
      was teaching and preaching it. The Methodist Church would not allow this 
      heresy of time-setting to continue in their church.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>I would be more inclined to believe the Methodist Church's records 
      as to the accuracy of the disfellowship than I would of Mrs. White's 
      account for these reasons:</P>

      can not be trusted with truthfulness when giving her testimony as shown 
      below.</P>

      style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>She 
      was not being truthful about being a vegetarian and ate meat most of her 
      life and condemned others for doing the same. Only those close to her knew 
      the truth.</P>
      <P

      was not truthful in acknowledging the source of her material for her 
      books. She made others think God gave her all the words she wrote. Her 
      son, Willie White knew the truth.</P>

      <P>The reasons given by Mrs. E. G. White for her disfellowship from the 
      Methodist Episcopal Church in Chestnut Street, Maine, U.S.A. in September, 
      1843 (shortly before the first failure of William Miller's time setting) 
      is one of the two earliest examples, based on contemporary documents, of 
      Mrs. White's failing of prevarication.</P>
      <P>Prevarication is to act or speak evasively; to circle around the truth 
      but not tell quite the whole truth; to state something so that 
      superficially it is true, but information is withheld which causes the 
      hearer to gain a false impression.</P>
      <P>Regarding the disfellowship of the Harmon family, which included 
      herself as a girl of sixteen years, Mrs. White insisted in her 
      biographical <SPAN style="COLOR: red">memoirs ("<I>Spiritual Gifts</I>," 
      Vol. II, pp. 21-26) published in 1860<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P>that the reasons for the disfellowship were:</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">1.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Because she "rejoiced in the soon coming of Jesus."</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">2.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Because she "longed for Jesus to come."</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">3.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Because she "wished Jesus to come and save his children."</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">4.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Because she had "stated, that when I had lived nearest to the Lord, 
      the more earnestly did I long for his appearing."</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">5.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Because she told them "what Jesus had done for me, through the 
      belief of the near-coming of the Son of God."</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">6.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Because she said "it was Christ and the hope of his soon coming 
      that made me free."</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">7.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Because "the entire (Harmon) family were interested in the doctrine 
      of<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>the Lord's coming."</P>
      <P 
      style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Because they were "looking for and loving the appearing of our 
      Saviour."&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">9.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>"The only charge brought against us was that we had walked contrary 
      to their rules. It was asked, 'What rules have we violated?' After a 
      little hesitation it was stated that we had absented ourselves from the 
      class meeting and had attended other meetings, and they considered that we 
      had violated their rules. (Note how Mrs. White evades stating that the 
      meetings were the Millerite meetings. - K.M.)</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">10. <SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Because "if they 
      mentioned the coming of the Saviour or their love for his appearing, there 
      was a hard pressing spirit against them and such displeasure manifested 
      that there was a plain division of feeling and we knew if they loved Jesus 
      they would love to hear of his coming."</P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in">11.<SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Because 
      "they wished it understood that it was not for immoral conduct that we 
      were turned out, but for a breach of their rules." 'We were all pushed out 
      of the church because we believed and talked the near coming of our 
      Saviour."</P>
      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: red">The full truth of the matter is that the 
      Harmon family was disfellowshipped for believing and teaching, in 
      particular in the Methodist class meetings, the heretical time-setting 
      doctrines of William Miller whose five "prophetic periods" all terminated 
      in October, 1843. </SPAN>At that time the gospel dispensation would end, 
      probation would be closed and the Day of Judgment would occur. See the 
      full statement of the Stewards and leaders of the Chestnut Street M.E. 
      Church.</P>
      <P>For a person to speak particularly of second advent teachings as many 
      times as Mrs. White does in the above "reasons," without giving the 
      slightest indication that these teachings were in any way connected with 
      Millerism, seems to make the charge of prevarication a valid one. Or else 
      Mrs. White had an extremely bad memory, which of course would not help us 
      to accept very swiftly her other recollections of the SDA pioneer 
days.</P>

      style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> </SPAN>confess JESUS everywhere, and seemed to 
      be shut in with GOD. I went to the hall where the Advent people worshiped, 
      and there related what the LORD had done for me, and with tears of 
      gratitude declared the wondrous love of GOD. Bro. Stockman was present. He 
      had recently seen me in deep despair, and as he now saw my captivity 
      turned, he wept aloud, and rejoiced with me. I also related my experience 
      in the Christian meeting house in Portland. The sacrifice that CHRIST<SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> </SPAN>had made to save me from sin and death, 
      looked very great. I could not dwell upon it without weeping. I could<B> 
      </B>then praise GOD for my misfortune. I was naturally proud and 
      ambitious, and fear that I never should have given my heart to the LORD if 
      I had not<U> </U>been afflicted. For six months not a cloud of darkness 
      passed over my mind.</P>

      <P>My brother Robert and myself still attended the Methodist 
      class-meeting. One evening the presiding elder was present. And, filled 
      with the love of GOD. I related what he had done</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>22 EXPERIENCE AND VIEWS.</P>
      <P>for me, that I had at last found the blessing I had so long sought 
      for—entire conformity to the will of GOD. <SPAN style="COLOR: red">I 
      rejoiced in the soon coming of JESUS.</SPAN> <B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">1</SPAN></B> I expected they would rejoice with me, but 
      was disappointed. After I ceased speaking Elder B. asked me if it would 
      not be more pleasant to live a long life of holiness here, and do others 
      good, than to have JESUS come and destroy poor sinners. <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">I told him I longed for JESUS to come. 
      <B>2</B></SPAN><B> </B>Then sin would have an end, and we should enjoy

      </SPAN>Then he asked me if I would not rather die easy on a bed, than to 
      pass through the pain of being changed from mortal to immortality. I 
      answered <SPAN style="COLOR: red">that I wished Jesus to come and save his 
      children;</SPAN> <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">3</SPAN> </B>and that I was 
      willing to live or die; that I could endure all the pain that could be 
      borne in a moment in the twinkling of an eye; and that I desired the 
      wheels of time to roll swiftly round, and bring the welcome day, when 
      these vile bodies should be changed, and fashioned like unto Christ's 
      glorious body<SPAN style="COLOR: red">. I also stated that when I lived 
      nearest to the LORD, the more earnestly did I long for his appearing. Some 
      in the class-meeting seemed to be greatly displeased. <B>4<O:P>

      </SPAN>Once more I attended class-meeting, and was happy in the love of

      </U>The class-leader interrupted me, saying, "Through Methodism!" But I 
      could not give the glory to Methodism, when <SPAN style="COLOR: red">it 
      was Christ and the hope of his soon coming, that made me free. 
      <B><U>6</U></B></SPAN><B><U> </U></B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">I finished 
      my testimony, the last I was ever to bear among the Methodists and sat 
      down. I was convinced that I must give up my belief in the soon coming of 
      my LORD, or should have no freedom in class-meeting, or among the 
      Methodists; </SPAN>for my feelings would be wounded, and their ire would 
      be kindled against me, if I talked out what the Spirit of the LORD wrought 
      in me.</P>

      </SPAN>Soon the minister visited my father's family. <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">The entire family were interested in the doctrine of 
      the LORD'S coming. <B>7 </B></SPAN>The minister wished us to withdrew from 
      the church, as that would save a church trial. My parents told him they 
      wished to know the reason of the request. He said that we had been walking 
      contrary to their ruled, and that they had rather would withdraw, than to 
      have the sound go out that they had turned us out. We preferred a trial, 
      that we might know what sin we had committed. <SPAN style="COLOR: red">We 
      were not conscious of any wrong, unless it was a sin to be looking for and

      <P>ing house. <SPAN style="COLOR: red">The only charge brought against us 
      was that we had walked contrary to their rules. It was asked, "What rules 
      have we violated? After a little hesitation it was stated that we had 
      absented ourselves from the class-meeting, and had attended other 
      meetings, and they considered that we had violated their rules.

      </SPAN>They were reminded of some who were retained in the church, who had 
      not attended class meeting for more than a year, and a portion of our 
      family had been in the country, and none who had remained in the city had 
      absented themselves but a few weeks, and they were compelled to remain 
      away because they could not talk out the sentiments of their heart.<B> 
      <SPAN style="COLOR: red">10</SPAN></B> <SPAN style="COLOR: red">If they 
      mentioned the coming of their SAVIOUR, or their love for his appearing, 
      there was a hard pressing spirit against them, and such displeasure 
      manifested that there was a plain division of feeling, and we knew if they 
      loved JESUS they would love to hear of his coming.</SPAN> It was asked us 
      whether we would agree to conform to their rules, and confess that we had 
      walked contrary to them. We answered that we would confess that after the 
      manner which they call heresy, so would we worship the GOD of our fathers. 
      We dared not yield our faith. With free spirits, happy in the love of GOD, 
      we left the vestry of the Methodist meeting house. We had the assurance 
      that GOD was</P>

      </SPAN>At the commencement of their love-feast, Elder B. read off our 
      names, seven in number, and wished it understood that it was not for 
      immoral conduct that we were turned out, <SPAN style="COLOR: red">but or a 
      breach of their rules.<B>11</B></SPAN> He also stated that a door was now 
      open, and all who should walk contrary to their rules would share the same 
      fate. They had made a beginning, and should follow it up. There were 
      others in the Methodist church who were looking for the appearing of the 
      SAVIOUR. They wished to hold these persons among them by frightening them. 
      They succeeded in a few instances, and some sold their favor with GOD for 
      a place in the Methodist church. Many believed, but dared not confess 
      their faith for fear of being turned out of the synagogue. They loved the 
      praise of men more than the favor of GOD. Some after wards left them <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">and joined those who were loving the appearing of 
      JESUS. We were all pushed out of the church because we believed and

      time the words of the prophet were exceedingly precious: "Your brethren

      be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed."

      </SPAN>For six months not a cloud intervened between me and my SAVIOUR. 
      Whenever there was a proper opportunity <SPAN style="COLOR: red">I bore by 
      testimony in meeting</SPAN><U>,</U> and was greatly blessed. At times the 
      Spirit of the LORD rested upon me in such power that my strength was taken 
      away. This was a trial to some of those who had come out from the formal 
      churches, and often words were spoken meant for my ear, which grieved me. 
      They did not believe that any one could be so filled with the Spirit of 
      the LORD as to lose their strength. I began to fear. I reasoned thus: Am I 
      not justified in holding my peace in meeting, and restraining my feelings, 
      when my testimony caused such opposition, even in meeting, and in the 
      hearts of some of those older in experience, and just as faithful in 
      living out my religion, and not bear my testimony. I often felt pressed by 
      the spirit of GOD to speak in meeting; but did not, and was sensible that 
      the Spirit of God was grieved. I even kept away from meeting where some of 
      those attended who were annoyed by my testimony. I withheld my testimony 
      for fear of offending my brethren, and that uninterrupted communion with 
      GOD</P>
