          <P align=left><FONT size=3>The Investigative Judgment is a complex 
          doctrine, unique only to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It is 
          complex because the Scriptures have been twisted and manipulated to 
          make this doctrine appear Biblical. Most SDA Church members probably 
          would not be able to explain it without SDA/EGW material in front of 
          them to guide them.&nbsp;</FONT>
          <P align=left><FONT size=3>The doctrine of&nbsp; I J has been the most 
          controversial and debated doctrine within the SDA Church since it's 
          invention. Ellen White put her visionary stamp of approval on the I J. 
          and the SDA Church cannot discard this doctrine without admitting 
          Ellen G. White was a false prophet. They have a tiger by the 
          tail.</FONT>
          <P align=left><FONT size=3>I hope to make the <B>EGW's</B> 
          <I><B>Investigative Doctrine </B></I>simple to understand so that 
          sincere Christians can see that it is without Bible foundation, and 
          that it was the invention of religious fanatics.&nbsp;</FONT>

          <P align=left><FONT size=3>Thousands of people from all denominations 
          took part in the "Advent Movement" also known as "The Millerite 
          Movement" and also "The Great Disappointment". These misguided people 
          believed that Christ would return to earth and save them and destroy 
          the wicked including those that rejected William Miller's "date 
          setting" with hell fire raining down from heaven. The first date set 
          for the "end of the world" was in the fall of 1843, then the spring of 
          1844 and finally they settled on October 22, 1844.</FONT>
          <P align=left><FONT size=3>Needless to say all these failure dates 
          passed without the Savior's return. Hence the term, "The Great 
          Disappointment". The failure of Christ not returning to earth divided 
          the Millerites into two groups. The largest group was led&nbsp; by Wm. 
          Miller who renounced his belief of anything prophetically happening in 
          1844 and also renounced the SHUT DOOR DOCTRINE. The Millerites went 
          back to holding evangelistic meetings and winning souls for 
          Christ.&nbsp;</FONT>
          <P align=left><FONT size=3>The splinter group led by Ellen G. Harmon 
          (later the wife of James White), James White, Captain Joseph Bates and 
          others held on to the SHUT DOOR DOCTRINE, that the door of salvation 
          to the world was closed. They called themselves, "The Little 
          Flock".&nbsp;</FONT>
          <P align=left><FONT size=3>There was a rift between the Millerites and 
          the Whites/Bates group.&nbsp; "The Little Flock"&nbsp; were&nbsp; 
          trying to prove to the Millerites that they were not mistaken about 
          the 1844 date and THE SHUT DOOR and that something happened. Ellen 
          White blamed God for the failure for Christ not returning, as she 
          claimed that God put his hand over the figures of the chart and they 
          could not see their mistake. EGW claimed the figures were correct, but 
          the event was wrong. She went on to say that instead of Christ coming 
          to earth to cleanse the Sanctuary on earth, he move from the holy to 
          the most holy apartment in 1844 to begin an Investigative Judgment to 
          cleanse the Sanctuary in Heaven.&nbsp;</FONT>
          <P align=left><FONT size=3>It was shortly after the October 22, 1844 
          DISAPPOINTMENT that the Investigative Judgment theory developed. The I 
          J is not an ancient doctrine from the Bible but is of modern 
          origin.</FONT>

          <P>"The sanctuary being cleansed" in the KJV is not an accurate 
          rendering. Modern translations are more accurate such as the NIV using 
          "reconsecrated" or the NRSV in using the term "restored." Also "days" 
          are not correctly translated in the KJV, which should be "evenings and 
          mornings", of course EGW did not know this. There is no magic formula 
          for making "evenings and mornings" into prophetic years.</P>

          <P>The sanctuary service of Daniel 8:14 has nothing to do with the 
          "Day of Atonement" service or any future event in 1844.&nbsp; How was 
          the sanctuary defiled? Vs. 9-12 tells us that it was the little horn 
          that defiled the sanctuary. this would never be cleansed on the Day of 
          Atonement. This defilement was by Antiochus Epiphanies in the second 
          century B. C. as recorded in 1 Maccabees 4:36, 41-45, 52,53. This 
          cleansing was by Judas and the Jews, and was completed on the ninth 
          month, the 25 day. Not the seventh month the tenth day, which is the 
          annual Day of Atonement.</P>

        Daniel 7 as the 1844 Investigative Judgment of the saints. If you will 
        look closely at this chapter you will find that is a judgment by God 
        against the beast power that was persecuting the saints. The saints are 
        not judged for their sins but are vindicated by God. Read Daniel 7:
