Dear Sirs,
I was browsing through your website and something caught my eye.  My father 
is Rene Noorbergen. He died almost 11 years ago, but his books are still 
sought after and my mother has even had some of them reprinted.

The reason I am writing to you, is I see that you have a question mark next 
to my father's previous church affiliation.  In fact, my father was born and 
always remained a Seventh-day Adventist church member. My siblings and I 
have been brought up in that faith as well, and I have married an adventist 
minister.  Would you please correct this as soon is convenient.  I have had 
to clarify this for a number of people over the years - hence, it would be 
good if this mistake could be corrected.

Thank you for making it easy to email you about this, it means alot to me.

I am sure it is an easy mistake to make and of course the reason a question 
mark is there is because there is no other religion connected with my 
father's past.

I appreciate it very much,

Yours sincerely

Dawn Surridge Noorbergen)

NOTE: Obviously the actions of Ntakirutimana in Rwanda, Speight in Fiji, Malvo in D.C., Dayton Leroy Rogers in Oregon, Yates in Washington, and Wesson in Fresno in no way reflect Adventist teachings, nor do they reflect the outstanding record of good works and community service brought about by the majority of millions of Seventh-day Adventists worldwide.

Someone forwarded your list....you should contact Pam/Bed Feldcamp who have been running a Golden Awards for (famous) or contributing Adventists that have attended Adventist schools. Among them, former governor of Hawaii, Dick Rutan (whose space encounters are fabulous) an Olympic winner, many more. Also you failed to mention Dr. Leonard Bailey.???

They've really expanded that site.
One book they don't mention is LA Confidential.
The movie was great, but I couldn't quite wade through the book.
Anyways, in the book, set in the 50's, a cop shoots and kills an innocent bystanding couple. The ME covers it up, and the kids back East don't ask any questions, beacuase "they're SDAs, and SDAs don't belive in autopsies."
I've never heard of that before! Has anyone else, or did the author get his religious groups crossed up?
