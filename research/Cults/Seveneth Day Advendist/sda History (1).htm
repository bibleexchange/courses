            <P>Its birthplace in the township of Washington, New Hampshire, in 
            1844, reveals three central truths about the history of the 
            Seventh-day Adventist Church.</P>
            <P>1. Before it was "Adventist" or Sabbath keeping Adventist, it was 
            "Christian."</P>
            <P>2. It celebrates a history that has emphasized "freedom."</P>
            <P>3. It welcomes and grows from diversity within its 
membership.</P>
            <P><B>The Christian Roots of Seventh-day Adventism</B></P>
            <P>The local church where "Christian," "Advent," and "Sabbath" 
            combined was established by Christian Connection believers, a 
            religious body that in the mid-nineteenth century was fifth in 
            membership within the United States.</P>
            <P>Members of the Christian movement sought biblical authority for 
            every aspect of belief. They wanted "no creed but the Bible." Thus, 
            if they were convinced from the Scriptures of the literal soon 
            advent of Christ and the continuing validity of the seventh day 
            Sabbath, their heritage demanded acceptance.</P>

            <P>Because William Miller, a well-known Baptist preacher, exhibited 
            profound knowledge of the Scriptures as he lectured upon the literal 
            soon advent of Christ, scores of Christian Connection churches and 
            many of its ministers and leaders became "Adventist" in the late 
            1830s and 1840s. The Washington, New Hampshire, Christian Connection 
            church by the early 1840s was an "Adventist" church.</P>
            <P><B>Social, Organizational, and Theological Freedom</B></P>
            <P>Another element of the Seventh-day Adventist heritage from 
            "Christians" involves the Seventh-day Adventist emphasis upon 
            freedom.</P>
            <P>Washington, New Hampshire, was the initial town in the United 
            States to name itself after George Washington, and it took that name 
            in 1776, the year of the American Revolution. Its very birthplace 
            seemed a call to personal freedom.</P>

            <P>"Christians," as did Seventh-day Adventists from their earliest 
            days, actively sought freedom for all and worked toward abolition of 
            slavery as well as roles for women in the church, and fostered a 
            strong opposition to formalized church creeds.</P>
            <P>Freedom was also emphasized through an orientation toward 
            temperance and health reform. Proper care of the physical frame 
            would yield a clear mind with which to perceive scriptural 
            truths.</P>
            <P>Thus within nineteenth-century Adventism one finds strong 
            anti-slavery actions, women licensed as ministers, and health reform 
            principles that included abolition of alcohol and tobacco within the 
            membership.</P>

            <P>Religious freedom came to mean more than the separation of church 
            and state. It also implied a right to read the Scripture for oneself 
            and come to conclusions not bound by creedal presuppositions. The 
            "present truth" perspective assumed that new insights would arise as 
            Seventh-day Adventists continued to study the Scriptures. The 
            prophetic guidance of Ellen White within the movement solidified 
            this perspective of social, organizational, and theological 
            freedom.</P>
            <P><B>A Diverse Movement</B> </P>
            <P>The Washington, New Hampshire, roots also illustrate the 
            diversity within the heritage of Seventh-day Adventists. It was 
            Rachel Oakes, a Seventh Day Baptist, that convinced some of the 
            members of the Washington church about the continuing validity of 
            the seventh-day Sabbath. Not all mid-nineteenth century churches 
            would give a fair hearing to the insights of a woman. Besides that, 
            Thomas Preble, who attended that church and wrote an influential 
            tract on the seventh-day Sabbath, was a Freewill Baptist. Frederick 
            Wheeler, who served as their pastor, was a Methodist minister. We 
            thus have substantial diversity within that original church. At 
            least five different religious faiths formed the first Sabbath 
            keeping Christian Adventist church. Within that diversity, however, 
            unity over central issues prevailed.</P>

            <P>Shortly after settling on a denominational name in 1860, 
            Seventh-day Adventists began to talk about a worldwide movement. 
            After all, didn't Christ urge to "go ye into all the world, and 
            preach the gospel to every creature" and didn't Revelation talk of 
            "the everlasting gospel" to be proclaimed to "them that dwell on the 
            earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people"? In 
            1861 it was discovered that at least five in Ireland were practicing 
            Seventh-day Adventists. But how could a group of only a few thousand 
            perform the task of worldwide evangelism? The denomination was 
            officially organized on May 21, 1863, when the movement included 
            some 125 churches and 3,500 members. By 1864 Michael Belina 
            Czechowski, a former Catholic priest, decided to spread the 
            Seventh-day Adventist message throughout Europe. In 1874 the church 
            was ready to send abroad its first official missionary, J. N. 
            Andrews, who left the United States for Switzerland. By the end of 
            the century Seventh-day Adventism had become worldwide in scope.</P>
            <P>Today some 10 million Seventh-day Adventists have established 
            themselves in virtually every country of the world. Less than 10 
            percent of Seventh-day Adventists live in the United States. While 
            ethnically diverse, they remain united over the everlasting gospel, 
            the basic Christian message of salvation through faith in Christ. 
            Unity prevails also over the other central teachings of their 
            Christian heritage.</P>
            <P><B>The Heritage Continues</B></P>
            <P>While Seventh-day Adventists arose within an apocalyptic movement 
            that stressed the nearness of the Second Advent, their "Christian" 
            heritage emphasized the down-to-earth implications of the ministry 
            of the Saviour. The tension between "today" and "later" gives a 
            unique power to the way Adventists serve in their communities. It 
            has focused the energies of church members into education, 
            publishing, the healing arts, community service, and any other 
            activities that allow them to talk about their faith while improving 
            the lives of their neighbors.</P>
            <P>One result of this desire to touch lives for God is that 
            Adventists have built thousands of schools around the world. It also 
            means that Seventh-day Adventist physicians and medical institutions 
            serve individual needs in more than 98 countries, giving the highest 
            possible quality of personal care whenever people hurt. These 
            physicians, nurses, therapists, and other medical workers have 
            dedicated their lives to providing physical healing so that each 
            person can live the best possible life. Using modern medical 
            knowledge and carefully developed skills, these workers touch 
            thousands of lives each day, bringing healing and hope into families 
            around the world.</P>
            <P>Schools, hospitals, clinics, and health food factories are just 
            one small corner of the Seventh-day Adventist commitment to 
            improving lives. There is much more:</P></DIV>

              to mission and presence in the society with messages of "Good 
              news." Numerous radio studios dot the Adventist broadcasting map 
              around the globe. The same goes for production of television and 
              other media programs. The church's interest is best exemplified in 
              a satellite broadcast system with more than 14,000 downlink sites, 
              and the television 24/7 global broadcasting network for homes, the 
              Hope Channel. </LI></UL>

            <P>Too often it's easy to see all of this as just activities of the 
            institutions and organizations of the church. But the Seventh-day 
            Adventist Church is far more than its organizational structure and 
            institutions. The Adventist Church is people, individual members who 
            have caught a vision and who have chosen to live out that vision for 
            Christ, as His hands of hope.</P></DIV><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><IMG
