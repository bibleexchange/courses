            <P>God has woven music into the very fabric of His creation. When He 
            made all things “the morning stars sang together and the angels 
            shouted for joy.”—Job 38:7 The book of Revelation portrays heaven as 
            a place of ceaseless praise, with songs of adoration to God and the 
            Lamb resounding from all.—Rev 4:9-11; 5:9-13; 7:10-12; 12:10-12; 
            14:1-3; 15:2-4; 19:1-8</P>
            <P>Because God made humans in His image, we share a love and 
            appreciation for music with all His created beings. In fact, music 
            can touch and move us with a power that goes beyond words or most 
            other types of communication.<A title="" 
            href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music_guidelines.html#_ftn1" 
            name=_ftnref1><SUP>[1]</SUP></A><SUP> </SUP>At its purest and best, 
            music lifts our beings into the very presence of God where angels 
            and unfallen beings worship Him in song.</P>
            <P>But sin has cast blight over the Creation. The divine image has 
            been marred and well-nigh obliterated; in all aspects this world and 
            God’s gifts come to us with a mingling of good and evil. Music is 
            not morally and spiritually neutral. Some may move us to the most 
            exalted human experience, some may be used by the prince of evil to 
            debase and degrade us, to stir up lust, passion, despair, anger, and 
            hatred.</P>
            <P>The Lord’s messenger, Ellen G White, continually counsels us to 
            raise our sights in music. She tells us, “Music, when not abused, is 
            a great blessing; but when it is put to a wrong use, it is a 
            terrible curse”.<A title="" 
            href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music_guidelines.html#_ftn2" 
            name=_ftnref2><SUP>[2]</SUP></A> “Rightly employed, . . . [music] is 
            a precious gift of God, designed to uplift the thoughts to high and 
            noble themes, to inspire and elevate the souls.”<A title="" 
            href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music_guidelines.html#_ftn3" 
            name=_ftnref3><SUP>[3]</SUP></A><SUP> </SUP></P>
            <P>Of the power of song, she writes: “It is one of the most 
            effective means of impressing the heart with spiritual truth. How 
            often to the soul hard-pressed and ready to despair, memory recalls 
            some word of God’s,—the long-forgotten burden of a childhood 
            song,—and temptations lose their power, life takes on new meaning 
            and new purpose, and courage and gladness are imparted to other 
            souls! . . . As a part of religious service, singing is as much an 
            act of worship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. . . . As 
            our Redeemer leads us to the threshold of the Infinite, flushed with 
            the glory of God, we may catch the themes of praise and thanksgiving 
            from the heavenly choir round about the throne; and as the echo of 
            the angels’ song is awakened in our earthly homes, hearts will be 
            drawn closer to the heavenly singers. Heaven’s communion begins on 
            earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise.”<A title="" 
            href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music_guidelines.html#_ftn4" 
            name=_ftnref4><SUP>[4]</SUP></A></P>
            <P>As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe and preach that Jesus is 
            coming again soon. In our worldwide proclamation of the three 
            angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6-12 we call all peoples to accept 
            the everlasting gospel, to worship God the Creator, and to prepare 
            to meet our soon-returning Lord. We challenge all to choose the good 
            and not the bad, to “say ‘No’ to ungodliness and worldly passions, 
            and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present 
            age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of 
            our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.”—Titus 2:12, 13</P>
            <P>We believe that the gospel impacts all areas of life. We 
            therefore hold that, given the vast potential of music for good or 
            ill, we cannot be indifferent to it. While realizing that tastes in 
            music vary greatly from individual to individual, we believe that 
            the Scriptures and the writings of Ellen G White suggest principles 
            that can inform our choices. </P>
            <P>In this document the phrase “sacred music”—sometimes referred to 
            as religious music—designates music that focuses on God and on 
            biblical and Christian themes. In most cases, it is music composed 
            and intended for worship service, evangelistic meetings, or private 
            devotion and may be both vocal and instrumental music. However, not 
            all sacred/religious music may be acceptable for an Adventist. 
            Sacred music should not evoke secular associations or invite 
            conformity to worldly behavioral patterns of thinking or acting.</P>
            <P>“Secular music” is music composed for settings other than the 
            worship service or private devotion. It speaks to the common issues 
            of life and basic human emotions. It comes out of our very being, 
            expressing the human spirit’s reaction to life, love, and the world 
            in which the Lord has placed us. It can be morally uplifting or 
            degrading. Although it does not directly praise and adore God, 
            nevertheless it could have a legitimate place in the life of the 
            Christian. In its selection the principles discussed in this 
            document should be followed.</P>
            <P>Principles to Guide the Christian</P>
            <P>The music that Christians enjoy should be regulated by the 
            following principles:</P>
            <P>1. All music the Christian listens to, performs or composes, 
            whether sacred or secular, will glorify God: “So whether you eat or 
            drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.”—1 
            Corinthians 10:31 This is the over-riding biblical principle. 
            Anything that cannot meet this high standard will weaken our 
            experience with the Lord.</P>
            <P>2. All music the Christian listens to, performs or composes, 
            whether sacred or secular, should be the noblest and the best: 
            “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is pure, whatever is 
            right, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or 
            praiseworthy—think about such things.”—Phil 4:8 As followers of 
            Jesus Christ who hope and expect to join the heavenly choirs, we 
            view life on this earth as a preparation for, and foretaste of, the 
            life to come.</P>
            <P>On these two foundations—glorifying God in all things and 
            choosing the noblest and the best—depend the other principles listed 
            below for the selection of music by Christians.</P>
            <P>3. It is characterized by quality, balance, appropriateness, and 
            authenticity. Music fosters our spiritual, psychological, and social 
            sensitivity, and our intellectual growth. </P>
            <P>4. It appeals to both the intellect and the emotions and impacts 
            the body in a positive way. It is wholistic.</P>
            <P>5. Music reveals creativity in that it draws from quality 
            melodies. If harmonized,<A title="" 
            href="http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/music_guidelines.html#_ftn5" 
            name=_ftnref5><SUP>[5]</SUP></A> it uses harmonies in an interesting 
            and artistic way, and employs rhythm that complements them.</P>
            <P>6. Vocal music employs lyrics that positively stimulate 
            intellectual abilities as well as our emotions and our will power. 
            Good lyrics are creative, rich in content, and of good composition. 
            They focus on the positive and reflect moral values; they educate 
            and uplift; and they correspond with sound biblical theology.</P>
            <P>7. Musical and lyrical elements should work together harmoniously 
            to influence thinking and behavior in harmony with biblical 
            values.</P>
            <P>8. It maintains a judicious balance of spiritual, intellectual, 
            and emotional elements. </P>
            <P>9. We should recognize and acknowledge the contribution of 
            different cultures in worshiping God. Musical forms and instruments 
            vary greatly in the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist family, and 
            music drawn from one culture may sound strange to someone from a 
            different culture. </P>
            <P>Seventh-day Adventist music-making means to choose the best and 
            above all to draw close to our Creator and Lord and glorify Him. Let 
            us rise to the challenge of a viable alternative musical vision and, 
            as part of our wholistic and prophetic message, make a unique 
            Adventist musical contribution as a witness to the world regarding a 
            people awaiting Christ’s soon coming.</P><BR clear=all>
