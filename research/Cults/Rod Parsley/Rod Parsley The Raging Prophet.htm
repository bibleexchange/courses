HIS<BR>UNORTHODOX DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=center>by G. Richard Fisher</P>
<P>It is hard to describe a “worship service” led by pastor and television 
evangelist Rod Parsley. Whether viewing at home by way of his popular daily 
television broadcast, <I>Breakthrough</I>, or as part of his 12,000-member 
congregation, his services could, perhaps, be described as a hybrid of pep 
rally, boxing match and professional wrestling with smatterings of Bible verses 
and hyped-up claims that take people over the edge of hysteria. It is primal 
scream set to spiritual aerobics. Parsley is the ultimate cheerleader and 
professional boxer combined. He deftly and quickly moves people into altered 
states of unreality. There is no question that he can be a compelling and 
convincing speaker. Neither does he have difficulty or qualms about hosting the 
worst of Word-Faith teachers and promoting their agendas. </P>
<P>Rodney Lee Parsley charges back and forth across the stage of his World 
Harvest Church in Columbus, Ohio, sweating profusely, railing against the devil 
in a demonstration of heart-pounding Christian calisthenics and his crowds love 
it. They follow his lead, bouncing, swaying and screaming. It is raw 
pandemonium. They repeat whatever mantras he gives them to say, waiting to be 
smacked, pushed or pommeled to the floor by the “Raging Prophet.”</P>
<P>Though Parsley has difficulty, at times, pronouncing biblical names, his 
stride and jarring verbal onslaughts are unabated. He is definitely emerging as 
a key player and force to be reckoned with in the world of charismania. Parsley 
further demonstrates he has arrived among the rich and famous of the Charismatic 
world when he found himself featured in the cover story of <I>Charisma</I> 
magazine in March 1998. Parsley’s meetings are so out of control that he 
sometimes makes even faith healer Benny Hinn or Brownsville Revival evangelist 
Stephen Hill appear tame. </P>
<P>His preaching style and intonations are well likened to R.W. Schambach but 
revved-up considerably. His preaching raps are reminiscent of pseudo-evangelist 
Marjoe Gortner and, at times, he chops his way across the stage with a grimace 
reminding one of the old professional tag team, the Bushwhackers. No doubt about 
it, he is a showman <I>par excellance</I> and he has the moves to prove it.</P>
<P>Parsley melds the antics and craziness of the Toronto revival, the Pensacola 
(Brownsville) outpouring and the laughing revival of Rodney Howard-Browne. He 
shakes in some Word-Faith teaching and then uses Jesus as a prop to try to 
legitimize the whole thing. His followers seem to reason that the wilder the 
time, the more evidence of the work of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Even his Charismatic colleagues acknowledge his showman traits. 
<I>Charisma</I>, in its cover story, called him the “electric evangelist” and 
described him this way: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Part warrior, part cheerleader ... Parsley’s growing congregation and 
  nationwide audience have come to expect both sass and savvy from this 
  entertaining preacher. ... And he’s not afraid of shock-value preaching. ... 
  Parsley appears to be a good showman.”<SUP>1</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In actual fact, Parsley’s preaching does not have the shock value that his 
antics have.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>THE GENESIS OF A SHOWMAN </STRONG></P>
<P>In Parsley’s book, <I>The Backside of Calvary</I>, one can find within just 
two adjacent pages biographical information which is contradictory. However, 
while this segment of the book is not meant to be a detailed biography, 
tellingly absent is any reference to a conversion story. Moreover, it appears 
that Parsley has little, if any, formal ministerial training. He dropped out of 
school in his second year at Circleville Bible College. </P>
<P>The initial biographical information found in this volume states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Rod Parsley began his ministry as an energetic 21-year-old in the backyard 
  of his parent’s Ohio home. The fresh, ‘old-time gospel’ approach of Parsley’s 
  delivery immediately attracted a hungry, God-seeking 
audience.”<SUP>2</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yet, on the very next page, we read:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Rod Parsley began his ministry as an energetic 19-year-old, in the 
  backyard of his parent’s Ohio home.”<SUP>3</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>His family did not just provide a derivation for his ministry, but as we will 
see, Parsley’s backyard preaching efforts have grown into a lucrative, family 
business empire. </P>
<P>Parsley was an assistant to Lester Sumrall. Sumrall, who died in April 1996, 
claimed his anointing from Smith Wigglesworth.<SUP>4</SUP> In 1992, Sumrall 
supposedly passed his “sword of anointing” to Rod Parsley and his 
wife.<SUP>5</SUP> The idea of a “sword of anointing” is resurfacing as the 
latest Charismatic cliche. In Pensacola, at the Brownsville Assembly of God, 
they have actually used real swords to dramatize such a passing.</P>
<P>Christian Research Institute has issued a warning about Parsley, which 
reveals his disdain for formal Bible training:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Caution and discernment should be exercised when listening to Rod Parsley 
  because he considers himself to be a disciple of Lester Sumrall, who promotes 
  Word of Faith theology ... Also, his statement on TBN’s ‘Praise the Lord’ that 
  ‘exegesis X’s out Jesus’ (6/26/92) demonstrates an irresponsible perspective 
  toward the serious study of the Bible. This type of anti-intellectualism is 
  dangerous because it can lead to a faulty interpretation of God’s 
  Word.”<SUP>6</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><STRONG>ALL-POWERFUL</STRONG></P>
<P>The Hawaiian-based apologetic group, Let Us Reason Ministries, reports in its 
web site article, “Rod Parsley’s anointing,” just how powerful the rising 
evangelist believes himself to be:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Speaking about how the Lord told him people are bound, ‘I’m about to set 
  you free. Addictions that you had for years are about to fall off of you. I’m 
  telling you, you don’t have to do anything but just receive, that’s it. ... 
  this is your night, this is your night <B>as the high priest standing in this 
  Holy place</B>. I’m gonna put this shofar to my mouth and the moment I blow it 
  every demon is coming off your shoulders, outta your mind, outta your 
  finances. When I blow it I want you to shout like you never shouted a shout of 
  victory and freedom that you will ... are you ready?’ (He blows the whistle 
  and everyone is screaming.) There is only one high priest and that is Jesus if 
  it’s Parsley we’re in deep trouble. This is a perfect example of what Jesus 
  warned about in Mt. 24, many will say they are Christ (anointed). This 
  certainly implies him as our deliverer.”<SUP>7</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Parsley was also so bold as to tell the Church of God’s General Assembly in 
San Antonio that “I am superior to the forces of darkness.”<SUP>8</SUP> 
According to Jude 9, no one, not even the archangels of heaven, have the 
authority to speak this way. Jude goes on to say in verse 16 that false teachers 
use “great swelling words.” </P>
<P align=center><STRONG>EASIER THAN YOU THINK</STRONG></P>
<P>It takes no special gifts or talents to work people into a frenzy. What 
Parsley does can be done by anyone at all. These dynamics have been known for a 
long time; over 60 years ago, Elmer Clark explained how it all worked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The ground is laid for the gift of tongues by the well-known methods of 
  revival evangelism. Pratt finds the explanation of successful revivalism in 
  the laws of rhythm and crowd psychology. It is not to be supposed that 
  evangelists know much about psychological principles in the technical sense, 
  but by a process of trial and error many have become experts. Curiosity is 
  subtly turned into expectancy; the advance publicity usually ‘plays up’ 
  previous successes, and testimony figures prominently in sermons. The 
  successful evangelist gets <I>en rapport</I> with his audience quickly; he is 
  always a conservative in theology and sticks to themes on which the people are 
  agreed. He never argues, but uses repetition instead of 
logic.”<SUP>9</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Clark goes on to describe the other elements of mass manipulation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The denser the throng the more successful the revival. So much the better 
  if people are packed closely together; evangelists always crowd them into a 
  relatively small space, even if the room is only half-filled. Just as freedom 
  of bodily movement enhances the feeling of independence, so the loss of such 
  freedom in a dense crowd creates a sense of helplessness, which is conducive 
  to the breaking down of inhibitions. This is not peculiar to revivals; 
  cheerleaders know that there would be little rooting if the prospective 
  cheerers were scattered about in a half-filled stadium. Then in a crowd one 
  gains a sense of added power while the feeling of responsibility is weakened — 
  ‘Only the crowd is responsible and the crowd is big and strong and need not 
  fear. Hence the ordinary inhibitions of prudence and propriety are thrown off, 
  and the individual may act as a primitive being who has not reached the stage 
  of reflection.’ Autosuggestion operates powerfully under such circumstances, 
  aided and abetted by suggestion from the platform. Coe tells of an evangelist 
  who shouted, ‘See them coming! See them coming!’ when nobody had started 
  forward, a premeditated and fraudulent device of 
suggestion.”<SUP>10</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Our examination of Rod Parsley will be done against the backdrop of Scripture 
as we look at his checkered history, his crazed histrionics and his confused 
hermeneutics.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>ALL IN THE FAMILY</STRONG></P>
<P>First, we will consider the checkered history of the “Raging Prophet.” In 
1992, <I>The Columbus Dispatch</I> newspaper reported the filing of a lawsuit by 
48-year-old Naomil Endicott against Parsley and his father, claiming that the 
father had sexually harassed her and offered her money for sex with Parsley’s 
knowledge.<SUP>11</SUP> The woman is Parsley’s aunt and was an employee of his 
World Harvest Church.</P>
<P>A few months after the newspaper’s report, the <I>Columbus Monthly</I> 
magazine provided more of the details:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“But there is trouble in Parsley’s paradise. A church employee and Parsley 
  relative is suing over what she claims were repeated incidents of sexual 
  harassment by Parsley’s father. She says she sued rather than complain to 
  church officials because they punish boat-rockers. The Parsleys deny the 
  claims of harassment. And the apparent financial success of the church, 
  Parsley has acknowledged, has brought cries from members for a better 
  accounting of how donations are spent, something Parsley adamantly refuses to 
  provide.”<SUP>12</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tracing the twists and turns, the magazine further reveals:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“World Harvest is practically a family business. Parsley is president, and 
  his mother, Ellen, is secretary of World Harvest Church Inc. His father, 
  James, has worked in several capacities with the church since the 1970s, 
  mainly overseeing construction. In the lower ranks are assorted in-laws, 
  nieces and nephews of the Parsleys, with everyone helping each other out of 
  difficulties and spending time together off work. That family unity ruptured 
  in September when Parsley’s aunt, Naomil Endicott, filed suit in Franklin 
  County Municipal Court claiming James Parsley, her brother-in-law, had 
  sexually harassed her while she worked at the church. Endicott has been with 
  World Harvest Church from the beginning. Her brother, Ed Endicott, co-founded 
  in 1977 the Sunrise Chapel with Rod and James Parsley, and Ms. Endicott says 
  she began attending services regularly in 1979.”<SUP>13</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Endicott was asking for compensatory and punitive damages claiming to have 
secretly taped James Parsley twice making sexual comments to her. Damages could, 
it was reported, top $1 million.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>TAG TEAM </STRONG></P>
<P>Endicott was not the only one in court because of the Parsley father and son 
team:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Endicott’s suit is one of two facing Parsley and his father. In a civil 
  suit filed in Fairfield County Common Pleas Court, a former church member 
  named Lewis Bungard claims that in September 1991, Rod Parsley choked him and 
  James Parsley punched him in a dispute over some painting work Bungard had 
  done at the Parsleys’ homes. (Criminal assault charges were dropped against 
  Rod Parsley, and his father pleaded no contest to an assault charge, was found 
  guilty of disorderly conduct and fined $100 plus court costs.) Bungard also 
  charges that a $7000 donation he made to the church to build a home for unwed 
  mothers and a senior care center was used ‘for the enrichment of Rodney 
  Parsley, his parents and others so as to achieve an opulent lifestyle for 
  themselves.’”<SUP>14</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Neither of the Parsleys would grant interviews in early April 1995 when 
<I>The Columbus Dispatch</I> reported:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The pastor of the World Harvest Church and his father reached an 
  out-of-court settlement yesterday in a civil lawsuit filed in September 1992, 
  attorneys said. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, said Columbus 
  attorney Clifford O. Arnebeck, who represented Lewis Frederick Bungard of 
  Westerville.”<SUP>15</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It seems that a lot of Parsley’s money has gone, not to the Gospel, but to 
lawyers and disgruntled, abused parishioners.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>I DESERVE YOUR MONEY!</STRONG></P>
<P>Parsley tells his people they should believe for millions. He makes no 
apology for being mercenary:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Parsley is upfront with his congregation about the church’s need for 
  money. ‘I just love to talk about money,’ he told them. ‘I just love to talk 
  about your money. Let me be very clear — I want your money. I deserve it. This 
  church deserves it.’”<SUP>16</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, lawsuits can be costly. But there is more.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND SHAMELESS </STRONG></P>
<P>Regarding Parsley’s personal holdings, the <I>Columbus Monthly</I> magazine 
further discloses:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Parsley, his wife, Joni, and their two young children live in a 
  five-bedroom house they have built next to his parents’ house on a 21-acre 
  compound in northwest Fairfield County. The compound has an electronic gate at 
  the road to discourage uninvited visitors, and stables and a corral have been 
  built in one corner. Rod Parsley’s home is worth $857,090, say records at the 
  Fairfield County recorder’s office. His parents’ home, also new, is valued at 
  $831,480. Each was built with a $200,000 mortgage taken out in 1990. ... 
  Parsley also owns a $500,000 jet, a seven-passenger Hawker Siddeley 
  125.”<SUP>17</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now let us consider the histrionics of the “Raging Prophet.” The Scriptures 
state, “The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For God is not 
the author of confusion but of peace as in all the churches of the saints. ... 
Let all things be done decently and in order” (1 Corinthians 14:32-33, 40). 
Thus, according to Paul, order is a mark of God. James tells us that confusion 
is demonic (James 3:15-16).</P>
<P>Parsley flaunts his lack of submission to Scripture in his wild services. 
Viewing a Parsley meeting is more like looking at the scene in Exodus 32 when 
Moses came off the mountain to find the mob reveling and the people crazed and 
dancing. Decorum and order mark New Testament worship, not frenzy.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>YEAR OF JUBILEE</STRONG></P>
<P>Besides the general noise, screaming and general chaotic atmosphere of 
Parsley’s meetings, Pentecostal minister and apologist Joseph R. Chambers 
describes, in his web site’s article, other innovations of the “Raging Prophet” 
that add to the confusion and mass pandemonium:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“One of Parsley’s main themes during 1998 has been the idea of ‘celebration 
  within the context of a church service.’ He calls this the ‘Year of Jubilee’ 
  and somehow ties the idea to a supernatural harvest. During these services he 
  and the congregation put on their party hats and pull out their party whistles 
  and hoop and holler just like they were at a carnival. The House of God 
  becomes just as vile as a pagan temple celebrating the rites of fertility. 
  Jesus spoke to the Jewish leaders of His day and soundly rebuked them for 
  making the House of God a den of thieves. He would do the same today to those 
  defilers of the House of God. I can envision Him saying, ‘You have made the 
  House of God a playhouse of entertainment and folly.’ It is blasphemous. ... 
  In listening to different messages and reading material from Rod Parsley, 
  there is a constant sense of empty, noisy hype and fleshly manipulation. 
  Everything is geared to creating an altered, highly emotional atmosphere. 
  Individuals that think for themselves and reason from the Scripture would be 
  totally out of place. The people are told when to shout and when to 
  listen.”<SUP>18</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Party hats and party whistles? Parsley has missed entirely the biblical 
setting of the event. The Year of Jubilee was a decidedly <I>Jewish</I> practice 
found in Leviticus 25 and 27. It had to do with the very complicated legal 
instructions for the 50th year and the Israelites’ relationship to the land, 
debt and slaves. It has no parallel in the New Testament and only with a little 
imagination could we stretch it to prefigure the Millennial or eternal 
scene.<SUP>19</SUP> The jubilee teaching of Parsley, that we can believe and 
shout our way out of debt, is a scam and a sham, and does insult to the Word of 
God.</P>
<P>However, distorting God’s Word does not stop there as the “Raging Prophet” 
employs a repertoire of confusing hermeneutics. Parsley is a Word-Faith teacher. 
The basic premise of the Word-Faith idea is that faith is a force that we can 
use in our speaking, to get what we want. We can and should use creative words 
just like God did, (as He created the world from nothing by simply speaking it 
into existence). It is a neo-gnostic and <I>Star Wars</I> mentality.</P>
<P>In typical Word-Faith fashion Parsley teaches:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“In the beginning, He <I>spoke the Word</I>, and out of the nothingness of 
  space, there was suddenly — Life! Using just His <I>Word</I>, God invented the 
  sun, the moon, and endless galaxies of stars. ... If the Lord and His Word 
  never change, and if He created life with a spoken thought, then He is still 
  able to speak into existence whatever you need today. Healing is not hard. It 
  is as simple and easy as saying, ‘I believe your Word, Lord. Now speak. Create 
  new life in me.’”<SUP>20</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><STRONG>GET WHATEVER YOU WANT</STRONG></P>
<P>Note Parsley’s view, “It is as simple and easy as saying... .” He will go on 
to say we can cause the impossible to happen everyday.</P>
<P>The power that is attributed to God is then attributed to us. Our major 
reason for reading the Bible, Parsley says, is so that we can speak Bible 
phrases and bring blessings in existence:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Learning the Godly guarantees which deal with your situation and 
  rehearsing them over in your spirit will help you, like Peter, to possess the 
  kind of faith that makes the impossible an everyday occurrence. ... keep His 
  Words of faith and healing always before you.”<SUP>21</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Faith is not a force but is a word meaning trust. The objects of our trust 
are to be God and His Word. Paul, in Romans 10:17, clearly speaks of the object 
of our faith and trust and it is God’s Word. Believing what God has spoken and 
finding comfort in His promises is a far cry from taking what God has spoken and 
thinking we can create our own reality and get anything we want by just speaking 
it. </P>
<P>Henry Thiessen explains the components of biblical faith:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“(1) The Intellectual Element. This element includes belief in the 
  revelation of God in nature and in the historical facts of Scripture, and the 
  doctrines taught therein as to man’s sinfulness, the redemption provided in 
  Christ, the conditions to salvation and to all the blessings promised to God’s 
  children. ... (2) The Emotional Element ... We may define the emotional 
  element of faith as the awakening of the soul to its personal needs and to the 
  personal applicability of the redemption provided in Christ, together with an 
  immediate assent to these truths. ... (3) The Voluntary Element. This element 
  of faith is the logical outgrowth of the intellectual and the emotional. If a 
  man accepts the revelation of God and His salvation as true and comes to 
  assent to it as applicable to himself personally, he should logically go on to 
  appropriate it to himself.”<SUP>22</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To make faith mere conviction or to have faith be conviction without facts is 
to align with the likes of liberal rationalist Rudolph Bultmann.<SUP>23</SUP> 
Parsley’s “faith” is not true biblical faith. It is whistling in the dark.</P>
<P>We are told that Scriptures can speak comfort to us (Romans 15:4) and are to 
reprove, rebuke, correct and instruct us (2 Timothy 3:15-17), as we respond in 
faith and obedience to it but nowhere in the Bible are we told that if we will 
just speak Scripture out we can get what we want or create our own reality. We 
find in Genesis 1 that God <I>finished</I> creating and rested on the seventh 
day from all His labors. Creation, in the strict sense, is not going on now. 
</P>
<P>Remember too, that we are not little creators. The distinction between the 
Creator and what is created is sharp and clear in the Bible. Adam’s dominion 
over the Earth had to do with his ability and power to subdue animals and nature 
— not create. The Fall has limited our capacity to subdue as is evident in the 
number of deadly diseases and natural disasters that cripple us. But there is 
even a darker side to this. </P>
<P>The frightening aspect to all this is how close the Word-Faith definition of 
faith comes to the <I>credo of raw paganism</I>. Self-confessed killer, drug 
addict and would-be vampire Rod Ferrell, who was obviously delusional from drugs 
and occult reading, articulated his occultic belief and it parallels the 
illusions of the Word-Faith commitment. </P>
<P>Ferrell pontificated ideas that would be acceptable in any Word-Faith church 
when he said: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“You just have to believe it ... Anything you want to have happen, will 
  happen, ... You just have to want it hard enough.”<SUP>24</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Word-Faith view is that faith as a force — that is, words being powerful 
missiles of that force — is more in line with an occultic world view than a 
biblical one.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>CONQUER THE WORLD</STRONG></P>
<P>Parsley is also a dominionist. This too, grows out of the Word-Faith error. 
Dominionism teaches that powerful anointed men will bring in all the benefits 
(healings and miracles) of the millennium, creating a Utopia to which Christ 
will return. Somehow they will reverse the consequences of the Fall and totally 
subdue disease and the hard circumstances of life. </P>
<P>This teaching is also identified as “Manifest Sons of God” doctrine. It 
confuses glorification by intermingling it into the sanctification process. One 
cannot take glorification and arbitrarily impose it on the sanctification 
process. It is a grave and fundamental error that produces chaos. Sanctification 
is growth while glorification is completion or perfection, which comes in 
resurrection and the eternal state (Romans 8). Parsley no longer wants “a 
mansion over the hilltop,” he wants it here and now.</P>
<P>Parsley derives the dominion teaching not from Scripture but from a 
“prophecy” of the late evangelist-healer Tommy Hicks (1909-1973). Hicks held 
mass meetings in Argentina in the mid-1950s and was a friend of Juan 
Peron.<SUP>25</SUP> What should be alarming to any Christian is that Hicks 
seemed to be open to occultic phenomenon. </P>
<P>Hicks’ so-called prophecy<SUP>26</SUP> referred to by Parsley is wild 
imaginings of science fiction. He claims to have seen in a vision on July 25, 
1961, that a great anointed miracle army was then about to burst on the scene, 
healing multitudes and invulnerable to bullets and death. This unstoppable army 
would be miraculously transported from place to place. Hicks must have known 
about the occult phenomenon called astral projection. </P>
<P>Will man ever be invulnerable to death? According to 1 Corinthians 15, death 
will not be finally destroyed until Jesus comes. Here, almost 40 years later, 
Hicks’ imminent army has not shown up.</P>
<P>In the May 28, 1999, installment of his daily program (filmed in a replica of 
the Upper Room in Jerusalem, Israel), Parsley predicted a new “wave” coming that 
would empty out hospitals and anoint seemingly ordinary believers. The new wave 
or as it is sometime called, “the new thing,” has been touted for over 50 years 
(over a decade longer than Parsley has been living) and goes back to the 
heretical Latter Rain Movement of the late 1940s,<SUP>27</SUP> which, by the 
way, was condemned by the Assemblies of God until recently. </P>
<P>On the program, Parsley appealed to the Hicks “prophecy” and added the twist 
that we are not to look to the Book of Acts, but to a far greater, future day of 
miracles. Parsley’s claim is that there is an end-time Church coming greater 
than the Church of the Apostles, which will routinely heal the sick and raise 
the dead.</P>
<P>Telling people to turn away from the Bible, the Book of Acts and the former 
Apostles and Prophets and to believe men’s “prophecies” as Parsley does, is a 
major slide to error and deception. After all, if it is not in the Bible, how do 
we know it’s true? End-time restorationism is a chimera and a myth.</P>
<P>Occult researcher Kurt Koch names Tommy Hicks as dealing in “psychic shock 
effects” and found that his claimed healings did not last.<SUP>28</SUP> Though 
Koch was open to the possibility of miraculous healing, he was convinced that 
men such as Hicks did not measure up and moved more in the realm of the psychic 
and suggestive.<SUP>29</SUP></P>
<P>Dominionism, with its new breed of prophets, is a convoluted postmillennial 
scheme that makes man the Messiah and focal point. Historically, 
postmillennialism taught that the universal spread of the Gospel along with 
Christian preaching and teaching would be the moral dynamic of bringing in the 
kingdom.<SUP>30</SUP> Historical postmillennialism is Word-centered and 
Gospel-centered, not man-centered. Dominionism is prideful and humanistic, 
centering on self-appointed “super prophets and super apostles” who bring in the 
Kingdom. It totally confuses Christ and the Church.</P>
<P>Albert James Dager, of the apologetic ministry Media Spotlight, says Dominion 
teaching is predicated on three basic beliefs:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“1) Satan usurped man’s dominion over the earth through the temptation of 
  Adam and Eve; 2) The Church is God’s instrument to take dominion back from 
  Satan; 3) Jesus cannot or will not return until the Church has taken dominion 
  by gaining control of the earth’s governmental and social 
  institutions.”<SUP>31</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Michael Moriarty further explains Dominionism and Parsley’s connection:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“In any event, the new charismatics continue to stress the need for the 
  church to exercise dominion over society. Power-packed conferences like 
  Dominion ‘90 (July 29-Aug. 3, 1990), hosted by Pastor Rod Parsley and World 
  Harvest Church in Columbus, Ohio, serve to raise the consciousness of the 
  church to the responsibility to take dominion over society. Some charismatics 
  claim that ‘God told them’ that Jesus will return in our generation ‘if’ the 
  church becomes more responsible in its dominion 
pursuit.”<SUP>32</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Since it will take the power and the mighty coming of Jesus to establish the 
Kingdom, dominionism is a figment of man’s imagination though a lucrative one. 
It’s a tired old hat that is preached <I>ad infinitum</I> by the likes of other 
Pentecostal superstars as well, including Benny Hinn, Kenneth Hagin and Rodney 
Howard-Browne. The “day of creative miracles” or “the day of dominion” is always 
just on the horizon, but it never seems to arrive. It is, in part, the bait 
which keeps the devotees of these Charismatic leaders perpetually nipping at 
their hooks.<SUP>33</SUP></P>
<P>So many of the “healers” have died of major illnesses (and the living ones 
have sicknesses) that their teachings are a joke to those who know better. A 
genuine and thorough reading of the Book of Revelation leaves no doubt that it 
is the “King of Kings and Lord of Lords” who will bring in the perfect and final 
Kingdom (Revelation 19:11-20:5). Man cannot miraculously recreate the earth and 
bring in heaven.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>HOLY RAGS: THE NEW RELICS</STRONG></P>
<P>Another staple of the Parsley ministry is the use of prayer cloths. Because 
this gimmick has become so widespread, Inner-City Christian Discernment Ministry 
has begun to catalog and collect prayer cloths from different healing 
ministries. Just the names associated with this outlandish fraud ought to make 
one leery: Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, Peter Popoff, Rod Parsley, Jim 
Whittington and others. ICCDM describes Parsley’s use of the relic:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Rod Parsley is a fast rising star in Pentecostal/charismatic circles. ... 
  sent right to my home is a glossy packet stating ‘<I>Release the anointing ... 
  Receive Your Miracle.’</I> Lo-and-behold enclosed is a <U>MIRACLE PRAYER 
  CLOTH</U> and I am supposed to: (1) <B>RECEIVE</B> this prayer cloth as your 
  point of contact (2) <B>PLACE</B> this prayer cloth in the envelope provided 
  and (3) <B>BELIEVE</B> God to receive YOUR miracle ... I am to do these 3 
  things and RUSH my <U>MIRACLE PRAYER CLOTH</U> back to Pastor Rod (hopefully 
  with a donation) and wait for my miracle to manifest. ‘<I>As you send me your 
  prayer cloth and your most generous gift toward our Breakthrough ministry, I 
  will send you my 3-tape audio cassette series, ”Releasing the Anointing ... 
  Your Breakthrough to Victory.“‘</I> <B>This is nothing but a shameless con to 
  transfer dollars from the pockets of God’s people who in many cases have a 
  </B><B><U>genuine need</U></B><B> but lack biblical understanding and thus 
  fall prey to ministers of this type.”</B><SUP>34</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><STRONG>DOING THE TWIST</STRONG></P>
<P>Parsley may make a weak appeal to Acts 19:12 but only serious Scripture 
twisting can make it fit. Verse 11 specifically says that this was unusual (as 
was the one-time event of touching the hem of Christ’s garment or creating 
loaves and fishes). Paul did not send out cloths to have people send them back 
for a corporate anointing as described in the literature of Parsley. This 
unusual or extraordinary miracle was just that, a very uncommon occurrence. </P>
<P>Stressing the uniqueness of the Acts 19 event, Albert Barnes says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>“Special miracles.</I> Miracles that were remarkable; that were not 
  common, or that were very unusual (<I>ou tas tuchousas</I>.) This expression 
  is classic Greek.”<SUP>35</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To further underscore the dramatic one-time nature of Acts 19:11-12, Thomas 
Edgar points out:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The word for miracles (<I>dunamis</I>) occurs ten times and does not occur 
  after Acts 19:11. ... The frequency of miracle-working seems to have been on a 
  decline during the lifetime of the apostles.”<SUP>36</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Steve Febbraro, in an Internet article entitled “Rod Parsley and Acts 19 — 
‘Send In The Cloths’,” concludes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Is the practice of sending prayer cloths biblical? No! Is the practice of 
  praying over prayer cloths biblical? No! Does Acts 19, teach anything of a 
  ‘corporate anointing?’ No! Instead of validating Parsley’s prayer cloth 
  dictum, Acts 19 disproves his teaching on every point. This particular error 
  is so glaring that anyone who takes the time to read Acts 19 will discover 
  these errors for themselves. Folks, keep your cloths at home. Use them to dust 
  furniture. Or if you have already sent a cloth in, maybe the next one you 
  decide to send in should be used to dust off your Bible 
  instead.”<SUP>37</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sir Robert Anderson so vividly reminds us:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“I may add that among Christians it is pestilently evil to make the 
  exceptional experience of some the rule of faith for all. The Word of God is 
  our guide, and not the experience of fellow-Christians; and when this is 
  ignored the practical consequences are disastrous. The annals of ‘faith 
  healing,’ as it is called, are rich in cases of mimetic or hysterical disease, 
  but about the spiritual wreckage due to failures innumerable they are 
  silent.”<SUP>38</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In the popular film trilogy, <I>Back to the Future</I>, lead character Marty 
McFly goes back in time. The Church is going back in time to the Dark Ages in 
following the antics of Parsley and others. Philip Schaff recounts that in 
Europe, circulated pieces of linen were considered holy and miraculous because 
they had come into contact with the dead bodies of saints.<SUP>39</SUP> These 
relics and holy rags are no better than Parsley’s “prayer cloths” supposedly 
made holy by his touch and the corporate anointing of others. It is 
superstitious nonsense. </P>
<P align=center><STRONG>KILLING THE DEVIL?</STRONG></P>
<P>Another misleading and dangerous practice that Parsley promotes is the 40-day 
fast. He claims that the 40-day fast is going to become commonplace in the life 
of a believer. Parsley claims to have led 6000 people in a 40-day fast with the 
following benefits:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“... you kill Beelzebub, <U>you kill the fly father</U>, the cycle of the 
  birthing process of the fly is forty days. That’s the reason stuff you got rid 
  of comes back ... You didn’t kill the larvae. But God said you fast 40 days. 
  When you spray a field, you spray it for 40 days. It not only kills the flies 
  but the ones they were gonna give birth to.”<SUP>40</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So here we have the teaching that we can kill Beelzebub (Satan) and his demon 
offspring (as if Satan gave birth to demons). Since Parsley and a cast of 6000 
have accomplished such a pretentious effort, are not Satan and his offspring 
annihilated? Totally gone? Why would anyone else have to fast? </P>
<P>First of all, spirits cannot be killed (Luke 20:36). Secondly, the final end 
of Satan is recorded for us in the Book of Revelation. It will be accomplished 
by our all-powerful Savior Jesus Christ. The weapons of our warfare are 
described in Ephesians 6 and a 40-day fast is not there. In spite of Parsley’s 
rantings, Satan’s demons cannot be killed by believers. </P>
<P align=center><STRONG>DANGER AHEAD</STRONG></P>
<P>The 40-day fast is a dangerous practice promoted in the <I>Dake Annotated 
Study Bible</I> (and by aberrant groups such as the End-Time Handmaidens). In a 
previous edition of <I>The Quarterly Journal</I>, PFO examined the numerous 
heresies promoted by the controversial <I>Dake Annotated Study Bible</I>. We 
noted that Finis Dake believed and taught that the prolonged fasts expelled all 
toxic poisons from the body and left the breath as sweet as a baby’s. We also 
noted that Jews fasted once a week with documentation that the Jewish fast was 
simply cutting down on amounts of food and was never understood to be 
total.<SUP>41</SUP> Further, there were only five fasts commanded in the Old 
Testament. Colossians would militate against required fasting. </P>
<P>Forty days of fasting was out of the ordinary, not normative. It was 
miraculous, not routine. Brad Young touches on the facts:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Like Moses and Elijah, who fasted for forty days, Jesus abstains from both 
  food and water, relying on divine sustenance during this period. ... Thus it 
  was considered miraculous for someone to go without food and water for forty 
  days. Only God could sustain Jesus for such a 
fast.”<SUP>42</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In allowing this written record of the event, Jesus was showing His Jewish 
audience that He was at least on a par with the greatest of their Prophets. What 
would it show if everyone could do it? Apparently Jesus did this only once that 
we know.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>SIN SICK BLOOD</STRONG> </P>
<P>Parsley also has a strange view of sin, human blood and the blood of Christ. 
Parsley teaches that sin is in the physical blood. He says of Adam: “That single 
exposure to Satan was all that was needed to transmit the communicable disease 
of sin into the bloodline of humanity.”<SUP>43</SUP> </P>
<P>The Scriptures are silent as to exactly where sin and the sin nature is 
located. Christ spoke of sin coming out of “the heart of man” and meant man’s 
innermost being (Matthew 15:18-20). He did not say sin is in the blood. It is 
unwise to speak where Scripture is silent. Out of this first error Parsley 
builds his second error regarding sin in the blood of Jesus.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>JESUS — SINNER OR SINLESS?</STRONG></P>
<P>Parsley teaches that Jesus was “injected” with sin and that His blood once 
tainted by sin became immunized and then capable of giving us salvation and 
healing. At the outset he mistakes identification for identity. </P>
<P>As he puts it:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The nails that pounded into Christ’s hands and feet that day ‘injected’ 
  Him with every blatant iniquity, every subtle sin, every vile act that mankind 
  had ever or would ever commit.”<SUP>44</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Bible never hints in any way that Christ’s blood changed in composition. 
It is just called blood throughout the Scriptures. Peter called it “precious 
blood” (1 Peter 1:19) and Paul calls it God’s own blood (Acts 20:28). In the 
resurrection it appears that the glorified body did not depend on a blood supply 
(Luke 24:39). That Christ <I>shed</I> His blood is the all important factor.</P>
<P>Yet Parsley says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Hanging from those nails, Jesus was also deliberately infected with all 
  manner of sickness and sin, so to bring about salvation and healing, through 
  His divine, immunized blood.”<SUP>45</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Parsley comes perilously close to saying Jesus became a sinner. </P>
<P>Though Parsley does not mention 2 Corinthians 5:21, he may be like other 
Word-Faith proponents confusing its meaning. Paul says: “For He made Him who 
knew no sin to be sin for us that we might be the righteousness of God.”</P>
<P>How could Jesus “be sin for us”? This has always been understood by all major 
commentators and commentaries to relate to the sin offering of the Old 
Testament. It means that Jesus became a sin offering for us, not that He had to 
become inherently sinful or carry sin in His blood. Nothing intrinsically 
changed in the sacrificial lamb. Isaiah 53:5 tells us that the chastisement of 
our peace was “upon” Him, not “in” Him. Isaiah 53:6 says the Lord laid our 
iniquity “on” Him not “in” Him. Blood that becomes infected with everyone’s sin 
and disease and then is somehow immunized is a figment of Parsley’s imagination. 
</P>
<P>J.R. Dummelow shares the sense of 2 Corinthians 5:21:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>“Made him</B> <I>to be</I> <B>sin for us</B>] Christ had to bear not the 
  guilt, but the burden of sin. He bore its penalty not as a punishment, but as 
  the innocent suffers for the guilty; feeling all its shame and horror, but 
  free from the sense of guilt and degradation. Hence St. Paul says not, ‘He 
  hath made Him to be a sinner’ but ‘He hath made Him to be 
  sin.’”<SUP>46</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Reminding us that 2 Corinthians also says, “He knew no sin,” Albert Barnes 
notes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Literally it is, ‘he has made him sin, or a sin offering,’ ... Nor (2) can 
  it mean that he was <I>a sinner</I>, for it is said in immediate connection 
  that he ‘knew no sin’ and it is everywhere said he was holy, harmless, 
  undefiled. ... if the declaration that he was made ‘sin’ (<I>hamartian</I>) 
  does not mean that he was sin itself, or a sinner, or guilty, then it must 
  mean that he was a <I>sin-offering</I> — an offering or a sacrifice for sin; 
  and this is the interpretation which is now generally adopted by 
  expositors.”<SUP>47</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Adam Clarke gets into the linguistics of 2 Corinthians 5:21:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“...it signifies a ‘sin offering,’ or ‘sacrifice for sin,’ and answers to 
  the <I>chattaah</I> and <I>chattath</I> of the Hebrew text; which signifies 
  both ‘sin’ and ‘sin offering’ in a great variety of places in the Pentateuch. 
  The Septuagint translate the Hebrew word by <I>hamartia</I> in ninety-four 
  places in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, where a ‘sin offering’ is meant; and 
  where our version translates the word, not ‘sin,’ but an ‘offering for sin.’ 
  Had our translators attended to their own method of translating the word in 
  other places where it means the same as here, they would not have given this 
  false view of a passage which has been made the foundation of a most 
  blasphemous doctrine; viz., that our sins were imputed to Christ, and that He 
  was a proper Object of the indignation of divine justice, because He was 
  blackened with imputed sin; and some have proceeded so far in this blasphemous 
  career as to say that Christ may be considered as the greatest of sinners, 
  because all the sins of mankind, or of the elect, as they say, were imputed to 
  Him, and reckoned as His own. Thus they have confounded sin with the 
  punishment due to sin.”<SUP>48</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Jesus did not have to have His blood infected or immunized. All He had to do 
was <I>shed</I> it. Jesus Himself said: “This cup is the new covenant in My 
blood, which is <I>shed</I> for you” (Luke 22:20).</P>
<P>Leon Morris rightly observes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“When the evidence is surveyed as a whole, there can be no reasonable 
  doubt. Blood points not to life set free, but to life given up in 
  death.”<SUP>49</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><STRONG>HEALING ON DEMAND?</STRONG></P>
<P>To say that Jesus had to suffer all our diseases on the cross is an old error 
referred to as healing in the atonement. While healing <I>is</I> in the 
atonement in the <I>ultimate</I> sense (Romans 8 and Revelation 21), the full 
benefits of glorified, deathless bodies will only be realized in heaven. We owe 
everything (all spiritual and physical blessings) to the atonement of Jesus but 
we do not receive all of those blessings right now. Scripture makes that 
abundantly clear. </P>
<P>Parsley has evidence in his own home that his teaching on healing is off-base 
— <I>his son Austin has been diagnosed “with Asberger Syndrome, a 
high-functioning form of autism</I>.”<SUP>50</SUP> God has provided evidence of 
Parsley’s own errors but for whatever reason he refuses to see it. It is sad 
that Parsley can so compartmentalize that he lays teaching on his followers but 
has a different reality at home. Parsley shared in a sermon televised last June 
4 that his son was diagnosed at the Cleveland Clinic and reports while he is 
making improvement, “we’re not all the way out of the woods but we’re on our 
way.” </P>
<P>Added to that is the fact that as much as Parsley rants about God’s Kingdom 
come in our body, he still has a deaf section and a signer in his church. As 
kindly as we can, we say, <I>physician heal thyself</I>.</P>
<P>Richard Mayhue, Dean of Master’s Seminary in Sun Valley, California, dissects 
the false teaching of healing in the atonement (that is, that healing can be 
claimed now just as forgiveness of sins is claimed) in his book <I>The Healing 
Promise</I>. </P>
<P>Mayhue carefully exegetes the Scriptures, especially Isaiah 53, to give us 
his views:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Both Leviticus and Hebrews demonstrate that in God’s mind the atonement 
  dealt primarily with sin, not sickness. It had everything to do with our sin 
  problem and the redemption needed to remove sin so that we might stand 
  eternally before a holy God. Christ’s atonement paid the due penalty for sin, 
  which involved God’s wrath being poured out upon Jesus Christ. Clearly the 
  major emphasis of Isaiah 53 centers on spiritual 
salvation.”<SUP>51</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then Mayhue unpackages the word “iniquity”:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Note that the word ‘iniquity’ is used four times in Isaiah 53 and 
  identifies the passage’s major emphasis. In 53:5, Christ was crushed for our 
  iniquities. According to 53:6, the Lord ‘has caused the iniquity of us all to 
  fall on Him.’ He will bear our iniquities (53:11), and He Himself bore the 
  sins of many (53:12; cf. Hebrews 9:28). <I>The primary thrust of Isaiah 53 is 
  on the spiritual and the eternal effects of sin</I>, not on its physical and 
  immediate effects upon the body.”<SUP>52</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Further Mayhue shows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“We could look at such godly examples as Abraham, Isaac, Daniel, Paul and 
  Timothy to show that God’s greatest saints endured sicknesses and also 
  eventually died. Therefore we can biblically conclude that while there is a 
  related aspect of physical healing in the atonement, it won’t be applied until 
  <I>after</I> death and the redemption of our bodies by resurrection (Romans 
  8:23).”<SUP>53</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mayhue then presents this summary:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Isaiah 53 refers to the atonement and its redemptive value, not its 
  therapeutic effect in a physical sense. Four lines of evidence support this 
  conclusion: 1. The idea of the atonement in Leviticus and Hebrews clearly 
  applies to salvation. 2. The context of Isaiah 53 focuses primarily on the 
  atonement’s provision for sin. 3. The theological context of Christ’s death 
  and salvation centers on sin. 4. Matthew, Peter and the Ethiopian eunuch 
  understood Isaiah 53 in reference to sin. All the scriptural evidence affirms 
  that Isaiah 53 deals with the spiritual being of man. Its major emphasis is on 
  sin, not sickness. It focuses on the moral cause of sickness, which is sin, 
  and not the immediate removal of one of sin’s results — 
  sickness.”<SUP>54</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When it is all said and done, Parsley preaches a different Gospel. Paul 
clearly defines the Gospel in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Paul says in verse 1: “I 
declare to you the Gospel.” In declaring the Gospel, Paul then defines it “that 
Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried and 
that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.” The objective 
side of the Gospel is all that Jesus purchased for us in His death and 
resurrection. The experimental side of the Gospel is that when we trust in 
Christ and Christ alone, all the eternal merits of Christ — sins forgiven, a 
place in God’s family, and an ultimate resurrection become ours. </P>
<P>Parsley, in his book, <I>Renamed and Redeemed</I>, asserts: “JESUS IS NOT 
SICK — I DON’T HAVE TO BE SICK.”<SUP>55</SUP> Yes, but Jesus is God — God 
immortal and glorified. I am not God — I am not immortal or glorified — yet. And 
I will never be God.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>GOSPEL OF GOLD AND GREED</STRONG></P>
<P>Parsley’s “gospel” is the gospel of prosperity. He claims that the Gospel is 
our ability to work miracles and be rich. It is a distortion of the worst kind. 
His “good news” is that the poor can be wealthy.</P>
<P>In <I>God’s Answer to Insufficient Funds</I>, Parsley affirms his false 
gospel:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“For you to sit in physical bondage is to deny the power of the gospel. ... 
  Most people would have no trouble shouting whatsoever if I said, ‘To remain in 
  the bondage of sin and death is to deny the power of the gospel.’ But if I 
  said ‘What about healing for your body?’ the amens would not be quite so loud. 
  If I said the same thing about poverty and financial bondage, it would get as 
  quiet as a tomb. If I said that for you to live from paycheck to paycheck is 
  to deny the power of the gospel, many of you would get angry. In Luke 4:18 ... 
  Notice there was an anointing to preach good news to the poor. A lot of people 
  don’t like to look at that because good news to a poor man is that he doesn’t 
  have to be poor anymore. We have multitudes saved, delivered and filled with 
  the Holy Ghost, and many are healed, yet over 90% of the church of Jesus 
  Christ are living in absolute financial bondage. All the while, Jesus is 
  saying, ‘I’ve been anointed to preach the good news to the poor.’ ... You have 
  held back the flow. You have denied the perpetual propulsion of power that 
  could deliver you from not only sin and sickness but from the horrible stench 
  of poverty.”<SUP>56</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So the Gospel in Parsley’s view is telling the poor man “he doesn’t have to 
be poor anymore.” Poverty is a stench. He is confusing gold with God. Jesus 
never said there was anything sinful about being poor. In fact, He warned that 
being rich may throw one into idolatry: “No man can serve two masters. ... you 
cannot serve God and mammon” (Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13). We may seek to relieve 
poverty and improve our lot but Paul reminded us of the dangers and snares that 
accompany riches (1 Timothy 6:9-10).</P>
<P>Parsley teaches that the tithe and offering are “seed.” If we sow our seed, 
we can expect a huge financial return. In fact, we will not only double and 
triple our money, we will get it back one hundred times:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“People have said that it’s selfish to ask God to give a hundredfold return 
  on the seeds sown in the financial realm. No it’s selfish <I>not</I> to expect 
  the hundredfold return. ... The anointing is on the seed. If you will divest, 
  God will invest.”<SUP>57</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>God is recast as almost a Wall Street broker. </P>
<P>This is a shocking example of blatant promotion of greed. Our prayer ought to 
be:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Remove falsehood and lies far from me; Give me neither poverty nor riches 
  — Feed me with the food allotted to me; Lest I be full and deny you, And say, 
  ‘who is the Lord?’ Or lest I be poor and steal, and profane the name of my 
  God” (Proverbs 30:8-9).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Did Jesus promise Paul material riches and health? In Acts 9:16, Jesus says: 
“I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name’s sake.” Paul 
reminds us that we are “blessed with every <I>spiritual</I> blessing in the 
heavenly places in Christ” (Ephesians 1:3). </P>
<P align=center><STRONG>MISSING THE POINT </STRONG></P>
<P>Parsley further misleads by improperly defining words. He claims that: “The 
Greek word translated salvation here [Romans 1:16] is the word ‘sozo’. It means 
‘complete deliverance’.”<SUP>58</SUP> The word salvation is actually the Greek 
word <I>soteria</I>.<SUP>59</SUP> <I>Soza</I> is translated “save” or to save, 
and like <I>soteria</I> can mean a number of different things depending on the 
context. It can mean deliverance from danger but William E. Vine lays out the 
primary usages of <I>soza</I>: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“(<I>a</I>) of material and temporal deliverance from danger, suffering, 
  etc., ... (<I>b</I>) of the spiritual and eternal salvation granted 
  immediately by God to those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, ... 
  (<I>c</I>) of the present experiences of God’s power to deliver from the 
  bondage of sin, ... (<I>d</I>) of the future deliverance of believers at the 
  Second Coming of Christ for His saints, ... (<I>e</I>) of the deliverance of 
  the nation of Israel at the Second Advent of Christ, ... (<I>f</I>) 
  inclusively for all the blessings bestowed by God on men in 
  Christ.”<SUP>60</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After reading of the richness and fullness that Vine unfolds, we can see that 
Parsley has short-changed us to try to get across his limited view to bolster 
his false gospel of prosperity and healing on demand. </P>
<P>Parsley can scream, shout, stomp, prance, obfuscate and mislead but it is all 
noise and no substance. It is froth without real content which helps to pump 
money into his empire. </P>
<P>By contrast, Jesus was gentle and would not cry out nor lift His voice in the 
streets (Matthew 12:19-20). Jesus, as well, was <I>truth</I>. No one could be 
more unlike Jesus in his raging, his legal settlements, his false teaching, his 
lavish lifestyle and his false gospel than Rod Parsley. </P>
