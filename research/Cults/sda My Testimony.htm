      </SPAN>My wife and I were baptized into the Decatur, IL SDA Church in 
      1958, after taking the SDA Voice of Prophecy Bible Correspondence Studies 
      and a series of studies with the SDA Pastor. I became a representative for 
      Christian Record Braille Foundation, which is Adventist work for the 
      blind.&nbsp; I left the Christian Record in 1962 as I did not like being 
      away from my family all week and just seeing them on the weekends. I then 
      went to work for Purdue University and retired after 31 years in 1994, I 
      was employed as a Technical Assistant for Aeronautical and Nuclear 
      Engineering. <B><O:P></O:P></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B>Why I Left the SDA Church</B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">I was a third generation SDA 
      before leaving Adventism. People that leave any church have various 
      reasons for leaving. Some leave because of politics, hurt feelings by 
      fellow members, others by pressure from family members or loved ones, and 
      some because of doctrine. In my case it was because of doctrine that my 
      wife and I left. We could no longer be true to the Word of God and accept 
      the Bible contradictions of Ellen White.</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">I was a member for 37 years 
      till 1994 and held offices as Elder, SS Teacher, building chairman, etc. I 
      also did volunteer work for the Indiana Conference as well as holding a 
      seminar for the Conference on "How to give Bible Studies". I gave Bible 
      studies to many people that were baptized into the church. My son and 
      grandsons attended SDA schools. I share this information with you so that 
      you will be aware that I am thoroughly familiar with Adventist's 
      beliefs.</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">I was thoroughly convinced 
      that I was in the true "remnant church." We had the "Spirit of Prophecy" 
      and "the testimony of Jesus" which are the writings of Ellen White. With 
      that premise I understood the Bible as interpreted by EGW. After all she 
      was God's prophet to his last day church I was taught.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">It was about 1985, that I 
      began questioning EGW's work. I was taught that she had a third grade 
      education and all her wonderful books came from&nbsp;God and her teachings 
      were just as inspired as the Bible prophets.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
      <P class=MsoBodyTextIndent><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: windowtext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      In 1985 I became aware of Ellen G. White's plagiarism by SDA Pastor Walter 
      Rea. Rea showed in his book, "The White Lie" that EGW used the works of 
      uninspired authors and did not give them credit, while EGW claimed her 
      words were shown her by an angel or from the throne of God. By this EGW 
      was a liar and never publicly repented of her sin.<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time before this 
      Adventist Pastor Dr. Desmond Ford had shown that EGW's sanctuary doctrine 
      including the Investigative Judgment was without Bible foundation. Most 
      SDA scholars agreed with Ford that it is not biblical. There are no 
      non-SDA Bible Scholars that can find a Bible basis for EGW's Sanctuary 
      doctrine.</P>
      <P class=MsoBodyText style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">This caused me to research 
      what EGW really taught to see if was in harmony with the Bible and 
      history. I found that EGW often contradicted the Bible and history and 
      this was unacceptable to me. I found that EGW was wrong on the October 22, 
      1844 date as the Day of Atonement and history shows it was <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/Day_of_Atonement.htm">September 23, 
      1844. </A>&nbsp;I found that the Day of Atonement was completed in full at 
      Calvary and did not begin in 1844 with a Investigative Judgment.&nbsp;</P>
      <P class=MsoBodyText style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Because of the 
      non-biblical teachings of EGW I could no longer believe that the SDA 
      church is God's true church on earth. In fact the Bible does not list any 
      denomination as a true or "remnant" church. I was reminded that Jesus and 
      the Apostles taught Christians not to follow after false prophets.</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">It was disappointing to find 
      that EGW and the leaders of Adventism had misled me by believing that they 
      had "the truth". However, I rejoice that I no longer have to live by the 
      non-biblical baggage of Ellen White.</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">It was difficult for me to 
      deal with the Bible contradictions of Ellen G. White in Sabbath School 
      Class that I was teaching. Some would quote her writings as if it were 
      Scripture giving no thought that they were Bible contradictions. For 
      example, a class member would say that, "babies and saints will have wings 
      in the resurrection." I would then say, "the Bible says we will have a 
      body just like Christ and there is no record of him having wings." Or they 
      would quote EGW saying, "we cannot say that we are saved." And I would 
      say, "how is it that Paul could say that there was a crown laid up for him 
      and those that love his appearing"?</P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The pastor was continually quoting EGW in 
      his sermons as an authority with the Bible and mixing EGW's writings with 
      the Bible. Sometimes he would not give Ellen credit as his source and for 
      example he would say, "Peter led Mary Magdalene into sin." After the 
      service I would ask, "where is the Bible text for this?" He would not even 
      give me a reply. I could no longer sit in church and listen to the Word of 
      God being integrated with the myths of Ellen G. White. In fact it took 
      about two years after leaving the church to come to a point of 
      understanding if what I knew was from the Bible or from EGW. My wife would 
      ask me at times is that teaching from Ellen G. White or the Bible?</P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">My last Sabbath was October 1994. The 
      denomination was celebrating the 150th year of the October 23, 1844 fiasco 
      Sanctuary doctrine. The local church had invited a SDA Pastor to give the 
      sermon on the Sanctuary. He dressed up in the High Priest's robe and had a 
      large model Sanctuary setup on a table. When I looked into the sanctuary 
      after Sabbath School and saw this, I asked myself, why in the world am I 
      going to sit for an hour or more and listen to this garbage. I just walked 
      out never to return to be indoctrinated. I felt like to stay and listen, 
      would be like sitting in a Jehovah Witness or Latter Day Saint cult 
      meeting. I did go back a couple times for funerals held in the church to 
      pay my respects. </P>

      <P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">So

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revelation 19:10 tells us 
      that the "testimony of Jesus" is the "spirit of prophecy." According to 
      the Bible, neither Ellen G. White nor her writings are the Spirit of 
      Prophecy. The "Spirit of Prophecy" is a name the Seventh-day Adventist 
      Church gave to EGW, but it did not come from<B> </B>God. Think about it, 
      if what SDAs tell us is true, then for two thousand years (until the SDA 
      church arrived in the 1860's) there was no true church and people could 
      not understand their Bibles -- even though Jesus had promised His people 
      would have the Holy Spirit to guide them into all truth (John 16:13). I am 
      sure you do not believe that the Spirit of Prophecy did not exist until 
      Ellen White came on the scene.<O:P> </O:P></I></P>

      only&nbsp;remnant people of God. God's remnant people today, as in ages 
      past, are all those who&nbsp;worship Him in spirit and truth, and is not a 
      denomination.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      her&nbsp;writings are the "Spirit of Prophecy," since they contradict 
      Scripture.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      believe when He ascended to heaven He sat on the throne with His Father in

      Investigative Judgment. I do not believe the 1844 Investigative 
      Judgment&nbsp;is Biblical. According to Paul the saints of Hebrews 11 were 
      already assured of&nbsp;salvation almost 2,000 years before 1844. For 
      example, God&nbsp;commended Abel as&nbsp;a "righteous man" without having 
      to wait&nbsp;until 1844 to discover that fact.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      there&nbsp;are no Priests or Levites in the Seventh-day Adventist church,

      ministry by tithe.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
