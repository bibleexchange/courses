<H3>Leadership</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/wimber/"><B>John 
Wimber</B></A> -- No one doubts that the central figure behind the Vineyard was 
John Wimber (died 11/17/97 at 63 years of age). After Wimber's conversion, he 
became active at a "Friends church" (Quaker). Later, he joined its staff but 
became disillusioned with the local church. During this time, Wimber was a 
dispensationalist who rejected the "charismatic gifts" as viable for today. 
Wimber left the church and took a position at the Fuller Institute of Church 
Growth. While teaching at Fuller, as a result of personal experience and 
testimonies of happenings among Christians in the Third World, Wimber "felt 
compelled to reexamine Scripture, looking more carefully at the relationship 
between spiritual gifts and evangelism" (<I>Power Evangelism</I>, p. 85). In 
1978, he returned to the pastorate at one of the branch churches of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/calvary/chapel.htm">Calvary 
Chapel</A> (mildly charismatic). During the first year of that pastorate, he 
began praying for supernatural healing of his people. Nothing happened for ten 
months; then one day a woman was "healed." This was the beginning of the "signs 
and wonders movement" (pp. 90-91). In 1982, because of sharp differences, 
Wimber's church broke from Calvary Chapel and was renamed the Vineyard Christian 
Fellowship.</P>
<P><B>C. Peter Wagner</B> -- Wagner has long been recognized as an authority in 
both world missions and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/cgrowth/">church 
growth</A>. He was drawn towards signs and wonders by observing that church 
growth was most rapid among the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/">Pentecostal and 
charismatic</A> ranks, especially in the Third World. <SPAN 
style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Wagner's obsession with demons and "signs and 
wonders" seems to have started at Fuller Theological Seminary where he was a 
"think tank" genius who created methodologies and strategies for the 
reintroduction of fake gifts and mission to the churches. He was the professor 
of Fuller's School of World Mission, and was a disciple and close associate of 
John Wimber. He co-authored the Fuller course<I> MC510 - Signs, Wonders and 
Church Growth</I> with Wimber, and took this course globally to every continent. 
He and Wimber were the implementers of the so-called "restoration of the missing 
holy spirit to the Churches."</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Wagner has strategically placed 
himself into the middle of an international network of "Christian" activities to 
help implement, organize, and dominate a Global Church within the coming New 
World Order. Currently, Wagner is President of Global Harvest Ministries whose 
main objective states: "From day one we have joined hands with Jesus of whom it 
was said, 'The Son of God<B> </B>was manifested, that He might destroy the works 
of the devil' (1 Jn. 3:8). Our mandate is to weaken the 'god of this age' that 
he will no longer be able to blind the minds of men and women who are lost. We 
know that you are ready for war!" (Doesn't Scripture say that Jesus 
<I>Himself</I> will destroy the devil, not through any effort by Global 
Harvest?) Through Global Harvest Ministries and it offshoots, Wagner Leadership 
Institute and the World Prayer Center (WPC), Wagner is training future 
"Christian" leaders, tracking thousands of churches by computer, and creating a 
"New Way" in which the Holy Spirit is working in this age. Wagner says, "We see 
our task as getting people in touch with one another <U>to form interactive, 
human web networks</U> that are properly equipped to wage effective spiritual 
warfare." The WPC is "a fully equipped nerve center with data and information 
about prayer needs throughout the world [which] ... networks prayer ministries, 
denominations, churches and cell groups. This creates a united prayer front that 
will end <U>Satan's attempt to divide and isolate believers</U>, and to blind so 
many to the Gospel of Jesus Christ." (Quotes from the World Prayer Center 
website. Emphasis added.) As part of his networking plan, Wagner recently 
founded the idea of the "New Apostolic Reformation," where apostles and prophets 
are rising up to take control of the Church. Wagner recently proclaimed himself 
"presiding apostle" of a coalition of 200 "true" apostles by forming the 
"International Coalition of Apostles." Their mandate is to build and usher in 
the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Because of this unbiblical belief in 
a "new and improved" holy spirit, Wagner has publicly affirmed many charismatic 
deceptions, like the "gold fillings" miracles in Latin America, where people 
have reported having regular fillings in their mouth changed to gold by the 
power of God. (Wagner's <I>Confronting the Powers</I>, p. 59.) His reliance on 
extra-biblical spirituality is so strong, in fact, that Wagner believes that 
occult practitioners have superior knowledge to Christians. He states in 
<I>Confronting the Powers</I> that "certain people, such as shamans, witch 
doctors, practitioners of Eastern religions, New Age gurus or professors of the 
occult on university faculties are examples of the kind of people who may have 
much more extensive knowledge of the spirit world than most Christians have." He 
goes so far as to advocate that Christians attempt "first-hand research into the 
world of darkness" and chides those who are unwilling to listen to "independent 
expertise in demonology" (<I>Powers</I>, p. 147).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P><B>Paul Cain</B> -- Cain is the most well known of the Vineyard "prophets." 
Cain was a contemporary of Oral Roberts during the tent revivals of the 1940s 
and '50s. He left the healing revival circuit in 1957, supposedly because many 
of the leaders were becoming "disobedient." He remained semi-secluded until the 
Vineyard movement was born, and then he stepped into the revival arena once 
again. He is considered the greatest of the modern day prophets by the 
leadership of the Vineyard. He claims to speak regularly with angels, to receive 
prophetic revelations directly from God, and to have powerful gifts of healing. 
Some believe him to be an apostle, although Cain does not accept that title.</P>
<P><B>Jack Deere</B> -- In 1986, Jack Deere believed the miraculous gifts of the 
Holy Spirit had passed away. He had just completed his tenth year as an 
associate professor at Dallas Seminary, and seventh year as pastor of a Bible 
church. Then he invited British psychiatrist John White as guest speaker, and 
reluctantly agreed to let him teach about miraculous healing. Soon after, 
Deere's thinking "radically reversed." He said: "First I began to believe that 
the scriptures taught that healing and miracles were for today. Then I believed 
that God spoke today outside the Bible. ... And the final stage was believing 
all the gifts of the Spirit actually are for today." Two weeks later he met 
Vineyard movement founder John Wimber, developed close ties, and was dismissed 
from Dallas Seminary. Today he ministers world-wide with Paul Cain. Deere says: 
"After John Wimber prayed for me several years ago, I noticed an immediate 
increase in revelatory words and healings whenever I prayed for people. I've 
also seen this happen when Paul Cain has prayed for people ..." Deere is one of 
the most powerful spokesman for the Vineyard. His book <I>Surprised by the Power 
of the Spirit </I>is probably the best defense of the Vineyard's views and has 
undoubtedly drawn many into the movement. His 1995 book, <I>Surprised by the 
Voice of God</I>, is supposed to be a treatise on how to tell God's voice from 
our own, or even Satan's. In this volume, he defends the view that God is giving 
fresh revelations today.</P>
<P>In a private interview with Graham Banister following a Vineyard conference 
workshop taught by Deere (March of 1990 in Sydney, Australia), Deere was asked, 
"What is the Gospel?" Deere asked Banister what <I>he</I> thought the gospel 
was. Banister replied that it was about Jesus Christ who died for our sins was 
buried and raised on the third day and that it is this gospel by which we are 
saved (1 Cor. 15). Deere's reply was that this was <B>not</B> the gospel. When 
asked what, then, is the gospel, Deere replied, "I'm not prepared to make a 
formal statement about that." When asked, "Could you perhaps tell me informally 
what you believe to be the gospel?" Deere answered, "I'm not sure. ... I used to 
be just like you ... thinking the gospel was simply justification by faith." 
When asked what he would add to it, he responded, "Deliverance. ... things like 
demons and healing ... it's the complete package -- the word and the works of 
Jesus?" But he was not yet ready to give a definitive answer to the question, 
"What is the gospel?" Continuing to be amazed, Banister asked, "Are you saying 
that you couldn't go back into that pavilion and tell those people the gospel?" 
He replied, "No, not yet. ... Maybe [in] five years, maybe ten ..." Amazingly, 
one of the leading theological minds in the Signs and Wonders movement did not 
know what was the gospel! [Source: 4/24/90, <I>The Briefing</I>, "John Wimber: 
Friend or Foe," Sydney, Australia -- Deere claims that this article contains 
"serious misrepresentations, false reporting, and erroneous methodology" 
concerning the Vineyard's teachings, and misrepresents his (Deere's) 
understanding of the Gospel. Since it was just Graham Banister and Jack Deere 
present for the interview, the reader must judge for himself whether<I> The 
Briefing's </I>rendition is consistent with what we know of Deere's documented 
doctrinal positions. For Jack Deere's take on the interview in question, see the 
"<A 
href="http://www.vineyardusa.org/publications/position_papers/briefing10.htm">Misrepresentation 
Of Jack Deere's Teaching And Views</A>" section of the May, 1992, "<A 
href="http://www.vineyardusa.org/publications/position_papers/briefing1.htm">Vineyard 
Position Paper #2</A>: The Vineyard's Response to <I>The Briefing</I>," by Jack 
Deere.]</P>
<P><B>Wayne Grudem</B> -- Grudem is Associate Professor of Biblical and 
Systematic Theology at Trinity International University (formerly Trinity 
Evangelical Divinity School -- <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/efca.htm">Evangelical Free 
Church of America</A>), and recognized Biblical scholar. His book <I>The Gift of 
Prophecy in the New Testament and Today</I> is an attempt to bring some 
moderation to the extremes of the Vineyard movement, and at the same time, 
persuade outsiders that God is still revealing His word today through the gift 
of prophecy. Grudem attempts to deal with the important issue of how Christians 
can receive direct revelation from God, and yet not claim to be inspired in the 
same way the Scriptures are. This issue is crucial. If God is speaking to 
Christians today, what weight are we to give these modern day prophecies? If we 
claim that they are equal to Scripture, then we should add them to the Word of 
God. We should be adding new books to the canon as God reveals His word as he 
did in the past. On the other hand, if these prophecies are not on par with 
Scripture, then what are we to do with them? How can God be speaking in and 
through His people and yet not to be speaking with authority?</P>
<P>Grudem's answer is that OT prophecy and NT prophecy (as well as modern 
prophecy) are two different things. In the OT, prophets spoke the very words of 
God. As a matter of fact, if they prophesied in the name of the Lord and their 
prophecies did not come to pass, they were to be stoned to death (Deut. 
18:20-22). Grudem assures us that all of this changed in the NT. In the NT, only 
the apostles spoke with divine authority. They, according to Grudem, are the NT 
counterparts to the OT prophets. He believes that all other NT, and modern 
prophecy, while coming directly from God, is not really inspired. NT prophets 
can, and often will, be wrong and suffer no consequences. So, <U>according to 
Grudem, we receive messages from God today, but those messages do <B>not</B> 
carry the weight of divine revelation. They can be in error, and we do not 
necessarily have to obey them</U>.</P>
<P>But we must ask, "Of what value are such prophecies?" If we don't know for 
certain that they come from God, if we don't know for certain whether they 
contain error, then what purpose do they have? Grudem never satisfactorily 
answers that question. Here are his best shots: "We are not expected to accept 
every word spoken through the gifts of utterance ... but we are only to accept 
what is quickened to us by the Holy Spirit and is in agreement with the Bible 
... one magnification may be 75% God, but 25% the person's own thoughts. We must 
discern between the two" (<I>The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and 
Today</I>, p. 110). "As a matter of fact there may be a whole range of degrees 
of inspiration" (p. 111). In answering his own question as to how we can know if 
a revelation is from the Holy Spirit, he says that it must first be in 
conformity to the Scriptures. Then he makes these amazing statements, "Did the 
revelation 'seem like' something from the Holy Spirit; did it seem to be similar 
to other experiences of the Holy Spirit which he had known previously in 
worship? Beyond this it is difficult to specify much further, except to say that 
over time a congregation would probably become more adept at recognizing a 
genuine revelation from the Holy Spirit and distinguishing it from their own 
thought" (pp. 120-121).</P>
<P>In other words, we are left in a sea of subjectivity. If the thoughts in my 
mind "seem like" they are coming from the Holy Spirit, then "probably" they are 
(according to Grudem). But of course, I may be wrong. Those thoughts could come 
from anywhere. We never really know. We can only hope that we will become more 
"adept" at discerning God's voice as time goes on. Again, we ask, of what value 
are such prophecies? Why seek after new revelations from God, revelations that 
we cannot be assured are even coming from God, when we have the sure words of 
Scripture?</P>
<H3>Doctrine</H3>
<P>Below is discussed briefly some of the Vineyard teachings that are troubling 
in the light of Scripture:</P>
<P>1) <B>Noncessationist</B> -- One of the trademarks of the Vineyard movement 
is the belief that God is actively revealing His Word today through prophecies, 
words of knowledge, visions, etc. Of course, this opens the door to every kind 
of error and heresy imaginable. [In <I>Power Evangelism</I>,<I> </I>John Wimber 
says that the very basis for power evangelism is the belief that God directly 
reveals to us certain information. For example, on an airplane Wimber saw 
written clearly across a man's face, "in distinct letters," the word "adultery." 
As he witnessed to the man, the Spirit spoke directly to Wimber and said, "Tell 
him if he doesn't turn from his adultery, I'm going to take Him" (pp. 
75-82).]</P>
<P>2) <B><A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/areview.htm">Sign 
gifts for today</A></B> -- Until the late-1900s, orthodox Christianity believed 
that the sign gifts (prophecy, miracles, healing, tongues, interpretation of 
tongues) all had ceased with either the closing of the canon of Scripture or the 
death of the Apostles. Only heretical groups such as the Montanists, Shakers, 
and Mormons believed that such gifts were valid for today. Early Christians did 
not doubt that God could work miracles and heal people, but they believed that 
these <I>gifts</I> had ceased. The Pentecostals, then the charismatics, and now 
the Vineyard, all make the present day use of these sign gifts an important part 
of their system.</P>
<P>3) <B>Spiritual Warfare ministry</B> -- The Vineyard <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/warfare/">believes that 
Christians can be demon possessed</A>, that those demons must be forcefully cast 
out, and that we are to aggressively attack Satan in order to defeat him.</P>
<P>4) <B>"Power evangelism" vs. "program evangelism"</B> -- Program evangelism 
is the presentation of the gospel message to a lost sinner. While not 
anti-program evangelism, the Vineyard believes that it is an anemic way of 
bringing people to Christ, especially people in the Third World. What is needed 
is power evangelism, that is, signs and wonders. If, in conjunction with 
presenting the gospel message, we also heal a person, raise the dead, cast out a 
demon, or speak a word of knowledge, our message will be with authority and 
power. The results of power evangelism, we are told, are far superior to program 
evangelism. It is interesting, however, to examine the Scriptural record of the 
results of signs and wonders. It would appear that miracles seldom produced any 
true faith or lasting fruit. Even with Christ, we find people following Him in 
order to be healed or fed, yet rejecting His message (e.g., John 6).</P>
<P>5) <B>Ecumenical</B> -- Just as with charismatics, it is experience rather 
than doctrine that draws people to the Vineyard. Therefore, the Vineyard people 
can apparently work with anyone who claims to be a Christian, no matter what 
they believe. The Vineyard actively encourages reunification with the Catholic 
church, and claims that the Pope is an evangelical Christian. We can see why the 
<A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/pk/">Promise 
Keepers</A>, with its strong Vineyard leadership, is so ecumenical and 
encourages the participation of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/">Roman 
Catholics</A>, even in leadership positions.</P>
<P>6) <B>Dominionist</B> -- <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/cor/">Dominion theology</A> 
teaches that dominion over every area of life has been restored by the first 
coming of Christ. It is now the church's obligation to redeem not only 
individuals, but society as well, in order to usher in the kingdom of God. The 
Vineyard, following the teachings of George Ladd, believes that "the kingdom is, 
but not yet." That is, we are now in the kingdom of God. Wimber wrote, "The 
kingdom of God created the church at Pentecost through the outpouring of the 
Holy Spirit" (<I>Power Evangelism</I>, p. 34). As a result of this, Christians 
have "kingdom authority" (note the words to the popular <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hayford/">Jack Hayford</A> 
song "Majesty" with its charismatic teachings in this regard) that enables us to 
have power over sickness, demons, and nature. What the Vineyard does is to bring 
the characteristics of the Millennial reign of Christ to this present age. They 
reason that since we are in the kingdom now, we should manifest all the power 
that Christ had while on earth. (As Wimber was fond of saying, "I want to do the 
stuff Jesus did.")</P>
<P>This is the Vineyard's theological foundation for the belief in the validity 
of the sign gifts for today. The Vineyard also believes that there is yet to 
come a physical kingdom on earth over which Christ will rule. But they believe 
that the church will usher in the final aspect of the kingdom as it takes 
dominion over the earth. Part of this will come in the form of a great last day 
revival in which the world will turn to Christ. (The Bible teaches that there 
will be a great apostasy in the last days, not revival.) This is known as the 
"Latter Rain," and is taught nowhere in the Bible.</P>
<P>7) <B>Eastern world view</B> -- The Vineyard dismisses its critics by 
declaring that they have been blinded by their two-tier, Western world view. The 
Western mind-set has an "upper tier" that includes heaven, hell, God, and 
eternity. Westerners also have a "lower tier" of science, the empirical world of 
our senses -- those things that we see and experience in the natural, material 
order. In the Western world view, the Vineyard says there is no interaction 
between the two tiers. But in the Eastern world view, wrote Wimber, there is 
another tier -- the middle tier which, "includes the influence of angels and 
demons on everyday life, the Holy Spirit's intervention in divine healing, signs 
and wonders, and spiritual gifts. Non-Western world views make room for all 
kinds of supernatural intervention in everyday life, so the idea that a 
Christian God can heal is easy for them to accept. But we Western Christians, by 
excluding this middle zone, usually make little or no room for what in Scripture 
is normal -- the regular activity of both God and Satan in human life" (<I>Power 
Evangelism</I>, p. 138). (What we must develop is a Biblical world view. Where 
the Vineyard errs is failing to distinguish between the Scripture's approach to 
the supernatural and the superstitious, mystical approach of the Eastern 
mind-set.)</P>
<P>In the Vineyard system, all problems, including sins, can be traced back to 
the demonic. The secular, Westerner world view says that all of the above come 
from natural causes. The Biblical view is that God sovereignly controls all 
aspects of life. He uses angels, demons, germs, nature, and every other created 
thing for His purposes. We then must go back to the Scriptures to determine how 
God would have us handle these issues of life. And what do we find? The 
epistles, written to church age believers, advocate progressive sanctification, 
prayer, faith, feeding on the Word, and even the use of medicine for illnesses. 
But the epistles say virtually nothing about casting out demons (or any other 
signs and wonders) in order to live for God and to deal with the problems of 
living.</P>
<P>8) <B>Baptism of the Spirit </B>-- The Vineyard differs somewhat from <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/">Pentecostals and 
charismatics</A>. One of the cardinal doctrines of the other two groups in their 
belief in the "baptism of the Holy Spirit" <I>subsequent</I> to conversion. They 
believe that this baptism is a second work of grace that enriches the life of 
the Christian and prepares him for ministry. The Vineyard, on the other hand, 
believes that this baptism takes place at the moment of conversion. However, 
they also teach that there can be multiple fillings of the Spirit after 
salvation.</P>
<P>9) <B><A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/biblical.htm">Tongues-speaking</A></B> 
-- The Vineyard also differs with respect to tongues. Although it is practiced 
by many within the movement, its importance is down-played, and not all 
Christians are expected, or encouraged, to speak in tongues. On the other hand, 
some Pentecostals and charismatics believe that speaking in tongues is the 
evidence of conversion. Others would say that it is something necessary to a 
fulfilled Christian experience.</P>
<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>One of the wisest things that we can do when examining any movement that 
claims to be of God, is to ask, "Does this movement place its emphasis on the 
same things that God's Word does?" For example, what does the Vineyard movement 
emphasize? Is it not signs and wonders? Their churches are consumed with 
miracles, healings, casting out of demons, and prophetic utterances. It is 
through these things that they believe people will be brought to Christ and 
discipled. They point people to dynamic experiences, and it is those 
experiences, rather than the truth of the Scriptures, that bring people into 
their fellowship.</P>
<P>Now compare the Vineyard's emphasis with that of the NT epistles. Note 
especially the books of First and Second Timothy and Titus. In these three 
books, we have the Apostle Paul instructing two young pastors on how to lead 
their churches. Paul is telling them what their churches need in order to move 
on to maturity. It is interesting to discover the complete absence of any 
mention of signs and wonders. Paul did not encourage these men to cast out 
demons, heal the sick, or seek new revelation from God. Rather, he pointed them 
to the Scriptures that were adequate to equip their people for every good work 
(2 Tim. 3:15-17). He told them to preach the Word (2 Tim 4:1,2), and to exhort 
in sound doctrine and refute those who contradict (Titus 1:9). No mention is 
made of developing churches around emotional experiences and supernatural 
happenings. The emphasis of these pastor's ministries was to be the written Word 
of God. They were to hold it fast, preach and teach it, apply it to every 
possible kind of situation, and guard and defend it. In light of the NT 
instructions to the church, the goings-on in the Vineyard should throw up red 
flags all over the place, for their faith and practice are contrary to NT 
teaching.</P>
