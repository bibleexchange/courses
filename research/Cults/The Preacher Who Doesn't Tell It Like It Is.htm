WHO DOESN’T TELL IT LIKE IT IS<BR></FONT><FONT size=6><STRONG>THE TRUTH TWISTING 
AND TALL TALES OF JOYCE MEYER</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=center>by <STRONG>Paul R. Belli and G. Richard Fisher</STRONG></P>
<P>Joyce Meyer has finally arrived into the top echelons of the Charismatic “Big 
League.” Her image has appeared next to many of the “Who’s Who” of Charismatic 
icons again and again in the pages of <I>Charisma</I> magazine.</P>
<P>Last November, she made it to the cover of the sensationalistic publication. 
<I>Charisma</I> promised on the cover “Straight Talk From Joyce Meyer,” and 
titled the inside cover story of the St. Louis-based Meyer, “The Preacher Who 
Tells It Like It Is.” Her book sales are soaring as well, but does Joyce Meyer 
really tell it like it is? That is — <I>like it really is?</I></P>
<P>Meyer’s visibility these days has brought her such popularity that even some 
of the Charismatic superstars have been writing articles for her ministry’s 
monthly magazine, <I>Life in the Word</I>.</P>
<P>On occasion, the favor is reciprocated as Kenneth Copeland’s magazine, <I>The 
Believer’s Voice of Victory</I>, has featured some of her articles. Yes, she has 
definitely arrived in the “Top Ten.” However, for an already undiscerning 
Church, this is not a good thing when you consider that she mirrors the 
teachings of her unhealthy associations.</P>
<P align=center><B>NOT A SINNER</B></P>
<P>For years, <I>Charisma</I> magazine has left a lot to be desired. Double 
standards, subjective journalism, mysticism, attacks upon historic and orthodox 
Christianity, and little regard for hermeneutics appear with frequency in the 
magazine. The issue featuring Meyer was no exception.</P>
<P>Take, for example, the magazine’s slamming of those who have evaluated her 
theology:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Joyce is not the subject of intense controversy, but she has faced her 
  critics. Various cult-watchers have attacked her, including one who lambasted 
  her on St. Louis radio and challenged her to a debate (which she 
  refused).”<SUP>1</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The “attack” to which <I>Charisma</I> alluded was the Dec. 7, 1995 edition of 
<I>Issues, Etc.</I> (KFUO 850 AM in St. Louis). The program was hosted by 
Lutheran Pastor Don Matzat and the featured guests for the show were none other 
than the authors of this article.<SUP>2</SUP> Evidently, the magazine or Meyer 
herself surmises that a systematic and biblical analysis of her teaching (with 
primary documentation from her tapes and writings) constitutes an “attack” or 
assault of some kind. Paul commended Bereans, while the magazine castigates 
them.</P>
<P>Matzat, himself involved in the Charismatic movement from 1971-1986, 
observed:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Regarding the challenge, as I remember it, was nothing more than an open 
  invitation to Joyce to respond to our comments. Joyce did not avail herself of 
  the opportunity to respond on the air.”<SUP>3</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Like others in the Word-Faith camp who are uneducated, untrained and 
unskilled in doctrine and systematic theology, Meyer is none too eager to openly 
discuss the Christian faith with one who has worked hard to rightly divide the 
Word of Truth. However, following the initial radio broadcast, Matzat did have 
the opportunity to dialogue with Meyer and her husband, Dave. Matzat, a friend 
of Dave’s family, recalled the meeting: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“We had a very nice chat. I told them exactly what I just said here. I 
  said, ‘You were distorting the doctrine of justification.’ I said, ‘What your 
  doctrine will lead to is what Ken Copeland teaches, that Jesus had to be born 
  again in hell. Because He’s simply a man dying for our sins.’ She did not 
  reject what Ken Copeland teaches. She simply told me, ‘I am not going to 
  change what I teach.’”<SUP>4</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Meyer’s concept of sinless perfection is the most disturbing element to 
Matzat. Meyer has claimed,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Now whether you like it or not, whether you want to admit it or not, 
  whether you want to operate on it or not, you are made the righteousness of 
  God in Jesus Christ. Most people who go to denominational churches never ever 
  hear that! They never hear it! Never! All I was ever taught to say was, ‘I, a 
  poor, miserable sinner.’ I am not poor. I am not miserable. And I am not a 
  sinner. That is a lie from the pit of hell! That is what I were [sic] and if I 
  still was, then Jesus died in vain. Amen?”<SUP>5</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Meyer may be able to say she is not poor and not miserable. First John 1:8, 
however, would preclude the rest of her comments about not being a sinner. Paul 
thought himself to be the chief of sinners (1 Timothy 1:15). As Christians we 
are, after all, saved sinners. </P>
<P>Meyer’s comments point out the real issue: Just who is lambasting whom? 
Meyer’s declaration clearly lambastes the theology of the Reformers, including, 
most notably, Lutherans and Calvinists.</P>
<P>As noted in our previous <I>Journal</I> article, Meyer no longer distributes 
the above tape with her perfectionistic ideas.<SUP>6</SUP> A staff member from 
her ministry told PFO that the message is obsolete. What is not clear is what 
<I>part of</I> or if the entire message is obsolete. One of its major themes on 
the tape is the “born again Jesus” gospel. Yet it can be shown that Meyer still 
distributes material promoting this heretical gospel, which certainly suggests 
that she does not see it as entirely obsolete (at least for the time being).</P>
<P>Moreover, when one examines the now obsolete tape, divine intervention and 
direct revelation are stated as the source of her message:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The Bible can’t even find any way to explain this. Not really. That’s why 
  you’ve got to get it by revelation. There are no <I>words</I> to explain what 
  I’m telling you. I’ve got to just trust God that He’s putting it into your 
  spirit like He put it into mine.”<SUP>7</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Having foolishly appealed to divine revelation and God’s impartation for the 
message, she now, in essence, has made God culpable for an obsolete message. 
Thus, one must ask, why does she continue to rely upon <I>revelation 
knowledge</I> when it produces obsolete messages and indicts God as the author 
of heresy? And how can the average listener discern which part of Meyer’s 
materials are biblical truth and which are destined for the trash heap of 
obsolescence? The caution of Zechariah 13:4-5 regarding false prophets who 
change their mind and their message bears consideration here. </P>
<P align=center><B>JESUS IN HELL?</B></P>
<P>The <I>Charisma</I> article indicates that another of Meyer’s critics, 
apologist Hank Hanegraaff, cited her booklet, <I>The Most Important Decision You 
Will Ever Make</I>.<SUP>8</SUP> Hanegraaff faulted Meyer for teaching that Jesus 
was born again in hell. Meyer responded by stating that she does not believe and 
has never taught that particular doctrine. </P>
<P>Whether Hanegraaff ever used the exact words, “Jesus was born again in hell” 
or if the <I>Charisma</I> writer simply put those words in the Southern 
California apologist’s mouth in an attempt to build a “straw man” is not clear. 
What is clear, however, in spite of Meyer’s denials, is that in the fourth 
chapter of her booklet, <I>The Most Important Decision You Will Ever Make</I>, 
she:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>• Teaches a born again Jesus.<SUP>9</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>• Teaches that hell, not the cross, is where salvation was 
  purchased.<SUP>10</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>She not only delineates and defines the heresy but she blatantly defends it. 
</P>
<P>While Meyer may deny now that she has ever taught that “Jesus was born again 
in hell,” she has not renounced the teaching nor denounced those who teach it. 
Were she to do so, she most likely would neither have her picture in or on 
<I>Charisma</I> magazine again, nor would she be invited to speak with the 
heretics who do believe and teach it: her mentors and friends.</P>
<P>Based on the content of her book, turning to Christ would be the most 
<I>impotent</I> decision one would ever make. By placing faith in “another 
Jesus” (2 Corinthians 11:4) as put forth in her booklet, a new “believer” would 
not be entitled to the new covenant purchased with Jesus Christ’s blood. Rather, 
the Jesus that Meyer proclaims, is a Jesus whose blood paid for nothing because 
his “blood was made of no effect,” being “treated as an unholy thing” (Hebrews 
10:29), because according to this teaching, Jesus’ payment was actually made by 
suffering in hell. This teaching makes the “It is finished” of John 19:30 a lie. 
First Corinthians 15:3 is very clear: “Jesus was crucified and <I>died</I> for 
our sins,” not suffered in hell for our sins.</P>
<P>Thus, Meyer refuses to debate and will not “comment directly on such 
opposition.” Is it any wonder that her husband remarked, “We let God respond” 
and “That’s not our position, to try and come back and straighten them out”? 
</P>
<P>As noted above, neither Meyer nor her husband has the necessary theological 
training to defend her indefensible teachings. The only reason the Meyers can 
say that it’s not their “position” to respond and “straighten” us out is that 
they fail to grasp the basics of biblical interpretation and hermeneutics. As a 
result, it’s not that they <I>won’t</I> respond, it’s because they <I>cannot</I> 
respond. “Let[ting] God respond” is merely subterfuge. Strange how first-class, 
super-Christians, who would have us believe they are tapping into divine 
revelation, can do all things in Christ, except successfully defend their 
damnable doctrines of demons.</P>
<P>As we read earlier, the Apostle Paul’s attitude was not to just let God 
respond, but to get into the trenches and do what God called <I>him</I> to do, 
namely to “cut the ground from under those who proclaim” another gospel. </P>
<P>Even worse, their response gives this issue the sense of unimportance. Much 
to do about nothing! If it were, we would truly be wasting their time. Yet, 
those in apologetics ministries are keenly aware that this is an essential 
issue. Corrupting the Gospel produces heretical and damnable doctrine. Hence, we 
take heed to the Scripture’s admonition to “earnestly contend for the faith that 
was once for all entrusted to the saints” (Jude 3). We should not, and cannot, 
do otherwise. </P>
<P align=center><B>STOLEN WORDS</B></P>
<P>Stealing others’ errors is directly addressed by the Prophet Jeremiah: 
“Therefore, declares the Lord, I am against the prophets who steal from one 
another words supposedly from me. Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false 
dreams, declares the Lord. They tell them and lead my people astray with their 
reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these 
people in the least, declares the Lord” (Jeremiah 23:30, 32).</P>
<P>In her booklet, <I>The Most Important Decision You Will Ever Make,</I> the 
first subchapter heading is, <U>WHAT HAPPENED ON THE CROSS</U>? This heading is 
strikingly similar to the title of Kenneth Copeland’s 1984 notorious sermon 
tape, <I>What Happened From The Cross To The Throne</I>. As earlier noted, Meyer 
also has a tape with the title, <I>From the Cross to the Throne</I>. Not only 
are these titles similar, they each go into great detail about the subject of 
what happened on, and more significantly, beyond the cross of Christ. And they 
each go well beyond Scripture to teach the heretical “born again Jesus” gospel. 
</P>
<P>While Meyer apparently borrowed her content from Copeland, Copeland in turn 
presumably adopted the title from E.W. Kenyon’s book by the same name, as well 
as the same heretical theme. Both Copeland’s and Kenyon’s works have become 
“classics” within the Charismatic camp. In the 1980s, faith healer Benny Hinn 
also taught the same heresy with the “revelation knowledge” tactic as its 
source. He has since disavowed the teaching. Others committed to the teaching 
include: Kenneth Hagin, Fred Price, Charles Capps, Paul and Jan Crouch and John 
Jacobs (of The Power Team).</P>
<P>In summary (with few variations), the “born again Jesus” gospel teaches that 
Jesus died two deaths, one physically upon the cross and the other spiritually 
in hell. His Spirit literally became sin on the cross, taking on the very nature 
of Satan, thereby being stripped of His Deity. He was ushered into hell where He 
was tortured for three days and nights by Satan and his demons, was reborn or 
“born again” in hell, reclaiming His Deity and finally rising bodily from the 
dead. </P>
<P>The amount of fanciful “revelation knowledge” necessary to contradict the 
clear teaching of Scripture, in order to teach the “born again Jesus” gospel, is 
nothing short of amazing. Meyer, like her predecessors, offers the same “you’ve 
got to get it by revelation” diversion. </P>
<P>This doctrine removes the clear teaching of Scripture that the atonement took 
place upon the cross and places the event in hell. It is just one more example 
how Satan strives to take our focus from the cross.</P>
<P>Although Meyer puts great value upon the “job” Jesus did, she misplaces 
<I>where</I> He did it. When challenged about the unbiblical concept of this 
teaching, Charismatics will often respond that it doesn’t matter where He atoned 
for our sins. Strangely, Latter-day Saints offer the same rationale because 
their version of Jesus Christ atoned for our sins in the Garden of Gethsemane. 
Atonement in hell contradicts the Apostle Paul’s admonition to “never boast 
except in the <I>cross</I> of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has 
been crucified to me, and I to the world” (Galatians 6:14).</P>
<P align=center><B>A JOB </B><B><I>HELL</I></B><B> DONE?</B></P>
<P>As mentioned above, Meyer’s booklet focuses primarily upon the “born again 
Jesus” gospel. This small volume is still being sold to the public. And the 
teaching is not confined to just this one booklet. Consider these statements on 
her tape, <I>From the Cross to the Throne</I>: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“And you’ve got to really glean some things out of the Word of God to 
  really get hold of what He [Jesus] did for you during those three 
days.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Jesus said, ‘It is finished.’ And He meant the Old Covenant. The 
  <I>job</I> He had to do was just getting started. He really did the <I>job</I> 
  the three days and nights that He was in hell. That’s where the <I>job</I> was 
  done” (emphasis added).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“He was pronounced guilty on the cross but He paid the price in 
hell.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“All the hosts of hell was [sic] upon Him. Upon Him. They got on Him. They 
  got Him down in the floor and got on Him. And they were laughing and 
  mocking.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Sunday morning, here comes the Son. Sunday morning, God gets Himself 
  together. Ho, hoooo. Justice has been met, somehow the thing’s been taken care 
  of. And ol’ God gets His voice together and He hollers out three words and 
  they go roaring through the universe and entering the gates of hell. He said, 
  ‘<I>It is enough! It is enough</I>!” (emphasis in the 
original).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Can she prove that God actually said, “It is enough! It is enough!”? Can she 
provide chapter and verse for such a declaration? No! Only through the guise of 
“revelation knowledge” can such information be provided. Yet, tragically, it is 
Kenyon, Copeland and others within the Word-Faith camp who are her source for 
such knowledge. God plainly warns us:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“‘Yes,’ declares the Lord, ‘I am against the prophets who wag their own 
  tongues and yet declare, “The Lord declares”’” (Jeremiah 
23:31).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>He also warns:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you 
  know that we who teach will be judged more strictly” (James 
3:1).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Many able expositors have addressed the weakness of the Jesus-in-hell idea. 
Former CRI researcher Brian Onken points out something that Meyer misses 
entirely:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Jesus appears to be conscious of the end of His redemptive suffering. 
  Furthermore it seems evident that His conscious fellowship with God the Father 
  was restored because of His subsequent self-committal: ‘Father, into thy hands 
  I commit My spirit’ (Luke 23:46).”<SUP>11</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ephesians 1:7 is clear: “In Him we have redemption <I>through His blood</I>, 
the forgiveness of sins.” Pastor Michael Moriarity emphatically affirms: “As 
Christians, we affirm that our salvation is based solely on Christ’s atoning 
work on the cross.”<SUP>12</SUP> Moriarity’s book has a 22-page appendix dealing 
with the whole issue of where Jesus atoned for sin.</P>
<P align=center><B>WHAT IS REAL PROOF?</B></P>
<P>Meyer says “that the changed lives are proof enough,” that she’s “anointed by 
God to do what I’m doing.”<SUP>13</SUP> As is the Charismatic tendency, this is 
a subjective posture. Every cult and aberrational sect on the face of the Earth 
appeals to “changed lives” as a means of validating their claims that they 
represent God. Latter-day Saints, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and others all validate 
that they are “anointed by God” to do what they’re doing by virtue of “changed 
lives.” As such, her logic is as flawed as cult logic. Meyer needs something 
more concrete on which to base her claims. Remember, Christianity is based on 
facts, not feelings. Holy Ghost “goose bumps,” liver quivers or even subjective 
short-term change are not the confirmation of the Christian faith.</P>
<P>Objectively speaking, her literature and tapes are “proof enough” that she is 
not anointed! Listening to her twists, turns and changes could only lead one to 
conclude that God is confused. Meyer’s appeal to have God’s blessing upon her 
ministry is questionable when one considers that God does not empower the 
vanguards of the Church to teach false and heretical doctrine.</P>
<P>Sadly, when careful exegetes of God’s Word challenge her theology, she 
resorts to calling them “religious people” (pg. 55) who only criticize her for 
not being as well-educated as they are and then appeals to her “anointing” as 
proof that she is free to ignore them. </P>
<P align=center><B>MISSING CHARACTER</B></P>
<P>While Meyer claims, “It’s important to me to have character and 
integrity,”<SUP>14</SUP> she lacks those qualities when she uses red herrings 
such as the above in order to evade any and every critic regardless of their 
status. Criticism directed to her does not stem from her lack of education, it 
rather stems from her heretical teachings. She not only lacks a sound 
understanding of Scripture, she lacks integrity and a teachable spirit, the very 
things she boasts about. </P>
<P>Why does PFO make the charge of “unteachable”? When she met with Matzat to 
discuss the issues that were brought up on the radio broadcast, she told him 
that she was not going to change what she taught. This certainly emphasizes that 
she is not willing to learn sound doctrine or repent of the heretical teaching 
she promoted. The book of Proverbs is replete with admonitions that a wise man 
is teachable. Meyer, apparently prefers to hold onto teachings scraped from the 
garbage cans of the Word-Faith movement.</P>
<P>On the radio broadcast, Matzat spent a great deal of time in his introduction 
of the program covering the issue of discernment and how it’s not a matter of 
dealing with the person or getting personal. He took great pains to explain 
this, “You don’t deal with the individual, rather you deal with the concepts.” 
Matzat made the truth as palatable as possible. It’s one thing to be confused or 
unclear on an essential Christian doctrine such as the Gospel, but it’s an 
entirely different matter when one adamantly refuses to acknowledge the truth 
when confronted with it. </P>
<P align=center><B>REAL CHANGE?</B> </P>
<P>Meyer told <I>Charisma</I> that she has been radically changed from being 
“angry, rebellious and hateful toward men” and “mean, ornery, sarcastic, sharp, 
hard, bitter and full of resentment.”<SUP>15</SUP> She even admitted to have 
trouble submitting to her own pastor, “Acknowledging that their strong-willed 
personalities clashed regularly.”<SUP>16</SUP> The Lord has worked in her life, 
she says, and the result is “an absolute, all-out, total miracle.”<SUP>17</SUP> 
While there may have been a change in her life, the transformation falls short 
of being a “miracle.”</P>
<P>Consider this example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“And from here on, it probably wouldn’t do you one bit of good to try and 
  follow me. So if you’re taking notes, you can write down the Scriptures. Cause 
  very frankly, <I>I’m not going to have time to wait on 
  you</I>.”<SUP>18</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Her words are not exactly what one could label a servant’s heart or a 
demonstration of patience, nor much of a Christian display of love. Consider, 
also, these comments: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Don’t talk to anybody, don’t go to the bathroom, don’t go get a drink of 
  water, don’t move — just listen. Amen? I believe it’s that 
  important.”<SUP>19</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When listening to her sermon tape in its entirety, there is ample evidence 
that she possess an aura of haughtiness. For emphasis, she speaks just short of 
yelling through the entire tape. There is no doubt in her mind that what she is 
teaching is gospel truth. Unfortunately, if you first listen to Kenneth 
Copeland’s version of this damnable teaching, it is obvious that Meyer simply 
heisted not only his title, but his teaching as well. Plagiarizing someone 
else’s material is bad enough, but plagiarizing heresy is even more regrettable. 
And then naming God as the source is blasphemous.</P>
<P>While she may have mellowed with time, there doesn’t seem to be a radical 
difference between the old and the new Joyce Meyer. The <I>Charisma</I> spin 
attempts to soften her personality, but in fact demonstrates her continued 
arrogance and combative spirit.</P>
<P align=center><B>BAD THEOLOGY FOR GOOD</B></P>
<P>Meyer says that her exodus from the Lutheran church was because her 
“charismatic beliefs fueled conflict with their congregation.”<SUP>20</SUP> 
While she expresses gratitude to the Lutheran Church for her doctrinal 
foundation,<SUP>21</SUP> she quickly traded sound teaching for the writings of 
mystics and heretics.</P>
<P>The Lutheran church certainly did not teach her to supplement “Bible study 
with books such as Watchman Nee’s <I>Spiritual Man</I>, Brother Lawrence’s 
[<I>The</I>] <I>Practice of the Presence of God </I>and the writings of Madame 
Guyon.”<SUP>22</SUP></P>
<P><I>Charisma</I> writer, Ken Walker, describes Guyon as “a 17th century 
writer.” He fails to mention that Guyon was a French, Catholic mystic. PFO has 
covered the terrible errors of Guyon in its article, “The Mindless Mysticism Of 
Madam Guyon,” showing the confusion and occultism of this medieval 
mystic.<SUP>23</SUP> </P>
<P>Likewise, Brother Lawrence was a 17th century Catholic mystic, who claimed, 
“That perfect resignation to God was a sure way to heaven.”<SUP>24</SUP> 
Lawrence, typical of mystics, failed to realize that Jesus is the <I>sure</I> 
and <I>only way</I> to Heaven (John 14:6). </P>
<P>Our Lord said, “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good 
fruit” (Luke 6:43). Meyer, like others lacking discernment, gets her spiritual 
nourishment from bad trees. Yes, Charismatic beliefs do “fuel conflict” with 
Evangelical Christianity when their sources are unbiblical and 
non-Christian.</P>
<P>Speaking of bad theology, it’s unfortunate that Vinson Synan, dean of the 
School of Divinity at Regent University in Virginia, compares “Meyer to Baptist 
pastor Charles Stanley, saying she can hold a crowd’s interest without fiery 
rhetoric or sensational preaching.”<SUP>25</SUP> That’s where the similarity 
ends. Stanley’s views are neither in a state of change, nor is his theology 
aberrant or heretical. Stanley and Meyer are on complete opposite ends of the 
spectrum when it comes to obeying Paul’s command to rightly divide the Word of 
Truth.</P>
<P align=center><B>IGNORANCE IS BLISS</B></P>
<P>In preparation for ministry, Meyer claims a divine call on her life, stating 
“she sensed the Holy Spirit saying, ‘You are going all over the place to teach 
My Word.’”<SUP>26</SUP> While it is commendable for one to teach God’s Word, it 
is imperative that one obeys God’s admonition to: “Do your best to present 
yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and 
who correctly handles the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15) and “Watch your life 
and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both 
yourself and your hearers” (1 Timothy 4:16). One cannot be said to be properly 
teaching God’s Word when they violate these commands.</P>
<P>Throughout Meyer’s rise into ministry, her mentors and the reservoirs from 
which she has developed her theology are hazardous-waste sites. From 17th 
century mystics to 20th century Word-Faith proponents, Meyer has fed on a 
harmful diet of unbiblical teaching. </P>
<P align=center><B>CANCEROUS TEACHING</B></P>
<P>While Meyer has been greatly influenced by the Word-Faith advocates, the 
“health” message they preach has not been realized in her own physical 
well-being. In her tape set, <I>Overcoming Adversity</I>, Meyer details her 
fight with breast cancer and the mastectomy that followed.<SUP>27</SUP></P>
<P>On the back of the album cover she reveals,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“During a routine checkup in 1989, doctors discovered that I had breast 
  cancer; and I was advised to have surgery immediately. Dave and I prayed and 
  sought God about what to do. Our children, staff, pastor, and friends all 
  prayed. For me, it would have been easier to say, ‘God will take care of me. 
  I’m not having the surgery.’ However, it would have been a statement of the 
  flesh — of presumption — not faith. At the time, I did not have the assurance 
  that only God can give to take such a stand. I had the surgery. The cancer had 
  not reached the lymph nodes, and I do not have cancer anymore!”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No matter how you view Meyer’s statement, it is confusing and inconsistent. 
And it demonstrates that the “faith” message does not work. Once again, God 
becomes culpable because He did not provide her with the assurance “to take such 
a stand.” Apparently, Meyer has to come up with a rationale as to why she went 
to a doctor and elected to have the surgery — which is a departure from 
Word-Faith’s “health” gospel message and, in fact, a negative confession.</P>
<P>However, the “wealth” message certainly seems to be fulfilled in her life and 
ministry. The <I>Charisma</I> article stated that approximately 600 radio and 
television stations, plus seven cable networks and seven satellite networks 
spanning the globe, carry her program. She adds 30,000 names to her mailing list 
each month and has sold nearly three million tapes and close to a million books 
last year.<SUP>28</SUP> This being the case, how then does her ministry manage 
to grow at such a phenomenal rate? Does not this signify the Spirit’s 
involvement and blessing upon her work?</P>
<P>Pastor Matzat offers this sane and revealing observation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Here is the deception in all this: A person gains a following, they get a 
  lot of money because they sell a lot of tapes, and think it’s the blessing of 
  God, when all they are doing is telling sinners what sinners want to hear. 
  What do sinners want to hear? I’m not a sinner! Of course, people flock to you 
  for that and therefore, it’s not the blessing of God. It’s simply a 
  deception.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Matzat further warns:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Joyce Meyer is the classic case of an individual who knows absolutely no 
  theology, who has read a few books, picked up some ideas, takes some popular 
  notions then teaches them. It’s these kinds of people who are dangerous in the 
  Body of Christ because they know nothing. She has no grasp of historic 
  systematic theology. Basically what she’s doing is, she’s going back to Rome 
  with her understanding of sin. Because the Roman Catholic church teaches that 
  we are no longer bearing the sinful nature. She has rejected the basic 
  Reformational truth of justification. She’s a 
heretic!”<SUP>29</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><B>BLIND LEADING THE BLIND</B></P>
<P>Meyer maintains her “ministry is so important because we’re called to the 
believers. We’re to help believers mature, and grow up.”<SUP>30</SUP> Yet, how 
can she fulfill such a noble “call” when she, herself, has no proper 
understanding of the doctrine of justification and promotes a different gospel? 
The Gospel is something every true believer should understand. Meyer’s confusion 
on such a vital tenet of the Christian faith emphasizes an immaturity on her 
part and an inability to help others. Rather, she is simply blindly leading the 
blind.</P>
<P>She credits the devil with stealing the knowledge of her salvation as a young 
believer.<SUP>31</SUP> It would appear that Satan is still lying to her 
regarding the message of salvation because she has not renounced the “born again 
Jesus” gospel which she continues to tacitly support.</P>
<P align=center><B>IMITATION IS THE SINCEREST FORM OF HERESY</B></P>
<P>Latter-day Saints have imitation scriptures. Jehovah’s Witnesses have 
imitation prophecies. Many within the Word-Faith or Charismatic camps, like the 
Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses, have an imitation gospel. This type of 
imitation is deadly. There should be no doubt that Meyer truly fosters “another 
gospel.” Unbelievably, she sanctimoniously states on her tape:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“I might as well go and smack Him right in the face if I’m going to go 
  around and feel guilty and condemned. Every time you feel guilty and condemned 
  it’s just like slapping Him in the face and saying, ‘You didn’t do a good 
  <I>job</I>. You didn’t do a complete <I>job</I>. I’m an old rotten this and 
  I’m an old rotten that.’”<SUP>32</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here Meyer’s “born again Jesus” gospel further takes on the elements of the 
“self-love, self-image, self-esteem” gospel. Her words bear further weight to 
Matzat’s charge that she is simply “telling sinners what sinners want to hear.” 
The Bible never focuses on man’s worth, but on God’s love. Man does need to 
experience the guilt and condemnation of his sin. It is only when man feels he 
is “an old rotten this” that the eminence of Christ’s sacrifice is realized. 
Therein, also, is the true working and anointing of the Holy Spirit. </P>
<P align=center><B>PRACTICAL BUT DEADLY</B></P>
<P>While Meyer’s preaching may be folksy and down-to-earth, it isn’t biblical 
when it comes to the Gospel, the crux of Christianity. Most of those who hear or 
watch Meyer via radio and television, are probably unaware that she espouses 
heresy. Yet Peter warns us:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be 
  false teachers among you. They will <I>secretly introduce destructive 
  heresies</I>, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them bringing swift 
  destruction on themselves” (2 Peter 2:1, emphasis added).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In spite of this, many believe that she offers “good practical teaching.” 
People may enjoy her “folksy” preaching but do they, in the long term, really 
spiritually benefit from it? We cannot allow symbolism to win out over 
substance. Paul reminds us, “Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the 
whole lump?” (1 Corinthians 5:6). Partaking of Meyer’s down-to-earth fare can be 
as deadly as one trying to eat rat poison and spit out the arsenic from it while 
nourishing on the cornmeal. It cannot be done. And no, the analogy of eating the 
chicken and spitting out the bones (of error) just doesn’t cut it when you 
consider that the average believer doesn’t have the discernment necessary to 
separate heresy from orthodoxy — babies and small children are incapable of 
performing such a task of bone-spitting. They choke on the bones.</P>
<P>Saying Joyce Meyer has practical teachings is on the same level as saying 
she’s a nice person. It doesn’t matter. If you have a nice Jehovah’s Witness or 
nice New Ager, the value of their message is not established on a congenial 
disposition but on their core doctrinal beliefs. False prophets, though 
sometimes nice or practical, are still deadly. So what if one is a <I>nice</I> 
heretic? So what if one is a <I>practical</I> false teacher? We benefit nothing 
from a nice and practical heretic.</P>
<P>The Body of Christ has so disparaged theology that even a rudimentary 
understanding of heresy is not in the language of the average believer. 
Practicality has become the sole standard for judging theology because all other 
standards are absent. Thus, practicality wins the day by default. </P>
<P>Others claim that Meyer espouses a positive faith message. Yet, faith is 
nothing more than trust, leaning on, clinging to, and relying upon God. What 
they’re saying, in effect, is that she puts out a positive Word-Faith message. 
But just how positive can a message be when you have a counterfeit gospel which 
Galatians 1:8-9 says causes one to be eternally condemned? Not very positive at 
all!</P>
<P>Consider, too, some of her practical teachings:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Now, I don’t know what hell looks like but God gave me a few ideas. It’s 
  hot, fire hot, but at the same time it’s cold and clammy. That’s kind of 
  different, isn’t it. Fire hot, but cold and clammy.”<SUP>33</SUP> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once again, Meyer appeals to God’s intervention in going beyond the 
Scriptures. Then there’s her concept that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Pain is a spirit. When it gets on your body, tell it to 
  leave.”<SUP>34</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That would be practical advice if it worked. But it doesn’t.</P>
<P align=center><B>HOW IMPORTANT CAN A COMMA BE?</B> </P>
<P>Meyer advocates teaching that would endear her to the Jehovah’s Witnesses and 
in doing so aids and encourages them. Consider her words:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“And in Luke 23:43, Jesus said unto him, ‘I say unto you today you shall be 
  in paradise with me.’ There’s no punctuation in the original translations of 
  the Bible. We have punctuated it and in this particular Scripture it was 
  punctuated wrong. They put in there: ‘I say unto you comma today you shall be 
  in paradise with me’ making it appear that the minute Jesus died on the cross 
  He went straight to paradise. No, no, no. He did not. The way it should read 
  is: ‘I say unto you today comma. I’m telling you today. Today I’m telling you 
  that you are going to be in paradise with me.’ But He didn’t say, ‘You’re 
  going to be there today.’ He said, ‘I’m telling you this 
  today.’”<SUP>35</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What Meyer attempts to do here, is explain away a key passage of Scripture 
which would disprove her belief that Jesus was ushered into the depths of hell, 
rather than going directly to paradise. Within Charismatic and Pentecostal 
circles, “spiritual death of Jesus” advocates are relatively alone in their 
desire to move the comma in Luke 23:43. However, in the cult realm, they are in 
good (or not so good) company. Strident annihilationists say virtually the same 
thing. Compare these comments found in a <I>Watchtower</I> magazine:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“In the <I>King James Version</I> the comma’s being placed before the word 
  ‘today’ makes it appear that Jesus told the evildoer that he would be in 
  Paradise that very same day. This would mean that Jesus would have to come 
  into his Kingdom, and that Jesus, as well as the evildoer, would be in 
  Paradise on that very day that he was speaking.”<SUP>36</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Additionally, the Jehovah’s Witness version of the Bible, <I>The New World 
Translation of the Holy Scriptures</I>, renders Luke 23:43 along the lines of 
Meyer’s scriptural interpretation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Like the Watchtower, Meyer has absolutely no scholarly foundation for such a 
belief. She reads into Scripture (eisegesis) whatever it takes in order to 
buttress her heretical doctrine. This, too, is not very practical.</P>
<P>Since there are no commas used in the Greek manuscripts, the punctuation in 
English must be determined by the context, as well as the other verses that 
speak of Jesus’ cross work and the afterlife. That is why all versions (except 
<I>The New World Translation</I>) have the comma after “you” and not “today” in 
Luke 23:43. The immediate and larger context demand that the comma be placed 
where it is, in virtually every modern version.</P>
<P>Dr. Randolph Yaeger, in his substantial work, <I>The Renaissance New 
Testament</I>, translates Luke 23:43: “Therefore He said to him, truly I am 
telling you, Today you will be with me in Paradise.”<SUP>37</SUP></P>
<P>Greek scholar Kenneth Wuest renders Luke 23:43: “And He said to him, 
Assuredly I to you am saying, Today with me you shall be in 
paradise.”<SUP>38</SUP></P>
<P>Former Jehovah’s Witness David Reed criticizes the Watchtower rationale of: 
“In keeping with the context, we omit the comma before ‘today.’” And 
perceptively observes: “However, what the JW translators should really say is 
that ‘in keeping with their <I>doctrine</I>,’ they move the 
comma.”<SUP>39</SUP></P>
<P>Dr. Ron Rhodes further shows the inconsistency of the moved comma:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“It is helpful to observe how the phrase, ‘Truly I say to you’ is used 
  elsewhere in Scripture. The phrase — which translates the Greek Words <I>amen 
  soi lego</I> — occurs 74 times in the Gospels and is always used as an 
  introductory expression. ... Now here’s the important point: In 73 out of the 
  74 times the phrase occurs in the Gospels, the <I>New World Translation</I> 
  places a break — such as a comma — immediately after the phrase, ‘Truly I tell 
  you.’ Luke 23:43 is the <I>only</I> occurrence of this phrase in which the 
  <I>New World Translation</I> does not place a break after it. Why? ... this 
  would go against Watchtower theology. Hence the relocated 
  comma.”<SUP>40</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><B>HELPLESS HELPER</B></P>
<P>The bedrock theme of her ministry is presenting “before God intervened” 
illustrations of herself along with “after God intervened” illustrations, then 
giving advice on how her listeners, using the Word of God, can do the same thing 
in their lives. The <I>Charisma</I> article seems to award her the Christian 
world’s official poster girl for hurting women. Many women suffer from mental 
and sexual abuse and may benefit from the advice and counsel of someone who’s 
been there. This in itself is not a bad thing. But if Meyer wants to truly teach 
the Bible, rightly divide the Word of Truth and affect lives in a lasting way, 
she needs to get a theological education and a sound doctrinal foundation. Real 
results can only be gauged by time.</P>
<P>We must remember that her teaching style is not the only thing that draws 
large crowds — it is also her teachings. Are the teachings sound or only that 
which tickle itching ears? Paul’s words in 2 Timothy 4:3-4 loom prophetic and 
timely for our day.</P>
<P align=center><B>PROBLEM OR SYMPTOM?</B></P>
<P>Joyce Meyer continues to have a huge impact upon women of every denomination. 
Yet, despite her false teaching, Meyer is really not the essence of the problem, 
only an evident symptom. The real problem lies within the leadership of the Body 
of Christ for not teaching, emphasizing, and reinforcing the essential doctrines 
of historic, orthodox Christianity and further exhibiting how sound teaching 
contrasts with the aberrant and heretical theology of the cults. Large portions 
of the Church’s leadership have been lazy. Few churches have counter-cult 
material available to their people. Yet this is a battle the Christian faces 
every day. </P>
<P>For too long, the Church has avoided essential Christian doctrine. Because we 
don’t do our homework, we produce theologically weak Christians. As a result, 
members fall prey to cults which could ultimately lead them away from a saving 
knowledge of Jesus Christ. Messages from the pulpit and from Sunday School 
teachers rarely focus on the essentials of our faith. If anything, they are 
quickly touched upon or referenced to, causing little understanding and lots of 
confusion in the process. “Doctrine divides” has been the hue and cry. Yes, 
doctrine does divide — that’s its very purpose. It divides us from the Jehovah’s 
Witnesses and from those, like Meyer, who promote a distorted view of Christ and 
His atonement.</P>
<P>With such a teaching vacuum created, this was bound to happen. Until the 
issue of how to properly handle the Word of Truth is dealt with by the Body of 
Christ, these problems are going to continue and false teachers, like Joyce 
Meyer, will continue to flourish.</P>
<P>Finally, Meyer herself needs to be rebuked, not applauded as “<I>The Preacher 
Who Tells It Like It Is.”</I> She plays with the truth and recreates and 
fabricates her past as far as what she taught. She fails to understand essential 
Christian teaching. Scripture, whether knowingly or unknowingly in her view, is 
insufficient, thereby requiring “revelation knowledge” to supplement it. </P>
<P>Likewise, her gospel is insufficient and needs to be supplemented with an 
atonement in hell. Is she really fit to be called a minister of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ? Her endorsement by <I>Charisma</I> magazine ought to be evidence 
enough to disqualify her as an Evangelical minister.</P>
<P>Somehow, those who <I>really, “</I>tell it like it is” are looked down upon 
as overeducated, unanointed, critical, religious attackers. The bottom line is 
that as a result of not studying to show herself approved unto God, Meyer 
succumbs to heresies, promotes false teaching and does <I>not</I> tell it like 
it is — she tells it like it isn’t. </P>
