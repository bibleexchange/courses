      <P>Dear Friend Donna,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for 
      contributing your extensive thoughts regarding Ellen G. White’s 50 Bible 
      Contradictions.&nbsp; I do want to bring one fact to your attention: 
      neither Robert Sanders nor myself have any web site “called the Ellen 
      White web site” as you mistakenly think.&nbsp; But I do want to commend 
      you for your statement: “I could share with you many more contradictions 
      in the Spirit of Prophecy (writings of EGW) ...” I am glad we are both in 
      full agreement that EGW does indeed contradict the Bible (to say nothing 
      of the fact that she also repeatedly contradicts herself, modern science, 
      history, and common sense).<BR><SPAN style="COLOR: red">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      However, I am concerned that you attempt to justify EGW’s acknowledged 
      contradictions by claiming God’s Word lacks integrity.</SPAN>&nbsp; This 
      same approach has always been Seventh-day Adventism’s “quick fix” when 
      faced with EGW’s clear contradictions.&nbsp; I hope you understand the 
      attempt to discredit the Bible is a two-edged sword which cuts to pieces 
      Seventh-day Adventism’s view of Ellen White.&nbsp; For example, consider 
      the following:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The SDA Church has long claimed 
      that the reason they believe EGW is a genuine prophet is because she 
      “fulfills the Bible tests for a prophet.”&nbsp; From your statement “she 
      does pass the test of a true prophet,” I understand you agree with the SDA 
      Church’s official position on this.&nbsp; But let’s think more carefully 
      about that.&nbsp; If, as you claim in your letter, the Bible is not 
      reliable, then how can you and the SDA Church be credible by appealing to 
      the Bible for proof that EGW is a genuine prophet?&nbsp; <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">You see, if the Bible is not reliable in recording 
      simple historical facts, as you claim, then it certainly cannot be relied 
      upon to prove Ellen White’s claim to inspiration.&nbsp;</SPAN> So you and 
      the SDA Church are left with only one “proof” of the authenticity of EGW – 
      and that is the circular argument that she is inspired because she said 
      she was inspired!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You would not accept that same 
      reasoning from a Mormon about Joseph Smith’s claim to inspiration!&nbsp; 
      No, you would open the Bible to prove them wrong – the very same Bible you 
      tell me has myriad errors, contradictions, and inconsistencies!&nbsp; And 
      neither would you accept your own reasoning from the Christian Scientists 
      regarding Mary Baker Eddy’s inspiration; nor from the Jehovah’s Witnesses 
      regarding Charles Taze Russell's inspiration.&nbsp; So why would you 
      use&nbsp; circular reasoning to convince me that EGW’s claim to 
      inspiration is genuine?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) By attempting to 
      discredit God’s Word, claiming it is full of contradictions, you 
      contradict Ellen White’s own “divinely inspired” comments regarding the 
      integrity of the Bible: “Brethren, cling to your Bible, as it reads, and 
      stop your criticisms in regard to its validity, and obey the Word, and not 
      one of you will be lost” – <I>Selected Messages</I>, vol. 2, page 
      18.&nbsp; And here’s another: “The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted as 
      an authoritative, infallible revelation of (God’s) will” – Great 
      Controversy, page vii.&nbsp; Now, Donna, if you are unable to believe in 
      Ellen White enough to trust what she said about the validity, authority, 
      and infallibility of the Bible, how do expect to convince me to believe in 
      her?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you see that in your attempt to disparage 
      God’s Word you are contradicting the very “prophet” you’re trying to 
      support?&nbsp; The fact is, Donna, you can either accept the Bible as 
      God’s full and final authority regarding His will, or you can accept Ellen 
      White as God’s full and final authority regarding His will.&nbsp; But you 
      cannot have them both, because they totally 
      disagree!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know how the SDA Church tried to 
      solve that problem?&nbsp; They came up with&nbsp; The Clear Word Bible 
      (written by Jack Blanko, published by the Review and Herald, their best 
      selling book in 1993).&nbsp; That uniquely Seventh-day Adventist Bible is 
      filled with Ellen White’s own words written directly into the text just as 
      if it was the Bible prophets own writings.&nbsp; Thus it is the only Bible 
      in history which “agrees” with Ellen White.&nbsp; But notice, Seventh-day 
      Adventists produced this false “Bible” just like the Jehovah’s Witnesses 
      produced their false New World Translation to support their false 
      prophet’s errors, and just like the Mormons produced their false Book of 
      Mormon to support their false prophet’s errors.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Doesn’t it bother you that the SDA Church had the brazen gall to rewrite 
      the Bible – indeed blatantly butcher God’s Word – just so the Bible would 
      agree with Ellen White? Do you see the similarity now between these three 
      cults: Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Seventh-day Adventists?&nbsp; And 
      aren’t you right in there with them?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) You 
      realize, of course, that your attempt to discredit God’s Word as being 
      full of contradictions, errors, and inaccuracies, contradicts our Lord, 
      Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Consider what Jesus had to say about the Bible in the 
      following texts:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John 17:17&nbsp;<B> “Sanctify them 
      by the truth; your word is truth.” </B>Notice Jesus didn’t say the Bible 
      only contained a bit of truth, He said it “is truth.”&nbsp; According to 
      Jesus, the Bible is not a half truth, it is truth, the whole truth, and 
      nothing but the truth.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Samuel 22:31&nbsp;<B> "As 
      for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless.”&nbsp; 
      </B>Donna, are you really ready to contradict God Himself by claiming His 
      word is full of flaws?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deuteronomy 32:4&nbsp; <B>“He 
      is the Rock, his works are perfect.”</B>&nbsp; Are you really comfortable 
      contradicting God Himself by claiming God’s works are imperfect in order 
      to support the false prophet Ellen G. White?&nbsp; Isn’t that a spiritual 
      crime of the highest magnitude?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 19:7&nbsp;<B> 
      “The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the 
      LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.”&nbsp; </B>Don’t you see 
      your attacks on God’s Word simply demonstrate your lack of knowledge about 
      the Bible and your blind zeal in regard to Ellen White?&nbsp; If you 
      really understood the Bible as you claim, you certainly wouldn’t be so 
      foolish as to make such wicked statements about God.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Psalm 12:6&nbsp;<B> “And the words of the LORD are flawless, like silver 
      refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven 
      times.”</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proverbs 30:5&nbsp; <B>"Every word of 
      God is flawless.”</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can search through your 
      Bible and discover many more texts clearly teaching the flawless 
      perfection of God’s Word – but you will never find a single text 
      supporting your belief&nbsp; that God’s Word contains contradictions, 
      errors, and mistakes!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I write this to you in 
      Christian kindness: the so-called contradictions you presented in your 
      letter are simply evidence of your ignorance of God’s Word.&nbsp; Once you 
      let loose of Ellen White you will have no trouble understanding the 
      Bible.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, it is my prayer that God 
      will help you discover the truths of His perfect Word and reject the 
      outright lies of the false prophet, Ellen G. White.<BR>God 
      bless,<BR><BR>&nbsp;Sydney Cleveland</P>
