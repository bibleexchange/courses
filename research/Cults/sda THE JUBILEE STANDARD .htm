      <P><B>Note </B><I><B>by Robert K. Sanders<O:P> </B><O:P>: 
      "</I><O:P>Adventist Fanaticism". Hiram Edson’s letter to Snow showcases 
      "the sure foundation" upon which Ellen G. White and the founders of the 
      denomination built their faith in setting many dates for the Lord's 
      return. On May 29,1845, Hiram Edson wrote his letter of warning to "the 
      Jubilee Standard" paper, as a warning that the Lord was going to come, and 
      predicted his coming in three months, August 1845, notice the italicized 
      words I placed for emphases. <O:P></O:P></P>
      <P>Little wonder all their time setting dates failed. Wm. Miller spawned 
      many false prophets that predicted a date for the Lord’s coming. Not only 
      did Miller but also James and Ellen White, <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/Edson's%20final%20version%20with%20appendices%20corrected.pdf">Hiram 
      Edson </A>and <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/Bates_to_Hastings.htm">Joseph 
      Bates</A>. Bates date setting was calculated by using the <A 
      href="http://www.truthorfables.com/EGW_Time_Setting.htm">seven drops of 
      blood formula</A> that forecasted the Lord would return in 1851. The sure 
      foundation and pillar of the faith was date setting, and in doing so 
      contradicted the Word of God. Jesus says in, (Mat 24:36 NIV) ""No one 
      knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, 
      but only the Father." (Mat 24:26 NIV) ""So if anyone tells you, ‘There he 
      is, out in the desert,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner 
      rooms,’ do not believe it." If you were an Adventist back in the early 
      1840’s would you have followed this fanaticism and disobey the Lord? This 
      is exactly what the White’s and their followers did and the Adventist 
      Church still supports them as being guided by God in their rebellion. The 
      Adventist Church claims these pioneers are his special people and they 
      have God’s special message to the world. Are you proud of your Adventist 
      heritage and being a member of the remnant church?<O:P> </O:P></P>
      <P>Some of you may not be aware that the Charles Taze Russell, the founder 
      of the Watchtower Society (The Jehovah’s Witnesses) was associated with 
      Millerites.&nbsp; He also predicted several dates for the Lord to return 
      and was a total failure as were the Adventists pioneers. There is no doubt 
      Adventism and the Jehovah’s Witnesses start was based on fanaticism, 
      instead of the Word of God. <O:P></O:P></P>

      </SPAN><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P>Dear Bro. Snow: - THE LORD COMETH! so says the law and the testimony. I 
      believe it to a point generally conceded that the lot in which Daniel is 
      to stand at the end of the 1335 days will be the redeemed "purchased 
      possession", the land which the righteous shall inherit and dwell therein 
      for ever. Therefore the Lord may come, raise the dead and change the 
      living saints, cut off the wicked, root out the transgressors, before or 
      by the ending of the days; see Isa. xxxiv. 1-10, especially the 8th verse; 
      also ixiii. 4. <I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">And we believe we have good 
      evidence that the 1335 days end this year and I cannot extend time beyond 
      August next.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></I></P>
      <P>Our Lord swore to the time, and that when we shall have accomplished to 
      scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be<I> 
      </I>finished. Has not that come? Is not our power gone? Deut. xxxii-35,36. 
      Have we not gone even to Babylon? Knowledge shall be increased the wise 
      shall understands, and the path of the just is to shins more and more unto 
      the perfect day.</P>
      <P>I need not pause to present evidences that <I><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">the year of God’s redeemed is come</SPAN></I> and the 
      year of the recompense for the controversy of Zion. Has not the trumpet of 
      alarm been sounded in all God’s holy<I> </I>mountains, and given a certain 
      sound? Have not the inhabitants of the land trembled in consequence of the 
      evidence presented showing the day of the Lord at hand? Have we not had 
      the midnight cry, the antitype, of the Jubilee trumpet in the 49th year? 
      There have been voices saying 'the kingdoms of this world are become,’ 
      &amp;c. ‘And the time of the dead that they should be judged and that 
      reward should be given,‘ &amp;c. Also the marriage of the Lamb in come, 
      and It has been written ‘Blessed are they that are called to the MARRIAGE 
      SUPPER Of the Lamb,’ And He say these are the true sayings of God; hath He 
      said and will he not do it? Hath he promised<I> </I>and will not He make 
      It good<I>? </I>We have had all these in chronological order, perfectly 
      agreeing with the Word;<I> </I>and the Lord has nowhere warned us of a 
      counterfeit currency of this<I> </I>kind. And as these voices were to be 
      heard under the seventh trumpet, does it not follow of necessity, that the 
      seventh trumpet has sounded? And the Lord has condescended to mark out the 
      signs of the times of these last days with so much exactness that his 
      people might know the whereabouts, where they were nearing the haven of<I> 
      </I>eternal rest.</P>
      <P>The ‘times of the Gentiles’ <I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">are 
      fulfilled</SPAN></I>; we have come to 'this dispensation of the fullness 
      of times,’ - ‘the times of restitution of all things,' <I><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">and the time of blotting out of sins</SPAN>,</I> when 
      the ‘refreshing shall from the presence of the Lord.’ and the times of the 
      Covenant, when He<I> </I>‘shall take away their sins;’ Rom. viii. 23; 
      xi.25-27; Eph. i.14; iv.30; Acts iii.19-21.</P>
      <P>We came up to the types of the 7th month, and was not the Lord in it? 
      Is not the cloud between us and our enemies? We came upon the types of the 
      passover in the first month, and was not the Lord in it?<I> </I>Was not 
      the passover the Day Dawn, and is not the Day Star arising? Are we not in 
      the morning watch? The Lord has been looking through the pillar and 
      troubling our enemies, taking off their chariot-wheels so<I> </I>‘that 
      they drove them heavily,’ burning their cities and their land. <I>Have not 
      the servants of God been sealed in their foreheads? </I>The destroying 
      angel <I>has commenced hurting the earth. </I>The four winds are being 
      loosed, and speedy preparations are being made for the slaughters and soon 
      the Lord shall raise up a great whirlwind from the coasts of the earth. On 
      rushes the time of trouble, but the Lord will be the hope of his peoples 
      and deliver then out of it.</P>
      <P>We come next in chronological orders not to mount Sinai, to receive the 
      law on tables of stones <I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">but the anniversary of 
      the Lord's descent thereon</SPAN>,</I> I believe, to receive the law 
      written on our hearts and in our minds, no more to teach our neighbor or 
      brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,’ for then all shall have known him from 
      the least unto the greatest.</P>
      <P>The third, and next, order of types claims our present attention. 
      Please examine with care the following scriptures: Ex. xxxiv.22-2l; 
      xxii.16,l7; Deut. xvi.9-12; Num. xxviii.26; Matt. Xiii.39; Lev. 
      xx3iii.15-21; Isa. xviii.7, and make the application. The first fruits are 
      a very prominent feature of the quotations on types. Paul says, ‘Christ 
      the FIRST FRUITS,<I> </I>afterwards they that are Christ's AT HIS COMING.’ 
      It was on this anniversary that the Holy Ghost descended and sat upon the 
      Apostles like unto cloven tongues of fire, and they spoke 'with other 
      tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance.' <I><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">This is the anniversary of the Lord's decent on mount 
      Sinai</SPAN></I>. 'whose voice, Paul says, ‘then shook the earth, but now, 
      hath he promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but 
      also heaven,' thus connecting the second shaking and the removing of those 
      things that are shaken with this anniversary. And I think we have not had 
      the antitype of the two-wave loaves baked with leaven, which are the first 
      fruits unto the Lord. If so, where and when? ‘Till heaven and earth pass, 
      not one jot or tittle of the law shall pass, till all be fulfilled.’ 'Thou 
      shalt number from the morrow after the sabbath,’ (in the <I>passover 
      week)</I><U> </U>'from the day ye brought the first fruits of the wave 
      offering, seven sabbaths shall be complete.<SPAN style="COLOR: red">' 
      <I>The number seven is an important number in the Bible, and brings us to 
      important points</I>.</SPAN> And in this case it is expressly said to be 
      'complete’, at the end of which the two wave loaves Jews and Gentiles, 
      both houses of Israel are to be brought out of their habitations, baked 
      with leaven. These are expressly declared to be the first fruits unto the 
      Lord.</P>
      <P>Now we understand that Christ's resurrection is the antitype of the 
      first fruits on the morrow after the sabbath, in the passover week; and 
      from that point, when the passover is being fulfilled In the kingdom of 
      God, <I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">I believe seven sabbaths will complete 
      the first fruits unto God.</SPAN></I><SPAN style="COLOR: red"> </SPAN>even 
      they which are Christ's at his coming.' 'Then shall the present be brought 
      unto the Lord,’ Isaiah xviii,7. Paul, after exhorting us to certain duties 
      in Heb. x, assures us if we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of 
      the truths, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain 
      fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation, which shall devour 
      the adversaries. And exhorts not to cast away our confidence, for we have 
      need of patience after we have done the will of God that we might receive 
      the promise<I>, <SPAN style="COLOR: red">'For yet a little while and he 
      that shall come</SPAN> </I>will come, and will not tarry,’ Then in the 
      12th chapter, presents the example of Esau, to the intent we should not do 
      as he did, for when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected, 
      for he found no place for repentance, though he<I> </I>sought it carefully 
      with tears.' There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins; 2 Esdras vi. 8,9 
      says, Esau is the end of the world, Jacob in the beginning of it that 
      followeth.</P>
      <P>Paul after this admonition goes on to tell us we ‘are not come to the 
      mount that might be touched, and that<I> </I>burned with fire and the 
      voice of words,’ &amp;c.; but we ‘are come unto mount Zion, and unto the 
      city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.’ Followed by exhortations; 
      insists that antitype of Mt. Sinai is not yet fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Yours, waiting,</P>
