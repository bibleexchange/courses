<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; New>The 
Charismatic movement has been false from its inception and was a scheme of Satan 
to destroy the Classical Pentecostal and holiness movements of the twentieth 
century.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They have certainly succeeded. It all appears to 
have started with Kathryn Kuhlman who was a lasting influence of this false 
unity with the Harlot church .The Charismatic movement was designed by the devil 
to do to the Pentecostal churches what Constantine and Roman Catholicism did to 
the early church in the fourth century.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Satan’s 
master-stroke has always been to join and dilute what he cannot stop.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>The Catholic churches and the Charismatic churches are perfect 
bedfellows and have been so joined from their beginning.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>Here is a list of their similarities.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>We will 
discuss each item separately.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; New>What 
a picture this represents.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>No religious group is 
promoting the acceptance of the Roman Catholic Church as “Christian” with 
greater devotion than the Charismatic coalition of individual ministers. They 
are clearly one of the children of the Mother Harlot and are being prepared to 
unite in accomplishing her goals of the future.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Let’s 
view the unique likeness within the Roman Catholic system and the 
Charismatics.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Certainly, there are honest and genuine 
people within the Charismatic world that are blind to their ultimate 
designs.</FONT></P>

New><B>They both fit the model of the Laodicean church as described by the Lord 
Jesus Christ Himself and sent by John.</B><SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The Scripture 
describes this model.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN><B>“I know thy works, that thou art 
neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>So 
then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out 
of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have 
need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and 
poor, and blind, and naked:I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, 
that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and 
that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with 
eyesalve, that thou mayest see.”<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN></B>(Revelation 
3:15-18)<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They have a semblance of the true faith but only 
enough likeness to pass as Christian and not enough to be acceptable to 
Him.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They have both created religious systems of great 
wealth and the ability to expand that wealth.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They are 
both proud of their wealth and worldly acceptance because of the same.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>Their poverty is evident only in their utter emptiness of a 
true Biblical godliness.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They love the world and its 
empty glories and actually flatter themselves and others with the grandeur they 
are able to manifest.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; New>It’s 
impossible to read a literal description of this letter to the Laodicean church 
and not see the exact picture of both the Catholic churches and the Charismatic 
churches.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>It’s all a big, fabulous façade.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>The one most perfect picture is Trinity Broadcasting 
Network.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>There is just enough religious emotion to 
entertain religious people, but also enough constant controversy to prove that 
the foundation is faulty.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The Lord’s counsel to this 
church was to exchange the wealth of their gold for the experience of truth that 
produces the character of gold.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>His counsel ended in a 
call for eyes that were anointed to see behind all the religious 
imitation.</FONT></P>

holiness of lifestyle.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN></B>The capacity of these systems 
to excuse sin and moral lapse is overwhelming.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Nothing is 
truly sacred except the religious system they have created.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>Homosexuality is rank in both systems.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The 
Charismatics have created an atmosphere that promotes masculinity in women and 
femininity in men.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The women that are not masculine in 
appearance are gaudy and Jezebel to the worst possible extreme.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>Nothing is in balance in either system.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>Uncontrolled flesh is always extreme in many directions.<SPAN yes&quot;>

present religious women’s movement of gaudy conferences and high-sounding advice 
is driven by the Charismatic world.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>T. D. Jakes, a 
Jesus-only deceiver, is one of the main powers.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Every 
woman that you see on the promotional material looks like a poster woman for 
Hollywood.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>It is all a religious façade sweeping its way 
to the one world church</FONT></P>

and devotion to the person of Jesus Christ.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN></B>The 
religious idea and teaching of consecration, sanctification, and separation from 
the world is absent.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>I have never read one book by a 
Charismatic personality that was centered in the deep life of holiness and 
righteousness.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Pursuing the delight of Jesus Christ’s 
imparted nature is utterly missing.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Consider the books by 
Kenneth Hagin, Benny Hinn, or any other leading spokesman, and all you have is a 
kind of worship of the Holy Spirit in a twisted form, or the hype of the “little 
god” theology.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Everything relates to these two basic 
themes or some version of them.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The materials of these 
two writers, and many others, are centered in the flesh and self, never in 
Christ and the consecration of surrender and cross-bearing living. Their own 
material is the best picture of their false theology.</FONT></FONT></P>

is<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>strangely absent in almost every aspect.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>The Charismatic Biblical world is exactly parallel to the 
Catholic world.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>New revelations and additional ideas are 
constantly added to Scripture.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The excitement and 
emotions are rooted in these added theological imaginations.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>No wonder Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, or Rick Joyner are equally at 
home in this movement.</FONT></FONT></P>

replaced Christ’s Kingdom on earth after the Seven Years of Tribulation, with 
their own kingdom based on amilleniallism or post-milleniallism.</B><SPAN

intimately than the “Kingdom Now” theology.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They are 
certainly bedfellows in establishing their kingdom in this present world. The

</SPAN></B>The last few weeks have settled the love between these two imitation 
movements of this present hour.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Some of the strongest 
love for the deceased pope and some of the strongest words of praise for his 
perceived Christ-likeness has come from leading Charismatics.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>Their true colors have been exposed for all to see.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>The Charismatics are really Catholics with a few twists of theological 
differences.<BR><BR>Joseph R. Chambers<BR><A
