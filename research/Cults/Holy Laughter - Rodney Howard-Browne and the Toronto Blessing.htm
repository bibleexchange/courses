<H1>Holy Laughter</H1>
<H2>Rodney Howard-Browne and the Toronto Blessing*</H2>
<P>There are few within the evangelical Christian churches today have not heard 
of the phenomenon known as "holy laughter." It has been increasingly manifesting 
in charismatic churches in the United States, Canada and Great Britain for over 
two years, and its reach into new churches continues at a rapid 
pace.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>WHAT IS HOLY LAUGHTER?</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>Many 
churches are reporting spontaneous, uncontrollable laughter erupting from their 
congregations, even during times of solemn ceremony or messages from the pulpit. 
Some report uncontrollable weeping, falling to the floor in ecstatic trances, 
and animal noises such as barking like dogs and roaring like lions. Some stagger 
and reel like drunken people, unable to walk a straight line. For simplicity's 
sake, all these have come to be called "holy laughter," since laughter is the 
preeminent phenomenon displayed. In simple terms, it is physical manifestations 
in the form of virtually any expression attributed to absolute control by the 
Holy Spirit.<BR><BR>Proponents of these phenomena say they are evidence of a 
fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit in response to the people's desire to see a 
new sign from God -- the latest in manifestations of Holy Ghost power, such as 
took place at Azusa Street in Los Angeles at the turn of the century. They point 
to the Welsh Revival, the Cane Ridge Revival in Bourbon County, Kentucky in 
1801, and to [Arminian] preachers like Charles Finney, to validate today's holy 
laughter experience.<BR><BR>Opponents say it is either a manifestation of the 
flesh, at best, or of demonic spirits at worst. Those who believe it is of God 
point to changed lives, deeper commitment to faith in Jesus, huge responses to 
the salvation message, a renewed strength and purpose for ministry, and all 
sorts of positive results. On the other hand, there are also reports of demonic 
oppression, suicidal feelings, and loss of faith after the holy laughter 
experience.<BR><BR>Whatever one thinks of holy laughter, it has certainly 
impressed a number of well-known personalities within the Christian media 
circuit. There seems to be a strong manifestation especially in word-faith 
churches, and within the Vineyard movement, as well as charismatic mainline 
churches such as Episcopalian and Anglican. Individuals who have flocked to holy 
laughter meetings span every denomination from Baptist to Roman 
Catholic.<BR><BR>Holy laughter has also received the endorsements of Oral and 
Richard Roberts, Marilyn Hickey, Paul and Jan Crouch, Karl Strader, Larry 
Tomszak, <A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/copeland">Kenneth 
Copeland</A>, <A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hinn">Benny 
Hinn</A>, <A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/wimber">John 
Wimber</A>, and many other hyper-charismatic luminaries.<BR><BR>While the claim 
of spontaneity is heard from all sources, the current popularity of the 
phenomenon can be traced to one man, Rodney Howard-Browne, formerly a 
Pentecostal South African evangelist. The major impetus for the worldwide spread 
of the movement has come through one church in particular -- the Toronto Airport 
Vineyard, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, famous for "the Toronto 
Blessing."<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>THE TORONTO BLESSING</STRONG></CITE> 
<BR><BR>People have flocked from all over the globe to attend services at the 
Toronto Airport Vineyard, hoping to experience holy laughter. So impacting has 
been the influence of this church on the holy laughter phenomenon that 
<CITE>Charisma</CITE> magazine devoted considerable space to the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/bless.htm">Toronto 
Blessing</A> in its February, 1995, issue.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>HOW DID IT 
START?<BR></STRONG></CITE><BR>On January 20, 1994, what was intended to be the 
start of several "revival" meetings was held at a small church located in an 
industrial complex near Pearson International Airport in Toronto. Within one 
year, it had become what Diana Doucet, writing for <CITE>Charisma</CITE>, calls, 
"a mecca of sorts." Because of the huge crowds seeking a sign from God, the 
church continues to conduct meetings every night except Mondays. Even the 
secular media have focused reports on the phenomenon with articles and 
television documentaries. The focus of all reports is upon the physical 
manifestations displayed at these meetings. Says Diana Doucet in the 2/95 
<CITE>Charisma </CITE>(pp. 20, 21):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"... Worshipers are overcome by laughing, weeping, groaning, shaking, 
  falling and, to the chagrin of some, noise-making that has been described as 
  'a cross between a jungle and a farmyard.' But of greater significance are the 
  reports of changed lives: healings, restored relationships and increased 
  fervor for God."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Doucet attributes the origins of the Toronto Blessing to Vineyard pastor 
Randy Clark of St. Louis, Missouri, who had been influenced by Rodney 
Howard-Browne in late 1993:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"... What was intended to be a four-day series of meetings with Clark 
  expanded into months of nightly services that sometimes lasted until 3 
  a.m."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>News of the movement spread, and by April, 1994, curious international 
visitors were arriving in Toronto. By December, 75,000 people from almost every 
country of the world had crossed the Airport Vineyard's threshold. Cumulative 
attendance has been more than 200,000, some 10,000 of them clergy [as of 
mid-1995].<BR><BR>It can be honestly stated that, until Clark took what he had 
received from Howard-Browne to the Toronto Vineyard, Howard-Browne and holy 
laughter were virtually unheard of. This, in spite of the fact that 
Howard-Browne claims he first experienced holy laughter in his meetings over 
thirteen years ago [1982]. Although Howard-Browne is now the most visible 
spokesman for the phenomenon, it has virtually become a <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/vine">Vineyard movement</A> 
within its own right, spreading to Europe, Asia, Africa, and other parts of the 
world.<BR><BR>The impact of the Toronto Blessing has been especially felt in 
Great Britain, where it is reported that it has touched every denomination in 
some way, with estimates that from 2,500 to 4,000 churches have had meetings 
similar to those of the Airport Vineyard.<BR><BR>Is this hyperbole, or are such 
tremendous figures for real? Knowing the penchant toward "evangelistic speaking" 
that is prevalent among charismatics, it is doubtful. But numbers aren't as 
important as the phenomenon's true spiritual origins and its true spiritual 
origins and its true spiritual consequences.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>THE 
ORIGINS</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>Rodney Morgan Howard-Browne, a burly, 6-foot 
charismatic preacher from South Africa, was born June 12, 1961, in Port 
Elizabeth, South Africa. He says he committed his life to Christ at age 5, and 
was filled with the Holy Spirit at age 8. In 1979, while praying for hours 
seeking a deeper spiritual experience, he challenged God:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"'Either You come down here and touch me, or I will come up there and touch 
  You,' he prayed in desperation. Suddenly, his whole body felt like it was on 
  fire. He began to laugh uncontrollably. Then he wept and began to speak in 
  tongues. 'I was plugged into heaven's electrical supply,' he later wrote in 
  his book, <CITE>The Touch of God. </CITE>'And since then my desire has been to 
  go and plug other people in'" (Julia Dulin, "Praise the Lord and Pass the New 
  Wine," 8/94, <CITE>Charisma,</CITE> p. 22).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For the next ten years, Howard-Browne moved about, pastoring for two years at 
Rhema Church in Johannesburg, South Africa, prior to moving to the United States 
in 1987. He became an itinerant preacher, with small engagements, throughout the 
country. It was in April, 1989, while Howard-Browne was preaching in a church 
near Albany, New York, that the holy laughter outbreak began. Browne claims that 
he felt a sensation like a heavy blanket coming over him. Soon he began falling 
out of their seats, some laughing, others crying. From that point on, his 
reputation began to grow.<BR><BR>He established the Rodney Howard-Browne 
Evangelistic Association in Louisville, Kentucky. In the spring of 1993, Karl 
Strader, pastor of Carpenter's Church in Lakeland, Florida, invited him to 
preach. Scheduled for a one-week appearance, he was carried over for three more 
weeks.<BR><BR>Since the services were broadcast on radio, many people began 
showing up at Carpenter's Church to experience what they heard on the air. It 
wasn't long before Howard-Browne was appearing on the Trinity Broadcasting 
Network (TBN). It was only shortly afterward that Howard-Browne's influence 
began to envelope the Toronto Airport Vineyard through the visit by Randy Clark. 
From that point, it was spread from the Toronto Airport Vineyard to churches 
throughout the world, primarily through the Vineyard movement.<BR><BR>In the 
final analysis, then, the present popularity of the holy laughter phenomenon can 
be traced to this one man, Rodney Howard-Browne, and his influence through radio 
and television, and his impact upon Randy Clark.<BR><BR>Or can it? Not to be 
outdone by Rodney Howard-Browne of the Vineyard movement, suddenly we learn from 
Charles and Frances Hunter (a.k.a. "the Happy Hunters") that they were 
experiencing this phenomenon many, many years ago. It's only in 1994 that they 
decided to let us know about it in their book, <CITE>Holy Laughter.</CITE> 
Frances Hunter states that she fell under the power of the Holy Spirit at a Full 
Gospel Businessmen's Fellowship banquet in Houston. She neglects to mention the 
year, but they were new to the charismatic experience at the time, so it must 
have been sometime in the 1960s or '70s at the latest. After falling down with 
Charles, she found herself glued to the floor, unable to move. Then she began to 
erupt into uncontrolled laughter for about one-half hour. After which the Holy 
Spirit allegedly released her from His grip.<BR><BR>This was just the beginning 
of holy laughter for the Hunters. Thereafter, it seems that holy laughter 
manifested itself at their meetings, almost always accompanied by claims of 
physical healings. New to the charismatic experience at the time, the Hunters 
wanted to know what the phenomenon was. They asked their good friend Lester 
Sumrall what he though of it:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Dr. Sumrall said, 'What you experienced in your service is holy laughter.' 
  Then he continued, 'Anything that is of God is holy and anything that is holy 
  has power connected to it.' Now we began to understand why the unusual 
  healings took place because it was a supernatural move of God and it brought 
  supernatural healing power with it. Hallelujah!" (<CITE>Holy Laughter</CITE>, 
  pp. 21-22).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One may wonder why holy laughter was never promoted by the Hunters until 
after it became popular through Howard-Browne and the Vineyard. The Hunters do 
mention Howard-Browne, however, and give him credit for imparting to them the 
gift of holy laughter on a greater scale by the laying on of his hands. But 
apparently they are the originators and the experts on the 
phenomenon.<BR><BR>But wait! We have another person whose claim to holy laughter 
precedes that of the Hunters. Derek Prince, writing in the 2/95 
<CITE>Charisma</CITE>, states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"I believe the Holy Spirit at times produces in people prolonged, exuberant 
  and apparently causeless laughter. I have to believe it, because that is how I 
  was saved more than 50 years ago" (p. 52).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CITE><STRONG>AN EARLIER PRECEDENT?<BR></STRONG></CITE><BR>The holy laughter 
purveyors tell us that this is really nothing new, but has always been a part of 
revival. For example, <CITE>Charisma</CITE> magazine quotes Jonathan Edwards, 
"pioneer of the First Great Awakening in the 1730s," whose revivals led to tears 
and laughter. <BR><BR>One who is convicted of sin might well laugh or cry 
<CITE>after</CITE> he has felt release from the condemnation and control of sin, 
which comes with confession and repentance. But there is no evidence he will 
bark like a dog or make other animal noises. The manifestation have historically 
been attributed to demonic spirits, not to the Holy Spirit.<BR><BR>Although 
today's holy laughter proponents like to point to Jonathan Edwards as validation 
for their practices, history doesn't line up with their claims. The fact of the 
matter is, there is no true historical precedent for what is occurring today 
with Rodney Howard-Browne, or at the Vineyard and other holy laughter meetings. 
And even if there were a true historical precedent, it would mean, at best, that 
whatever is motivating today's holy laughter participants motivated someone 
before. So what? There is no <CITE>Biblical</CITE> precedent.<BR><BR>But there 
is, the holy laughter proponents would say. It was the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit at "Pentecost" as recorded in the Book of Acts. That outpouring resulted 
in the Lord's disciples preaching the Gospel unto repentance, with the Holy 
Spirit giving them utterance in specific languages that the visitors from other 
nations could hear and understand. This is a far cry from what is occurring 
under the alleged ministry of the holy laughter 
preachers.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>IS IT OF GOD?</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>By what 
standard do the proponents of holy laughter judge whether the phenomenon is of 
God or not? Do they cite Scripture properly? Do they minister with unfailing 
signs and wonders as did Jesus' apostles? No. Rather, they base their judgment 
upon perceived results, and whether or not it catches on. Says 
Howard-Browne:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The proof that this is a move of God is that when I leave, it doesn't 
  stop" (Julia Duin, "Praise the Lord and pass the New Wine," 8/94, 
  <I>Charisma</I>, p.22).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Howard-Browne disparages those who try to apply a theological test to his 
methods. Why? Because they cannot stand a theological test. Any valid 
theological test must be based on the clear teaching of Scripture, and holy 
laughter doesn't measure up.<BR><BR>The only measure the holy laughter people 
want to apply is that which is based on outward results to their liking:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Since last March [1994], Howard-Browne has been back to Carpenter's Church 
  three times. The church has added 800 new members, and its income is up 30 
  percent, according to [pastor Karl] Strader. 'I've been here 28 years, and 
  there's never been anything like this,' he adds. 'We've had 2,200 people 
  baptized. We'd go until almost 2 a.m., Rodney baptizing them six at a time in 
  our pool. That's why we think we've had revival.' Strader invited Ron Clarke, 
  pastor of Living Water Church in Tampa, Florida, to one of the meetings. He 
  was reluctant at first, but then he found himself lying on the floor, laughing 
  uncontrollably ... Clarke is still laughing today. In one year, membership at 
  his church has grown from 800 to 1,500, and the congregation recently bought a 
  new building. Clarke says conversions, baptisms in the Holy Spirit, and 
  healings have soared" (Julia Duin, "Praise the Lord and pass the New Wine," 
  8/94, <I>Charisma</I>, p.24).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So, this so-called revival has come not through the preaching of the Gospel, 
but through allegedly uncontrollable laughter. Strange that Scripture doesn't 
record any such event. The apostles did perform signs and wonders, but the 
Gospel was always clearly delineated and repentance was called for. Seldom if 
ever is this the case with holy laughter.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>VALIDATION BY 
RESULTS<BR></STRONG></CITE><BR>The Hunters claim that the purpose of holy 
laughter is to effect healing. They offer testimony after testimony of people 
healed at their services after experiencing holy laughter. They also point to 
changed lives as do those in the Toronto Blessing and the Rodney Howard-Browne 
camps:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"People began to testify of wonderful changed in their lives. Many 
  displayed a new hunger for God and a new zeal to see Him glorified. Bad 
  relationships were healed, and weak marriages were wonderfully strengthened. 
  Formerly depressed people were changed beyond recognition" (Terry Virgo, 
  "Interrupted by the Spirit," 2/95, <I>Charisma</I>, p.29).</P>
  <P>"Church leaders also point to the spiritual fruit produced in people's 
  lives. Overall, they report, participants are experiencing a deeper 
  relationship with God. Repentance is often manifested on both a personal and a 
  congregational level. People yield to forgiveness, relationships are healed, 
  and families are restored ... Their initial experiences often led to other 
  results: the healing of long-standing emotional hurts, a growing love for the 
  Lord and an increased desire to read His Word and to pray. Reports abound with 
  testimonies of physical healings and stories of non-believers being overcome 
  by the power of God" (Diana Doucet, "What is God doing in Toronto," 2/95, 
  <CITE>Charisma</CITE>, p. 22).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>God may indeed be at work in individual lives. But results are subjective. 
Will they last? Are they emotionally based or a true work of the Holy Spirit? 
Cults point to results of changed lives for the better to validate their beliefs 
and practices. Should we not be critical of those beliefs and 
practices?<BR><BR>For that matter, the same results claimed by the holy laughter 
people can be found among non-Charismatics without benefit of the experiences. 
It may be asked, "Who is the more spiritually mature -- those whose lives are 
changed by willful obedience to God's Word, or those who cannot or will not 
change unless they experience what they believe is a supernatural manifestation 
in their lives?" Scripture would point to the former.<BR><BR>Are the conversions 
genuine? Is God using holy laughter? Let's not confuse God's grace with man's 
foolishness. Nor should we justify man's foolishness because of God's grace. And 
let's not confuse results with truth.<BR><BR>Yet, regardless of whether or not 
healings and changed lives accompany holy laughter, people are feeling 
something; they are experiencing something that convinces they that God is 
manifesting Himself to them in a unique way. But is it of God? Or is it demonic? 
Or is it merely the flesh? Can it possibly be that all three sources are being 
manifested at the same time?<BR><BR>Even the proponents of holy laughter believe 
that not all manifestations are of God. While falling short of attributing them 
to demons, they do acknowledge that sometimes the flesh gets involved:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"For Pentecostals or charismatics, such manifestations as fainting, weeping 
  or laughing aren't completely foreign. More problematic, however, are the 
  animal sounds -- particularly the barking or roaring that has been reported in 
  meetings in Toronto, London and elsewhere. Opinions vary widely on the origin 
  of these animal sounds. Many reject them as demonic. Others counted that they 
  are simply a fleshly response to the Holy Spirit. In the British magazine 
  <CITE>Alpha</CITE>, Toronto Vineyard pastor Marc Dupont suggests that the 
  noises could be from God. He tells of praying for Gideon Chui, a 
  Vancouver-based Chinese Pentecostal pastor. 'He began to roar like a lion,' 
  Dupont relates, noting that normally he would have assumed Chui needed 
  deliverance from a demon spirit. But he believed Chui's unusual vocal 
  expression heralded a sign from God. 'This symbolic, prophetic act signifies 
  that the Lion of Judah will triumph,' Dupont explains" (Diana Doucet, "What is 
  God doing in Toronto, 2/95, <CITE>Charisma</CITE>, pp. 25-26).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Are we to assume that those who bark like dogs are heralding the triumph of 
Christ in some other form? Dogs are unclean animals (as are lions). Can we 
imagine Jesus or any of the apostles barking like dogs or roaring like lions? 
Yet who was more filled with the Holy Spirit than they?<BR><BR>How can these 
facts be overlooked? Vineyard movement founder <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/wimber">John Wimber</A> offers 
a clue:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"John Wimber takes a rather neutral approach to the more bizarre 
  manifestations. 'There's nothing in Scripture that supports these kinds of 
  phenomena that I can see, and I can't think of anything throughout the church 
  age that would,' Wimber writes. 'So I feel no obligation to try to explain it. 
  It's just phenomena. It's just people responding to God'" (Diana Doucet, "What 
  is God doing in Toronto, 2/95, <CITE>Charisma</CITE>, p. 26).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What an amazing statement! His Vineyard movement has virtually exploded with 
this thing; he has exported it to the ends of the earth; and he feels no 
obligation to try to explain it, even though, by his own admission, it has no 
precedent in Scripture or in Church history. How does this measure up to 
Scripture's exhortation that we must test the spirits to see if they are of God 
or not (1 John 4:1)?<BR><BR>It will be argued that the test is whether or not 
one confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh (verses 2-3). And this, 
certainly, the proponents of holy laughter would lay claim to. In the light of 
history, we must understand that at the time John wrote those words, there was 
no one who would claim that Jesus Christ had come in the flesh other than those 
who were His true disciples. By the same token, no one could say "Jesus is 
Lord," except by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3).<BR><BR>No one can deny that, 
today, many deceivers claim that Jesus has come in the flesh; they even use the 
expression "Jesus is Lord." The Mormons, the pope, the Jehovah's Witnesses, 
virtually all pseudo-Christian cults and false teachers who come in the name of 
Christ will testify to these truths. This is evidence that we are in the last 
days (Matt. 24). While there have been false prophets through the ages, the last 
days are seeing a proliferation of false prophets coming with lying signs and 
wonders. Therefore, the test today is whether or not something is in mere 
agreement with God's Word.<BR><BR>The operative words in 1 John 4:1-3, then, 
are, "believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God." 
Today especially -- regardless of one's confession of faith -- it is imperative 
that we always try (test) the spirits. And how do we try the spirits? Luke gives 
us an example in Acts 17:11, in speaking of the Jews at Berea:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><CITE>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they 
  received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures 
  daily, whether those things were so.</CITE></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Bereans did not merely accept what the apostles told them, even though 
their words were anointed by the Holy Spirit. They searched the Scriptures to 
see if what they were told was true. If a teaching or a manifestation cannot 
bear the scrutiny of Scripture, then it must be rejected.<BR><BR>Proper exegesis 
does not permit the misapplying of God's Word in attempts to bolster acceptance 
of any teaching or phenomenon. The Scriptures must be applied properly and in 
context in order to justify acceptance by believers.<BR><BR>Since, by John 
Wimber's own admission, "there's nothing in Scripture that supports these kinds 
of phenomena," they must be classified as unbiblical or, at best, 
extra-Biblical. Let us assume the best -- that they are extra-Biblical. That 
being the case, the proponents should take care not to insist that those who do 
not enter into them or accept them as genuine manifestations of the Holy Spirit 
are missing out on God's move, or are unspiritual, or are "closed to the Holy 
Spirit." At least they should be willing to give people time to test this thing. 
But are these phenomena being presented in this manner?<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>GET 
OUT OF YOUR MIND<BR></STRONG></CITE><BR>To the contrary, Charles and Frances 
Hunter tell us not to test it, but to go whole-hog:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Could this be the way God is bringing us into the final great revival 
  before the return of Jesus? Whether it is or not, we can feel the Holy Spirit 
  moving -- and we're going right along with Him! Don't stick your toe in to 
  test the water! Don't wait! Jump all the way into this flowing river" 
  (<CITE>Holy Laughter</CITE>, p. 159).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Really? Just jump in? Don't test it? Don't wait? This is contrary to 
Scripture; it is the same tactic used by cultists to intimidate candidates to 
follow their way. Don't use your mind:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"We always need to be completely open to the move of the Holy Spirit and 
  never be so closed that we cannot see that God might be doing something so 
  fresh and new today that there is not way our finite minds can understand it! 
  Let's just enjoy it an not try to figure out God" (<CITE>Holy Laughter</CITE>, 
  p. 103).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Hunter's language indicated that they themselves aren't all that positive 
about this thing. They use the phrases, "whether or not," and "God 
<CITE>might</CITE> be doing something." Yet they insist that we not test what 
they are promoting. This is characteristic of most of the major proponents of 
holy laughter, including Rodney Howard-Browne:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Howard-Browne disparages those who try to apply a theological test to his 
  methods. 'You can't understand what God is doing in these meetings with an 
  analytical mind,' he says. 'The only way you're going to understand what God 
  is doing is with your heart'" (Julia Duin, "Praise the Lord and pass the New 
  Wine," 8/94, <I>Charisma</I>, p.26).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked (Jer. 
17:9) -- even the heart of the born again believer in Jesus. This is why 
Scripture exhorts us to examine ourselves and to judge ourselves. Our self-life 
is still part of the unredeemed flesh.<BR><BR>Scripture warns us repeatedly not 
only not to trust our hearts, but to keep a sound mind and to test everything 
that comes in the name of Christ. When lauding the Bereans for searching after 
truth, Luke tells us that they "received the word with all readiness of 
<CITE>mind</CITE>, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were 
so" (Acts 17:11).<BR><BR>Readiness of mind is important to discerning truth from 
error. Those who tell us not to trust our minds are not to be trusted. No true 
minister of God would tell us such a thing. <BR><BR>Something doesn't add up 
here. Nor does it add up that Terry Virgo, a Columbia, Missouri, pastor, would 
heartily endorse this movement on one hand, and on the other say that it must be 
proven true from Scripture:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Moving into the supernatural does not mean you kiss your brain goodbye. 
  What we experience may be amazing -- outside our normal realm -- but we should 
  be able to articulate from Scripture the precedent and the purpose for what is 
  happening" (2/95, <CITE>Charisma</CITE>, p. 25).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But there is no precedent or purpose found in Scripture for what is happening 
in the holy laughter movement.<BR><BR>We find many similar mixed signals from 
the holy laughter proponents, even within the same forum of discussion. For 
example, Mona Johnian, writing in the February, 1995, <CITE>Charisma</CITE>, 
implies dire consequences for those who do not enter into the flow of this new 
thing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The question we as believers must answer is this: Will we flow with the 
  plans and purposes of God for this hour or will we hinder revival? I'm 
  concerned that many are in danger of creating a false comfort zone for 
  themselves. By the position they're taking, they are saying: 'I'm not sure 
  about this present move. I'm just going to wait and see what happens.' But 
  Jesus said, 'He who is not with Me is against Me' (Matt. 12:30, NKJV). 
  Pentecost was not -- and is not -- an option. God considers us to be either 
  for or against what He is doing at any given time" ("Flowing With Revival," p. 
  14).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Because someone doesn't blindly accept an extra-Biblical teaching or practice 
doesn't place him in the camp of Christ's enemies. We can still be for Him. It 
is presumption to say that we will be against Him just because we don't go with 
the flow.<BR><BR>Some have said that we cannot judge these phenomena without 
being there with an open spirit. But if truth or error can only be judged by 
experience, what purpose do the Spirit of God and the Word of God serve? To 
observe any religious thing with an open spirit precludes judgment. We would do 
better to observe everything with a spirit attuned to the Holy Spirit, testing 
everything by God's Word. In fact, Derek Prince, while endorsing this movement 
says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"It is appropriate to approach unusual manifestations with caution, but not 
  with blank, negative skepticism. After all, the fact that an experience is 
  unconventional -- or even extraordinary -- does not necessarily mean that it 
  is not from God" ("Uproar in the Church," 2/95, <I>Charisma</I>, p. 
52).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Testing by God's Word, of course, is not blind skepticism. Nor is coming to 
the conclusion to reject extra-Biblical phenomena.<BR><BR><CITE>Charisma</CITE> 
publisher Steven Strang goes even further in urging caution. After experiencing 
being "slain in the Spirit" at the Toronto Airport Vineyard, he would still not 
endorse the holy laughter phenomenon personally, even though he has published 
several glowing accounts of it by others:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Am I endorsing what I saw and experienced in Toronto? No, because I still 
  don't understand much of it. Similar manifestations have occurred in past 
  revivals; but I believe an experience should also be established in the Word 
  of God. Furthermore, I'm concerned. First, I'm concerned that such a move of 
  God has the potential to create a new group of 'spiritual elite' -- with those 
  who have experienced strange manifestations wearing them like a badge of 
  spirituality. Second, I'm concerned that the manifestations themselves could 
  become so important that people who don't receive them through the power of 
  the Holy Spirit will fake them -- as Simon the magician wanted to do in Acts 
  8. Finally, I'm concerned that a new denomination of shriekers, twitchers and 
  laughter could spring up. Impossible, you say? Well, remember the Shakers and 
  Quakers -- religious sects named after the phenomenon for which they were 
  known" ("Floored in Toronto," 2/95, <CITE>Charisma</CITE>, p. 
106).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Strang's perceptions are valid. He went to Toronto; he experienced something 
there himself; yet he is reticent to endorse it because it cannot be validated 
by God's Word. And no one who knows anything about <CITE>Charisma</CITE> would 
doubt Strang's charismatic fervor. He does say that he senses that what is 
happening is a part of what God is doing because it's happening worldwide. But 
so is Islam happening worldwide. <BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>BLASPHEMING THE HOLY 
SPIRIT?</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>No doubt those who reject phenomena like this as 
being of God will be accused of blaspheming against the Holy Spirit. The 
experience-oriented religionists point to Matthew 12:31-32 to claim that those 
who attribute to Satan or to the flesh what <CITE>they</CITE> believe is the 
work of the Holy Spirit, have blasphemed against the Holy Spirit.<BR><BR>This is 
a serious accusation. Those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit are eternally 
condemned; according to Jesus' own words, they will not be forgiven in this 
world or in the next. This should cause us to be careful in making any 
assessment of supernatural (or seemingly supernatural) phenomena. Certainly we 
must guard our hearts to be sure we are not resisting the grace of God from 
impure motives.<BR><BR>The fear that comes upon many who are uncomfortable with 
these things, yet who lack understanding or discernment to be able to make a 
judgment, causes them to freeze at the thought of challenging the proponents. 
This has been the problem in the churches these days; many pastors are too 
cowardly to speak against something so bizarre, from fear that they may be 
blaspheming the Holy Spirit. Others become prideful in their acceptance of 
anything -- their non-judgmentalism -- which keeps them in touch with everything 
going on.<BR><BR>Lester Sumrall says it this way:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The reason I have been in every move of God is because I have never 
  criticized any ministry or work of God!" (<CITE>Holy Laughter</CITE>, p. 
  103)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, of course! Someone who will not criticize even the most blatantly 
unscriptural claims to truth and to God's hand at work <CITE>will </CITE>find 
himself involved in every alleged "move of God." This is the true ecumenical 
spirit that pervades the alleged supernatural manifestations at work 
today.<BR><BR>If we are confident in our relationship with the Lord based upon 
unreserved trust in His written Word. We need not fear blaspheming the Holy 
Spirit. The Lord will keep us in check or will reveal to us what is of Himself. 
There are many in the churches whose testimonies are pure -- whose walks are 
pure -- whose hearts are right before the Lord -- who do not accept holy 
laughter being of God. They are not fighting the Holy Spirit out of spite, as 
did the religionists of Jesus' day who accused Him of casting out devils by the 
prince of devils. There is not jealousy toward these people and their alleged 
Holy Spirit ministry. But there is concern that what is transpiring finds no 
genuine fertile field among gullible professing Christians whose discernment is 
woefully lacking.<BR><BR>Truth does not produce guilt except guilt of sin. It is 
not a sin to test the claims of these people; it is not a sin not to laugh when 
they prompt us to laugh; it is not a sin to reject any subjective, 
extra-Biblical or unbiblical work. Therefore, we should have no guilt for 
rejecting any of these phenomena.<BR><BR>Those who are in faith will not be 
brought under condemnation by anything or anyone except those things that are 
clearly delineated in God's Word. Everything else is subject to acceptance or 
rejection.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>JOY! JOY! JOY!</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>What is 
it that these holy laughter proponents want us to enter into without 
reservation? Obviously it entails laughter, but not always. Nor is laughter the 
end in itself. It is the joy of the Lord, they claim, that the laughter 
testifies to. As the Hunters say:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"There is a powerful new wind of the Holy Spirit blowing, but it's lots 
  more than a rushing mighty wind! There's an energizing, forceful sound that's 
  coming with this new wind of the Spirit and it is the exciting sound of joy, 
  joy, joy, joy! Not only an inward joy, but it's bringing a vocal joy, a holy 
  laughter, right along with it. It's energetically stirring us to higher levels 
  with God!" (<CITE>Holy Laughter</CITE>, p. 5)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We're told by the holy laughter purveyors that God wants to bless his people 
because He loves us so much. No matter that the churches are in a chaotic mess 
of unbelief, false doctrine, self-pride, broken marriages, adultery, ecumenical 
fervor, and toleration of sin and of different gospels. God just wants to bless 
us; He wants us to be happy.<BR><BR>While Scripture warns us that the last days 
would see a great falling away from the purity of the Faith, the holy laughter 
crowd is telling us that the last days are seeing a revival. While Scripture 
warns us that there would be false teachers abounding in great numbers in the 
last days, the charismatics and others tell us that the false teachers are those 
who are against false teachers. While Scripture warns us that judgment must come 
upon the house of God before it comes upon the world, the happy crowd tells us 
that there is no judgment coming upon the Church -- only blessings; we should be 
filled with joy, not sorrow, at the prospect of the Church's condition 
today.<BR><BR>Certainly we can understand how such a deception can come about. 
Recall how Howard-Browne sought a special touch from God:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"'Either You come down here and touch me, or I will come up there and touch 
  You,' he prayed in desperation" (<CITE>The Touch of God</CITE>, p. 
73).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The arrogance to demand anything from God reveals and attitude of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/self-est/">self-love</A>. 
This is common among charismatics who place more stock in alleged signs and 
wonders than they do in God's written Word. This is reflected in Howard-Browne's 
demand that if God didn't do something for him he would ascend into heaven and 
touch God. Sound familiar?<BR><BR>Few believe Howard-Browne believed he could 
actually ascend into heaven and touch God, even at 18-years-of-age. He was 
merely challenging God with extreme language. Yet even this is effrontery 
against the holiness of our mighty, sovereign God. Such an attitude may well 
prompt God to send something -- but it won't be something a true believer would 
want. And while we may all on occasion be guilty of challenging God, it isn't 
something we should broadcast as an acceptable practice.<BR><BR>Because men do 
not love the truth (God's Word) -- because they use unbiblical means to approach 
Him -- He will send a strong delusion so that they would believe a lie (2 Thes. 
2:11). By every test based on God's Word, holy laughter is outwardly a blessing 
to those who follow after the flesh -- but it is a strong 
delusion.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>INTIMIDATION</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>Not only do 
the major proponents of holy laughter tell us not to use our minds -- not to 
bother testing these things -- some denigrate those who do not readily fall 
under their spell. Howard-Browne calls those who do not enter into this move 
"ugly," "sad," and other choice words that do not reflect the humility and kind 
spirit of a true minister of God. This is intimidation at the basic level. While 
everyone around you is losing their minds, you feel out of place -- conspicuous, 
unholy, unrighteous, guilty -- because you don't feel the bubbling up of holy 
laughter.<BR><BR>Claims of his wide-eyed fans to the contrary, Howard-Browne 
does intimidate verbally. On several occasions he would "slay people in the 
Spirit," and if they didn't begin to laugh he would place his foot on their 
stomach and tell them to laugh. Some he would kick as they lay there, and accuse 
them of not yielding to the Holy Spirit. He would keep at it until they would 
obviously begin to force some kind of laugh out of themselves.<BR><BR>Since 
Rodney Howard-Browne is the catalyst for the holy laughter phenomenon's 
popularity today (most purveyors tracing their "anointing" either directly or 
indirectly to him), it would be expedient to concentrate on his methodology. 
From the root springs the tree. Rodney Howard-Browne is the root of the holy 
laughter movement.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>HOWARD-BROWNE'S 
TEACHINGS</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>Howard-Browne's primary focus in his book, 
<CITE>The Touch of God</CITE>, as well as in his preaching, is on the anointing 
of God -- what the anointing is, the responsibilities that come with it, as well 
as the dangers and pitfalls. His call is for holiness of life and seeking after 
God with all one's heart.<BR><BR>On the subject of God's anointing, 
Howard-Browne states that the anointing is not a formula but a relationship with 
Jesus. The problem, Howard-Browne says, is that the early church had the 
substance and the modern church has the formula. God's power, he says, should be 
tangible and evident in our lives. This, one must agree, is a problem in today's 
churches. For the most part, either they are chasing after signs and wonders for 
their own sake, or they are chasing after human potential schemes (such as <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/codep/">12-step 
programs</A> and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/temper.htm">four 
temperament personality testing</A>) for spiritual giftedness. This is all 
confusion.<BR><BR>Howard-Browne takes a dim view of the extreme deliverance 
methods that incorporate railing against the devil rather than prayer. He likens 
it to a spiritual Nintendo game, accusing many of living in a fantasy world of 
spiritual warfare. One statement alludes to <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/peretti/">spiritual warfare 
novels</A> that have set the tone for their readers' prayer 
lives.<BR><BR>Interestingly, Howard-Browne has many indicting things to say 
about certain self-proclaimed prophets and apostles. He calls them "charismatic 
gurus," who always give vague prophecies, or apostles who want to rule over 
others no matter how few. His solution is to be led by the Spirit of God -- to 
be like Jesus who said that He could do nothing except what He saw the Father 
do.<BR><BR>In this process of teaching some valid truths, Howard-Browne reveals 
inside knowledge of how some alleged men of God operate. Without offering names, 
he lets us know that things are not always as they seem on the 
outside.<BR><BR>He states that some ministers actually buy large crusades in 
third-world countries, offering one dollar per head, because it looks good on 
television (and in their full-color brochures). It can move people in affluent 
countries to contribute to their cause if they can offer visual evidence that 
they can assemble a quarter of a million people to hear them preach. $250,000 
invested can result in millions in return. This is quite a 
revelation.<BR><BR>Howard-Browne has harsh words for mail-order ministries that 
send trinkets in the mail promising God's anointing for those who use them as a 
point of contact. This is interesting in view of Oral Robert's fund-raising 
methods and the fact that Howard-Browne unashamedly states that Roberts laid 
hands on him. The point-of-contact and "seed faith" methods are Oral Roberts 
traditions.<BR><BR>It's in the area of accountability that one must disagree 
with Howard-Browne -- particularly when it comes to exposing those who teach 
error. He believes that it is wrong to criticize anyone who claims to be a man 
of God. He has harsh words for those who call these men to accountability:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"It's amazing how it's always the ones who are doing nothing for God who 
  know how it should be done. There are ministries that start off exposing the 
  cults but then turn on the Body of Christ like cannibals. They build their 
  ministries off the fallings of God's servants" (<CITE>The Touch of God</CITE>, 
  p. 107).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The important thing in exposing error is to not judge the motives of those 
teaching error. But we must, in a spirit of humility -- yet with all boldness -- 
deal with the issues <CITE>they</CITE> bring up. In doing so, it is necessary to 
exercise the one gift of the Spirit few in the churches care to concern 
themselves with today: the gift of discernment.<BR><BR>Discernment is more often 
recognizing error based upon knowledge and understanding of God's Word. It is 
not merely some mystical sensory perception of demonic spirits. In any case, 
one's discernment must be based upon rightly dividing the Word of Truth. God's 
Word is still the bottom line for judging all beliefs and 
practices.<BR><BR>Amazingly, Howard-Browne is full of criticism of others who 
take advantage of the Body of Christ. He just doesn't name them. But he must 
have them in mind when he writes about them. So what's the difference? Is he not 
judging them in his heart? His indictment is that they have no 
integrity.<BR><BR>While Howard-Browne laments the lack of integrity in the 
ministry, he can be found sharing the platform with such men. How can a true man 
of God share the platform with a teacher who insists that we should think of 
ourselves as equal to God, and teaches that it wasn't Jesus' death on the cross 
that saves us, but his suffering in hell [<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/copeland/">Kenneth 
Copeland</A>]. This is a denial of the blood of Christ. It lacks integrity not 
in the realm of money, but in the realm of Biblical truth.<BR><BR>How can a true 
man of God share the platform with men who pronounce curses upon people that 
don't give financially to their cause, telling them God will abandon them; they 
will suffer divorce; they will suffer financial hardship. Yet that is the 
message of the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/w-f.htm">word-faith</A> 
people with whom Howard-Browne associates.<BR><BR>How can a true man of God have 
hands laid on him by someone who consistently says that the Lord told him to do 
something and it will be blessed, when time after time it doesn't come to pass 
and God's blessing is not evident. In the process, millions of dollars of the 
faithful are squandered on the promise of God's faithfulness.<BR><BR>He goes 
against his own words. Howard-Browne insists that men of God must have 
integrity. He claims, "I don't do anything in my meetings other than allow the 
Holy Spirit to come and have free reign." Yet this will also be proven false as 
we observe how he conducts his meetings.<BR><BR>Even if one were to suspend 
judgment on whether or not God wants to fill us with joy in the manner that the 
holy laughter teachers say, how is that joy being manifested in the 
meetings?<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>A HOWARD-BROWNE SERVICE</STRONG></CITE> 
<BR><BR>The following is a description taken from a video tape of a meeting held 
at Carpenter's Home Church and aired on TBN. Rodney Howard-Browne begins by 
exhorting the audience not to accept just anything that comes along in the name 
of the Lord. He ridicules those who have fallen into ritualistic formalism, and 
gives examples of people operating in the flesh.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Whatever is done as mere symbolism and out of mere ritual and tradition is 
  nothing more than a religious noose that's going to choke you and rob you of 
  the joy of serving Jesus."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>He cautions people about laying hands on others if they don't have the 
anointing, and about having hands laid on them by those who don't have the 
anointing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"I encourage people to lay hands on. But some churches go overboard and 
  just have it as a free-for-all, and you've got empty hands being laid on empty 
  heads, and that's why -- you can't just call any donkey out that's not 
  anointed of God to come and put his hand on somebody's head to encourage that 
  person. If they've got no anointing, they've got no business putting their 
  hands on somebody's head."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>He continues that there's no reason to have empty hands laid on you because 
you're not going to get anything. Then he goes on to say that whenever he has 
had hands laid on him, he didn't care who the person was; he just expected God 
to do something and he's never been disappointed.<BR><BR>Well, which is it? Can 
expectancy on the part of a recipient force God's hand to move through the hands 
of one who is not anointed? Where is chapter and verse for this? And why would 
he not take his own advice? This is just one example of the illogical mentality 
behind much of the charismatic fervor today.<BR><BR>When it comes to 
free-for-all laying on of hands, that's just what the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/vine/">Vineyard 
churches</A> practice. Everybody is encouraged to lay hands on the person next 
to them. Yet Howard-Browne endorses the Vineyard movement while ridiculing the 
very thing they practice. Again, which is it? He also ridicules those who 
advertise their school of the prophets. He rightly states that one cannot go to 
school to learn to be a prophet.<BR><BR>Overall, there wasn't much to find fault 
with in his preaching time, although, again, Scripture was seldom cited. It was 
more of a time for establishing that he could be trusted because he tore down 
the false assumptions of other unnamed teachers.<BR><BR>During this time, a few 
hoots and laughs can be heard emanating from the audience, but there is still 
relative order. After preaching, Howard-Browne calls a pastor forward who, the 
night before, had said he was ready to check himself into a mental clinic. 
Promising a double dose of the Holy Spirit this night, Howard-Browne lays his 
hand on the man, who promptly falls to the floor.<BR><BR>Howard-Browne then puts 
one foot on the man's stomach and pronounces that he will go forth forever 
changed. This sets the stage for working his audience into laughter, and 
disproves the claims that he does not provoke laughing responses:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Someone said, 'Why'd you put your foot on him?' Because I didn't feel like 
  bending down and putting my hand on him."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The audience erupts in laughter; from this point on things begin to roll. He 
then does similarly with the man's wife. Having fallen, she prays somewhat 
quietly. Howard-Browne tells her not to pray. He exhorts her with the words, 
"Joy! joy! joy!"<BR><BR>One person after another is called out to receive his 
anointing. Those who do not laugh, he prompts to do so. Most take quite a bit of 
prompting. One man lies there, also praying quietly. This is how Howard-Browne 
addresses him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Stop praying now and let the joy bubble out your belly. Joy. Joy. Joy. 
  Don't pray! Laugh!"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The audience laughs all the more as he goes from person to person prodding 
them to laugh. If it seems to be belaboring the point it's to demonstrate that, 
contrary to claims that holy laughter is spontaneous and uncontrollable, it is 
more often induced through coercion. Going back to a man he had kicked in the 
foot, Howard-Browne chides him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Why didn't you listen to the preacher? Why didn't you listen to the 
  preacher? I said laugh!"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The man is coerced. He erupts into an obviously strained attempt to laugh 
under this intimidation. So much for the claims that the laughter is 
uncontrollable and spontaneous.<BR><BR>Then comes Howard-Browne's ridicule of 
those who do not wish to enter into his laugh parade. Making a dour face he 
continues:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Some people say, 'I don't want that joy brother Rodney. [His face becomes 
  even more dour.] I'm happy just like I am. My great grandfather was sad. My 
  grandfather was sad. And when he died -- just before he died -- he looked at 
  me and said, 'Son, will you carry on the family tradition?' And I said, 'Yes, 
  dad.'"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hoots and hollering erupt from the audience as they join in laughing to 
derision those who don't enter in.<BR><BR>After some more banter calling people 
"ugly things" who aren't open to the Holy Spirit (read "open to falling down and 
laughing"), Howard-Browne slaps on the side of the head a man sitting on the 
front pew. The man falls over onto the pew, shaking his legs and hands in the 
air. The audience continues to roll with laughter.<BR><BR>Another man comes 
forward, goes down under Howard-Browne's touch and begins to pray. Says 
Howard-Browne:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Get out of the praying mode and get into the rejoicing mode! Pray when you 
  go home! Lord, have mercy! I mean, if their prayers had been working they 
  wouldn't have had to come up here in the first place."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>He begins a dissertation on the laying on of hands, pointing out that you can 
bless people by laying on of hands, you can heal them, and you can pass on the 
anointing and people fall over. He begins to quote Peter in Acts 2: "These are 
not drunk as you suppose ..." He lays his hand on a lady in the front pew, 
causing her to shriek repeatedly, shaking her hands as if she had palsy. He 
points out that she is a pastor's wife. In fact, most of the front-row pews are 
filled with pastors and their wives.<BR><BR>As he repeats, "These are not drunk 
as you suppose," "the drunkard" begins his routine. While sitting in his pew, a 
man throws his head back and laughs heartily, kicking one leg up in the air. 
Suddenly, he bolts from his seat and does a locomotive-action shuffle in a tight 
circle. Then he faces Howard-Browne, kicks one leg out in front and does a 
pratfall. Another man jumps out of his seat, does the same sort of locomotion 
shuffle, arms flailing wildly, and falls on the floor. Shortly afterward, the 
first man gets up and staggers around with a mock drunken smile on his face, 
salutes Howard-Browne, and plops down in the pew again. It is obviously 
<CITE>contrived</CITE>, but Howard-Browne and the audience eat it 
up.<BR><BR>Things continue in the same vein for the rest of the 
evening.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>DRUNK IN THE SPIRITS</STRONG></CITE> 
<BR><BR>Rodney Howard-Browne likes to call himself a "Holy Ghost bartender" who 
dispenses the "new wine" of charismatic fervor. In an earlier meeting than the 
one described above, he teaches that, if there is drunkenness in the physical 
realm, there must be drunkenness in the spiritual realm, also. To prove this 
illogical assumption, he quotes Acts 2 to suggest that the disciples at 
Pentecost were acting like drunkards.<BR><BR>Suddenly, a man from the second row 
stands up. He's wearing slacks and a sport coat opened to reveal suspenders, 
throws his head back, and in stereotypical pantomime of a comedic drunk (a la 
Foster Brooks or Jackie Gleason), adopts a smirk. Peering down his nose, he 
looks with half-closed eyes at the audience as he sways back and forth. He then 
plops himself in his pew and nods as if he's drunk, smiling at Howard-Browne, 
who enjoys it tremendously. Loud guffaws abound.<BR><BR>Cannot Howard-Browne 
discern that this man is merely seeking attention -- that he is not truly "drunk 
in the Spirit," as Howard-Browne claims? And what is being "drunk in the 
Spirit"? Scripture makes no mention of this. The proponents of holy laughter 
cite Acts 2 to suggest that acting drunk by the Holy Spirit is valid. But does 
Acts 2 really imply that such a thing is of God?<BR><BR>Versus 1-12 clearly 
teach that the disciples came forth from the upper room under the anointing of 
the Holy Spirit, and began to preach the <CITE>Gospel</CITE> in the languages of 
those present from various nations. Although the hearers discerned their own 
language, they also heard all the other languages being spoken at the same time. 
The mockers (verse 13) did not listen to the message, but heard what seemed to 
them like a lot of babbling. Thus, they accused the disciples of being 
drunk.<BR><BR>Verses 14-34 record Peter's dissertation to the crowd, exhorting 
them to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and to repent of their sins. Verses 
35-47 record the results of that plea.<BR><BR>While the disciples were accused 
of being drunk, they were not staggering about in the manner characteristic of 
those "intoxicated" by holy laughter; they were accused of being drunk because, 
while some heard their own languages, they also heard other languages. Nor did 
all the people accuse them, but only the mockers. It was a phenomenon they did 
not understand, and to them it seemed for the most part like babbling. Peter set 
them straight and many of them repented of their sins and were born again by the 
Spirit of God.<BR><BR>Furthermore, Acts 3 and 4 record that the disciples' 
activities after Pentecost resulted in persecution by the religious 
establishment. Today's religious establishment isn't beating up on the holy 
laughter people -- it is embracing them. In no way can Acts 2 be constructed to 
mean that the disciples were acting like drunkards -- certainly not like the 
stereotypical comedic drunkard at the Howard-Browne meeting. Nor can it or 
Ephesians 5:18 be construed to mean that the Holy Spirit would cause us to lose 
our sensibilities.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>MISAPPLYING SCRIPTURE</STRONG></CITE> 
<BR><BR>The misapplication of Scripture by the holy laughter people is not 
limited to Acts 2. In listening to Howard-Browne and others, there is hardly a 
Scripture citation that isn't twisted to mean what they want it mean in order to 
validate their peculiar experience. This, if nothing else, should be ample 
warning for caution if not down-right rejection of these experiences.<BR><BR>As 
with Acts 2, the holy laughter people like to quote Ephesians 5:18 to prove 
their claim that being filled with the Holy Spirit may result in one acting like 
a drunkard. This misapplication is evident to anyone who takes the time to read 
Ephesians 5:18 in context. The meaning of being filled with the Spirit within 
the context of the body is demonstrated in verses 19-21. These activities do not 
reflect a mindless stupor; rather they reflect a holy attitude of worship and 
edification. <BR><BR>What is taking place in these Howard-Browne meetings is 
pure exhibitionism played out for a group of spiritual voyeurs. One could liken 
it to spiritual pornography; it titillates in an ungodly manner. People who go 
for it can't get enough. Eventually their hunger grows for more bizarre 
stuff.<BR><BR>It wasn't enough to believe that they spoke in tongues; now they 
have to bark like dogs in the Spirit, roar like lions in the Spirit, cackle like 
chickens in the Spirit, and stagger like drunks in the Spirit. What will be the 
next "move of the Spirit?"<BR><BR>This exhibitionism may also be classified as 
pure experientialism -- a group therapy session engaging laughter as a catharsis 
in place of the primal scream. Does it work? Outwardly, yes. People feel better. 
They feel happier. Anyone who's had a good laugh feels better afterward. As one 
man at the meeting said, as he lay on the floor laughing, "Laughing doeth good 
like a medicine." (This was a misquote of Proverbs 17:22.)<BR><BR>There is a 
difference between a merry heart and laughter. Laughter can be good or bad, 
depending upon the circumstances. A merry heart reflects the joy of the Lord in 
all circumstances that are appropriate. Just as there are proper times to laugh, 
there are proper times to weep (Eccl. 3:1-4).What transpires at these meetings 
is not proper laughter. It is coerced in the name of the Holy Spirit. 
<BR><BR>Scripture warns against improper laughter (see Eccl. 7:3-4; 6) Proper 
laughter and rejoicing in the Lord is certainly acceptable to the believer in 
Christ. But laughing to derision those who do not agree with you; coercing 
people to laugh; claiming an anointing from the Holy Spirit on such laughter -- 
this is sin. It is evidence that one is in the house of 
fools.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>PREDISPOSITION</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>In spite of 
the obvious coercion involved, we are told that this laughter is 
"uncontrollable" and "spontaneous." It is true that Howard-Browne rarely cracks 
a smile. Yes, he holds a straight face. He rarely tells jokes -- if we're 
talking about jokes that include a setup, a plot, and a punch line. But he does 
utilize witticisms in his preaching, designed to invoke laughter. This, often at 
the expense of those who do not enter into the "flow" of what he's doing. A good 
actor can easily keep a straight face while going through a comedy routine. 
<BR><BR>And in spite of glowing reports of masses falling down in fits of 
uncontrollable laughter, many faces can be seen with no merriment on them, or 
with mere smiles. The scenario we've described hardly suggests that much of the 
laughter is uncontrollable when Howard-Browne has to prompt one after another to 
"let the joy bubble out your belly."<BR><BR>A clue as to why so many fall under 
the spell may be found in this statement from one of the <CITE>Charisma</CITE> 
reports on Howard-Browne:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"But his appeal is evident. It lies in his utter lack of slick evangelism. 
  His simple style and genuine desire to unleash spiritual revival in America 
  have caught the attention of charismatics who are eager to see signs and

<P>It becomes obvious that many of the people who attend these meetings are 
predisposed to laugh. They already know the reputation of the holy laughter 
preacher and that's what they're seeking when they arrive. They are "eager to 
see signs and wonders." They have come from miles around and they are not going 
to be disappointed.<BR><BR>Yet not all the laughter is contrived. Some of it is 
very genuine. People do laugh at others who laugh. Laughter is contagious. If 
someone begins to laugh uncontrollably in our presence, our natural tendency is 
to laugh also.<BR><BR>In view of Howard-Browne's methods of inducing laughter, 
it's obvious that much of the laughter is not from contagion but from coercion; 
it is contrived. If such an obvious contrivance is lost upon Howard-Browne, who 
is supposed to be ministering this thing, how are others to know what is of God 
and what is of the flesh? If it is acceptable to Howard-Browne or other 
proponents of holy laughter, even when it is obviously of the flesh, should we 
not at least be suspicious of these proponents' motives? If not of their 
motives, certainly their discernment. In either case, their credibility as 
ministers of the true spiritual gifts is in question. If they are operating with 
wrong motives or if they are unable to discern the flesh at work, they are 
unqualified to lead God's people.<BR><BR>Their followers may leave feeling 
better about themselves; they may even have experienced a change in their 
attitude toward God, or toward their mate, or toward their enemies. But, again, 
one cannot confuse God's grace in using error with the validation of the 
error.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>SHOW TIME!</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>Much of the holy 
laughter delusion smacks of show biz. It's played out like a circus act with the 
lead characters vying for starring roles. Even the language used to record 
Howard-Browne's rise to fame reveals a show business mentality:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Howard-Browne's reputation grew during the next four years, and he 
  established the Rodney Howard-Browne Evangelistic Association in Louisville, 
  Kentucky. In the spring of 1993 his big break came when Assemblies of God 
  pastor Karl Strader invited him to preach in Lakeland, Florida, at Carpenter's 
  Home Church" (Julia Duin, "Praise the Lord and pass the New Wine," 8/94, 
  <I>Charisma</I>, p.23).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>His "big break"? This suggests that the ministry is for the benefit of the 
minister. God's servants don't get "big breaks." They get big trouble! Their 
reputations are not enhanced unless they are tickling people's ears. The vast 
majority of those who follow after signs and wonders are not disposed to hear 
the hard Word of God. They want feel-good religion. And that's what they get 
with the holy laughter teaching, as attested to by this statement in 
<CITE>Charisma</CITE>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The difference was the laughter. No matter what Howard-Browne did or said, 
  hundreds who attended the daily sessions always ended up on the sanctuary 
  floor in helpless laughter. When the services were broadcast on radio, more 
  curious seekers showed up to join the fun" (Julia Duin, "Praise the Lord and 
  pass the New Wine," 8/94, <I>Charisma</I>, p.24).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"Curious seekers?" "Fun?" Since when does our holy God play to the benefit of 
curiosity seekers' amusement? Since when has the holy Faith been turned into an 
occasion for "fun?" Jesus was a man of sorrows. He sorrowed over the sins of the 
world. He would sorrow over "curious seekers" today; He would sorrow over the 
spectacle that has been made of His Church to the derision of those 
outside.<BR><BR>There are those in the Body of Christ who are sorrowing over 
these things. While so many who hear of this experience called holy laughter 
flock to receive gratification of their flesh, there is a small number who are 
genuinely sorrowing over those people's captivity to this latest fad. They have 
fallen prey to a delusion that causes them to think that, because they fall down 
and laugh, they have gotten a dose of holiness.<BR><BR>There is seldom any true 
teaching from God's Word in these meetings. And when there is, it is interrupted 
by laughter. It makes God's Word of no effect. As a writer for 
<CITE>Charisma</CITE> says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"No one doubts that having vast numbers of listeners convulsed in laughter 
  can make whatever is being said from the pulpit irrelevant" (Julia Duin, 
  "Praise the Lord and pass the New Wine," 8/94, <I>Charisma</I>, 
p.24).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What an indictment from one who lauds this side show! "Irrelevant" is an apt 
word to demonstrate how God's Word has little place among the holy laughter 
crowd. But since when did God ordain that His Word should ever become 
irrelevant? In essence, it is making the Word of no effect, which is what Jesus 
accused the religious leaders of doing through their tradition and other such 
things (Mk. 7:13).<BR><BR>Interruptions of God's Word, even if taught by false 
teachers, is not a sign of the Holy Spirit at work. At worst, it is a sign of 
demonic spirits at work. At best, it is a sign of irreverence on the part of 
those who do the interrupting. Rather than accept such interruptions as a sign 
from God, a true minister of the Word would rebuke those who would do such a 
thing. A true disciple of the Lord Jesus would continue in His Word (Jn. 
8:31-32).<BR><BR>The truth -- God's Word -- is what makes us free, not 
experiences (especially extra-Biblical experiences like holy laughter as claimed 
by its proponents). In fact, the holy laughter proponents demonstrate a rather 
low view of Scripture.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>A LOW VIEW OF 
SCRIPTURE</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>Hugh E. "Bud" Williams, rector of an Episcopal 
church in Lakeland, Florida, received the "anointing" from Howard-Browne in a 
meeting held at Carpenter's Home Church:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"... After two meetings he was not impressed; during the third, 
  Howard-Browne called him and three others out into the aisle and simply said, 
  'Be filled!' 'Boom! Down I went in the Spirit,' Williams says, 'and I started 
  laughing, I laughed so hard for 20 minutes, my throat was sore the next day. 
  I've been charismatic for 14 years, but I had dried out and grown tired. This 
  refreshed me personally and changed my marriage.' So why would God use 
  laughter to bring spiritual renewal? Williams says many people today need more 
  than words -- they need a demonstration of God's power. 'Words have become 
  meaningless in our society,' he says. 'Signs and wonders are what must 
  recapture our attention'" (Julia Duin, "Praise the Lord and pass the New 
  Wine," 8/94, <I>Charisma</I>, p.28).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Does faith come from signs and wonders? Not according to God's Word (Rom. 
10:17). Man's words may be meaningless, but God's Word is never meaningless. Was 
Williams speaking about man's words or God's Word? If man's words, we must agree 
with him. But then why extol experience over man's words? Why not extol 
Scripture instead? It seems apparent that he was speaking of Scripture as mere 
"words."<BR><BR>Scripture records that those who seek signs from God are not 
content with His Word. Multitudes flocked to Jesus for miracles, and in spite of 
his demonstrations of God's power, they crucified Him when His words became too 
difficult for them to hear (Mt. 12:39).<BR><BR>The Good News of the resurrection 
should be sufficient to minister joy to the hearts of those truly surrendered to 
God. But just as the resurrection did not satisfy the Jews of Jesus' day, it 
doesn't satisfy many professing Christians today. To get joy (read "fun"), they 
must turn to extra-Biblical 
activities.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>BRAINWASHING</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>Those who 
know anything about brainwashing techniques and the ability to induce altered 
states of consciousness in mass meetings will recognize that, often, these 
techniques are utilized in hyper-charismatic services.<BR><BR>Dick Sutphen, a 
professional <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/hypno.htm">hypnotist</A>, 
conducts seminars on persuasion and brainwashing techniques. His purpose is not 
to teach his listeners how to subvert other's minds, but to educate on how 
government, the military, cults, and religious groups utilize certain techniques 
to induce control and gain converts to their particular causes.<BR><BR>He points 
out that many who use these techniques are not necessarily aware that they are 
using them. They may well have learned them from watching others use them 
successfully. In any case, the bottom line is control; the intent may be 
perfectly altruistic, it may be beneficial in the mind of the controller. But 
the fact remains that people are being controlled, often with the belief that 
the Holy Spirit is doing a work in them.<BR><BR>Sutphen is not a believer in 
Christ. In fact, he is anti-Christ and a New Ager. But his logic and knowledge 
cannot be argued with. This is because he is not addressing the Faith or holy 
laughter; he is addressing a subject that he knows: brainwashing.<BR><BR>Sutphen 
believe that religion is valid, but that manipulation in the name of God is 
not:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"So, to begin, I want to state the most basic of all facts about 
  brainwashing: IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF MAN, NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED 
  AND REALIZED, OR BELIEVED, THAT HE HAD BEEN BRAINWASHED. Those who have been 
  brainwashed will usually passionately defend their manipulators, claiming they 
  have simply been 'shown the light,' or have been transformed in miraculous 
  ways" (Sutphen undated transcript, 'The Battle for Your Mind: Persuasion and 
  Brainwashing Techniques Being Used on the Public Today," p. 1). (Emphasis 
  Sutphen's.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sutphen gives an example of how manipulators set their marks up. The first 
step is to give information that the listeners will agree with. This gets them 
in the frame of mind to trust the speaker. Once trust has been instilled, they 
are open to suggestion:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"... Assume for a moment that you are watching a politician give a speech. 
  First, he might generate what is called a 'YES SET.' These are statements that 
  will cause listeners to agree; they might even unknowingly nod their heads in 
  agreement. Next come the TRUISMS. These are usually facts that could be 
  debated but, once the politician has his audience agree, the odds are in the 
  politician's favor that the audience wont stop to think for themselves, thus 
  continuing to agree. Last comes the SUGGESTION. This is what the politician 
  wants you to do and, since you have been agreeing all along, you could be 
  persuaded to accept the suggestion" (Sutphen, p. 10). (Emphasis 
Sutphen's.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In the same manner, false teachers will preach from God's Word, sharing 
obvious truths. That's phase one -- the "yes set." As well they will share what 
may be considered deep insights -- ideas that are debatable but not necessarily 
untrue. These are the "truisms." Then comes the suggestion. It is generally 
toward the end of the evening -- sometimes after two or three hours or more -- 
that the false teaching or inducement toward activity will be implemented. This 
is exactly what one witnesses in the holy laughter movement, not to mention the 
charismatic movement (particularly the word-faith movement) in 
general.<BR><BR>Sutphen points out that different entities may use different 
techniques -- the military may use some techniques that the government, dealing 
with civilians, may not use. Religionists and cultists will use still other 
techniques. Most techniques involve taking the subjects through stages or phases 
of conversion. Says Sutphen:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"With the progression through each phase, the degree of conversion becomes 
  more effective and complete. The ways to achieve conversion are many and 
  varied, but the usual first step in religious or political brainwashing is to 
  work on the emotions of an individual or group until they reach an abnormal 
  level of anger, fear, excitement, or nervous tension. The progressive result 
  of this mental condition is to impair judgment and increase suggestibility. 
  The more this condition can be maintained or intensified, the more it 
  compounds. Once catharsis, or the first brain phase, is reached, the complete 
  mental takeover becomes easier. Existing mental programming can be replaced 
  with new patterns of thinking and behavior" (Sutphen, p. 3).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Most people who attend the hyper-charismatic meetings that result in 
pandemonium and out-of-order behavior are normal, everyday folks. They may be 
professional people and hold responsible jobs. Many are normally "dignified" or 
"reserved." But they come with a sense of expectancy to receive something from 
the touch of the preacher -- something they are inclined to believe they can't 
receive from God on their own. They believe that God has placed a special 
anointing on the preacher, probably because they have been induced with a 
clergy-laity mentality that is the norm for most churches. Because they are so 
normal -- even possessing a reserved personality -- they can't believe that they 
can be brainwashed or manipulated. But the manner in which excitement and fervor 
builds in some meetings catches them off guard. They are susceptible to 
suggestion -- even the suggestion that they have been healed. To not be healed 
often generates feelings of guilt, an emotion that is easily exploited by the 
preacher. About alleged spiritual healing, Sutphen states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"For some, the healing may be permanent. For many, it will last four days 
  to a week, which is, incidentally, how long a hypnotic suggestion given to a 
  somnambulistic subject will usually last. Even if the healing doesn't last, if 
  they come back every week, the power of suggestion may continually override 
  the problem -- or sometimes, sadly, it can mask a physical problem which could 
  prove to be very detrimental to the individual in the long run. I'm not saying 
  that legitimate healings do not take place. They do. Maybe the individual was 
  ready to let go of the negativity that caused the problem in the first place; 
  maybe it was the work of God. Yet I contend that it can be explained with 
  existing knowledge of brain/mind function" (Sutphen, pp. 4-5).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sorry to say, Sutphen is correct in his assessment. New Agers testify of 
healings by laying on of hands, too. And the scenarios are all to common among 
those who claim to have healing ministries in the Church: Short-term healings; 
people neglecting proper health care because they believe they've been healed 
when they haven't been; even death from diseases whose symptoms disappeared. The 
preacher will tell those whose healings didn't last that it was because they 
"let go" of the healing. They didn't have enough faith to maintain 
it.<BR><BR>The difference between God's work and the work of the flesh is that 
God's work will always be validated by His written Word. And God doesn't play 
games with us. If He heals us by His sovereign will, we will be healed, 
period.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>TOWARD THE NEW AGE?</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>What we 
are witnessing in new evangelicalism and the charismatic movement is a 
subjective approach to God's Word. If something seems to work, it is accepted 
even if it cannot be validated by Scripture. Since it cannot be validated, it is 
assumed to be a new work of God. Those who reject it on the basis of its 
unbiblical or extra-Biblical character are regarded as faithless when, in fact, 
they are faithless toward the subjective religious philosophy of the "new thing" 
-- not toward God.<BR><BR>This subjectivity is necessary if Satan is going to 
meld humanity into a one-world religion. As the masses open themselves up to 
beliefs and practices that are not validated by Scripture, they leave themselves 
open to deception of the highest order, often presented in the name of 
Jesus.<BR><BR>The first step toward melding Christians into the New Age religion 
is not dissimilar to brianwashing techniques. The "yes set" is to get us to 
agree that all denominations share a common belief system. This is the 
motivating force behind the ecumenical movement sponsored by the Vatican and the 
major players in <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/neoe.htm">new 
evangelicalism</A> and the charismatic movement.<BR><BR>The "truisms" will be 
that we also share common beliefs and values with aberrant Christian cults and 
monotheistic religions such as cabalistic Judaism and Islam.<BR><BR>The 
"suggestion" will be that we have a common spiritual bond with all of mankind. 
This suggestion will be implemented through the observation of signs and wonders 
construed to be of God. And if God can honor the faith of non-Christians, who 
are we to dissent from unity with them? <BR><BR>Anyone who thinks he is above 
falling into this snare is hopelessly naive. In fact, he is an excellent 
candidate for deception.<BR><BR>It is not merely coincidental that holy laughter 
has found its place among the mystically inclined whose beliefs lean toward <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/newage.htm">New Age 
philosophy</A>. Leanne Payne, a disciple of inner healing guru, the late Agnes 
Sanford, has also indulged in holy laughter. (Her experience is recorded in <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/mains">Karen Mains's</A> book 
<CITE>Lonely No More</CITE>.) Payne blends New Age mysticism, <A 
href="http://www.psychoheresy-aware.org/jungleg.html">Jungian psychology</A>, 
and Christian philosophy. Her ministry team is headed primarily by women who 
share this integrationist methodology. To Payne, all sin is linked to lack of 
self-acceptance and failure to recognize God's affirmation of oneself. Of 
course, this is a simple explanation of her more involved theology.<BR><BR>Is it 
merely coincidental that her disciple, Karen Mains, wrote of this holy laughter 
experience in 1993, essentially the same time Rodney Howard-Browne's notoriety 
and the Toronto blessing began? And is it merely coincidental that a phenomenon 
similar to holy laughter is found in the New Age movement is exactly at the same 
time?<BR><BR>Barbara Marx Hubbard is the founder of the Foundation for Conscious 
Evolution, and a leader at the frontier of social and spiritual change for the 
New Age. At the same time holy laughter began to ripple through the churches, 
she wrote as one channeling the thoughts of God. The instruction given was to 
expect planetary transformation and a quantum leap in evolutionary personal 
transformation through uncontrollable joy. This uncontrollable joy of which 
Hubbard speaks will transcend all barriers to unity. False signs and wonders 
will likewise break down those barriers to unity (Mk. 13:22).<BR><BR>We can 
expect the holy laughter people to defend their practices as being of God, while 
these other practices are counterfeits. But holy laughter as we know it today 
came lately. All attempts to link it to Scripture or early revival history are 
without merit. Its real precedent is coincidental to New Age philosophy. Does 
God mimic something Satan originates? Or is He taken off guard by Satan? I think 
not. Else He would be guilty of causing confusion among His people. And God is 
not the author of confusion. (1 Cor. 14:33). <BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>REORDERED 
THINKING</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>What is transpiring in the Church is similar to 
what is transpiring in the world. In conditioning men's minds to accept a 
globalist mentality, the New Age change agents call for unity in diversity with 
no judgment -- no concern for what others believe or practice. If it doesn't fit 
for us, well, we just have a different truth. Let's just focus on our common 
objectives.<BR><BR>But we're not dealing with one human philosophy vs. another 
human philosophy. We're dealing with all of man's philosophies vs. God's Word. 
The world's rules don't apply here. This worldly assessment of truth is behind 
criticism of those who expose error in the Body of Christ; just because we don't 
understand it, we shouldn't be critical of it; it doesn't matter if it cannot be 
supported by Scripture; God may be doing a new thing we don't understand; we 
just don't have the same truth that the popular preacher has.<BR><BR>This can be 
intimidating to those who don't know Scripture. But those who do know Scripture 
have a responsibility to expose those who are in error. And it doesn't matter if 
they are 99.99% correct in their teachings. If the .01% error is sufficient to 
lead someone astray, it must be challenged.<BR><BR>To demonstrate how the 
professing church's thinking is parallel to the world's thinking in subjective 
terms, we might look at the current government education system and how it 
breaks down objective values in order to substitute new, subjective values. This 
is done in order to create a globalist population that is easily controlled. If 
someone doesn't have an absolute set of values, he can be exploited for the 
benefit of the hierarchy, whether political or religious.<BR><BR>The breakdown 
in absolutes is accomplished through the reordering of thinking skills. Modern 
education relies heavily on Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy which places knowledge of 
facts and comprehension on the bottom of the order in thinking 
skills.<BR><BR>Bloom is considered by the education elite to be the foremost 
expert on change agent strategy. The object of Bloom's reordering of thinking 
skills is to replace the Biblical model for thinking objectively with a new 
model rooted in subjective intuitive thought. This is the basis of 
witchcraft.The following demonstrates that objective understanding is considered 
to be lower on the scale than subjective and intuitive reasoning:</P>

<P><A href="http://www.crossroad.to/text/articles.html">Berit Kjos</A>, an 
expert on the education system and New Age philosophy, points out that one of 
the methods for bringing in the new global values is the removal of facts -- the 
removal of logical thinking -- so that people can't argue back from a basis of 
understanding. They will not have an objective framework from which to draw 
conclusions. Therefore, the education system is free to bring in all kinds of 
models for the new global spirituality from earth-centered cultures around the 
world. Those cultures are basically pantheistic and polytheistic. What we are 
seeing is a rise in animistic religions because the Biblical ethic and value 
system has been not only discarded, but forbidden to be discussed.<BR><BR>Is 
this not similar to what is happening in the churches today? Attempts to hold 
teachers accountable to God's Word are met with derision, even by those who 
insist that they believe that God's Word must form the basis for judging all 
things. We learn quickly that their exhortation to Biblical integrity is merely 
a ploy to disarm their critics and deceive their listeners. God's Word is 
valued, yes; but it is placed on the lower order of thinking skills. What is 
more important is intuitive "Holy Spirit" power.<BR><BR>Bloom's "higher order" 
thinking skills do have value; but they have no genuine value unless they are 
held accountable to the objective truths and facts that reside in knowledge and 
comprehension. By the same token, what is said to be of the Holy Spirit has 
value only if it is held accountable to, and is validated by, the objective 
truths that reside in God's Word.<BR><BR>Modern education places a lower value 
on objective conclusions; everything becomes relative. Appeals to emotion 
replace clear, concise teaching and instruction from facts. By the same token, 
the trend in the modern Church is to disregard objective assessment of alleged 
signs and wonders; everything becomes relative. Appeals to emotion replaces 
clear, concise teaching and instruction from God's Word.<BR><BR>People can only 
react against these deceptions if they have a solid Biblical basis upon which to 
judge, and which motivates them to react against those deceptions. Most 
Christians lack a solid Biblical basis upon which to judge. And they are fearful 
of reacting. Under the rules established by the religious hierarchy, you cannot 
judge or challenge these subjective teachings and practices. To do so brings the 
religious leaders' judgment that you have "touched God's anointed," or have 
blasphemed the Holy Spirit, thus risking God's wrath.<BR><BR>Thus, too, you 
cannot judge anyone else's belief system, whether <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/">Roman 
Catholicism</A>, <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/mormon.htm">Mormonism</A>, 
apostate Judaism, or anything that produces palpable spiritual benefit or 
satisfaction.To the subjective religionists, objective assessment of their 
teachings equals judgmentalism. And judgmentalism stirs God's anger. Fear and 
intimidation is very much a part of this subjective religion.<BR><BR>What is 
ridiculed most is any suggestion that the subjective religion is leading its 
adherents toward induction into the coming one-world New Age religious system. 
How dare anyone suggest that the major players within modern "Christianity" 
could fall into that trap and lead others as well. Yet the major move today 
among virtually all the well-known professing Christian leaders is toward 
ecumenism. They have already stated their disdain for those who warn against 
unity with the papacy.<BR><BR>They have chosen to overlook serious Biblical 
error in order to forge a united front against certain evils such as abortion, 
crime, pornography, and such. It's because they do not perceive heresy as any 
big deal that they can overlook much of the same error in the Protestant 
churches. And where there can be found agreement with New Age philosophy which 
works for a world wherein love and peace abide, one soon finds more "Christian" 
leaders joining hands with New Age 
prophets.<BR><BR><CITE><STRONG>CONCLUSION</STRONG></CITE> <BR><BR>The only 
defenses we have against spiritual deceptions arising today are a holy life, a 
solid grounding in God's Word, and a refusal to accept anything as being from 
Him that is not validated in His Word. We should heed John 4:23:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><CITE>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall 
  worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to 
  worship him.</CITE></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Many wish to worship God in the Spirit, and this is fine; but they neglect 
the second requirement: that we worship Him in truth. His Word is truth (John 
17:17). The two cannot be separated, for God's work is by His Word.<BR><BR>His 
Word says that all things in the Church must be done decently and in order (1 
Cor. 14:40). Women (let alone men) flopping on the floor and hooting or making 
animal sounds is not decent. Holy laughter is not orderly.<BR><BR>It doesn't 
matter how unspiritual we are perceived to be by those who go whole-log after 
alleged supernatural phenomena. We must stand firmly for the integrity of God's 
Word, even when they cast us out of the synagogues and put us to death, 
believing they are doing God a service.<BR><BR>The day is coming and is now here 
when we will have to count the true cost of following Jesus.</P>
