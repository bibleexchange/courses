<P align=center><STRONG>The Charismatic Strange Fire</STRONG></P>
<P align=left>One of the most subtle actions of the Antichrist spirit has been 
the rise of the Charismatic movement. Only a few very discerning saints of God 
understood the "Charismatic renewal." as they called it at its beginning. It 
appeared so harmless, even exciting, that the old line ministers and many 
Catholics were receiving the infilling of the Holy Ghost and revival was coming 
to multitudes of people. Being a Pentecostal since 1952, I attended some of 
their first Full Gospel Businessmen’s meetings. I wanted to be a part of 
anything God was doing. Never, not one time, did I sense a true move of God, but 
left every meeting where they claimed God was moving confused and troubled. The 
Spirit of God in me constantly witnessed that something was wrong, but I 
certainly did not understand what was wrong at that time.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>I was at the Charlotte Rescue Mission for a breakfast with the 
Full Gospel group of our city the first time I saw the entire crowd invited to 
sing in tongues together. When they started, I moved out of the room because it 
was exactly what I had witnessed when pagan gurus were worshipped. The very idea 
that someone can sing in tongues at will and in concert with a large crowd 
breaks every rule of Biblical teaching about the gifts of the Holy Ghost. I had 
already learned that one of the primary teachings of the Charismatics was that 
the gifts of the Spirit can be manifest at will. To see people using the Holy 
Spirit as they would a radio was utterly over the top. I remember Juanita and me 
being in a Charismatic church in Washington, D.C., and witnessing the same 
thing.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>On another occasion, I attended a breakfast where the speaker was 
a jewelry store owner. As he told about his jewelry business and the great 
blessing of selling tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry giving all the 
credit to his baptism in the Holy Ghost, I was sickened beyond description. How 
we can bring God’s Spirit down into the realm of merchandising something as 
unnecessary as gold and silver was beyond me. All of this brought the crowd to 
their feet, while outside the room was a multitude of crippled, broken, and 
suffering individuals waiting for the God of real miracles. That was my last 
prayer breakfast.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>On another occasion, I met with local ministers just for 
fellowship and the joy of friends. At this luncheon, again my last, a local 
Charismatic personality decided to lead everyone in a dance. I’m not sure how it 
all ended because dancing with a bunch of preachers did not seem very Godly to 
me, much less enjoyable. </P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>I will never forget the first time I went to hear Pat Robertson of 
Christian network television fame. He was speaking at a local arena and I was a 
bit excited about his coming to Charlotte. The fanfare was too much, and his two 
bodyguards really disturbed me, but his ideas were the real problem. Not long 
into his presentation, he began to promote his post-millennium doctrines. He 
stated that soon all members of our Supreme Court would be Spirit-filled 
believers. His theology was some kind of mixture of what sounded like 
replacement theology. He certainly was not a Bible fundamentalist. Later, I read 
a review of his book named<I> The Millennium </I>that stated, "If you believe in 
the Rapture, you will not be interested in this book." He has clearly shown his 
Catholic leaning.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>My experiences with the Charismatic world have been enough to 
prove to me the bankrupt foundations of this movement. The majority of the 
Pentecostal churches have been destroyed by this Antichrist movement within our 
midst. It apparently started with individuals like Kathryn Kuhlman. Our article 
entitled "Kathryn Kuhlman And Her Spirit Guide" proves beyond measure her foul 
influence. She was pro-Catholic to the core and started the slide within 
Pentecostal ranks in the direction of Rome. She was a guiding star to the 
compromises that later came to full bloom in Charismatic circles.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>This strange fire cannot be understood unless you are a strict 
Bible believer. The Father destroyed two of the precious sons of Aaron because 
they offered <B>"Strange fire which God had not commanded." </B>(Leviticus 
10:1-7) Anything that someone labels as the fire of the Holy Ghost that is 
contrary to the Bible is false, and God calls it "strange fire." The Charismatic 
world is totally dominated by unbiblical concepts. Let me name a few of them: 
holy laughter, oils appearing supernaturally, gold dust, angel feathers, fortune 
telling, prosperity concepts, etc. These are only a few. Ministers claiming the 
power to impart the anointing, people falling out in the Spirit en mass, all 
kinds of strange hysteria, the Spirit slamming people against walls, or any kind 
of emotion that borders on drunkenness, etc., cannot be supported by Holy 
Scripture. Why would this Divine Spirit of my Father and the Son of God act 
within or upon people to behave like pagans in a voodoo ceremony?</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>I watched Kenneth Hagin walk around the great crowds, hissing like 
a snake, his tongue sticking out and the crowd going insane with emotions, but 
when he came to the section of crippled people, he turned and walked in another 
direction. Do not accuse my God of promoting insane emotions as His fire, but 
turning away from the worshippers that needed a physical miracle. The fire of 
God saves, heals, renews the spirits and souls of the worshippers, and makes all 
things new. In fact, He commands us, <B>"Go ye into all the world, and preach 
the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; 
but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them 
that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new 
tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it 
shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." 
</B>(Mark 16:15b-18) This false emotionalism is "strange fire," but the real 
fire is still changing lives, healing the sick, transforming the oppressed, and 
exalting Jesus Christ as Lord of all. </P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Do not misunderstand me. I believe in everything that happened in 
the ministry of Jesus Christ and the Apostles. Everything recorded in the four 
Gospels and the Epistles is commanded of God to us. But the Charismatic world is 
full of strange fire that God has not commanded. It passes from one to another 
like some kind of poison while the wonderful miracles of God are utterly absent. 
The Word of God is the final discernment of the false and the true. </P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Now the final truth is out. The Charismatic world almost as a 
whole is in the process of returning to the Catholic fold of Rome. From Benny 
Hinn, Pat Robertson, the Pentecostal denominations are all moving swiftly toward 
Rome and fellowship with the Beast. "Strange fire" was judged quickly in the Old 
Testament. In the New Testament, the action is awaiting the fulfillment of all 
things, and then it will be complete judgment; not as swiftly, but completely. 
The Charismatic world is American style Voodoo. </P>
