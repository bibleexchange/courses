<P class=pcmaintitle>A Marriage From Hell</P>
<P class=pcauthor>by Joseph Chambers</P>
<P>The darkest hour of human history will soon unfold upon our world. This hour 
is called by different names in Holy Scripture. Jesus called it the Great 
Tribulation in Matthew 24:21. Isaiah called it a day <SPAN class=pcscripture>"to 
punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity"</SPAN> (Isaiah 26:21). 
Jeremiah called it "Jacob's Trouble" (Jeremiah 30:7). Those whom John the 
Revelator saw suffering the hell of that period called it the "wrath of the 
Lamb" (Revelation 6:16). It is a time of literal hell on earth, but it is more 
than just suffering and judgment. It is the atonement of the creation of God and 
its rightful preparation to become the Garden of God where the righteous 
millennium (1,000 years) will be established. Before that happens, religious 
debauchery must reach its final stage.</P>
<P>The joining of Catholics and Protestants is a clear indication of ultimate 
apostasy. Religious organizations, denominations, churches, and individuals are 
presently rushing to outdo each other in preparation for this unity. In fact, 
two words have come to describe the church world. Those two words are unity and 
tolerance. For some strange reason, which can only be described as supernatural, 
almost the entire church leadership appears to be headed in this direction.</P>
<P>Isaiah described this time in history as follows, <SPAN 
class=pcscripture>"And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the 
midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall 
be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err."</SPAN> (Isaiah 
30:28).</P>
<P>It is very evident that the majority of religious people have no idea where 
they are headed. The latest trend, the religious in-thing, the popular movement 
or whatever some religious tycoon is spouting off; they follow after like being 
led by the Pied Piper. Isaiah, by the Holy Spirit, called it a spirit of bondage 
that is clearly like having a hook in the jaw. There is no discernment, just 
following religious excitement to any place where the emotion is strong enough 
to give a high!</P>
<P>Apostle Paul said the same thing with different words. He said, <SPAN 
class=pcscripture>"And for this cause (they did not love the truth) God shall 
send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie..."</SPAN> (II 
Thessalonians 2:11). Our church world is gullible to the point of insanity. A 
man can go to prison for bilking millions from his followers and come out of 
prison to overflowing crowds. An evangelist can lead thousands to laugh 
themselves silly and then laugh himself all the way to the bank. A university 
president can threaten to die if he does not get millions in donations and get 
it. It's insanity far beyond the mental institutions. It's religious insanity, 
the worst kind of all! Let's look at the Catholic Church, the present Pope and 
what this unity suggests.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>Has Pope John Paul II Been Converted?</P>
<P>Let's take a little space to see if the Pope has become a Bible-believing 
Christian. A man's word spoken publicly or put in print is the best method of 
judgment. First, let's hear Pope John Paul II speak concerning Mary. "On the 
universal level, if victory comes, it will be brought by Mary, Christ will 
conquer through her because He wants the church's victories now and in the 
future to be linked to her." ("Crossing The Threshold Of Hope", 1994; Our Lady 
Publication, Spring 1995.)</P>
<P>In August 1993, in Denver Colorado, Pope John Paul II prayed the following 
prayer.</P>
<P>"Mary of the New Advent, we implore your protection on the preparations that 
will now begin for the next meeting [World Youth Day.] Mary, full of grace, we 
entrust the next World Youth Day to you. Mary, assumed into heaven, we entrust 
the young people of the world...the whole world to you." (NRI Trumpet, October 
1193, p.14).</P>
<P>The following prayer is the conclusion of the Rosary prayed by millions.</P>
<P>"Hail, holy Queen [of heaven], Mother of Mercy! Our life, our sweetness, and 
our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send 
up our sighs, mourning and weeping, in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most 
gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this our exile show 
unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus; O clement, O loving, O sweet 
Virgin Mary." (Rosary).</P>
<P>Listen to this statement from the Pope's address in Denver, Colorado, in 
1993.</P>
<P>"With my heart full of praise for the Queen of Heaven, the sign of hope and 
source of comfort on our pilgrimage of faith to the heavenly Jerusalem, I greet 
all of you, who are present at this solemn liturgy...This liturgy presents you, 
Mary, as the woman clothed with the sun... O woman clothed with the sun...the 
youth of the world greet you with so much love...In Mary the final victory of 
life over death is already a reality...</P>
<P>"O Mary...as Mother of the Church, you guide us still from your place in 
heaven and ...help us to increase in holiness by conquering sin." ("All-Night 
Prayer Vigil Becomes Devotion to Lady of the New Heavenly Goddess" by Kathleen 
R. Hayes, NRI Trumpet, October 1993, pp. 6-14).</P>
<P>The only word to use for this kind of theology is blasphemy. The Pope is a 
Mary worshipper who prays to the dead (necromancy - Deuteronomy 18:11), which is 
called an abomination in the sight of God.</P>
<P>The Pittsburgh Center for Peace reported the following quote from Mary to a 
woman named Gladys Quiroga. These are supposed apparitions or miraculous 
appearances of Mary whom they call the Mother of God and Queen of Heaven.</P>
<P>"I am the Mother of everything created by God: I am the 'Woman Clothed With 
the Sun,' the 'New Eve,' who will lead mankind to Light. The one who makes it 
possible for them to reach eternity. Make it known. Amen, Amen."</P>
<P>"I am the Eternal Spouse of the Holy Spirit, that I am the Mother of the 
Living God and I have the mission to mark all the foreheads with the Sign of the 
Living God, so that these foreheads with this mark may prevail over Hell. Have 
confidence in me, my children. I will be the one who will draw the Love of God 
to men, and the pardon for all those who wish to come to my Immaculate Heart." 
(Pittsburgh Center For Peace, Spring 1995.)</P>
<P>Do not believe anyone who tries to tell you that Catholics do not worship or 
pray to Mary. They will absolutely lie about this fact to deceive you and cover 
their idolatrous actions.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>Pope John Paul II Is Committed To The Unity Of All 
Religions</P>
<P>Let's listen to Pope John Paul II speak concerning unity and his belief that 
the church world is coming home to the Catholic Church. When evangelicals talk 
of unity with the Catholic Church, they are actually headed toward unity with 
all religions. It is clear that the Catholics have already made that decision. 
The unity of Catholics and Protestants is only the first step. This marriage is 
the actual work of demons and devils and will damn a multitude to hell. Listen 
to the Pope and his leaders describe their plan.</P>
<P>"Mary most holy, the highly favored daughter of the Father will appear before 
the eyes of believers [in '1999, the third and final year of preparation'] as 
the perfect model of love toward both God and neighbor...so that they will 
return to the house of the Father...The mother of fairest love, will be for 
Christians on the way to the Great Jubilee of the third millennium the star 
which safely guides their steps to the Lord." (Unity: The Key To God's Coming 
Victory!" by Denis Nolan, Our Lady, Queen Of Peace, Special Edition III, Spring 
1995, p.32).</P>
<P>In the same article the writer quotes Mary of Fatima as saying, "He that is 
not with the Pope is not with God, and he that wants to be with God, has to be 
with the Pope! (Ibid).</P>
<P>The Bishop of Fatima then added the following.</P>
<P>"Our Lady's plan is a global plan that embraces every heart; it is the 
project of the Triumph of Her Immaculate Heart; to offer to Her Son the unity of 
our hearts for the salvation of the world. Our Lady had made his stupendous 
spiritual family arise to contribute to surmounting the crisis in which, of 
course, the world, but also the Church, finds itself- a crisis of unity! Indeed 
the role of the Mother is that of bringing unity among her children, this most 
sublime task of Christianity, Jesus' mission par excellence: that all might be 
one with Him with the Father..."</P>
<P>This Pope is an ecumenicalist that is determined to be the spiritual leader 
of all religions and to be the right hand man of the coming World Dictator. He 
is certainly in the key position and the world that has missed the truth of God 
is preparing to follow him.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>Has The Catholic Church Changed?</P>
<P>The liberal charismatic magazine, Charisma, carried a report from Brazil 
where the Catholics had launched a "Holy War" on the evangelicals. The following 
are the words of the bishop of Brazil.</P>
<P>"Bishop Sinesio Bohn, the leader of a new anti-evangelical movement in 
Brazil, delivered some tough rhetoric at the conference. 'We will declare a holy 
war; don't doubt it,' he announced. 'The Catholic Church has a ponderous 
structure, but when we move, we'll smash anyone beneath us." (Charisma, May 
1994, p. 74.).</P>
<P>The Charisma writer further stated,</P>
<P>"According to Bohn, an all-out holy war can't be avoided unless the 13 
largest Protestant churches and denominations sign a treaty-similar to treaties 
signed by nations to end wars. He said it would require Protestants to stop all 
evangelism efforts in Brazil. In exchange, he said, 'Catholics would agree to 
stop all persecution directed toward Protestants.</P>
<P>"Bohn called his proposal an 'ultimatum', and he said it would leave no room 
for discussion." (Ibid).</P>
<P>The Catholic Family News carried an article in the June 1995 edition 
extolling a lady named Margaret Mary Alacogue. Her saintliness was described as 
follows:</P>
<P>"It was during the octave of the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament. "Margaret 
Mary was on her knees before the choir grate with her eyes fixed on the 
tabernacle. Suddenly Our Lord appeared at the altar and revealed His Sacred 
Heart.</P>
<P>"He said, 'Behold this Heart which loves men so much that it has spared 
nothing, even to exhausting and consuming itself, in order to testify in love. 
Yet, in return, I received from the greater part only ingratitude, by their 
irreverence and sacrilege, and by the coldness and contempt they exhibit for Me 
in this Sacrament of Love. (The Blessed Sacrament) And what is most painful to 
Me,' He added, 'is that they are hearts consecrated to Me'. Then He commanded 
her to have established in the Church a particular feast to honor His Sacred 
Heart. 'I desire, therefore, that the first Friday after the octave of the 
Blessed Sacrament be observed in a special manner as the Feast of My Sacred 
Heart, by receiving Holy Communion on that day, and making preparation for the 
indignity that It has received. I promise that My Heart shall bestow Its love 
abundantly on those who will render Me this honor, or cause the same to be 
rendered Me by others.'" (Catholic Family News, June 1995, p. 18).</P>
<P>Please notice that this devotion is before a wafer of bread, called by the 
Catholics the Blessed Sacrament. The Catholic Church still teaches that the 
priest actually transforms the wafer and wine into the very body and blood of 
Jesus Christ. Here is their actual quote from the Vatican council and published 
in 1988.</P>
<P>"There should be no doubt in anyone's mind 'that all the faithful ought to 
show to this most holy sacrament [wafer which allegedly has been transformed 
into Christ's body] the worship which is due to the true God, as has always been 
the custom of the Catholic Church. Nor is it to be adored any the less because 
it was instituted by Christ to be eaten.' [Quoting Trent]...he is to be adored 
there because he is substantially [physically] present there...whole and entire, 
God and man...permanently...through that conversion of bread and wine, which, as 
the Council of Trent tells us, is most aptly named transubstantiation.</P>
<P>"...in the Eucharist we become partakers of the Body and Blood of God's only 
Son...[and] the partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ has no less an effect 
than to change us into what we have received." (Austin Flannery, O.P. gen ed., 
Vatican Council II: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents, rev.ed. 
(Costello Publishing, 1988), vol. 1, pp. 104, 107, 109).</P>
<P>A pocket Catholic dictionary describes this more clearly as, the "true Body 
and Blood of Jesus Christ, who is really and substantially present under the 
appearance of bread and wine in order to offer him in the sacrifice of the Mass 
and to be received as spiritual food in Holy Communion." (John A. Hardon, S.J., 
Pocket Catholic Dictionary (Doubleday, 1966), p.132).</P>
<P>It is totally anathema to a Bible believer to ever suggest that unleavened 
bread or the fruit of the vine can be miraculously transformed into flesh and 
blood much less the flesh and blood of the ascended Son of God, who is seated at 
the Father's right hand. To further add, as does the Catholic Church, that only 
a priest has the power to perform this miracle. They state "the priest is 
indispensable, since he alone by his power can change the elements of bread and 
wine into the body and blood of Christ..." (Ibid, p. 249).</P>
<P>Mother Teresa expresses this belief as follows:</P>
<P>"It is beautiful to see the humility of Christ...in his permanent state of 
humility in the tabernacle, where he has reduced himself to such a small 
particle of bread the priest can hold him in two fingers." (Mother Teresa, In 
The Shadow of the Heart).</P>
<P class=pcheading1>Convinced?</P>
<P>I do not believe you need further documentation to prove that Catholicism is 
totally bankrupt and the very instrument of the Antichrist. It is as dark as 
hell itself and cannot be viewed as anything less while remaining true to Holy 
Scripture.</P>
<P>Dave Hunt in his breathtaking book, A Woman Rides The Beast, documents the 
sexual deviation of multiple popes, priests, and archbishops. He exposes the 
ratlines that helped Nazi thugs escape after the Allied Forces won World War II. 
He shows that Hitler was a lover and revered Catholic never condemned by the 
hierarchy of the church. So was Mussolini. Dave Hunt's 500+ page book will give 
you an updated perspective of the Harlot of Rome that cannot be denied.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>What Is Happening To Evangelicals?</P>
<P>Some of America's most listened-to leaders are bowing their knees to Rome. 
These persons, in most cases, are individuals who have served the church well in 
the past but appear to have lost their way. Let me quote without comment several 
of these individuals.</P>
<P class=pcheading2>Billy Graham</P>
<P>"I've found that my beliefs are essentially the same as those of orthodox 
Roman Catholics." (McCall's, January, 1978).</P>
<P>This quote concerning Billy Graham is taken from Dave Hunt's book: "The BGEA 
[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association] acquired the printing rights [for a 
special edition] of...the classic Henry H. Halley Bible Commentary entitled, 
Pocket Bible Handbook...[It] described [Rome's] martyrdom of millions...[In its 
1962 Billy Graham Crusade Edition] the Graham Association...removed all these 
pages...(Citing Halley's Bible Handbook, Billy Graham Crusade ed., p.57).</P>
<P>Here is what the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association removed: "[The 
Albigenses] preached against immoralities of the [Catholic] priesthood, 
pilgrimages, worship of saints and images...opposed the claims of the Church of 
Rome; made great use of the Scriptures...By 1167 they embraced possibly a 
majority of the populations of South France...In 1208 a crusade was ordered by 
Pope Innocent III; a bloody war of extermination followed, scarcely paralleled 
in history; town after town was put to the sword and the inhabitants murdered 
without distinction of age or sex...within 100 years the Albigenses were utterly 
rooted out.</P>
<P>"[Two centuries later] between 1540 and 1570 no fewer than 900,000 
Protestants were put to death in the Pope's war for the extermination of the 
Waldenses. Think of monks and priests directing, with heartless cruelty and 
inhuman brutality, the work of torturing and burning innocent men and women 
alive, and doing it in the Name of Christ, by the direct order of the 'Vicar of 
Christ!'</P>
<P>"...on the night of August 24, 1572, 70,000 Huguenots, including most of 
their leaders, were massacred [St. Bartholemew's massacre]. Some 200,000 [more] 
perished as martyrs...[and] 500,000 fled to Protestant countries." (Henry H. 
Halley, Pocket Bible Handbook (Chicago, 1944), pp. 608-13).</P>
<P>Speaking of the present Pope John Paul II, Billy Graham calls him 'the 
world's greatest evangelist." (Michael de Semlyen, All Roads Lead To Rome?, 
p.78).</P>
<P></P>
<P class=pcheading2>W.A. Criswell, Former President, Southern Baptist 
Conference</P>
<P>"I don't know anyone more dedicated to the great fundamental doctrines of 
Christianity than the Catholics." (David Beale, Southern Baptist Convention, 
House on the Sand?, pp. 142-143).</P>
<P></P>
<P class=pcheading2>Paul Crouch, TBN President</P>
<P>"In the essentials our theology is basically the same: some of these even 
so-called doctrinal differences...are simply matters of semantics. One of these 
things that has divided us [referring to transubstantiation] all of these years 
shouldn't have...we were really meaning the same thing but saying it a little 
differently....</P>
<P>"So I say to the critics and theological nitpickers, 'Be gone, in Jesus' 
name!' Let's come together [with Rome] in the spirit of love and 
unity...[Audience applause.] (From a tape of "Praise the Lord" (TBN), October 
17, 1989).</P>
<P>"I'm eradicating the word Protestant even out of my vocabulary...I ['m] not 
protesting anything...[it's] time for Catholics and non-Catholics to come 
together as one in the Spirit and one in the Lord." ("Praise the Lord" program, 
Trinity Broadcasting Network, October 17, 1989, hosted by Paul and Jan Crouch - 
guests were two Catholic priests, Fr. John Hamsch and Jesuit Fr. Herbert De 
Souza, and leading Catholic laywoman, Michelle Corral).</P>
<P class=pcheading2>Norman L. Geisler, President, Southern Baptist Seminary, 
Charlotte, NC</P>
<P>Catholics "believe in justification by grace" and that difference between 
Catholics and evangelists "are not as great as generally perceived and they are 
not crucial...[nor do they] involve heresy...the whole theological core of 
historic Christianity is held in common." (The Southern Cross, January 13, 1994, 
p.11).</P>
<P class=pcheading2>Benny Hinn</P>
<P>During a September 1991 interview with Randy Frame of Christianity Today, 
Benny Hinn said, "My upbringing, of course, was Catholic in that I attended 
Catholic school in Jaffa, Israel, and so my mentality basically is a Catholic 
mentality.</P>
<P class=pcheading2>Chuck Colson</P>
<P>"We have differences, but on the ancient creeds and the core beliefs of 
Christianity we stand together." (From a letter signed by James W. Jewell for 
Colson dated May 23, 1994, to T.A. McMahon, quoting a public statement by Colson 
made elsewhere).</P>
<P>I have allowed these men to speak for themselves. Everything they have said 
in defense of Catholic doctrines is untrue. Catholicism has not changed nor is 
it possible for it to change. The very fact that they claim infallibility in all 
their decrees and in every action of their chosen Pope makes the possibility of 
change impossible. You cannot be perfect and admit being wrong at the same 
time.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>The Gospel As Taught By Roman Catholicism</P>
<P>The following statement clearly shows what the Catholic Church believes 
concerning salvation.</P>
<P>"Our job is to make people as richly and as fully Christian as we can make 
them by bringing them into the Catholic Church. So evangelization is never fully 
successful, it's only partial, until the convert is made a member of Christ's 
body by being led into the [Catholic] church.</P>
<P>"Now listen again to the words of [Pope] Paul VI. Now this is a document 
every one of you should have in your homes...called 'On Evangelization in the 
Modern World.' This is what the Pope says: 'the commitment of someone newly 
evangelized cannot remain abstract ('Oh, I'm a Christian,' now that's too 
abstract)...it must be given concrete and visible form through entry...into the 
[Catholic] church our visible sacrament of salvation.'</P>
<P>"I like saying those words; I'm going to say them again: 'Our visible 
sacrament of salvation' That's what the Church is, and if that is what the 
Church is, we have to be evangelizing into the Church!...</P>
<P>"No, you don't just invite someone to become a Christian, you invite them to 
become Catholics...Why would this be so important? First of all, there are seven 
sacraments, and the Catholic Church has all seven... "On our altars, as 
offering...we become one with Christ in the Eucharist...</P>
<P>"As Catholics we have Mary, and that Mom of ours, Queen of Paradise, is 
praying for us till she sees us in glory.</P>
<P>"As Catholics we have the papacy, a history of popes from Peter to John Paul 
II...we have the rock upon which Christ did build His Church.</P>
<P>"As Catholics - now I love this one - we have purgatory. Thank God! I'm one 
of those people who would never get to the Beatific Vision without it. It's the 
only way to go...</P>
<P>"So as Catholics...our job is to use this remaining decade evangelizing 
everyone we can into the Catholic Church, into the body of Christ and into the 
third millennium of Catholic history. ("Roman Catholic Doubletalk at 
Indianapolis '90," Foundation, July-August 1990, excerpts from talk by Fr. Tom 
Forrest to the Saturday morning training session.)</P>
<P>That is the gospel that the evangelical leaders say they believe if they 
agree with this harlot woman. This is very clear. Salvation is intimately 
connected to Mass and other Catholic liturgical forms and included the final 
need of purgatory to settle the score and assure the person of heaven. This 
appointed teacher clearly said that he would not make it to Heaven (Beatific 
Vision) without purgatory. What happened to the glorious assurance of salvation 
by faith and cleansing in the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ? The doctrine of 
Roman Catholicism is damning and has already sent a multitude into hell. There 
is no kinship with the true message of justification by faith.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>Come Out Of Her My People</P>
<P>God has given you and me an ultimatum. It is simple and to the point. <SPAN 
class=pcscripture>"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of 
her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of 
her plagues."</SPAN> (Revelation 18:4). Anyone that defends this harlot woman 
and her blasphemies will answer to God. Ignorance is not an acceptable excuse 
simply because there is no honest way to remain ignorant. The evidence is 
overwhelming.</P>
<P>Faith in the blood of Jesus Christ for the redemption of your soul is a clear 
message. Jesus Christ provides a finished work of redemption. You are freely 
invited to the cross. </P></BODY></HTML>
