<P class=pcmaintitle>The Prayer of Jabez</P>
<P class=pcmaintitle>Faddish Idolatry </P>
<P class=pcauthor>By Joseph Chambers </P>
<P>Religious fads are the most dangerous fads of all. Any religious leader that 
will lower himself to create and perpetuate a religious idea that has the 
potential to promote a "faddish idolatry" is in serious trouble. Misplaced fads 
of a Christian nature cannot be called anything but idolatry. Superstitious or 
soulish people have no capacity to discern between a religious fad and the true 
faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. Fads capture these types of people and carry 
them along on a false journey of imaginary faith. It is impossible to prevent 
these dark souls from grabbing the next dream just as soon as some guru can 
create it. </P>
<P>In my lifetime I have watched one fad after another make a multi-million 
dollar fortune for their creators. The God Chasers fad is still in motion, 
carrying along with it millions of souls from the charismatic vein. Apostle Luke 
spoke of this kind of idolatry being promoted by religious leaders who were 
looking for a following of self-disciples. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"Take heed 
therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost 
hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with 
his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves 
enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men 
arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore 
watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every 
one night and day with tears. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to 
the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an 
inheritance among all them, which are sanctified. I have coveted no man's 
silver, or gold, or apparel."</SPAN> (Acts 20:28-33). My soul is repulsed by it 
all. I weep for those without shepherds who have no one to warn and prepare him 
or her to reject such idolatry in the name of the Christian faith. </P>
<P class=pcheading1>The Prayer of Jabez is "Faddish Idolatry" </P>
<P>Of course, this prayer in its original content was very beautiful and created 
a lovely picture of a believing Jewish gentleman. His prayer was apparently 
prayed in the perfect will of God and it set him apart from the multitude of his 
contemporaries. It has the potential of a great sermon and a wonderful example. 
We can and should use this text as both. But, to elevate it to a "paradigm 
breaker" that is the model for all Christians would be laughable if it were not 
so serious. There is not one Scripture in the Bible, even the "Lord's Prayer," 
that should be used to create a mantra. In fact, the Lord Himself forbids us to 
pray any prayer in repetition, but we will discuss that later. </P>
<P>It's impossible to understand idolatry, unless you understand the faith of 
Biblical Christianity. It is just as easy to be an idolater with false ideas 
concocted out of Scripture, as it is to worship in a pagan religion. The 
Scripture warns us to "rightly divide" the Word of God and speaks often of false 
prophets and men who come in His name to deceive others. </P>
<P class=pcheading1>The Biblical Faith is Personal</P>
<P>A Biblical relationship with the Lord Himself leaves no room for "faddish 
idolatry." We that are "Born Again" have been spiritually birthed into a 
personal relationship with God. We know Him for ourselves and we commune with 
Him one-on-one. Nothing is more contrary to us than for someone to prescribe a 
religious mantra or to create a system that makes us bound within that system. A 
born again believer is a free soul that willingly and spiritually unites with 
the local body of the church. Religious systems of thought control outside the 
local body are quickly rejected.</P>
<P>Every cult uses a form of idolatry to enslave its members. Mormonism, Jehovah 
Witnesses, and to a lesser degree, many modern day television ministers each 
have there pat ideas which enslave people and hold their loyalty. In the past, 
most cults were different enough to be easily discerned. More and more as we 
approach the end of this age, cults are within the range of truth that renders 
them easily misinterpreted. Any idea that captures you and overemphasizes one or 
more Scriptures out of content can easily lead to "faddish idolatry." The "Jesus 
Only" doctrine is a case in point. They teach Jesus, His death on the cross, and 
other very Biblical truths. Yet, their idea of this "oneness" doctrine of Jesus 
Christ, excluding the "Godhead of three express persons," is clearly "faddish" 
and outside the beautiful revelation of Scripture. People in this cult are bound 
by the idolatry of false worship to a schizophrenic god who does not know 
whether He is the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. </P>
<P>I hope you understand what I mean by "faddish idolatry." You must know the 
God of the Bible for yourself. He sent His Son to establish redemption from sin 
into sonship and His great big family. His Holy Book is not of private 
interpretation. You do not need someone's concocted idea to be an anchor for 
your faith. There is no such thing as a "New Revelation." His word is long ago 
"settled in Heaven." The testimony of His completed Book is seen in Revelation 
11:19, ready to be revealed at the designated hour. We already enjoy its total 
truth and must learn to be wary of anyone claiming some great miracle or 
spiritual experience based on his or her own new revelation. If someone else has 
got to prescribe a prayer for you to get God's favor and blessing, you are 
already in trouble. </P>
<P>Every promise that the author of The Prayer of Jabez claims for you has been 
real in my life for almost fifty years. I have often wept before God embarrassed 
for my blessings. He has never failed me. His Word, from Genesis to Revelation, 
is personal to me. His daily "mercies" are renewed day after day without 
anyone's "mantra" or "repetitious request." He knows me and I know Him and that 
is exactly what He has claimed for every person created in His universe. He 
wants to be "your" God and He wants you to be His "son or daughter." 
Christianity can never be reduced to a "system" or a "prescribed formula." It's 
personal. He has no grandsons or granddaughters. We are all "first born" by the 
Blood of His Son. </P>
<P class=pcheading1>The Prayer of Jabez, Pagan Idolatry </P>
<P>Why do men take an idea or truth from Holy Scripture and then seek to create 
a religious system out of that truth? Religious systems always become idolatry, 
because men worship the system instead of the God of the Whole Bible. Idolatry 
is anything to which we give a godlike attention. Pat doctrines are most often 
worshipped in today's churches. As a Pentecostal, I have watched a multitude in 
our ranks worship the Pentecostal experience far above the "God of Pentecost." 
This is true of every segment of the Christian church. Anyone that allows a kind 
of worship that cheats them from knowing personally the "Great God of the Bible" 
has been led into error. What a loss! </P>
<P>Let's look at the violations of established truth evident in The Prayer of 
Jabez book. I will give you five reasons why this book is a subtle form of 
idolatry that departs from the plain teachings of Holy Scripture. </P>
<P><SPAN class=pcheading2>* The Book Makes no Mention of Praying in Jesus' 
Name</SPAN> - How can a book that claims such incredible miracles as a result of 
praying its formula completely ignore the first principle of New Testament 
prayer? Jesus said, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"And whatsoever ye shall ask in my 
name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son." "If ye shall 
ask any thing in my name, I will do it."</SPAN> (John 14:13-14). The established 
pattern in the Book of Acts is irrevocable. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"Then Peter 
said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name 
of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk." "And his name through faith in 
his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which 
is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you 
all."</SPAN> (Act 3:6; 16). If you do not pray in Jesus' name, you cannot claim 
the answer came from God. How did Dr. Wilkinson miss this incredible fact? He 
said, "I want to teach you how to pray a daring prayer that God always answers." 
(The Prayer of Jabez, Bruce Wilkinson, p. 7.) That claim is beyond the grasp for 
any prayer, much less a prayer that has eliminated the name of Jesus. Is the 
author willingly or unwillingly advancing the cause of the Jesus haters of this 
generation? There is great controversy across America concerning the issue of 
"praying in Jesus' Name." It appears that the main thrust in the religious world 
is to promote a religious consensus that accepts all religious actions on an 
equal footing, except that which includes praying in Jesus' Name. </P>
<P><SPAN class=pcheading2>* This Book Promotes a Form of Prayer That is Easily 
Identified as Heathen or Pagan</SPAN> - One of the plainest of the teachings of 
Jesus Christ concerning prayer had this to say, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"But 
thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy 
door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in 
secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as 
the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have 
need of, before ye ask him."</SPAN> (Matthew 6:6-8). Vain repetition is 
repeating the same words over and over. It is the creating of a mantra that fits 
the pagan idea of altering your consciousness and conjuring up evil spirits. No 
wonder Jesus thoroughly condemns such prayer styles. </P>
<P>To begin to understand why Jesus forbids repetitive prayers you must 
understand that He is a personal Lord who wants our prayers to be based on 
fellowship and trust, not memorized lines. We have fellowship with Him when we 
pray. We share our inner thoughts, emotions, and needs; and we do it as a son or 
daughter having joyous communion with a Father. A memorized prayer is an insult 
to His Sovereign Person. </P>
<P>Apparently, this author has himself experienced a paradigm shift. He admits 
to praying this prayer daily for over 30 years. Now, he states to his readers 
the promise of altering your consciousness. He said, "Just under the surface of 
each request lies a giant paradigm breaker." (Ibid, p. 14.) When you experience 
a paradigm shift, you have altered your consciousness. You do not think as in 
the past, but you have passed into an altered state. The end result of a total 
(He used the word "giant.") paradigm change in thinking is the leaving of the 
old way of communion and joining with the New Age crowd. The ultimate meaning is 
to think with the mind of the cosmos or to merge into the "Age of Aquarius." 
Reading a little from the "New Age writers" will scare you back to the New 
Testament if you have not already gone too far to return. </P>
<P><SPAN class=pcheading2>* A True Believers' Glory is in Nothing but the 
Cross</SPAN> - The glory and praise of the Blood-bought saints is the death and 
resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Source of all the blessings and 
favors promised in the Word of God. To suggest that any one of the many prayers 
which were prayed and recorded in the Scriptures should be used as our main 
source is folly. The prayer of Jabez was answered in his day because of the 
Messianic hope, which sustained and undergirded every truth in the First 
Testament. So, to go back to the shadows of that day when we are now enjoying 
the glory fulfilled is to misinterpret the Word of God.</P>
<P>The Apostle Paul was a completed Jew that eloquently knew the whole of the 
law and prophets and proclaimed, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"But God forbid that I 
should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is 
crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Christ Jesus neither 
circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as 
many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the 
Israel of God. From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the 
marks of the Lord Jesus."</SPAN> (Galatians 6:14-17). </P>
<P>There were Judaizers in Paul's day that kept trying to put the people under 
bondage to the old covenant of blessings. This great text makes it clear that my 
blessings are in Christ Jesus, not the rituals of the past. All we need to do to 
enjoy Heaven's best is to glory and revel in the cross, while we obey and live 
under His Lordship. The very thought of going back to reciting an ancient prayer 
in some isolated text borders on blasphemy. We are free from the customs of the 
past. Jesus said to a Samaritan woman who was herself bound by the 
misunderstanding of worship, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"But the hour cometh, and 
now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in 
truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit: and they 
that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."</SPAN> (John 
4:23-24). The day of wailing or chanting certain Scriptures was over. The truth 
Himself had come.</P>
<P><SPAN class=pcheading2>* This Book is an Ecumenical Book Moving the Church 
One More Step Toward a "One World Religion"</SPAN> - Mr. Wilkinson himself has 
been deeply involved in ecumenical-type activities where Catholicism, Mormonism, 
and other strains of cultic worshippers are being united. This book is clearly 
absent of the fundamentals of our faith. It is a further uniting of the church 
with psychology and modern waves of thought. </P>
<P>The great faith of the past that taught self-denial, the crucifixion of the 
flesh, and sacrificial living is woefully missing. Yet, the author claims for 
his followers everything of blessing that has always followed obedience and 
self-surrender. </P>
<P><SPAN class=pcheading2>* This Book is Unashamedly Selfish</SPAN> - The Son of 
God left no room for a selfish Christianity. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"Then said 
Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, 
and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall 
lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is 
a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what 
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"</SPAN> (Matthew 16:24-26). No one, 
not even a book selling millions of copies, can change the truth of the Eternal 
Son of God. Selfishness and truth do not mix. </P>
<P class=pcheading1>Conclusion </P>
<P>The church world is being inundated with many versions of blessings and 
carnal living. No one can answer all the questions being raised by the many 
popular "feel good authors." The only hope for a hungry soul is the plain and 
simple Word of God. Quit feeding on the fodder that is flooding our world from 
the pens and lips of the religious who have left the paths of Holiness. Separate 
yourself from the worldly crowds and their questionable teachings and get back 
to the cross.</P>
<P>If the cross of Jesus Christ and His physical death on that tree is not 
supreme, something is wrong. If the lessons and sermons are not calling for 
repentance and surrender to a cross-bearing life, something is out of frame. If 
you are not being led to deny yourself and present only Jesus to your world, 
then the enemy is in the camp. My suggestion is to spend a couple of months in 
the Book of Saint John and pray for a simple encounter with His all consuming 
presence. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to 
you."</SPAN> (James 4:8). The encounter of a lifetime is to be "born again" and 
to live in the Word of God. </P></BODY></HTML>
