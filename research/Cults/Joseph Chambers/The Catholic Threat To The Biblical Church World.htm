are clearly living in the last days of the church dispensation.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>The times of the Gentiles is quickly being completed.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>You cannot study one Gentile nation and what is happening to the culture 
within that nation without seeing finality written everywhere.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>The death signs are evident of the end.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Nothing 
within the world cultures is more evident of radical change than the death 
rattle that is so visible within the church system.</FONT></P>

New>There is a modernization occurring that makes every theological or 
historical idea open and preparing<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>for change.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>The “Robert Schuller” mystique of positive Christianity is the 
dominant shift.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Along with this shift is a fresh delusion 
that this modern church is destined to set up the Kingdom of God on this 
earth.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>To a Bible believing fundamentalist it is all 
insanity; but to the modern church, the only crowd that is insane are the 
fundamentalists.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>It’s all raw, unfettered 
“apostasy.”<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The Bible said it had to happen.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN><B>“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall 
not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be 
revealed, the son of perdition.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>And then shall that 
Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, 
and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.”<SPAN yes&quot;>

<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; 
New>There are several streams within the modern theological systems that are 
quickly coming together.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The dominant stream is the 
Catholic system, but it is by no means the only one.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>There is no stream that is merging with the Catholic stream more 
devotedly or quickly than the Charismatics.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They are 
sweeping almost the total world of what were Pentecostal or Full Gospel churches 
and ministers and leading them to hell, right to the bowels of Catholicism.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>The third stream is the “positive thinking” evangelical 
ministries that have gathered steam and influence until they are very close to 
being as full of deception as the Charismania. The fourth stream is<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>“Reformed Theology”, and it is divided between those that are 
post-millenial and ready to call the Catholic system “Christian”, and those that 
cling to the pre-tribulation and pre-millenial theology.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>These are the four mainstreams, with many smaller groups that are 
modernizing quickly and will soon join the “one world revival crowd.”<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>This so-called “revival” is no revival at all, but a religious 
conglomeration.</FONT></P>

New>Bible believing fundamental churches and ministers are the hated and 
rejected holdouts of the world.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Like the three Hebrew 
children “we will not bow, we will not bend and we will not burn.”<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>Literally, millions in the church world are leaving these 
modern churches to meet in homes, storefronts, and in mostly small, faithful 
churches.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>While it would suit the Catholic Church and her 
harlot daughters to close us down, the Bible makes it plain that it cannot 
happen.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>This glorious Gospel of transforming power will 
be preached until the end.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Jesus Christ promised, <B>“But 
he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of 
the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; 
and then shall the end come.”</B><SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>(St. Matthew 
24:13-14)<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; New>The 
primary force behind this destruction of the church is Catholicism.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>This mammoth system is organized to the core. Its faithful 
troops are spread over this globe; they infiltrate every religious system, and 
they are determined to create a one-world church, a one-world system, and to 
control the religious, the political, and the economic world.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>The ignorance of the church world to the mammoth drive for a unity of 
religion so distant from a “book of Acts” revival is amazing and cannot be 
understood without the word “apostasy.”<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>You cannot 
investigate one, big religious event or fad over the last few years without 
seeing how distant it is from the infallible Word of God.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>The church world seems to think that you can sanctify any religious event 
as long as you say the name of Jesus Christ.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Do not 
forget that you cannot sanctify error by using the name of Jesus Christ over 
it.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; New>The 
Catholic Church is clearly either leading or manipulating the religious forces 
driving the church world.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Using their resistance to 
abortion-on-demand and a handful of moral issues, they are being heralded as 
hope for change, both politically and culturally.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>At the 
same time, their resistance to bedrock truths of Biblical Christianity is as 
dark as hell.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>“Replacement theology” is a primary 
doctrine of Roman Catholicism. They believe that God has divorced Israel, and 
that they are the spiritual Israel.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Many within the 
Evangelical church are preaching the same doctrine.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The 
Jews are presently being used by the Catholic Church to aid them in acquiring 
control over the coveted city of Jerusalem, but it is all a fluke.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>The present revival of “preterism” is nothing but warmed over 
Catholicism.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The Catholic Church now owns Benny Hinn, 
TBN, <I>Charisma </I>magazine,<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>and many other large 
Charismatic ministries or Protestant ministries.</FONT></P>

New>The “Passion of the Christ” was the box office success of Catholicism and 
the one world church.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The death of Pope John Paul II was 
the greatest media event this harlot system has ever orchestrated.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>In spite of the crisis of a multitude of immoral priests, they 
were able to raise the level of acceptance to a new height.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>The harlot system is the living drama of Revelation chapter seventeen in 
motion. <B>“So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a 
woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having 
seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet 
colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup 
in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.” 
</B>(Revelation 17:3-4)<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>John was chided by the angel 
because he wondered at this “mother of harlots” and the glory she was able to 
manifest.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN><B>“And I saw the woman drunken with the blood 
of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I 
wondered with great admiration. And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou 
marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that 
carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.”<SPAN yes&quot;>

<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; New>His 
glorying at this system is being repeated by the world.<SPAN yes&quot;> 
</SPAN>It is impossible not to glory at a worldwide religious entity so rich, so 
full of human glory, and so capable to demand the attention of the most high and 
mighty of our day.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The unconverted church world full of 
educated leaders so utterly void of absolute confidence in truth cannot 
understand the fulfillment of prophecy as is occurring at break-neck speed.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>The Catholic Church will succeed.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>They 
will become the dominate force of the church, and the multitude will drink her 
poison and fornicate with her “names of blasphemy.”<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The 
remnant of the godly and the sanctified will reject her overtures, refuse her 
poison, and be hated for it.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>But we will be faithful 
until the King comes, and we will go with Him to the Marriage Supper.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>Millions will realize too late and miss the 
Rapture.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt&quot;><FONT face='"Times' size=3 Roman&quot; New>It 
is imperative that you come out of every religious system that is playing church 
with Catholicism.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>The NIV Bible is a Catholic Bible, the 
Purpose Driven program is a tool of deception, and the TBN worldwide television 
outreach is worse than dangerous.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>Your only hope of 
escape is to devour the infallible Word of God and walk in abandonment to the 
Lordship of Jesus Christ.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>You must refuse to sit under a 
pastor or preacher that is willing to fit into the modern church world.<SPAN 
yes&quot;> </SPAN>If he is not willing to speak the truth at all costs, he is 
not a man of God regardless of how nice he may be.<SPAN yes&quot;> </SPAN>We are 
near the end and faithfulness to the truth is our lifeline.</FONT><BR><BR>JOSEPH
