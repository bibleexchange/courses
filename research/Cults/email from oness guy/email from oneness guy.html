How can one God pray to another God? This is the dilemma trinitarians find themselves in. One of the great denominational preachers of our day wrote a book entitled </span><span class="cs43C038A">How Can God Exist in Three Persons?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">In this book the author said: I have spent over a quarter of a century in the serious study of the Word of God, and I confess to my appalling ignorance in certain areas, especially in the subject we have before us. . . . I confess that I find it an enigmatic mystery. I find it an inscrutable riddle. I find that it is complicated, and complex, and bewildering. I find that it is impossible to explain.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">If you think that Oneness is difficult to understand, try the trinity! The trinity doctrine is so full of contradictions, impossibilities, and absurdities that there is not one person in the world who can understand it. The great preacher quoted above continued: There is an ancient adage which warns that he who would try to understand the Trinity would lose his mind; and he who would deny the Trinity would lose his soul. We are caught in that kind of a dilemma.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">I am glad that I am not caught in that kind of a dilemma!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">The revelation of God in Christ is from God, and He will open the eyes of your understanding if you will seek Him and do His will. Jesus said in John 7:17, &ldquo;If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine.&rdquo; When you received the Holy Ghost into your life, you received the &ldquo;spirit of . . . understanding&rdquo; (Isaiah 11:2). He has promised to &ldquo;guide you into all truth&rdquo; (John 16:13). Even though you may not understand everything, walk in the light you do have and more light will be given you. It is dangerous to reject light. Love the truth and believe the doctrine of Oneness whether you understand everything or not, lest you should &ldquo;believe a lie&rdquo; and &ldquo;be damned&rdquo; (II Thessalonians 2:10-12).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">The question you ask, &ldquo;How could Jesus be God when Jesus prayed to God?&rdquo; shows me that you are not aware of a basic truth relative to Jesus. He was both God and man, and in the days of His flesh limited Himself to the frailties common to all mankind. That is why He could be &ldquo;in all points tempted like as we are&rdquo; (Hebrews 4:15), and as a man could hunger, thirst, grow weary, and sleep. Yet all this did not detract from His deity, for He was truly God in the likeness of man.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since He was both wholly God and wholly man at the same time as one person, He could speak from two distinct standpoints. At times He spoke as a man, and at other times as God Himself. As a man He prayed, but as God He created a feast for the multitudes. As a man He slept on the ship, but as God He said, &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9), and &ldquo;I and my</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Father are one&rdquo; (John 10:30). As a man He said, &ldquo;My Father is greater than I&rdquo; (John 14:28). You must know from which standpoint Jesus was speaking.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Bible calls this truth a mystery, but it is a revealed mystery, hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes (Matthew 11:25). &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory&rdquo; (I Timothy 3:16). Become as a little child! Love the Lord with all your heart, and He will reveal His truth to you!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
