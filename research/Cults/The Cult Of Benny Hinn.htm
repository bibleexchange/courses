<P class=pcmaintitle>The Cult of Benny Hinn </P>
<P>Benny Hinn is certainly a trendsetter in the New Wave movement. Before we 
learn about some of his teachings, lets remember the importance of truth. The 
Bible states, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"For truth is fallen in the 
street..."</SPAN> (Isaiah 59:14b). Probably, no Biblical statement could more 
accurately describe our present religious world. Truth has become relative. It 
means different things to different people, even within the ranks of what we 
call Biblical Christianity. I don't mean differences in non-essentials, but 
almost every fundamental doctrine is now under siege as preachers scramble the 
Holy Words. One thing to remember -- you cannot sanctify false doctrines by the 
multiple use of Jesus' name or by the presence of miracles. </P>
<P>Biblical confusion is a powerful tool which prepares the people to blindly 
follow religious leaders. It's impossible to create a new religious stream 
without introducing new theological ideas that depart from the mainstream. There 
are several elements to the beginning of a new and novel religious movement, 
Biblical confusion being the first. There must be an extremely strong and 
personable leader with enough charisma to titillate the crowds. The people are 
warned not to question this "man of God" because of the "anointing" on his life. 
They will always give the people an emotional charge to keep them on a high. He 
or she promises the people much for their loyalty and support, and they always 
teach enough of the old truths to add legitimacy to themselves. </P>
<P>As the group becomes big and powerful the very element of success makes it 
almost impossible for people to leave. There is a mesmerizing effect to the 
<EM><STRONG>"sight, sound, and sensation"</STRONG></EM> which characterizes this 
strong New Wave religious movement. As P.T.L. rose in financial glory and 
television success, the very best of religious leaders and Christians were 
swooned into support. People forsook Old-Fashioned standards of godliness and 
separation from the world and poured their life's earnings into that ministry. 
When someone pointed out "question mark", that individual was almost crucified 
by their friends. Many major ministries will never recover from the paralysis of 
the P.T.L. syndrome. We don't have P.T.L. anymore, but we do have many similar 
kingdoms that continue to conduct made-for-television religion. </P>
<P>The Kingdom of Jesus Christ never uses titillation to call men and women to 
this faith. The very foundation of Biblical Christianity is conviction of sin 
and a call to experience the Holiness of God. The Good News of the Gospel is 
simple; we are sinners, but God has given His Son as our sacrifice. By His blood 
we are forgiven, made whole, and called to follow in His footsteps of godly and 
Holy Spirit filled living. We are no long condemned with the world, but called 
to be His family. </P>
<P>He gives us great joy, but it's not the world's kind of joy. Jesus said, 
<SPAN class=pcscripture>"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not 
as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither 
let it be afraid."</SPAN> (St. John 14:27). Please notice that He said His peace 
was not the world's kind of peace. It's not the fleshly, carnal, love of 
pleasure, love of things, love of applause, love of a big time; but a godly 
peace and joy that flows from a right relationship with God and men. It's joy of 
the Holy Word, joy of winning souls and just plain joy from a clean and pure 
heart. A person that knows God through Jesus Christ will not need the 
experiences of a religious junkie.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>The Cult Of Benny Hinn?</P>
<P>What Benny Hinn's Ministries represent is your decision to make, but it's 
important for you to know the facts before you make that decision. Let's examine 
his teachings. The ultimate base of examination is the Holy Scripture. If a 
man's doctrines depart from the clear truth of Scripture, that settles the 
question. All of the following quotes from Benny Hinn's sermons have been 
transcribed from audio messages by the credible ministries of the Christian 
Research Institute or the Media Spotlight, A Biblical Analysis of Religion and 
Secular Media. Both addresses are listed at the conclusion of this article.</P>
<P class=pcheading1>Teachings Of Benny Hinn</P>
<P>Let's examine his actual words and then look at the Scripture for the 
Biblical facts on each subject. May I ask that you be very careful in reading 
his words so there is no misunderstanding.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><STRONG>The Subject Of God...</STRONG>: "God, the Father is a person, God 
  the Son is a person, God the Holy Ghost is a person, but each one of them is a 
  triune being by himself. If I can shock you and maybe I should, there are nine 
  of them.... God the Father is a person with his own personal spirit, with his 
  own personal soul, and his own personal spirit body. You say, "I never heard 
  of that." Well, do you think you're in this church to hear things you've heard 
  for the last fifty years? You can't argue with the Word can you? It's all in 
  the Word." (Benny Hinn)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Benny Hinn has since acknowledged this false teaching and apparently does not 
teach it any longer. But, how could such a lapse occur to begin with? It says 
something about him and his ministry that must be admitted. No subject is of 
greater importance to the Christian church than the personhood of God. God is 
one, represented in the person of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy 
Ghost. The beloved disciple John wrote by the Holy Ghost, <SPAN 
class=pcscripture>"There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the 
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."</SPAN> (I John 5:7). The 
Scripture testifies of the Trinity of God in perfect unity throughout Holy Writ. 
To speak of God the Father (The Son of God and the Holy Ghost) having a personal 
spirit, a personal soul, and a personal body is completely contrary to the Word 
of God. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, so how 
could the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit all three have their own personal 
spirit, spirit body, and soul. We see right at the beginning that the paranormal 
or psychic ideas are influencing the doctrines Rev. Hinn teaches. </P>
<P>Benny Hinn's teachings about Jesus Christ are similar to Kenneth Hagin and 
Kenneth Copeland, but actually go to another level above Rev. Copeland. He says, 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Ladies and gentlemen, the serpent is a symbol of Satan. Jesus Christ knew 
  the only way He would stop Satan is by becoming one in nature with him. "What 
  did you say? What blasphemy is this?" No, you hear this! He did not take my 
  sin, He became my sin. Sin is the nature of hell. Sin is what made Satan. You 
  remember, he wasn't Satan till sin was found in him. Lucifer was perfect till 
  Ezekiel says, sin was found in thee. It was sin that made Satan. Jesus said, 
  "I'll be sin. I'll go to the lowest place. I'll go to the origin of it. I 
  won't just take part of it. I'll be the totality of it. When Jesus became sin, 
  sir, he took it from A-Z and said no more. Think about this. He became flesh 
  that flesh might become like Him. He became death so dying man can live. He 
  became sin so sinners can be righteous in Him. He became one with the nature 
  of Satan so all those who had the nature of Satan can partake of the nature of 
  God." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This subject is equally important with that of the nature of God. The New 
Agers are willing to accept that Jesus was one of the great masters. Almost all 
religions have Jesus sandwiched in between the other godlike illuminares. The 
pure Christian faith teaches that Jesus Christ is the eternal Word of God, 
divine in all His Person and could not have taken any nature that would defile 
His person. Even the Body of the Son of Man was sanctified before He was sent 
into the World. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath 
sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the 
Son of God? "</SPAN> (St. John 10:36). </P>
<P>Jesus Christ did not become a sinner, but He did take our guilt as a 
vicarious sacrifice. Without question, He "became sin" by the act of 
substitution, not personal guilt. Paul said, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"For He 
(God the Father) hath made Him (God the Son) to be sin for us (in our stead), 
who knew no sin. . . "</SPAN> (II Corinthians 5:21). He did not "become sin from 
A to Z" as Hinn says. He did die as our substitute just as though He had been 
the guilty one, but he did not take the nature of Satan in the process. To be a 
substitute for someone is vastly different than taking their nature. Remember, 
He wasn't a substitute for Satan, anyway. He was a substitute for you and I 
because of Satan's rebellious act and deception and our bondage to sin. </P>
<P>The death of Christ was prefigured in the great sacrifices of the Old 
Testament temple. These great acts were given as a pattern for the coming 
Messiah and to cleanse the people once each year from their accumulated sins. 
Jesus Christ fulfilled all of that at His death. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"It was 
therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be 
purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices 
than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, 
which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the 
presence of God for us: Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high 
priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; For then 
must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in 
the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of 
himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the 
judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them 
that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto 
salvation."</SPAN> (Hebrews 9:22-28). The whole teachings of Benny Hinn on this 
subject are deeply flawed and present a perfect foundation for a paranormal 
religious movement. </P>
<P>Rev. Hinn's idea of the "little god theology" is quite revealing. Instead of 
you and I being elevated, The Lord Jesus Christ is actually being demoted. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"When you say I am saved, what are you saying? You are saying, I am a 
  Christian. What does that word mean? It means, I'm anointed. You know what the 
  word anointed means? It means Christ. When you say I'm a Christian, you are 
  saying I am Mashiyach in Hebrew, I am a little messiah walking on earth, in 
  other words. That's a shocking revelation! We are not, we are not, having, we 
  don't have a part of Him running around in our stomach feeling goose bumps. 
  His spirit and our spirit man are one, united. There is no separation, it's 
  impossible. The new creation is created after God in righteousness and true 
  holiness. The new man is after God, like God, God-like, complete in Christ 
  Jesus, the new creation is just like God. May I say it like this, you are a 
  little god on earth running around." (Benny Hinn) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Very few teachings have caused a greater flurry of emotion, pro and con, than 
this teaching of men becoming little gods. Hinn appears to give it a twist that 
the main proponents have not done. Hagin and Copeland (along with many others) 
have created a new world view among their followers with this whole idea. It has 
bred an arrogance and egotistical mindset with those adhering to this false 
teaching. Instead of humility and a contrite spirit (loved and blessed by the 
Lord), it has given us a whole class of professing believers who cannot be told 
anything. I have had people say to me, "I don't care what Paul the Apostle said 
or did." The very nature of this teaching is pride, haughtiness and every spirit 
of the Adamic nature. </P>
<P>Hinn teaches that we are "god-like in Spirit, not in our flesh" which appears 
to be even worse than the former idea. Here is another description of this idea 
by Hinn. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"They think we're saying we in flesh are God, we're not God in flesh. We 
  are god-like in Spirit. We're complete in Christ in Spirit. Our Spirit man is 
  god-like. It was birthed by God. It's a Spirit being. That's what I'm talking 
  about. [background voice says, 'So, those that would put that teaching down, 
  want us to have a beginning and an end.'] Yes! [background voice says, 'That's 
  Satan isn't it?'] Those that put us down are a bunch of morons. Glory to God! 
  Glory to God!" </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>His division of the human personality is dangerous. Man is a unified person 
and cannot experience something in the spirit without affecting his flesh or 
soul. If we are "born again", our entire personality is changed. We do not sin 
in the flesh without defiling our soul and spirit. Neither can we be god-like in 
spirit without being god-like in the flesh. The truth is we are saved by the 
action of the Holy Spirit upon our human spirit that puts God in charge of our 
whole life. Paul prayed that we be sanctified body, soul, and spirit and 
preserved blameless. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"And the very God of peace sanctify 
you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved 
blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</SPAN> (I Thessalonians 
5:23). </P>
<P>Any doctrine that elevates man to become a prideful and arrogant creature 
does not come from the Word of God. God is calling us to humility and a broken 
spirit, not a spirit of pride. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"The sacrifices of God 
are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not 
despise."</SPAN> (Psalm 51:17). </P>
<P>Paul was careful to say, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"For we are the 
circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and 
have no confidence in the flesh."</SPAN> (Philippians 3:3).</P>
<P class=pcheading1>The Believer And A Spirit Man</P>
<P>Rev. Hinn puts great emphasis on this idea of a spirit-man in the Believer. 
Here, he indicates that this occurs when we are born-again. If we receive a new 
Spirit man, then we are not really "born again" at all. It is rather a 
paranormal transformation. Benny Hinn says, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"When you were born again God gave you this brand new being, this brand new 
  being was created before the foundation of the World. Ephesians one declares 
  that God literally chose us before the foundation of the world and there it 
  talks about our spirit-man... Your spirit, ladies and gentlemen, is God-like; 
  he's God-like in every way...The second this spirit-man comes into our being 
  -- pops into our bodies -- we're born again. He's spirit; what born of spirit 
  is spirit. Say after me, within me is a God-man. Say it again, within me is a 
  God-man. Now let's say even better than that, let's say, I am a God-man. When 
  you say I am a God-man you're not talking about your flesh or your soul; 
  you're talking about your spirit-man." "Now, remember, everything Jesus did, 
  He did so we can receive the opposite! What He gave up, He was saying, 'You 
  are to receive what I gave up!' Now it's like this: I have His name on earth! 
  Isn't that right? What is it to have the name of Jesus? It means to have His 
  office!... Paul the apostle said that Jesus is standing before the throne as 
  the Son of Man. He called Him the "Man-Christ!" Now, you ready for some real 
  revelation knowledge? Okay, now watch this. He laid aside His divine form, Now 
  these are the seven steps from the glory to the cross. He laid aside His 
  divine form! Why? so one day I would be clothed on with the divine form!" 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This teaching appears to be so new as to leave one wondering where it came 
from. Read carefully, he is saying that when we are "born again", a spirit-man 
separate from ourselves, that God created before the foundation of the world, 
"pops into our body." Instead of the Holy Spirit renewing our human spirit and 
uniting us into the body of Christ, we are said by him to receive this 
extra-terrestrial spirit-man that takes over our inner spirit. The use of the 
word extra-terrestrial is mine, but I think that's exactly what we are dealing 
with. The possibility of demon-activity is very real when you begin to suggest 
an extra spirit activity apart from the Holy Ghost. </P>
<P>Apostle Peter spoke by the Holy Ghost and clearly stated, <SPAN 
class=pcscripture>"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of 
incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all 
flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass 
withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: But the word of the Lord 
endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto 
you."</SPAN> (I Peter 1:23-25). </P>
<P>Jesus, Himself, said, <SPAN class=pcscripture>"Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit (Holy Spirit) he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God."</SPAN> 
(St. John 3:5b). The activity in the soul of a repenting sinner is the work of 
the Holy Spirit. To suggest anything else is contrary to the Word. Actually, 
Hinn appears to be using this "spirit-man" idea to lay a foundation for the 
"little gods" teaching. If God has created an extra spirit-man that the believer 
receives, then we are changed into this new being, higher than just being 
redeemed from sin. </P>
<P>He suggests that in other remarks by saying, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"When Jesus came, He did not give us back Adam's office. He gave us His 
  office. This is why angels to this day cannot rebuke Satan. Jude says, even 
  Michael will not bring an accusation against the devil. Why? Because angels 
  are lower today than Satan who holds the office of Adam. But we, as joint 
  heirs with Christ in heavenly places, are higher than Adam [background voice 
  says, "and angels"] and angels." "So, today, angels cannot rebuke Satan, but 
  we can, because we are on the same level as the Son on earth." "We're not God, 
  we're the children of God. We're god-like in our Spirit man, not in our flesh. 
  Thank God, our flesh will die and we are gonna have a new body. The Bible 
  says, when we shall see Him our bodies shall be like Him, but our spirit man 
  is already like Him." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It would appear that every Christian would recognize this kind of teaching as 
aberrant to our faith. Hinn's effort to quote as proof text a Scripture in 
Ephesians One, fails miserably. Notice this Scripture. <SPAN 
class=pcscripture>"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation 
of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in 
love."</SPAN> (Ephesians 1:4). </P>
<P>There is no basis at all in this Scripture for such a teaching. Such ideas 
are usually defended as being "words of knowledge" or a "word of prophecy." 
Paul's words to Timothy are clearly applicable. <SPAN class=pcscripture>"For of 
this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden 
with sins, led away with divers lusts, Ever learning, and never able to come to 
the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do 
these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the 
faith."</SPAN> (II Timothy 3:6-8).</P>
<P class=pcheading1>Benny Hinn And The Word Of Knowledge</P>
<P>The doctrine of the Word of Knowledge is a big idea in the New Wave movement. 
Here is Rev. Hinn's idea on the subject: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Man, I remember when God would give me words of knowledge back when I 
  began in this ministry. I missed nine out of ten. Nobody knew it except me. 
  'Well, Benny Hinn, I thought when the Holy Ghost' -- saints, the Holy Ghost is 
  using an imperfect vessel. Are you listening? We're not infallible. Or when 
  you give a prophecy sometimes you can be way off; you have to be open enough 
  to say I blew it. "Hooo! He blew it; he's a false prophet!" No, he just blew 
  it. Just because you blow it -- men of God blow it all the time. Paul blew it; 
  Moses blew it; even Elijah blew it; even Elisha blew it! They all blew it. 
  Maybe not with prophecies, but they blew it in all kinds of things. Like 
  Elijah goes and says, 'Lemme die! I wanna die! I wanna die!' That's a bad 
  blow! Peter decides to withdraw himself from the Gentiles; he blew it bad! We 
  all blow it, and if you don't you're not human. Don't forget, the man who does 
  not use the eraser is no good! The man with clean eraser -- untouched -- don't 
  touch him. The man who does not know how to say, 'I blew it,' [you] can't 
  trust him. Did you hear that? So -- but you see, when the gift begins -- is 
  this helping you? -- when the gift begins it begins rough, but then as you 
  keep going with it you just get better and better and cleaner and purer with 
  it. So today with the word of knowledge -- I'm just being open with -- I 
  rarely miss anymore. Why? Because I recognize how to operate in it. [Hinn 
  snaps his fingers.]"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nothing in Hinn's teaching is more dangerous than his supposed use of the 
"gifts of the Holy Ghost" without the absolute commitment to dependability. He 
says he missed it nine out of ten times while he was learning how to use these 
gifts. Now, he says, "I rarely miss anymore." The Holy Ghost does not play games 
and He never misses being perfectly right. Hinn is apparently suggesting that 
the gifts are learned rather then given by the Holy Ghost. This is never taught 
or even suggested in the Scripture. </P>
<P>Let's imagine that he prophesied to one hundred people to begin with and now 
ninety of them are living under a false prophecy, which they accepted as true. 
Are they not as important as this man who says, "Don't judge me, I'm just 
learning?" Now, he says, "I rarely miss it;" but how about the people whose 
lives are wrecked when he does. Are these just disposable people Hinn takes no 
regard for as he rises to greatness? </P>
<P>Mr. Hinn pronounces a quick judgement on those who question him. Here are his 
words, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"All of us make mistakes; all of us are bound to error. But woe to the man, 
  and woe to the [TV] station, and woe to the group that will expose the 
  nakedness of the man of God to the world. You know, I'll tell you something. 
  I'm not supposed to, but the Holy Ghost is upon me, and I think I need to. The 
  day is coming when those that attack us will drop dead. You say, "What did you 
  say?" I speak this under the anointing of the Spirit. Can I tell you 
  something? Don't touch God's servants -- it's deadly. You'd think we should do 
  whatever we want with someone who's failed God? 'Touch not my anointing.' (-- 
  Benny Hinn) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Again, he is elevating himself above the Word of God. Paul said, <SPAN 
class=pcscripture>"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others 
judge."</SPAN> (I Corinthians 14:29). Every prophecy given by anyone is subject 
to judgement by the proper leaders in the Body. This protects all of us from the 
immature and evil imaginations of undisciplined individuals in the church. </P>
<P>We could discuss the wild antics that Mr. Hinn calls the work of the Holy 
Spirit. One single thing should suffice. Any activity in the church body should 
be judged by the precedent of New Testament Scripture. When men blow on others 
to give them the Holy Spirit, we should ask, "Is this a Biblical method for 
receiving the Holy Ghost Baptism?" Every activity of the church should point to 
Jesus Christ and should be clearly patterned after the Holy Bible. </P>
<P>The coming of Jesus Christ and the appearing of the Antichrist are both at 
hand. The very elect are at risk as we witness the confusion in religious 
circles. Very few men are willing to publicly speak to the evidence of the New 
Wave movement. There are many trendsetters that appear to be teaching a new way 
that they call a "paradigm shift." </P></BODY></HTML>
