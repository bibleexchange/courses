<H1>Bible: History of the KJV?</H1>
<P>The King James Version of the Bible, released in 1611, was authorized by King 
James in order to have as accurate a translation as possible, which could be 
printed and widely circulated. The original Old Testament writings were in 
Hebrew and the New Testament in Greek. Jerome (5th century) translated the Bible 
into Latin, called the Vulgate, which has become the official Roman Catholic 
Bible. The Council of Trent in 1546 met to consider doctrines and published a 
list of books, which were to be considered canonical, that is, to be included in 
the Bible. This list included the 39 books of the Old Testament, plus 7 
Apochraphal books, plus the New Testament 27. The Jews, however, do not accept 
the 7 Apochrapha as canonical. The Jewish Bible is limited to the Old Testament. 
The Greek translation these books is known as the Septuagint which is the oldest 
know translation of any large literary work and most widely used translation of 
any ancient writing. It is thought to have originated toward the end of the 3rd 
century BC or the beginning of the 2nd century BC. The earliest reference to 
this work dates around 132 BC. This translation is much older than the Masoretic 
translations of the first five centuries AD.</P>
<P>Since the Bible was hand written in the centuries prior to the invention of 
the printing press, few copies were available. The Latin translation (Vulgate) 
was the most common. Reformers such as Luther and Tyndale translated portions of 
the Latin Bible into the common language of the people; Luther into German and 
Tyndale into English. Wycliffe translated the Bible into the English language in 
about 1400 AD. While Luther was opening a closed Bible to the people of Germany, 
Tyndale was impelled by the Spirit of God to do the same for England. Wycliffe's 
Bible had been translated from the Latin text, which contained many errors. It 
had never been printed, and the cost of manuscript copies was so great that few 
but wealthy men or nobles could procure it. Furthermore, being strictly 
proscribed by the church, it had had a comparatively narrow circulation.</P>
<P>In 1516, a year before the appearance of Luther's theses, Erasmus had 
published his Greek and Latin version of the New Testament. Now for the first 
time the word of God was printed in the original tongue. In this work many 
errors of former versions were corrected, and the sense was more clearly 
rendered. It led many among the educated classes to a better knowledge of the 
truth, and gave a new impetus to the work of reform. But the common people were 
still, to a great extent, kept from God's word. Tyndale was to complete the work 
of Wycliffe in giving the Bible to his countrymen. Since the discovery of the 
"Dead Sea Scrolls" the accuracy of the Bible has been verified. In more recent 
years many translations of the Bible have been done. </P>
<P>The New King James version uses the Stuttgart edition of the Biblia Hebraica, 
the Septuagint along with a variety of ancient versions of the Hebrew manuscript 
including manuscripts found in the Dead Sea Caves. </P>
<P>We advise that several translations be used by those who cannot read the 
original Hebrew and Aramaic.</P>
<P>Several translations are available at <A 
href="http://en.bibleinfo.com/redir/?id=2" target=_blank>Bible Gateway</A>, 
which makes it easy to find verses and compare different versions at the same 
time. </P></DIV>
