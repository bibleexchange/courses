      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"><SPAN class=style14>s leading 
      televangelists rise to virtually celebrity-like status in our society, we 
      watch in amazement as a host of new and ambitious evangelists strive to 
      rise to stardom each time one of the old guard begins to fall into 
      relative obscurity.&nbsp; Benny Hinn is one who has clearly risen to the 
      top in Pentecostal and Charismatic circles.&nbsp; His book 
      </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=style14 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"><EM>Good Morning Holy 
      Spirit</EM> sold nearly one million copies, went through numerous 
      printings, and moved Hinn to the top of the Christian Bookseller's "Best 
      Seller List" for an extended period of time.&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">Hinn's ministry has also shown 
      phenomenal growth.&nbsp; As the pastor of Orlando Christian Center (OCC), 
      in Orlando Florida, Hinn now boasts of a massive congregation with over 
      7000 in attendance each Sunday.&nbsp; In addition, his television program 
      is seen daily on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), and his traveling 
      crusade ministry plays to a packed house in virtually every arena and 
      convention center where he appears.&nbsp; There is no doubt that Benny 
      Hinn is an important figure in the American religious scene.&nbsp; But 
      there is also no doubt that in spite of Benny Hinn's remarkable success, 
      his ministry is very suspect doctrinally.1</SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=style14 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      One of the first things that a viewer notices about Hinn's television 
      appearances, are the strange practices he employs in ministry.&nbsp; In 
      his own unique style, Hinn blows on the eager faithful in his audience, 
      causing them to collapse <EM>en masse</EM>, in a fashion reminiscent of 
      "the wave," seen at major sporting events.&nbsp; Of course, it is Hinn's 
      claim that this mass "slaying in the Spirit," is due to the power of the 
      Holy Spirit falling upon the crowd, through the ministry of Hinn himself, 
      as his own "anointing" is imparted to others by means of his breath.&nbsp; 
      More skeptical viewers may be inclined to attribute this to the condition 
      of Hinn's gastro-intestinal tract.&nbsp; It is also not uncommon to see 
      Hinn "throw" the Holy Spirit into a crowd, much like a famous athlete is 
      exhorted by his adoring fans to throw a ball into the stands as a 
      souvenir.&nbsp; Claiming to possess the power of God in his hands, Hinn 
      maintains that his personal "anointing" feels like electricity radiating 
      through his extremities.&nbsp; Often, Hinn will call those in the 
      audience, who claim that they have been healed, to come up onto the stage 
      and testify about what they feel has happened to them during the 
      emotionally charged crusade.&nbsp; Hinn may blow on them or "lay hands" 
      upon them individually, slaying them in the spirit.&nbsp; If they persist 
      in remaining on their feet--in a somewhat embarrassing situation for all 
      parties involved--Hinn "slays" them in a rather aggressive manner, placing 
      both of his hands upon them, then pushing them backwards into the arms of 
      the waiting attendants who catch them.&nbsp; In the words of one reviewer, 
      Hinn's ministry "bears all the marks of manipulative, staged 
      performances."2 </SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=style14 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      As is the case with many of these neo-gnostic teachers, Benny Hinn's 
      theological thought is often quite disjointed and shows signs of being 
      developed on the fly.&nbsp; Like Hinn, key figures in the Word-Faith 
      movement are often theologically untrained and they do not write 
      systematically on any of the various topics which they address.&nbsp; 
      Instead, they make bold claims to supernatural spiritual authority, 
      enabling them to speak as God's spokesman.&nbsp; This means that many of 
      the distinctive doctrines taught by Benny Hinn are often expressed in 
      spontaneous and off-the-cuff remarks made in his many public appearances, 
      which eventually find their way into the ministries' video and audio tape 
      catalogues, where these once spontaneous comments now become canonized, 
      and are then disseminated as doctrine to the adoring faithful.&nbsp; 
      </SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=style14 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Even more troubling, is the apparent willingness with which Hinn has 
      promised to cease teaching questionable doctrines when his orthodoxy is 
      challenged by various theological watchdog groups.&nbsp; What is 
      particularly problematic about this is that while Hinn humbly admits his 
      shortcomings to his critics and promises to change, he then continues to 
      teach the very same doctrinal errors almost immediately after agreeing to 
      stop doing so.&nbsp; This gives Hinn's theology a deceptive and 
      evolutionary character, as we will see.&nbsp; Thus defining Benny Hinn's 
      views on any given point is like trying to pick up mercury with your 
      fingers; it easily slips away if one is not prepared to pick it up with 
      the proper tools.&nbsp; What Hinn is teaching now, may not be what Hinn 
      has taught in the past, and there is no guarantee that it will be what he 
      will teach in the future.&nbsp; In fact, the initial outcry regarding his 
      book <EM>Good Morning Holy Spirit</EM>, is indicative of this, as Hinn's 
      publisher felt compelled to change questionable doctrinal assertions in 
      the book between the seventh and eighth printings without printing a 
      retraction or giving public notice of the changes, something which I 
      consider to be patently dishonest.3</SPAN></SPAN></P>

      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">There is a striking parallel in 
      the teachings of many of America's televangelists with ancient 
      philosophical system of gnosticism, and Benny Hinn is no exception.&nbsp; 
      Many of his serious doctrinal errors are largely the outworking of his own 
      neo-gnostic world and life view.&nbsp; The gnostic lineage in Hinn's 
      thought is readily apparent in two ways.&nbsp; The first is in Hinn's 
      description of created reality, wherein God exists at the top of a ladder 
      of being, closest to pure spirit, with Satan at the bottom, closest to 
      matter.&nbsp; The second indication of Hinn's gnostic orientation can be 
      found in his exceptional claims to be a <EM>gnostikoi</EM> or enlightened 
      teacher, who claims a great insight into the divine, beyond that of his 
      followers or other ministers and ministries.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Hinn's gnostic conception of reality is clearly developed in an early 
      work, <EM>War in the Heavenlies,</EM> where Hinn lays out an overtly 
      gnostic chain of being as the nature of reality:</SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P class=style15><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
        style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">There is only one step from 
        the natural world to the invisible world.&nbsp; Visualize a ladder from 
        God to Satan, the invisible through the visible or earthly into the 
        invisible.&nbsp; At the top of this line is God.&nbsp; Under God are 
        angels.&nbsp; Then a thin dividing line and we find spirit filled 
        people, then average Christians, carnal Christians, and then the 
        division of the Blood line.&nbsp; Then a moral sinner, average sinner, 
        demon-possessed sinner, a dividing line, then demons and Satan.&nbsp; 
        Only a thin dividing `line' separates the seen from the unseen, the 
        natural from the spiritual, the earthly from the heavenly.<SPAN

      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">It is clear that Hinn has 
      divided reality into various levels, with God at the top of the ladder of 
      being and Satan on the bottom rung.&nbsp; This means that humanity is 
      caught in a cosmic tug-of-war, stuck between the powers of good and 
      evil.&nbsp; As you may know, the entire epistle of I John was likely 
      written to combat this same anti-Christian system of thought.&nbsp; 
      Instead of employing the classical Biblical categories of sin and grace, 
      and giving proper consideration to the Biblical doctrine of the 
      Creator-creature distinction in describing humanities' predicament and 
      ultimate redemption, Hinn recasts the entire Christian faith purely in 
      terms of spiritual warfare along this chain of being, invisible to the 
      naked eye of most everyone except, of course, Benny Hinn, the "enlightened 
      one."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The second aspect of this gnostic system is found in Hinn's claim to be an 
      individual with God's extraordinary favor, a <EM>gnostikoi</EM>, as proved 
      by his professed dramatic encounters with Jesus Christ.&nbsp; In fact, 
      Hinn's entire ministry is based upon his claims to receive divine and 
      angelic visitations, "revelation knowledge," as well as out-of-body 
      experiences.&nbsp; Hinn's rise to influence is largely due to the fact 
      that many of his followers believe these sensational claims to be true, 
      and accept them as the basis for Hinn's authority (his "anointing") to 
      minister in the mode in which he does.&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=style14 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Hinn's first reported divine visitation was when he was just eleven years 
      old.&nbsp; At the time, Hinn lived in Jaffa, Israel.&nbsp; "I really 
      believe it was the moment that God began moving in my life....I saw Jesus 
      walk into my bedroom.&nbsp; He was wearing a robe that was whiter than 
      white and a deep red mantle was draped over the robe.&nbsp; I saw his 
      hair.&nbsp; I looked into his eyes.&nbsp; I saw the nail prints in his 
      hands."&nbsp; Hinn concludes, "I saw everything."5&nbsp; A second 
      visitation came while Benny was in high school and living in 
      Toronto.&nbsp; One night, Hinn claims "I had an encounter with the 
      Lord.&nbsp; He came into my room and visited me -- this time in the form 
      of an unforgettable dream."&nbsp; This dream, in which Hinn recounts how 
      he was delivered from being bound to others shackled as prisoners and who 
      were heading into a deep, black pit, was but a precursor to an even 
      greater experience which followed the next day during a prayer time with 
      Hinn's pesky Christian friends.&nbsp; "Suddenly I saw Jesus with my own 
      eyes.&nbsp; It happened in a moment of time.&nbsp; There he was.&nbsp; 
      Jesus."6&nbsp; Those around him could not, of course, see or hear what was 
      going on.&nbsp; But Benny Hinn, however, knew exactly what had happened to 
      him.&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=style14 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      It was a trip with a friend to a Kathryn Kuhlman crusade in Pittsburgh, 
      that Benny Hinn claims changed his life.&nbsp; Experiencing strange 
      "vibrations" while waiting outside for the doors to open to get into the 
      building, Benny recounts uncontrollable "shaking" once the meeting 
      began.&nbsp; After Kathryn Kuhlman appeared, Hinn experienced a dramatic 
      conversion during the time of worship.&nbsp; Not quite sure what had 
      happened to him, Hinn tells of how he later prayed, "I've got to have this 
      (what Kathryn Kuhlman had)."&nbsp; That night Benny had yet another 
      experience, this time, after speaking to the Holy Spirit as a 
      person.&nbsp; "Then, like a jolt of electricity my body began to vibrate 
      all over -- exactly as it had through the two hours I waited to get into 
      the church."7&nbsp; This culminated with an eight-hour experience with the 
      Holy Spirit, apparently the next night, in which Benny's room was "full of 
      glory."8&nbsp; Obviously, Benny Hinn's experiences exceed that of the 
      normal conversion, and the truthfulness of these experiences become the 
      basis for believing the sensational claims that he makes 
      elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=style14 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Hinn additionally claims to have seen angelic visitors, and to have heard 
      them conversing with one another.&nbsp; "I don't know whether you have 
      ever seen angels, but I have....Not only did I see angels, I even heard 
      them speak to one another....I not only saw angels, I heard them talking 
      among themselves."9&nbsp; Hinn also claims to have had out of body 
      experiences, which he interprets as the same type of event that the 
      Apostle Paul experienced when he was caught up into the third heaven (II 
      Corinthians 12:2).&nbsp; While sleeping, Hinn describes how he was 
      awakened by a black and evil figure who had entered his room and who was 
      intent on choking him.&nbsp; "I screamed out, 'Lord help me'....The second 
      I said 'Lord help me' the most unusual thing happened.&nbsp; In an instant 
      I was out of body.&nbsp; I assure you I was out of my body."10&nbsp; 
      Pleading with the reader to believe him, Hinn adds apostolic testimony 
      which supposedly supports his claim.&nbsp; "[Paul] did not know whether he 
      was in the body or out of it.&nbsp; Well I knew.&nbsp; I was out of my 
      body.&nbsp; I came out of my body in a split moment....I had this 
      experience, please believe me."11&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">Who can argue with a man who 
      experiences direct visitations from Jesus, sees and hears angels, has out 
      of body experiences and claims direct revelations from God?&nbsp; If Benny 
      Hinn has experienced these things, is he not a spokesman for God?&nbsp; 
      The answer to this question is a resounding <EM>"no"</EM> when we discover 
      that Benny Hinn, as a supposed divine spokesman, rejects the Biblical 
      doctrine of the Trinity, the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as God incarnate, 
      among other grievous doctrinal errors.&nbsp; We would do well to remind

      is, as we have seen, a somewhat popular dogma taught by Bible teachers 
      like Jimmy Swaggart, Hinn's formulation of this takes on a new

      <EM>one</EM> in substance, and <EM>three</EM> in person.&nbsp; Benny Hinn 
      abandons this formula by insisting upon defining the persons in the 
      Godhead in such a way as to destroy the idea of God existing in only one 
      substance.&nbsp; For Hinn, God is not one in <EM>substance</EM> at all, 
      but only one in <EM>purpose</EM>.&nbsp; Hinn writes of the Godhead, "what 
      is true about one does not necessarily apply to all three.&nbsp; They are

      are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.&nbsp; And there are 
      diversities of activities, but the same God who works in all."&nbsp; This 
      text is used to set out how the oneness of God is economic (characteristic

      In order to interpret Paul in this fashion, and to make him out to be a 
      fellow tri-theist, Hinn must reject what orthodox Christians have 
      considered the essential element to make sense of the Biblical data 
      describing God as existing in three distinct persons.&nbsp; This is the 
      fundamental point that the three persons of the Godhead are one in purpose 
      <EM>because</EM> they are one in substance.&nbsp; The Scriptures 
      repeatedly declare that there is only one God, and that each of the three 
      persons of the Trinity mentioned in the Scriptures - the Father, the Son 
      and the Holy Spirit - are each called God.&nbsp; If these persons are not 
      one in substance, then logically they are three distinct gods, each with 
      their own unique substances.&nbsp; This reduces Christianity to 
      polytheism.&nbsp; Benny Hinn, therefore, is not orthodox in his views on 
      the Trinity.&nbsp; He leaves us with three distinct gods, who are each 
      triune (with body, soul and spirit), and who do not share the same common 
      substance, but are only one in purpose.&nbsp; Hinn's "god" therefore, is 
      three in substance and nine in person.&nbsp; This is simply nonsense, for 
      it amounts to tri-theism. </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">Notice that in Hinn's mind, 
      Jesus is <EM>not</EM> the unique incarnate God-man.&nbsp; In orthodox 
      Christianity, Jesus is seen as one person with two distinct natures - one 
      fully divine nature and one fully human nature, which exist together in 
      one person through the hypostatic union, without division, change, 
      separation or confusion.&nbsp; Since, in Benny Hinn's scheme, believers 
      are supposedly just like Jesus as to their own new natures by virtue of 
      partaking of the divine nature, there are several logical options that may 
      be exercised to solve the dilemma that orthodox Christian doctrine poses 
      for someone like Hinn.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=style14 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      In exercising the first option, Jesus' divine nature must be re-defined so 
      that it is possible for humans to partake of the same divine nature that 
      Jesus had once we become Christian believers.&nbsp; This means that Jesus' 
      divinity must be transferable, or mutable in some sense. &nbsp;This option 
      by itself is a rejection of the divinity of Christ, for how is it possible 
      for eternal God to create a second God, since something that is created 
      cannot be divine by definition?&nbsp; As the Nicene Creed declares, Jesus' 
      divine nature is eternal, being of one substance with the Father.&nbsp; 
      Historic Christianity has always argued that God is immutable.&nbsp; That 
      is, God cannot change either in His being, His attributes or His 
      will.&nbsp; Any change related to God, such as in creation, or in the 
      Incarnation, is change that is external to God Himself, rather than 
      involving an internal change within the essence of the Godhead.&nbsp; To 
      argue that God's essence changes internally, as Hinn does, (in this and in 
      other places that we will see below), is to deny the concept of God as 
      being free from defect and, therefore, intrinsically perfect.&nbsp; In 
      Word-Faith theology, God is not perfect as He is.&nbsp; Rather, He is 
      always in the process of becoming something else, in effect multiplying 
      his essence each time He produces an additional "little god" each time a 
      new believer is deified.&nbsp; If this option is exercised, God's being 
      itself must be seen to exist in a state of constant change.&nbsp; 
      </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      A second option, is that believers themselves must somehow be raised to 
      the level of the divine in their own "new" natures, so that they can 
      become just like Jesus.&nbsp; This means that each individual believer 
      must be deified in some sense.&nbsp; If this option is exercised, one must 
      conclude that every time someone becomes a Christian, their essential 
      human nature is exchanged for a new divine nature, the same as Jesus 
      had.&nbsp; Thus, Christians cease to be truly human after their 
      conversion, since metaphysically speaking, they exchange their humanity 
      for a new form of divinity.&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      The little gods proponents opt for a position which is a kind of 
      <EM>tertium quid</EM>, a third option that combines elements of both 
      possibilities expressed above.&nbsp; Jesus' two unique natures are 
      rejected in this understanding, in that Jesus is not fully God in the 
      classical sense described above, and because man is elevated to the status 
      of a little god who has the same metaphysical nature that Jesus had while 
      he was on earth.&nbsp; Christ's unique divine nature is destroyed, and 
      man's unique human nature is deified.&nbsp; In effect, we lose both the 
      true deity of Jesus Christ, and the true humanity of the Christian 
      believer.&nbsp; Hinn concludes, "we are all little gods running around on 
      the earth."&nbsp; Since Jesus is <EM>the</EM> Messiah, and since he is the 
      pattern for us in the new creation, we are all therefore, ourselves 
      "messiahs."&nbsp; This means that when we are born again, we receive the 
      same kind of divine nature that Jesus had.&nbsp; This is a complete 
      rejection of the Biblical doctrine of Christ's incarnation.&nbsp; 
      Ironically, Hinn's doctrine does have some Biblical support, the only 
      problem for Hinn is that it comes from the mouth of the serpent in the 
      garden, who tells Eve, "you will be like God, knowing good and evil 
      (Genesis 3:4)."&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      In Hinn's neo-gnostic Christology, Jesus cannot be the unique Son of God, 
      but is instead presented as a kind of super "spirit-filled man" with a 
      divine nature.&nbsp; Hinn writes, "On earth, <EM>Jesus was nothing less 
      than a total man</EM>.&nbsp; He did not have `revelation knowledge' 
      without the voice of the Spirit.&nbsp; And he could not move unless the 
      Holy Spirit moved him (italics in the original)."18&nbsp; According to 
      Hinn, while Jesus was on earth, he was dependent upon revelation 
      knowledge, a concept which is totally without Biblical support.&nbsp; We 
      know that Jesus' public ministry began after his baptism by John in which 
      the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus in power, preparing him for public 
      ministry (Matthew 3:13-17).&nbsp; But to argue, as Hinn does, that Jesus 
      was powerless apart from this event, is an implicit denial of the fact 
      that Jesus was God <EM>and</EM> man by virtue of his incarnation, not 
      through the descent of the Holy Spirit upon him at his baptism.&nbsp; 
      Hinn's argument here has much more in common with the ancient heresy of 
      adoptionism, wherein the man Jesus is adopted by God to be the son of God, 
      through the subsequent empowerment by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Hinn makes 
      this point quite clearly:&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      really tempted, and yet as God incarnate and without a sinful nature, how 
      could he have actually sinned.&nbsp; Christians can and do disagree about

      the issue.&nbsp; The real issue is the fact that Christ's uniqueness does 
      not flow from his incarnation, but from his empowerment by the Holy 
      Spirit.&nbsp; According to Hinn, Jesus is not unique as to his divine 
      nature as the eternal Son of God, who takes upon himself a true human 
      nature.&nbsp; Jesus is merely the pattern for all believers who come after 
      him, who can now partake of the same divine nature as Jesus did by virtue

      What is perhaps the most troubling aspect about this is that Hinn claims 
      that the source of his teaching and views on the subject came to him

      himself revealed the little gods doctrine to him.&nbsp; In a tape series 
      entitled, <EM>Our Position in Christ</EM>, Hinn declares, "Now are you

      aside his divine form....Why?&nbsp; So one day I would be clothed with the 
      divine form."20&nbsp; Are we really to believe that God would reveal to 
      Benny Hinn that Jesus would lay aside the divine form and thereby cease to 
      be God?&nbsp; And do we really believe that we become a "god" by taking on 
      the divine form ourselves that Jesus kenotically set aside?&nbsp; This 
      raises the rather interesting question, "Can God reveal obvious 
      heresy?"&nbsp; But if this was not God speaking to Benny Hinn, who was 
      it?&nbsp; The choices are few.&nbsp; Either this did not happen at all and 
      Hinn is not telling the truth (and only God knows the answer to this for 
      sure!), or that whoever, or whatever, revealed this to Benny Hinn was 
      working for the other side!&nbsp; In any case, the dangers in deriving

      the doctrine of salvation is also formulated in overtly neo-gnostic 
      categories, which leaves Hinn preaching what the Apostle Paul labeled as 
      another gospel.&nbsp; As we will see, salvation is not spoken of in 
      orthodox terms, wherein Christ dies for our sins, in that <EM>His</EM> 
      sacrifice pays for the guilt of our sins which are imputed or credited to 
      Him, so that God can acquit our guilt, and impute (or credit) the 
      righteousness of Christ to us.&nbsp; According to Hinn, salvation from sin 
      is the result of an exchange of metaphysical natures, wherein we are 
      deified by receiving the divine nature of Jesus.&nbsp; Consider the 
      following comments from Hinn:</SPAN></SPAN></P>

        What did you say?&nbsp; What blasphemy is this?&nbsp; No, you hear 
        this!&nbsp; He did not take my sin, he became my sin!&nbsp; Sin is the 
        nature of hell.&nbsp; Sin is what made Satan.&nbsp; Jesus said I'll be

        it!&nbsp; I won't just take part of it, I'll be the totality of

      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">Hinn rightly acknowledges the 
      blasphemous ring to his words, for quite simply, Benny Hinn openly 
      declares that the Lord Jesus Christ became one with Satan.&nbsp; Benny is 
      right about one thing.&nbsp; This doctrine is utter blasphemy!&nbsp; Again 
      notice the category that is in view.&nbsp; Jesus "did not take my sin, he 
      became my sin!"&nbsp; Christ does not have our guilt imputed to him, 
      instead Jesus takes on the nature of Satan so that we can have the nature 
      of God transferred to us.&nbsp; In the Word-Faith theology, God's saving 
      act in Jesus Christ does not take place upon the cross of Calvary, but in 
      the pit of hell.&nbsp; In this scheme, Jesus' death on the cross is but 
      the preliminary to the main event, Jesus' descent into hell, where the 
      real action takes place.&nbsp; For it is in hell ("the lowest place") 
      where Jesus receives the nature of Satan, so we can partake of the nature 
      of God.&nbsp; According to Hinn, sin is not a condition of the human heart 
      as is taught in Scripture, but is instead the actual partaking of the 
      nature of Satan.&nbsp; This satanic nature must be exchanged for a new 
      divine nature if we are to be saved.&nbsp; Thus salvation is not a 
      reckoning of guilt and righteousness between Christ and the believer, but 
      an exchange of natures from Christ to Satan, and from Christ to 
      us.&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>

      In another instance, Hinn describes the doctrine of justification in 
      categories totally outside the Biblical and Protestant notion of 
      "justification by grace alone through faith alone, on account of Christ 
      alone."&nbsp; Hinn has stated, "Justification deals with what I am going 
      to do.&nbsp; Now watch this!&nbsp; This does not mean that I can go on 
      sinning because justification is dependant on obedience.&nbsp; If I obey 
      God, I am justified."23&nbsp; If this is not a doctrine of justification 
      by works, I don't know what is!&nbsp; There is no mention of faith as the 
      instrument of justification, because in Word-Faith theology, faith is not 
      defined as trust in Christ.&nbsp; Faith is instead seen as the 
      <EM>abracadabra</EM> which releases the power of God.&nbsp; It is 
      important to notice that Hinn completely rejects the Biblical concept of 
      salvation by grace through faith.&nbsp; Instead, Hinn declares, that he is 
      justified by his obedience, rather than by receiving the saving benefits 
      of Christ through faith alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <P class=style14><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">Once again we can see how Hinn 
      twists a Biblical concept into a neo-gnostic pretzel.&nbsp; In Paul's 
      thinking, reconciliation refers to a restoration of a right (peaceful) 
      relationship between two estranged parties.&nbsp; In Romans 5, this 
      estrangement is clearly bi-directional, from God to man, and from man to 
      God.&nbsp; Christ's death removes the source of the enmity between these 
      two parties, which is man's sinful rebellion from God.&nbsp; But notice 
      carefully how Hinn completely distorts this whole concept.&nbsp; Hinn 
      argues that reconciliation "doesn't deal with my problem," that is with my 
      sin, but instead "it deals with my likeness."&nbsp; Hinn is clearly 
      referring to his doctrine of man's fallen nature, which in Word-Faith 
      theology became satanic after the fall of Adam.&nbsp; In effect, Hinn is 
      saying "I don't need to be restored to a new relationship with God, and 
      have the guilt of my sin removed, I need to become a god just like 
      Jesus!"&nbsp; Once this has happened, God is now Hinn's daddy and Satan 
      can no longer accuse him, since he's "already like Jesus."&nbsp; This 
      "exchange of natures" doctrine is completely foreign to Holy Scripture, 
      and as we have seen above is nothing short of blasphemy.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

      publicized interview given for the October 28, 1991 edition of 
      <EM>Christianity Today</EM>, Benny Hinn frankly admitted the controversial 
      nature of many of his doctrinal assertions.&nbsp; In fact, in that 
      interview Hinn completely retracted his "nine of them" comments regarding 
      the Trinity, calling his own statements on the subject "stupid."&nbsp; He 
      very candidly declared that "I really no longer believe the faith 
      message.&nbsp; I don't think it adds up."25&nbsp; Hinn even apologized for 
      threatening his critics with a "Holy Ghost machine gun," and presented 
      himself as a humble, and "willing to be corrected" young minister of the 
      gospel.&nbsp; Distancing himself from his earlier claims to be a prophet, 
      Hinn stated his intention to shun such a label and concluded that "the 
      only revelation knowledge is already in the Bible."26&nbsp; Many Christian 
      leaders undoubtedly breathed a huge sigh of relief at seeing Hinn's 
      remarks.&nbsp; "Maybe he is for real," many of them concluded.&nbsp; Many 
      of those that I talked with who had been following Hinn's ministry for 
      some time with a critical eye to Hinn's orthodoxy, genuinely hoped and 
      prayed that a wayward brother had been restored to the truth.&nbsp; Others 
      were more hesitant to take Benny Hinn at his word.&nbsp; If what he said

      weeks <EM>after</EM> Hinn had been interviewed by <EM>Christianity 
      Today</EM> and had given his supposed recantation, Hinn and Trinity 
      Broadcasting Network President Paul Crouch demonstrated the cavalier 
      attitude that those in the Word-Faith movement have toward anyone who 
      expresses concerns about the Trinitarian errors that they espouse.&nbsp; 
      In this case, what was being discussed on the <EM>Praise the Lord</EM> 
      show that evening were the accusations made against Benny Hinn for 
      teaching tri-theism.&nbsp; While Crouch continued his on-going diatribe 
      against those who evaluate the doctrinal content of those regularly 
      featured on TBN by Holy Scripture, Crouch complained that the "heresy 
      hunters" were again after Benny Hinn.&nbsp; Hinn then took the opportunity 
      given him by Crouch to express his primary purpose in writing <EM>Good 
      Morning Holy Spirit</EM>, which was "merely to introduce the Holy Spirit 
      to people as a personal being."&nbsp; This is certainly a noble goal, and 
      one with which Holy Scripture agrees.&nbsp; But notice carefully, how this 
      noble task quickly becomes a platform to once again reject orthodox

      defending Hinn, the discussion immediately moved on to an unashamed 
      exposition of tri-theism from Genesis 18, where the three men in that text 
      were interpreted as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, each with bodies and 
      physical form.29&nbsp; Keep in mind that these remarks were made just two

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, Hinn has not 
      retracted any of the errors in his controversial book <EM>Good Morning 
      Holy Spirit</EM> (either in the original edition, or in the revised 
      one).&nbsp; And, as we have seen, Hinn is not orthodox in his views on the 
      Holy Trinity, not only as proved by the doctrine taught in his books, but 
      also by his comments made on TBN within two weeks of supposedly 
      recanting!&nbsp; Hinn may purport to be introducing the Holy Spirit as a 
      person to the average Christian.&nbsp; But in actuality he is introducing 
      his readers to the one Paul called "another spirit" (II Corinthians 
      11:4).&nbsp; For the spirit to which Hinn introduces us has a body and a 
      soul, which are human, not divine properties, and Hinn's spirit is not of 
      one substance with the Father and the Son.&nbsp; The tragedy in all of 
      this, is that this does not bother Paul Crouch in the least, for he states 
      that none of the points raised matter, since "it doesn't affect our 
      salvation."&nbsp; The very fact that Hinn is being questioned at all, is 
      interpreted by Crouch as proof of an attack of Satan upon both TBN and 
      Benny Hinn.&nbsp; In other words, doctrinal accuracy and orthodoxy do not 
      matter, and any criticism against the Word-Faith teachers is simply 
      Satanic opposition to their message.&nbsp; The fact that they are 
      challenged at all, is presented as proof that they are 
      right!</SPAN></SPAN></P>

      Since actions do speak louder than words, it should be pointed out, that 
      to my knowledge, none of Hinn's heretical teaching tapes have been pulled 
      from Hinn's ministry tape catalogue, and Hinn is still seen daily on 
      national television continuing to receive revelations from God, as 
      multitudes who continue to attend his crusades clamor to be healed.&nbsp; 
      In addition, Hinn has failed to meet with his critics, as he stated he 
      would do, and in fact, those with whom he promised to meet for 
      reconciliation have instead been met with threats of litigation from 
      Hinn's lawyer when they seek out meetings as Hinn had

      Among Hinn's most ridiculous post-recantation utterances were his comments 
      that Adam could fly and that he could also swim underwater without ever 
      losing his breath.&nbsp; In an appearance on TBN, in which Hinn even 
      startled Jan Crouch with his assertions that the Hebrew word for dominion 
      indicated that in order for Adam to take dominion over a thing, Adam had 
      to do whatever it was that the thing over which he had taken dominion 
      could do.&nbsp; "Since Adam had dominion over the birds of the air, he 
      certainly had to fly.&nbsp; Since Adam was given dominion over the fish of 
      the sea, accordingly, Adam had to be able to swim underwater without 
      losing his breath."30&nbsp; Hinn claimed, of course, that God had revealed 
      this to him.&nbsp; My five-year old son was watching the video tape with 
      me and remarked, "Dad that sounds more like Superman than Adam."&nbsp; Out 
      of the mouths of babes!&nbsp; Amazingly, it is indeed true that in Hinn's 
      theology, both Adam and Jesus have more in common with fictional 
      super-heroes than they do with their Biblical counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      All of this has tragic consequences, for what Crouch and Hinn ignore is 
      the fact that we cannot be saved by Benny Hinn's other Jesus, his other 
      spirit or his other gospel, since the three gods given us by Hinn are 
      clearly not the Triune God found in Holy Scripture.&nbsp; Despite Paul 
      Crouch's objections to the contrary, this is not a game that theologians 
      play to give them something to do.&nbsp; This is about the gospel and 
      "contending for the faith, once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 
      3).&nbsp; While Paul Crouch may not feel that this is important, our 
      eternal destiny rides on our orthodoxy on this exact point!&nbsp; In his 
      first epistle, John warned Christians to "test the spirits to see whether 
      they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the 
      world" (I John 4:1).&nbsp; But how are we to do this?&nbsp; John tells us

      the historic understanding of the deity of Christ, and teaches a doctrine 
      of salvation which is clearly another Gospel.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

      A second factor which must be considered are the warnings given us in Holy 
      Scripture about the signs and conditions during the last days.&nbsp; In II 
      Thessalonians, Paul warns of a great apostasy.&nbsp; "The coming of the 
      lawless one," who many believe will be the final culmination of the spirit 
      of antichrist whom John describes as anyone who denies that Jesus is God 
      in human flesh (I John 4:1-3), "will be in accordance with the work of 
      Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles" (II Thessalonians 
      2:9).&nbsp; Paul plainly warns that immediately before the end, 
      counterfeit miracles will be in open display.&nbsp; These false miracles 
      and signs that will "deceive those who are perishing.&nbsp; They perish 
      because they refused to love the truth and so be saved" (v. 10).&nbsp; 
      Paul concludes this warning with one of the most frightening passages in 
      Holy Scripture: "For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so 
      that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have 
      not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness (v. 11-12)."&nbsp; 
      Those who perish are those who do not love the truth, but instead love the 
      perversion, which is based on false signs and wonders.&nbsp; 
      </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: times"><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: verdana">These are frightening words and 
      must be heeded.&nbsp; It is my prayer that God grant Benny Hinn repentance 
      from his rejection of the truth before it is too late.</SPAN></SPAN></P>

        United for Reformation. That Mr. Hinn is referring to Mike Horton is 
        likely indicated by the fact that Mike was an ordained clergyman in the 
        Reformed Episcopal Church, and was pictured in an article on The Agony 
        of Deceit, in USA Today (Wednesday, January 31, 1990, p. 7A), wearing a 
        clerical collar. Hinnís reference to ìyour collar on your neck,î was 
        probably in reference to Mike and The Agony of Deceit. The Christian 
        Research Institute (CRI), located Southern California, has also been 
        very critical of Hinn's ministry, and it is possible that Hinn's remarks 
        were aimed at them as well.<BR>13. Benny Hinn Broadcast, recorded
