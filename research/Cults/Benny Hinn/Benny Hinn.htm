      <P>It is important to recognize two indisputable facts about Benny Hinn's 
      ministry: (1) He has no formal theological education nor has he attended 
      even a non-accredited Bible School. (2) He is part of the Word of Faith 
      Movement as opposed to the Signs &amp; Wonders Movement. There are some 
      distinct differences between the two. Benny has made the statements that 
      he visits the tombs of K. Khulman and A. Simple MacPhearson to get a 
      recharge of his anointing. That alone is pretty spooky stuff folks!</P>
      <P>The following two articles come from 
      <STRONG>http://rapidnet.com/~jbeard</STRONG> Biblical Discernment Ministry 
      is an excellent site for reference material on individual ministries. They 
      provide a free newsletter as well. </P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>Pros &amp; Cons*</STRONG></P>
      <P align=left>Benny Hinn, pastor of Orlando Christian Center in Orlando, 
      Florida, is one of the most prolific voices in the Christian media today. 
      His book, <EM>Good Morning, Holy Spirit</EM>, has remained on the 
      bestseller list since its release in October, 1990, having sold 
      approximately one-quarter million copies within the first few months. As 
      of this writing (May, 1992), it is still number one among paperback books 
      according to Christian Reading, one of the major trade publications for 
      Christian bookstores, distributors, and publishers. </P>
      <P>Due to some rather startling statements in the original edition of 
      <EM>Good Morning,Holy Spirit</EM>, Hinn came under fire from a few 
      organizations that perceived serious doctrinal discrepancies in Hinn's 
      theology. </P>
      <P>The most public criticism of Hinn's teachings came from the Christian 
      Research Institute which took Hinn and his publisher, Thomas Nelson 
      Company, to task for what CRI perceived as heretical statements. This 
      resulted in Nelson revising the questionable material in its later 
      releases and Hinn apologizing and promising not to promote in the future 
      the teachings under question. However, Thomas Nelson Company spokesman 
      Bruce Barbour (publisher) and Bill Watkins (senior editor) as well as 
      Hinn, say that the theology expressed in the original edition has not been 
      changed but merely "clarified." </P>
      <P>Yet Hinn does claim to have changed his mind about other teachings not 
      dealt with in Good Morning,Holy Spirit, most notably the 
      "Jesus-died-spiritually" heresy that has characterized the theology of 
      word-faith teachers from E. W. Kenyon through Kenneth Hagin, Kenneth 
      Copeland, and others. </P>
      <P>In spite of these developments, many Christians are still questioning 
      where Benny Hinn is coming from. And in view of his continued popularity 
      within the Christian marketplace, we felt that an analysis of Hinn's 
      teachings is in order. We also feel that much of the criticism leveled 
      against Hinn has been based not on scriptural truth, but upon 
      orthodoxy--traditionally accepted understanding of issues not necessarily 
      addressed in clear terms by Scripture. It is our hope to set these 
      differences apart. </P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>The Man</STRONG> </P>
      <P>Benny Hinn was born in 1953 in Israel to a Greek father and an Armenian 
      mother. He was raised in the Greek Orthodox religion. Hinn claims that 
      while he was a young boy of 11 years of age in Israel, God first appeared 
      to him, and has been appearing to him ever since. At the age of 14, Hinn 
      moved to Canada with his parents. While attending high school there he 
      says he had visions of himself preaching before huge crowds. He also 
      claims that God healed him of a stuttering problem so that he could become 
      a preacher. </P>
      <P>Yet in spite of the visions and God's appearing to him for several 
      years, Hinn marks the year of his being born again as 1972 when he was 
      about 20 years old. It was at a Kathryn Kuhlman service the following year 
      that he says he had a "profound spiritual experience." </P>
      <P>Hinn readily admits that much of the misunderstanding that has arisen 
      from his teachings is the result of his lack of formal Bible training. In 
      fact, almost immediately after his having been "born again," Hinn says, 
      "The Lord launched me into ministry almost overnight." </P>
      <P>In spite of these circumstances, Hinn founded his present church, 
      Orlando Christian Center, in 1983. Beginning with just a few hundred 
      members, that church now boasts an average weekly attendance of over 
      7,000. In addition, Hinn conducts worldwide crusades and has a daily 
      television program that airs over the Trinity Broadcasting Network, headed 
      by Jan and Paul Crouch. </P>
      <P>Although Hinn states that his ministry throughout the 1970s was shaped 
      by the writings of men like D. L. Moody and R. A. Torrey, he was a strong 
      proponent of "revelation knowledge"--new truths revealed to him by God 
      directly--that were not contained within Scripture. Only recently has he 
      stated that he will no longer claim revelation knowledge as the authority 
      for his teachings. </P>
      <P>More than this, Hinn claims to actually be a channel for God--that God 
      enters him and takes over his mind and tongue to the point where he is 
      unaware of what he has said. After his sermon on December 31, 1989, at 
      Orlando Christian Center, during which he gave several future prophecies, 
      Hinn expressed that he was drunk--presumably on the Holy Spirit--and asked 
      someone to tell him what he had just said. </P>
      <P>It became evident in the early 1980s that the word-faith teachings of 
      Kenyon, Hagin, Copeland, and others began to have an enormous impact on 
      Hinn. But shortly after his encounter with critics of his book, Hinn 
      announced that he no longer hold to the word-faith teachings. </P>
      <P>As Hinn's popularity increased due to his television program and the 
      runaway sales of Good Morning Holy Spirit, his teachings came under close 
      scrutiny by several apologetics ministries. The Christian Research 
      Institute became especially alarmed by Hinn's references to the God-head 
      that seemed at best unorthodox and at worst heretical. On both his 
      television program and in his book, Hinn asserted that all three persons 
      of the Triune Godhead have their own independent bodies, souls, and 
      spirits, as well as wills (10/13/90, TBN). </P>
      <P>What alarmed most critics of Hinn is his statement that "there are nine 
      of them [Spirits of God]." Some took this to mean that there are nine 
      persons, which is not what Hinn was saying. "Nine of them" referred to the 
      separate elements of the Trinity: three bodies, souls, and spirits. </P>
      <P>Hinn is clearly guilty of teaching as "revelation knowledge" (God's 
      Truth imparted to him personally) something that is not clearly supported 
      by Scripture. As such, he has established in the minds of those who trust 
      him a personal belief as if it were authoritative truth, which it is not. 
      </P>
      <P>While Hinn's teachings on the Trinity have captured the forefront of 
      the debate between himself and the apologist ministries, there are other 
      serious issues that have taken a back seat to the questionable Trinitarian 
      controversy--issues that truly do lead toward heresy. </P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>A God-Man</STRONG> </P>
      <P>Hinn teaches that when one is born again by faith in Jesus, he is given 
      a new spirit man that wasn't there before--a spirit man that is divine in 
      nature and God-like (Our Position in Christ [sermon tape]). </P>
      <P>Throughout his dissertations, Hinn avows that the Bible says what he 
      says. <STRONG>But his ploy is the same as that of false teachers, which is 
      to pull a proof text out of context and apply it to their personal 
      interpretation which they claim has been given by direct revelation from 
      God</STRONG>. Where in Scripture is it found that some "spirit-man" 
      distinct from us, comes into us? The Holy Spirit comes into us, but Hinn 
      isn't speaking of the Holy Spirit, because he says this spirit-man was 
      "created before the foundation of the world." </P>
      <P>Hinn also cites Ephesians 1 as a proof text, but this is a gross error. 
      It does speak of our being chosen in Christ before the foundation of the 
      world; nowhere does it mention a God-like "spirit-man," let alone one 
      distinct from us. </P>
      <P>In another statement, Hinn asserts that though we are not Almighty God 
      Himself, nevertheless, we are now divine (12/1/90, TBN). Hinn continues by 
      denying that he is saying we are God, but affirming that we are children 
      of God (elsewhere he asserts that we are gods). </P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>Jesus Took On Satan's Nature</STRONG> (push to 
      read ICCDM article<A 
      href="http://www.discernment.org/faithhealers/jesus.htm"><IMG height=14 
      src="" width=14 border=0></A> ) </P>
      <P>One of the popular word faith teachings is that Jesus took on the 
      nature of Satan and had to be born again. This doctrine is intrinsically 
      linked to the "Jesus died spiritually" heresy which postulates that Jesus' 
      shed blood was insufficient for the redemption of man; He had to suffer at 
      Satan's hands in Hell and be born again as the first man to conquer death. 
      Hinn also teaches this heresy: </P>
      <P>"<STRONG>He [Jesus] who is righteous by choice said, 'The only way I 
      can stop sin is by Me becoming it. I can't just stop it by letting it 
      touch Me; I and it must become one.' Hear this! He who is the nature of 
      God became the nature of Satan where He became sin!</STRONG>" (TBN, 
      12/1/90). </P>
      <P>In this one statement, Hinn manages to convey three distinct errors 
      concerning Jesus, to which we must answer the following: 1) Jesus is not 
      righteous by choice, but by nature; 2) Jesus never said these words, 
      either in Scripture or to Benny Hinn personally, because they are 
      unbiblical; 3) Jesus' nature is constant; even God cannot change His 
      nature from God to something else. When He became a man, the Word of God 
      co-mingled his divine nature with the flesh of man, not angels; but that 
      is the limit of His approaching anything like assuming Satan's nature. 
      This idea is a first-rate heresy which, drawn to its conclusion in the 
      supposed spiritual death of Jesus denies the blood of Christ and damns 
      those who teach and believe it unless they repent. It is a different 
      gospel from that given through Scripture. </P>
      <P>In spite of Hinn's professional rejection of the word-faith message, he 
      hasn't given up on it entirely. The word-faith message encompasses far 
      more that the "name it and claim it" foolishness. It is intrinsically 
      linked to the God-man-believer and Jesus-died-spiritually heresies, which 
      Hinn continues to espouse. It exalts man and denigrates Christ, as most 
      false teachings do. </P>
      <P>The problem with these and other teachings of Hinn is that he exhibits 
      the mindset of someone who "learned as he earned," strewing spiritual 
      wreckage in his path. Whatever comes to mind must be God's voice; after 
      all, Hinn believes himself a prophet of God. And woe to those who dare 
      challenge him. </P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>Blowing It</STRONG> </P>
      <P>One of the characteristics of Hinn's services has been his claim to 
      impart the Holy Spirit at will by blowing on people. He has been known to 
      wave his coat in the air, or to toss the Holy Spirit like a baseball at 
      the audience, causing entire sections to ostensibly swoon under the power 
      of God. Obviously God is at Hinn's disposal. And he doesn't mind being 
      made a spectacle in the process. </P>
      <P>The phenomenon known as being "slain in the Spirit" is a trademark of 
      modern charismatism. And while I would not say that God will or cannot 
      come upon someone with such a power, it becomes obvious that, coupled with 
      false teachings, the power transmitted by Hinn (if there is any power at 
      all) is not of God. In fact, it appears more a case of mass hysteria 
      entered into by people predisposed to fall for several reasons: 1) they 
      want the power of God no matter what; 2) they would be embarrassed not to 
      fall when everyone else around them is falling; 3) many have testified 
      that the person imparting the Holy Spirit pushed them down; 4) God might 
      allow and even grant such a "blessing" to entrench error in people's minds 
      who don't care about truth as much as they do about some supernatural 
      experience; 5) <STRONG>Satan and demons may duplicate such a phenomenon to 
      validate as truth the error of one's teachings</STRONG>. </P>
      <P>Finally, Hinn's errors are compounded by his continual extolling of the 
      virtues of the pope and Roman Catholicism, as if the errors of that church 
      are to be ignored in the interest of unity. In 1989, Hinn was a 
      participant in the move to grant to Pope John Paul II the "Prince of 
      Peace" award, instigated by Harold Bradesen. Receiving much flack for his 
      part in that award, Hinn recanted and withdrew his participation. </P>
      <P>*This material has been adapted/excerpted from a Media Spotlight 
      Special Report of May, 1992 (Albert James Dager, P.O. Box 290, Redmond, WA 
      98073). Biblical Discernment Ministries - 5/92 </P>
      <P><STRONG>Benny Hinn Repents--Again</STRONG> </P>
      <P>Benny Hinn is a 40-year old hyper-charismatic "signs &amp; wonders 
      healer," and the founder and pastor (1983) of the 7,000-plus membership 
      Orlando Christian Center in Orlando, Florida. He conducts worldwide 
      crusades and has a daily television program airing over the heretical 
      Trinity Broadcasting Network, headed by Jan and Paul Crouch. Hinn is also 
      a best selling author, the most popular of his books being the 10/90 book, 
      Good Morning, Holy Spirit , published by Thomas Nelson. This book is full 
      of heresies and blasphemies. </P>
      <P>Due to confrontations by biblical fundamentalists as well as by a 
      television tabloid journalism program, Hinn has "repented" now at least 
      three times, but each time he goes back to that from which he repented. He 
      says he no longer believes the "positive confession" he once taught. But 
      if that were true, he would oppose its teachings and teachers. Had he 
      really repented, Hinn would actively work to deliver his many thousands of 
      followers from these false doctrines, but he has not done so. In fact, he 
      is still in full fellowship with the positive confession leaders and 
      adherents. </P>
      <P>If Hinn were seriously concerned for truth, as he now claims to be, he 
      would recall his tapes and books that presented false teachings he says he 
      no longer believes. Instead, they are still being sold. In fact, his 
      "repentance" is deficient because it fails to admit the gravity of his 
      error. "I never taught heresy," Hinn insists. "I admit I taught some 
      things that were aberrant ... but I think heresy is too strong a word." 
      </P>
      <P>Actually, Hinn has taught much heresy. Even though Hinn claims to have 
      been saved at age 20, he declares that God first appeared to him when he 
      was 11, and has been appearing to him ever since. He also claims to be a 
      revelatory channel for God! In addition, Hinn literally rewrote Job 1:21, 
      changing "the Lord taketh away" to "the Lord never taketh away." There are 
      many examples, but here are a few of his other heretical teachings: </P>
      <P>"(1) Never, ever, ever go to the Lord and say, 'If it be thy will'; (2) 
      No Christian should ever be sick; (3) We Christians possess 'power in our 
      mouths' to heal or kill just as witches possess it; (4) Job tapped into 
      the negative side of the faith force by a negative confession; (5) Christ 
      'became one with the nature of Satan' and was 'born again' in hell; (6) 
      Christ would have sinned without the Holy Spirit and would have remained 
      in the grave 'if the Holy Ghost had changed His mind about raising Him 
      from the dead' [Jesus said, 'I have power to lay down my life and I have 
      power to take it again' (Jn 10:18) for He is God]; (7) We are 'little 
      gods' and even part of God with all the power of God; and (8) We are 
      'little messiahs,' everything that Jesus ever was." </P>
      <P>Some of his statements, such as that a woman was originally designed to 
      give birth from her side, or that Adam and Eve were super beings who could 
      fly to the moon, are not only heresy, but ludicrous blunders. Yet Hinn 
      claimed that most of them, as well as the heresies above, came as direct 
      revelation from God under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. To attribute 
      such errors to the Holy Spirit is blasphemy of which he has not repented. 
      That Hinn's alleged "Holy Spirit" teaches error and folly should be enough 
      to discredit his book about "the anointing of the Holy Spirit," yet it has 
      been a runaway best seller. Hinn's repentance and renunciations to date 
      have obviously fallen far short of truth. [Adapted and/or excerpted by

      <H1><!--mstheme--><FONT color=#330099>Beware of Charismatic Leader Benny 
      Hinn<!--mstheme--></FONT></H1>
      <P>The following is from Dave Hunt's <EM>CIB Bulletin </EM>for February 
      1992: </P>
      <P>There is a new star rising on the charismatic faith-healing circuit. 
      Benny Hinn has attracted crowds as large as 30,000. At 38 he pastors 
      Orlando Christian Center, one of America's fastest growing churches. Its 
      2,800-seat auditorium is packed three times each Sunday and the service is 
      aired later on TBN. Though he has preached at Grant's [W.V. Grant, a 
      charismatic leader who has been exposed for fraud in having prior 
      information of his supposed "words of knowledge"] church, Hinn's methods 
      vary from Popoff's or Grant's. He raises about $12 million a year with the 
      usual false promises of healing and prosperity in exchange for "seed 
      faith" gifts -- a condition for "miracles." "Give no less than $100," he 
      exhorts an audience, and promises to "lay hands on all the envelopes and 
      ask God for financial miracles for the givers." </P>
      <P align=left><STRONG>Praying at Kuhlman's grave:<BR></STRONG><FONT 
      color=#660066><STRONG>The secret to Hinn's power is his peculiar 
      anointing, which he connects with Kathryn Kuhlman and Aimee McPherson, 
      founder of the Foursquare Gospel Church. He first felt the "full power of 
      the Holy Spirit" on him at a Kuhlman healing service in 1973 -- and her 
      mantle has presumably fallen upon Hinn. He conducts his meetings almost 
      exactly like hers -- though it takes Hinn much longer to get his audience 
      into the expectant mood that seems to generate psychosomatic "miracles." 
      In an April 7, 1991 sermon, Hinn revealed that he periodically visits 
      Kuhlman's grave and that he is one of the few with a key to gain access to 
      it. He also visits Aimee's grave, where he says: "I felt a terrific 
      anointing ... I was shaking all over ... trembling under the power of God 
      ... `Dear God,' I said, `I feel the anointing.' ... I believe the 
      anointing has lingered over Aimee's body</STRONG></FONT>." </P>
      <P align=left><STRONG>Blowing people down with the 
      "spirit"<BR></STRONG>The anointing or power plays a major role at Benny 
      Hinn's "miracle services." He uses it to "slay in the spirit" as Kuhlman 
      did 30 years ago. She has been imitated by charismatic evangelist/healers 
      ever since. But Hinn has a new flare. Yes, like Kuhlman, he touches people 
      on the forehead or neck to make them fall over. But he also blows or 
      throws the "anointing" and "slays" people from a distance. As Mike Thomas 
      reported in <EM>Florida Magazine</EM>, Nov. 24, 1991: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Winded catchers try to keep up with the toppling bodies. He rears 
        back and with a pitching motion slays the entire choir with one toss. 
        "That's power," yells Benny." "POWER!" ... Hinn takes off his custom 
        tailored jacket and rubs it briskly on his body. He is rubbing the Power 
        into the jacket. Then he starts swinging it wildly, like the biblical 
        David swinging his sling. He decks his followers left and right. Bam! 
        Bam! Bam! The stage vibrates with their landings. Then he throws it [the 
        "anointed" jacket]. Another bam. As a catcher moves to pick up a woman, 
        Hinn slays him ... then he slays the catcher who caught the catcher. 
        When Benny Hinn is moved, nobody is safe from the Power ... [H]e blows 
        loudly into the microphone ... Hundreds fall backward ... a woman 
        collapses in the aisle and begins to babble. And then, suddenly, Benny 
        is gone. The power vanishes from the room, and the people stare in 
        stunned silence. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This aspect alone of Hinn's meetings is enough to condemn him. He 
      capriciously throws the "Holy Spirit" around in most irreverent fashion, 
      using the third Person of the Trinity as his servant to attract attention 
      to himself. Hinn acts as though the "anointing" is some metaphysical power 
      at his disposal, to be rubbed off onto objects. It looks impressive, works 
      largely by the power of suggestion, but has no purpose except to make 
      people stand in awe of Hinn. "It's scary," says Bill James, a former 
      church member. "The people are mesmerized. ...When he comes out, he's like 
      God." </P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>Got to have gold now!</STRONG></P>
      <P align=left>Benny's office at his church contains pictures of himself 
      with George Bush and John Paul II. It was Hinn who arranged for Paul and 
      Jan Crouch to meet with the Pope. Here is Mike Thomas's impression of a 
      visit with Hinn: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=left>He looks like a Ralph Lauren advertisement, a true 
        gentleman of leisure. As always, his hair is sprayed solidly in place. 
        "I don't know if you'll ever [again] see a reverend without socks," he 
        says proudly. [He's wearing no socks.] "That's the way I am. I'm more 
        down to earth than most people." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=left><FONT color=#ff0000>This comes from a man who just turned 
        in his Mercedes for a Jaguar and recently moved from the exclusive 
        Heathrow development to the even more exclusive Alaqua, where he now 
        lives in a $685,000 home. His suits are tailored, his shoes are Italian 
        leather, and his wrists and finger glitter with gold and diamonds ... 
        what he considers a modest lifestyle, as if everyone lives like 
        this</FONT>. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P align=left>He wears his diamond Rolex, diamond rings, gold bracelet 
        and custom suits for all to see. ..."What's the big deal, for goodness 
        sake?" he says. "What am I supposed to do, drive a Honda? ...That's not 
        in the Bible. ... I'm sick and tired about hearing about streets of gold 
        [in heaven]. I don't need gold in heaven. I got to have it now." 
      </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=center><STRONG>Healed of blindness -- vision still 
      cloudy!</STRONG></P>
      <P align=left>Benny declares: "I have received a new mandate from heaven 
      -- bring the message of the miraculous, healing power of God back to 
      America! Invade our nation with the miracle-working power of God in the 
      '90s!<STRONG>" He claims that about 1,000 people are healed at each 
      "miracle service</STRONG>." But as Thomas reported, "Despite all the 
      thousands of miracles claimed by Hinn, the church seems hard pressed to 
      come up with any that would convince a serious skeptic. ... When pressed 
      for truly convincing miracles, [Hinn spokesperson] Susan Smith cited a 
      woman in Orlando who was cured of blindness caused by diabetes. But she 
      would not give the woman's name. She later admitted that the woman's 
      vision may still be cloudy. `She still has diabetes, strangely ... [and] 
      was just rehospitalized." </P>
      <P align=center>Christians are little gods </P>
      <P>"People of God," shouts Benny, "we must never speak such 
      faith-destroying words as these: `If it be thy will, Lord.' ... I am Him 
      [Jesus]! The Word has become flesh in Meee! ...You are a little god on 
      earth!" <STRONG>His other heresies include the teaching that God the 
      Father, Son and Holy Spirit each has a body, soul and spirit. "There's 
      nine of them!" he told his congregation "by revelation knowledge," but 
      probably got the idea from </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Dake's Annotated Reference 
      Bible</STRONG></EM><STRONG>, where this ancient heresy was revived on page 
      55</STRONG>. Hinn taught the same heresy as Hagin and Copeland, that when 
      Jesus died on the cross He sank into hell and took upon him the nature of 
      Satan and was tortured by Satan for our redemption. Then early in 1991 he 
      repudiated this teaching along with other "Word- Faith" peculiar 
      doctrines. Yet he had taught it as "revelation knowledge." God's 
      revelations don't change. </P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>Hinn would like to blow the heads off his 
      enemies</STRONG></P>
      <P align=left>As As for his critics, Hinn says: "You know, I've looked for 
      one verse in the Bible -- I just can't seem to find it -- one verse that 
      says, `If you don't like 'em, kill 'em.'' I really wish I could find it! 
      ...Sometimes I wish God would give me a Holy Ghost machine gun. I'd blow 
      your head off!" The TBN studio audience loudly applauded those gracious 
      words from the "man of God." </P>
      <P>Surely we are seeing fulfilled the primary sign Christ gave of the 
      nearness of His return: "For there shall arise false christs, and false 
      prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it 
      were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." Let us seek to know God 
      and His Word and to walk in obedience to Him, contending earnestly for the 
      faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. He's coming soon!

      <P><FONT size=5><STRONG>A</STRONG></FONT>s a personal note my wife and I 
      have "felt" the <EM>power </EM>in Benny Hinn's services. My wife had the 
      luxury to making it through the maddening throng to get up on the platform 
      . . . and yes Tracy did fall down, <U>knocked down by a force</U>! The 
      question is what is the origin of that force? Tracy will testify that she 
      was no better physically or spiritually because she was knocked down. 
      Thus, the question, where is the benefit? Any observer of his ministry 
      must also question the caviler manner in which Benny knocks people down, 
      stands them up to knock them down again. Can you see Jesus saying 
      "<EM>Peter pick that guy up again</EM>." Then hitting him with His 
      seamless robe and knocking down again to the loud applause of the 
      multitudes. <STRONG>Showmanship at its best and worst</STRONG>.</P>
      <P>One stage magic trick Benny used in the services we participated in is 
      this: He has the 10,000 plus people all get deathly quiet and close our 
      eyes. Then after a few moments Benny's microphone is turned up and he 
      either blows loudly into it or yells "<EM>take it</EM>." When he does this 
      everyone's autonomic nervous system is jolted (like when someone sneaks up 
      behind up and says "boo") and people (already mentally prepared) fall down 
      thinking that was the anointing of the Holy Spirit. <STRONG>What a cheap 
      trick to play on ignorant people!</STRONG></P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>God may out of His great mercy heal some people at 
      these meetings. If anyone gets anything good, its source is the Lord God, 
      not Benny Hinn. Due to his severe doctrinal errors, ungodly crusade 
      performances, and bad hair . . .his ministry is to be avoided at all 
      costs, unless you want to observe mass hysteria under the hands of a 
      manipulator.</STRONG></P><!--mstheme--></FONT><!--msnavigation--></TD>
