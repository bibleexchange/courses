<H2><I>General Teachings/Activities</I>*</H2>
<P>Benny Hinn, [former] pastor of Orlando Christian Center in Orlando, Florida 
[the church was first re-named World Outreach Church, and then Faith World 
Church in 1999 when Hinn resigned from the pastorate and moved his "crusade and 
evangelism" ministry to Dallas] is one of the most prolific voices in the 
so-called "Christian" media today. <SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[Hinn's "ministry" 
reportedly takes in over $100 million a year, which allows him to maintain a 
$3.5 million home, and to spend $8,000 on airline fares and stay in $2,000/night 
hotel rooms.]</O:P> </SPAN>His book <I>Good Morning</I>,<I> Holy Spirit </I>has 
remained on the best-seller list since its release in October, 1990, having sold 
approximately one-quarter million copies within the first few months. In May of 
1992, it was number one among paperback books according to <I>Christian 
Reading</I>, one of the major trade publications for "Christian" bookstores, 
distributors, and publishers.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Due to some rather startling statements in the original edition of <CITE>Good 
Morning, Holy Spirit</CITE>, Hinn came under fire from a few organizations that 
perceived serious doctrinal discrepancies in Hinn's theology.<BR><BR>The most 
public criticism of Hinn's teachings came from the Christian Research Institute 
(CRI) [which has many <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/cri/">theological problems 
of its own</A>], which took Hinn and his publisher, Thomas Nelson Company, to 
task for what CRI perceived as heretical statements. This resulted in Nelson 
revising the questionable material in its later releases and Hinn apologizing 
and promising not to promote in the future the teachings under question. 
However, Thomas Nelson Company spokesman Bruce Barbour (publisher) and Bill 
Watkins (senior editor) as well as Hinn, say that the theology expressed in the 
original edition has <B>not</B> been changed but merely "clarified."<BR><BR>Yet 
Hinn does claim to have changed his mind about other teachings not dealt with in 
<CITE>Good Morning, Holy Spirit</CITE>, most notably the 
"Jesus-died-spiritually" heresy that has characterized the theology of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/w-f.htm">word-faith</A> 
teachers from E. W. Kenyon through <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hagin/">Kenneth Hagin</A>, <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/copeland/">Kenneth 
Copeland</A>, and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/posit.htm">others</A>.<BR><BR>In 
spite of these developments, many Christians are still <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hinn/morehinn.htm">questioning 
where Benny Hinn is coming from</A>. And in view of his continued popularity 
within the Christian marketplace, we thought that an analysis of Hinn's 
teachings is in order. We also think that some of the criticism leveled against 
Hinn has been based not on Scriptural truth, but upon orthodoxy -- traditionally 
accepted understanding of issues not necessarily addressed in clear terms by 
Scripture. It is our hope [Al Dager of <I>Media Spotlight -- </I>see asterisk 
note (between the horizontal lines) at the end of this section] to set these 
differences apart.<BR></P>
<H3><CITE>The Man</CITE></H3>
<P>Benny Hinn was born in 1953 in Israel to a Greek father and an Armenian 
mother. He was raised in the Greek Orthodox [false] religion. Hinn claims that 
while he was a young boy of 11 years of age in Israel, God first appeared to 
him, and has been appearing to him ever since. At the age of 14, Hinn moved to 
Canada with his parents. While attending high school there, he says he had 
visions of himself preaching before huge crowds. He also claims that God healed 
him of a stuttering problem so that he could become a preacher.<BR><BR>Yet in 
spite of the visions and God's appearing to him for several years, Hinn marks 
the year of his being born again as 1972 when he was about 20 years old. It was 
at a Kathryn Kuhlman service the following year that he says he had a "profound 
spiritual experience."<BR><BR>Hinn readily admits that much of the 
misunderstanding that has arisen from his teachings is the result of his lack of 
formal Bible training. In fact, almost immediately after his having been "born 
again," Hinn says, "The Lord launched me into ministry almost 
overnight."<BR><BR>In spite of these circumstances, Hinn founded the Orlando 
Christian Center in 1983. Beginning with just a few hundred members, that church 
now boasts an average weekly attendance of over 10,000. [The newly named Faith 
World Church is now being pastored by Clint Brown, who merged his charismatic 
Orlando church with Hinn's when Hinn moved to Dallas in late-1999.] In addition, 
Hinn conducts worldwide crusades and has a daily television program [the 
30-minute <I>This Is Your Day </I>program is seen in more than 100 countries] 
that airs over the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), headed by Jan and Paul 
Crouch [see the end of this report for transcripts of two of Hinn's recent 
appearances on TBN]. [Hinn also claimed to be building a $30-$35 million 
"Healing Center" in Dallas, which was to operate 24 hours a day with its planned 
opening in 2001; part of the attraction was to be films of previous healing 
services conducted by the <A 
href="http://www.wayoflife.org/fbns/ishealing01.htm">masters of the trade</A> -- 
Oral Roberts, Kathryn Kuhlman, Aimee Semple McPhearson, A.A. Allen, Jack Coe, 
Lester Sumrall, etc. As of the date of this report revision, it appears that 
Hinn has again raised money under false pretences -- not one brick has been laid 
for the Healing Center. Hinn <SPAN style="COLOR: black">now says the decision to 
delay the project was divinely inspired (6/23/02, <I>Dallas Morning 
News</I>).</SPAN>]</P>
<P>Although Hinn states that his ministry throughout the 1970s was shaped by the 
writings of men like D.L. Moody and R.A. Torrey, he was a strong proponent of 
"revelation knowledge" -- new truths revealed to him by God directly -- that 
were not contained within Scripture. Only recently has he stated that he will no 
longer claim revelation knowledge as the authority for his teachings. [See the 
end of this report of Hinn once again claiming revelation 
knowledge].<BR><BR>More than this, Hinn claims to actually be a channel for God 
-- that God enters him and takes over his mind and tongue to the point where he 
is unaware of what he has said. After his sermon on December 31, 1989, at 
Orlando Christian Center, during which he gave several future prophecies, Hinn 
expressed that he was drunk -- presumably on the Holy Spirit -- and asked 
someone to tell him what he had just said.<BR><BR>It became evident in the early 
1980s that the word-faith teachings of Kenyon, Hagin, Copeland, and others began 
to have an enormous impact on Hinn. But shortly after his encounter with critics 
of his book, Hinn announced that he no longer hold to the word-faith 
teachings.<BR><BR>As Hinn's popularity increased due to his television program 
and the runaway sales of <CITE>Good Morning, Holy Spirit</CITE>, his teachings 
came under close scrutiny by several apologetics ministries. The Christian 
Research Institute became especially alarmed by Hinn's references to the Godhead 
that seemed at best unorthodox and at worst heretical. On both his television 
program and in his book, Hinn asserted that all three persons of the Triune 
Godhead have their own independent bodies, souls, and spirits, as well as wills 
(10/13/90, TBN).<BR><BR>What alarmed most critics of Hinn is his statement that 
"there are nine of them [Spirits of God]." Some took this to mean that there are 
nine persons, which is not what Hinn was saying. "Nine of them" referred to the 
separate elements of the Trinity: three bodies, souls, and spirits.<BR><BR>Hinn 
is clearly guilty of teaching "revelation knowledge" (God's Truth imparted to 
him personally), something that is not at all supported by Scripture. As such, 
he has established in the minds of those who trust him, a personal belief as if 
it were authoritative truth, which it is not.<BR><BR>While Hinn's teachings on 
the Trinity have captured the forefront of the debate between himself and the 
apologist ministries, there are other serious issues that have taken a back seat 
to the questionable Trinitarian controversy -- issues that truly do lead toward 
heresy.<BR></P>
<H3><CITE>A God-Man</CITE></H3>
<P>Hinn teaches that when one is born again by faith in Jesus, he is given a new 
spirit man that wasn't there before -- a spirit man that is divine in nature and 
God-like (<CITE>Our Position in Christ </CITE>[sermon tape]).<BR><BR>Throughout 
his dissertations, Hinn avows that the Bible says what he says. But his ploy is 
the same as that of every false teacher, which is to pull a proof text out of 
context and apply it to a personal interpretation which is claimed to have been 
given by direct revelation from God. Where in Scripture is it found that some 
"spirit-man" distinct from us, comes into us? The Holy Spirit comes into us, but 
Hinn isn't speaking of the Holy Spirit, because he says this spirit-man was 
"created before the foundation of the world."<BR><BR>Hinn also cites Ephesians 1 
as a proof text, but this is a gross error. It does speak of <CITE>our</CITE> 
being chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world; nowhere does it 
mention a God-like "spirit-man," let alone one distinct from us.<BR><BR>In 
another statement, Hinn asserts that though we are not Almighty God Himself, 
nevertheless, we are now divine (12/1/90, TBN). Hinn continues by denying that 
he is saying we are God, but affirming that we are children of God (elsewhere he 
asserts that we are gods).<BR></P>
<H3><CITE>Jesus Took On Satan's Nature</CITE></H3>
<P>One of the popular word-faith teachings is that Jesus took on the nature of 
Satan and had to be born again. This doctrine is intrinsically linked to the 
"Jesus died spiritually" heresy which postulates that Jesus' shed blood was 
insufficient for the redemption of man; He had to suffer at Satan's hands in 
Hell and be born again as the first man to conquer death. Hinn also teaches this 
heresy:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"He [Jesus] who is righteous by choice said, 'The only way I can stop sin 
  is by Me becoming it. I can't just stop it by letting it touch Me; I and it 
  must become one.' Hear this! He who is the nature of God became the nature of 
  Satan where He became sin!" (TBN, 12/1/90).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this one statement, Hinn manages to convey three distinct errors 
concerning Jesus, to which we must answer the following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1) Jesus is not righteous by choice, but by nature;<BR>2) Jesus never said 
  these words, either in Scripture or to Benny Hinn personally, because they are 
  unbiblical; and<BR>3) Jesus' nature is constant; even God cannot change His 
  nature from God to something else.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When He became a man, the Word of God commingled his divine nature with the 
flesh of man, not angels; but that is the limit of His approaching anything like 
assuming Satan's nature. This idea is a first-rate heresy which, drawn to its 
conclusion in the supposed spiritual death of Jesus, denies the blood of Christ 
and damns those who teach and believe it unless they repent. It is a different 
gospel from that given through Scripture.<BR><BR>In spite of Hinn's professional 
rejection of the word-faith message, he hasn't given up on it entirely. The 
word-faith message encompasses far more than the "<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/posit.htm">name it and 
claim it</A>" foolishness. It is intrinsically linked to the God-man-believer 
and Jesus-died-spiritually heresies, which Hinn continues to espouse. It exalts 
man and denigrates Christ, as most false teachings do.<BR><BR>The problem with 
these and other teachings of Hinn is that he exhibits the mindset of someone who 
"learned as he earned," strewing spiritual wreckage in his path. Whatever comes 
to mind must be God's voice; after all, Hinn believes himself a prophet of God. 
And woe to those who dare challenge him.<BR></P>
<H3><CITE>Blowing It</CITE></H3>
<P>One of the characteristics of Hinn's services has been his claim to impart 
the Holy Spirit at will by blowing on people. He has been known to wave his coat 
in the air, or to toss the Holy Spirit like a baseball at the audience, causing 
entire sections to ostensibly swoon under the power of God. Obviously God is at 
Hinn's disposal. And he doesn't mind being made a spectacle in the 
process.<BR><BR>The phenomenon known as being "slain in the Spirit" is a 
trademark of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/">modern 
charismaticism</A>. And while I would not say that God will or cannot come upon 
someone with such a power, it becomes obvious that, coupled with false 
teachings, the power transmitted by Hinn (if there is any power at all) is 
<B>not</B> of God. [<SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">At 
one crusade, a man Hinn had "slain in the Spirit" fell on a prostrate elderly 
woman and broke her hip, resulting in her death. The lawsuit was settled out of 
court.] </SPAN>In fact, it appears, for several reasons, more a case of mass 
hysteria entered into by people predisposed to fall:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1) they want the power of God no matter what;<BR>2) they would be 
  embarrassed not to fall when everyone else around them is falling;<BR>3) many 
  have testified that the person imparting the Holy Spirit pushed them 
  down;<BR>4) God might allow and even grant such a "blessing" to entrench error 
  in people's minds who don't care about truth as much as they do about some 
  supernatural experience;<BR>5) Satan and demons may duplicate such a 
  phenomenon to validate as truth the error of one's teachings.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[Other examples of Hinn's false healing powers: <SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: normal">An elderly Hinn follower was turned away from one 
entrance to ARGO Stadium in Sacramento, CA because she had not given enough 
money to enter there. Later, on the stage she was "slain in the Spirit," and 
while she was lying on the floor a huge man, likewise "slain," landed on top of 
her, breaking her leg. In 1993 in Basel, Switzerland, Hinn prophesied over a man 
with cancer that he had many years to live. He died two days later. In Nairobi, 
Kenya early in May 2000, four patients released from a hospital to attend Hinn's 
"Miracle Crusade" died while waiting for prayer.<O:P> </O:P>(Source: 9/00, 
<I>TBC</I>.)]</SPAN></P>
<P>Finally, Hinn's errors are compounded by his continual extolling of the 
virtues of the pope and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/">Roman 
Catholicism</A>, as if the errors of that [false] church are to be ignored in 
the interest of unity. In 1989, Hinn was a participant in the move to grant to 
Pope John Paul II the "Prince of Peace" award, instigated by Harold Bradesen. 
Receiving much flack for his part in that award, Hinn recanted and withdrew his 
participation.</P>

<P align=center><B><BR><FONT size=4>BENNY HINN SAYS THE DEAD IN THEIR 
CASKETS<BR>WILL BE RAISED TO LIFE IN FRONT OF TV SETS</FONT></B></P>
<P>The following is a transcription of what Benny Hinn said on Paul and Jan 
Crouch's TBN television program (<I>Praise The Lord</I>, Trinity Broadcasting 
Network, October 19, 1999):</P>
<P><U>Benny Hinn</U>: But here's first what I see for TBN. You're going to have 
people raised from the dead watching this network. You're going to have people 
raised from the dead watching TBN. Programs -- just plain programs -- programs 
that haven't done much when it comes to supernatural manifestations -- teaching 
programs. It's not going to be a Benny Hinn saying "Stretch your hands." It's 
going to be your average teaching program, your normal Christian program that's 
blessing the church. There's going to be such power on these programs people 
will be raised from the dead worldwide. I'm telling you, I see this in the 
Spirit. It's going to be so awesome. Jesus I give you praise for this -- that 
people around the world -- maybe not so much in America -- people around the 
world who will lose loved ones, will say to undertakers, "Not yet. I want to 
take my dead loved one and place him in front of that TV set for 24 hours."</P>
<P><U>Paul Crouch</U>: Benny Hinn! Jesus!</P>
<P><U>Benny Hinn</U>: I'm telling you. People will be -- people -- I'm telling 
you, I feel the anointing talking here. People are going to be canceling funeral 
services and bringing their dead in their caskets, placing them -- my God! I 
feel the anointing here -- placing them before a television set, waiting for 
God's power to come through and touch them. And it's going to happen time and 
time -- so much it's going to spread. You're going to hear it from Kenya to 
Mexico to Europe to South America, where people will be raised from the -- so 
much so that the Word will spread that if some dead person be put in front of 
this TV screen, they will be raised from the dead and they will be by the 
thousands. You wait. Now the Lord just told me -- and I don't know whether this 
is true or not -- as I'm saying this, the Lord said He gave you that word many, 
many years ago.</P>
<P><U>Paul Crouch</U>: I have said that, yes.</P>
<P><U>Benny Hinn</U>: I don't remember you saying that to me ever.</P>
<P><U>Paul Crouch</U>: No, I didn't.</P>
<P><U>Benny Hinn</U>: [He said] 'I've told him this already.'</P>
<P><U>Paul Crouch</U>: Yeah, the Lord spoke that to me in the very beginning of 
TBN and I<BR>didn't really ...</P>
<P><U>Jan Crouch</U>: And I had a dream.</P>
<P><U>Benny Hinn</U>: You had a dream.</P>
<P><U>Paul Crouch</U>: Yeah, tell him about that little ...</P>
<P><U>Jan Crouch</U>: That's just a dream -- people were being raised from the 
dead. Years ago.</P>
<P><U>Paul Crouch</U>: It's on tape. I said the day is coming ...</P>
<P><U>Benny Hinn</U>: I see quite something amazing. I see rows of caskets 
lining up in front of this TV set and I see them bringing them closer to the TV 
set and as people are coming closer I see actually loved ones picking up the 
hands of the dead and letting them touch the screen and people are getting 
raised as their hands are touching that screen. With this program -- I'm not 
talking about my program -- I'm talking programs, plain programs aired -- the 
glory of God will be so on TBN that there's going to be divine resurrection 
happening as people bring their loved ones to the TV set.</P>
<P><U>Paul Crouch</U>: Just because it's His time.</P>
<P><U>Benny Hinn</U>: It's His time. Now here's something else I see. Jesus, I 
give You praise for this, I give You praise for this, I give You praise for this 
-- the day will come, Paul -- and I pray you'll be here. I pray the Lord will 
allow you to be here and see it. I mean, physically be here. You're in your 60s 
now. But the day is going to come when the gifts of the Holy Spirit will so 
intensify in the church that young children will be watching TBN and signs and 
wonders will begin to take place through them. Impartations of the Spirit will 
come to them. A little child that knows nothing about the gifts, knows nothing 
about the anointing, knows nothing about the power of God, will be imbued with 
power from on high as a child, as that TV set comes on, and will go out like 
fire torches to their schools and their playgrounds and their families. I see 
children, I see children, what looks like fire in their lips spreading -- but I 
see these kids touching the TV set, receiving it, and going out and spreading 
it. And it's going to happen with children in the U.S., Canada, all over the 
world. And I do see people being raised from the dead here, but I see masses of 
them overseas.<BR></P>

<P>When Benny Hinn found himself in a bind over his gaffe about there being nine 
persons in the Trinity, he said that it was only a joke. He has made many other 
irresponsible claims; e.g., that humans were created to swim like fish and fly 
like birds, and with only a thought, could move from planet to planet. When 
challenged as to his authority for such ridiculous claims, he appealed to his 
Jewish origin (Hinn was born a Palestinian Arab, not a Jew ["The Confusing World 
of Benny Hinn," <I>PFO Journal</I>, 12/97, p. 34]) and his knowledge of Hebrew, 
which he clearly doesn't have. He said that the word translated to "have 
dominion" in the creation story means that Adam and Eve could do everything that 
the creatures over which they had dominion could do (<I>Christianity in 
Crisis</I>, p. 119). So presumably, they could also lay eggs like hens and swarm 
like bees.</P>
<P>The teachings of Benny Hinn from the beginning of his ministry are obviously 
the rantings of a buffoon. A recent TV interview, however, indicates that the 
man has gone beyond the pale -- that he has indeed moved to a lower level. Paul 
Crouch (PC) is interviewing Benny Hinn (BH) on the Trinity Broadcasting Network 
(TBN) with Paul and Jan Crouch (9/13/99):</P>
<P>In the opening exchanges of the interview, reference is made to Kathryn 
Kuhlman, who BH appeals to as a precedent for his "cursing and blessing" 
pronouncements at a recently held Healing Crusade in Denver. He also refers to 
Fred Roberts, whom he calls "an apostle," as being another person who encouraged 
him to "speak judgment" on his opponents.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;He said you are entitled now because they blasphemed the 
  Holy Spirit to tell God what you want to see done.</P>
  <P><B>PC</B>: &nbsp;Because they were attributing your works to the devil; 
  exactly what they did to Jesus. (Hinn agrees.)</P>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;See the second they attribute the work of God to Satan, 
  we, as believers, step into, legally step into, a place we can ask God to stop 
  them.</P>
  <P><B>PC</B>: &nbsp;Amen!</P>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;William Branham was ministering one time -- and this 
  happened more than one time but I only heard about it twice -- this happened; 
  when a man came in and said -- he was actually lying to William Branham -- and 
  said -- he was trying to mock him -- and came in and said he was sick and 
  wanted William Branham to pray for him; and William Branham said, "you're not 
  sick; you're just here to mock me; but you're going to walk out with the same 
  sickness you said you had," and he walked out sick!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As the interview continues, BH refers to an incident that he alleges took 
place under the ministry of Tommy Reid in the Philippines when God supposedly 
inflicted sickness upon someone who was opposing the meetings. Whether such did 
or didn't take place we have no means of checking. From the way BH recounts it, 
it's very doubtful. What is certain is that Benny Hinn is employing illegitimate 
fear tactics. Even worse, he appeals to a Biblical incident in the life of 
Christ in an unscriptural way. Read what Benny Hinn said in the light of 
Proverbs 26:18.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;When they said this -- "It's of the devil," He (said), "Ah 
  this is one thing I won't forgive!" He spoke there, judgment; and the judgment 
  He spoke was eternal damnation. He said I'll forgive any sin but not this one; 
  and there he made the clear cut. So Tommy (Reid) said to the Lord, "All right 
  Lord, here's what I want done." The last night of the meeting they brought 
  this lady with arthritis on a wheelchair down front. The man came back, in the 
  back again, began to do the same thing. "This is of the devil," screaming all 
  this stuff. And Tommy said, "Lord now!" When he said "now," the Lord healed 
  the lady with the arthritis and struck the man with her sickness, he switched 
  sicknesses.</P>
  <P><B>PC</B>: &nbsp;Jesus!</P>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;He switched sicknesses and took it off the lady and hit 
  the man with it. And the man began screaming and ran out. With 
ARTHRITIS!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ask yourself, "Are these the rantings of a man whose mind has gone, who is no 
longer thinking rationally? Or are they, as is being presented, the expressions 
of someone anointed by the Holy Spirit?" According to Benny Hinn, God heals a 
woman in a wheel chair. In so doing He (i.e. God Almighty) "switched sicknesses" 
and brought judgment upon a poor Philippine man, who RAN out screaming with the 
same ARTHRITIS that had confined the woman to a wheel chair? Sounds like a 
double miracle, with the second canceling out the reality of the first. Now that 
really does stretch credulity.</P>
<P>[Apart from the utter stupidity of the ravings of Benny Hinn in this clearly 
fabricated story, the really sad thing is that he appeals to Scripture as a 
precedent. There is such a thing as blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, of which 
sin our Lord said there was no forgiveness (Matt 12:31-32). Seeing so many in 
the "Revival Now" camp all the time appealing to this SIN as their get-out from 
legitimate examination and judgment, by those who seek to follow the Berean 
example, it behooves us to know clearly what this blasphemy against the Holy 
Spirit is in the Scriptural context. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is 
ascribing the act of exorcising demons from people by the Lord Jesus Christ 
(Himself) to the works of the devil (Satan), while maintaining that Christ 
Himself is demon possessed. The application made by Benny Hinn and others like 
him is not legitimate Biblically. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit relates to 
our Lord Jesus Christ and not to Benny Hinn or any self-acclaimed "Anointed 
ONE." If you are doing what the Bible requires of you -- "testing the spirits" 
(1 John 4); "judge righteous judgment" (John 7:24), "proving all things" (1 
Thess. 5:21), and generally acting as a Berean Christian should act (Acts 
17:11), it is impossible for you to blaspheme the Holy Spirit. It is far more 
likely that men like Benny Hinn and Paul Crouch, <I>et al.</I>, are themselves 
guilty of the blasphemy that they impute to others.]</P>
<P>The interview gets worse:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;Under the anointing not one word falls to the ground.</P>
  <P><B>PC</B>: &nbsp;Amen.</P>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;I am not the same man under the anointing that I am now -- 
  My children are afraid of me under the anointing. What they do not know is 
  that I'm afraid of the anointing too. [laughter] I'm not afraid of myself, I'm 
  afraid of what the anointing can do to me if I mistreat it. Or if I abuse it 
  or if I misuse it.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Clearly, Benny Hinn is not talking about the "anointing" as the whole of 
Scripture portrays it and John the apostle describes it in 1 John 2:19-29. What 
is this anointing that he and others keep talking about? Nowhere in the New 
Testament is there any idea of ANYONE being specially anointed other than our 
Lord Jesus Christ, who is <B>the</B> ANOINTED ; i.e., the CHRIST (the words 
"anointing, Christ, messiah" all derive from the same root). There is a sense in 
which all of God's people have a general anointing, and John makes it clear that 
this gives us a relationship with our blessed Lord, but it never makes one 
higher, better, greater, or more powerful than another. This is utter heresy and 
is part of the necessary creation of a "mystique" to silence criticism and 
critics.</P>
<P>From here the TV interview goes to a level which can only be described as 
horrific and occultic. TBN screens a video recorded in Denver when Benny Hinn 
pronounced blessings on those who support him and curses on those who oppose 
him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;I've been preaching 25 years almost; I've never seen the 
  anointing as frightening as I saw in Denver Friday night; and so when you hear 
  me in just a little bit give blessings and cursings ... any who attack this 
  anointing, I speak a judgment on them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>According to an eyewitness account: "In the recent Denver crusade, Hinn 
became a different person under the influence of the 'anointing' unlike anything 
seen before. So much so, that his voice changed to a 'growl.' He was telling the 
people to raise their hands and exalt the master Jesus. It was obvious that he 
was not talking about the Jesus of the Bible. He also cursed all who would raise 
their hands against his ministry in word or deed." Here are some extracts from 
the video recording of what happened at Denver:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;My skin is about to explode. Your body will tingle from 
  the top to the bottom. Lift your voices. Lift your hands and ask him for it -- 
  People of God, be healed! People of the Lord, be delivered! Rise up out of 
  your sickness and jump into the river of healing and be healed, in Jesus' 
  name. Take your seats; this is just the beginning of the service. (Hinn then 
  brings up a man claiming two thirds of his heart is dead.) He's barely been 
  able to walk (Hinn growls). The glory! The glory! If I don't release it, I'll 
  blow up. If I don't release the anointing, I'll blow up. I got to release it 
  on somebody. The demon must bow to the name of the master Jesus ... Yes Lord 
  I'll do it! <U>I place a curse on every man and woman that will stretch his 
  hand against this anointing. I curse that man who dares to speak a word 
  against this ministry.</U> But any man, any woman, that raises his or her hand 
  in blessing towards this ministry, I bless that man. I bless that home. I 
  bless that family. Any man, any woman, any person that raises his tongue in 
  blessing toward this work, raises his tongue in blessing toward this 
  anointing, raises his tongue in blessing toward this servant of the Lord, I 
  bless them. I bless the work of your hands. I bless your life with His mighty 
  power. I bless your home with divine protection. I bless your children with 
  long life and I bless you (with) length of days. I bless you with healing. I 
  bless you with prosperity. I bless you with the very presence of Almighty God. 
  I, a servant, bless you in the name of the One I serve. I bless (your) people 
  tonight in Denver. Lift your hands and receive the blessing. I rarely ever do 
  what I'm doing now. This is the Holy Ghost on me telling me to do this. I 
  bless you; I bless your homes, your life, your future, your children. May 
  every attack of Satan be destroyed. May every plan of hell be destroyed 
  against you (change of voice) and every plan of God be established in Jesus 
  name. Amen, amen.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A number of third wave charismatics, key players in today's revivalism, were 
guests on Hinn's program over recent weeks -- <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/copeland/">Kenneth 
Copeland</A>, <A href="http://www.pfo.org/parsley.htm">Rod Parsley</A>, <A 
href="http://www.pfo.org/wan-star.htm">Joyce Meyer</A>'s and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/holylaugh.htm">Rodney 
Howard-Browne</A>. Hinn clearly is assuming the apostolic father-figure of the 
healing ministry, picking up the mantle where, not Kathryn Kuhlman, but William 
Branham left off.</P>
<P>Here's just one extract from one of the TV programs to let you see where 
things are heading. Sounds a bit like a Jimmy Bakker re-run. This is with Benny 
Hinn (BH) and Rod Parsley (RP) on "This Is Your Day," August 24, 1999:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>BH</B>: &nbsp;The healing ministry is almost dead. When you look at 
  who's out there praying for the sick today, there's not many! (This is false. 
  There are more healing ministries today then there ever were.) And the Lord 
  said to me to build a healing center, a healing and prayer center that people 
  can come to, 24 hours a day, any day of the week, and be prayed for and get 
  healed. And I did not really know what the Lord would show me, but as time 
  went on, I began to get the picture much clearer. January 3rd, the year 2000, 
  we break ground for that Healing Centre in Dallas Texas. [Ground-breaking has 
  yet to take place.] It's going to have Healing Gardens with Healing Statues of 
  Biblical Healing saints from the Old Testament. It's going to have a Healing 
  Fountain an Eternal Healing Fire. It's going to have places where people can 
  come to and be prayed for in a Healing Cathedral and Chapels in it. Think 
  about a place that will be staffed with partners, God-anointed partners. They 
  will be there volunteering, where people can come 24 hours a day and be prayed 
  for. So no one will have to wait for a crusade. Yes, I will continue to have 
  crusades; yes I will continue to travel; but what wonderful thing it would be 
  when Gods people can come to a place like that. It's going to be built with 
  Jerusalem rock. It's going to look like Jerusalem and the Lord gave us 
  property a mile and a half from the Dallas Stadium right on highway 114. 
  Saints, we have to preserve that anointing; whether it's the anointing ... 
  that's on Rod ... and your building a place now expanding your own ministry 
  ...</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Rod Parsley then prayed showing how little he understands about the true 
Biblical anointing.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>RP</B>: &nbsp;Holy Spirit of God, I thank you even now your servant has 
  been willing to conceive this child, this healing center where multiplied 
  thousands upon thousands would be healed, but more than (that) where the 
  healing ministry will be preserved. Preserved so that we will not lose our 
  roots; so that people may know the ministry of Kathryn Kuhlman and Aimee 
  Semple McPhearson, A.A. Allen and Jack Coe; of Oral Roberts and Lester 
  Sumrall, God, where those anointings will be multiplied [I'm seeing this now 
  Benny] and brought to bear in that place; multiplied by one another -- Smith 
  Wigglesworth's anointing multiplied by Oral Robert's anointing, multiplied by 
  Kathryn Kuhlman's anointing, multiplied by Benny Hinn's anointing. And when 
  the people come there, their faith will be at such a level that that spiritual 
  genealogy, which you are preserving, will come to bear against their need. 
  A.A. Allen had a miracle valley. This is going to be a miracle mountain.</P>
  <P><B>BH</B>:&nbsp; Whoa! This is going to be a miracle 
mountain.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><U>COMMENT</U>: Benny Hinn is a dangerous false prophet. The Bible does not 
promise a miracle-working revival at the end of the church age before the return 
of Christ. It promises, rather, great deception (Matthew 24:24; 2 Thessalonians 
2:7-10; Revelation 13:13,14). Many gullible people are deceived by miracles, but 
the Bible warns that miracles can be counterfeited. As we see in the above cited 
verses, every time the New Testament mentions miracles at the end of this age, 
it refers to them as deceptions. Miracles do not impart faith. Most of the 
people who witnessed Christ's miracles did not believe. Faith comes only by 
hearing the Word of God, the Bible -- "So then faith cometh by hearing, and 
hearing by the word of God" (Romans 10:17). Hebrews chapter 11 also tells us 
that faith comes through God's Word. It is the miracles that are <I>recorded</I> 
in Scripture that give faith (John 20:30,31). (Source: 12/11/99, <A
