              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Without 
              doubt, the Charismatic Movement is the fastest growing religious 
              movement of our day within the realm of those who profess 
              Christianity. It is, in fact, growing faster than Roman 
              Catholicism, Greek Orthodoxy, Protestantism, Pentecostalism, 
              Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism. At the same time, it is also 
              producing more theological confusion than any other movement in 
              the world. A full-length book would be necessary to fully document 
              these two facts, but the purpose of this article is to give a 
              Scriptural warning concerning some of the erroneous teachings of 
              the Charismatic Movement and, in particular, one of its key 
              figures, Benny Hinn. He is the one person in the Charismatic 
              Movement today who consistently appears to possess a "power" in 
              his public "healing and miracle" meetings second to none of his 
              peers and even greater than that of the late Kathryn Kuhlman, 
              whose disciple Hinn frankly acknowledges himself to be.</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Although 
              the Charismatic Movement as such was unknown until the 1960s, its 
              roots go back to Pentecostalism, which began in the early 20th 
              century. The major difference between Pentecostalism and the 
              Charismatic Movement is that most Christians rejected the 
              doctrinal deviations and unscriptural practices of the 
              Pentecostals in the early years, forcing them to establish new 
              churches, denominations and institutions. In contrast, the 
              Charismatic Movement has established itself within existing 
              churches and denominations, including the Roman Catholic and 
              Orthodox churches that had previously been untouched by 
              Pentecostalism.</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Today, 
              although some historic Pentecostals reject what they consider to 
              be excesses in the Charismatic Movement (especially with regard to 
              worldliness and fellowship with Catholics), Pentecostalism and the 
              Charismatic Movement are essentially considered the same because 
              both groups hold to and teach similar theological views regarding 
              the person, ministry and gifts of the Holy Spirit. While both 
              Pentecostals and Charismatics preach and teach many precious 
              truths of the Bible, it is the mixing of these truths with serious 
              doctrinal errors that makes their teachings so deceptive and 
              dangerous. We trust the following listing of some of these errors 
              will be helpful and lead believers to search the Scriptures to 
              determine whether or not these movements are of God (Acts 17: 11; 
              Jn. 5:39). First, we will set forth some of the wonderful truths 
              of God's Word concerning the Holy Spirit.</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">The 
              Bible makes it clear that the blessed Holy Spirit is the third 
              person of the Triune God—Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Before Jesus 
              Christ died, rose again and ascended into heaven, He promised His 
              own disciples that He would send the Holy Spirit—the Spirit of 
              Truth—who would guide them (the apostles whom the Spirit used to 
              pen the inspired, inerrant, written Word) "into all truth"—the 
              completed canon of Scripture (John 15:26; 16:13). The Bible tells 
              us that the written Word of God was given through the ministry of 
              the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1: 19-21). Sinners can only be saved 
              through hearing the Gospel which is found in that written Word, 
              the Bible, accompanied by the convicting power of the Holy Spirit 
              (John 16:7-11; Romans 10:8-17; 1 Peter 1:18-25). The Bible also 
              tells us that it was through the divine ministry of the Holy 
              Spirit that Jesus Christ, the Living Word, was conceived in the 
              womb of the virgin Mary (Matt. 1:18).</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Furthermore, 
              contrary to what most Pentecostals and Charismatics teach, God's 
              Word states that all true believers are baptized into the body of 
              Christ by the Holy Spirit at the moment of conversion, not at some 
              subsequent time (1 Cor. 12:13; Rom. 8:9). There can be, and should 
              be, continual fillings of the Holy Spirit throughout our Christian 
              walk (Eph. 5:18) as we yield completely to the Lord (Rom. 12:1-2), 
              but the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a one-time event that takes 
              place at the new birth, resulting in the believer being "sealed 
              unto the day of redemption" (Eph. 1: 11-14; 4:30). Another 
              ministry of the Holy Spirit is His role as the believer's 
              Comforter (Jn. 15:26) and his divine Helper and Intercessor in 
              times of infirmity and uncertainty (Rom. 8:26-27). A Biblical 
              study of the Holy Spirit will always bring much blessing to every 
              sincere believer.</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Sadly, 
              the Charismatic Movement, which claims to be a movement of the 
              Holy Spirit, actually contradicts many of the infallible teachings 
              of the Holy Spirit as found in the written Word, the Bible. Among 
              Charismatics, there is repeated and increasing misinterpretation, 
              misapplication and twisting of the Scriptures. Scripture texts 
              written specifically to Israel in the Old Testament, especially 
              concerning physical healing and material prosperity, are 
              misapplied to the church. Yet these are favorite texts used by 
              Charismatics to falsely teach that all believers may claim 
              physical healing or financial prosperity at all times. Not only is 
              such teaching unscriptural, but it is also contrary to actual 
              experience. Charismatics try to pressure people into believing a 
              lie concerning physical healing by asking a rhetorical question: 
              "Would a loving God ever desire any physical affliction for His 
              children?" Benny Hinn often says publicly that it is wrong to ask 
              God to heal anyone "if it be God's will." His contention that it 
              is always God's will to heal believers ignores the many Scriptures 
              which explain that God often uses physical affliction to 
              discipline and teach or to purify and refine (2 Cor. 12:7-10; 1 
              Pet. 4:12-13; 5: 10).</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">False, 
              unscriptural teachings concerning prayer add to the doctrinal 
              confusion resulting from Charismatic errors. If someone is ill, 
              two or more Charismatics often join hands and voices in prayer, 
              claiming immediate healing for that individual supposedly in 
              accordance with Matthew 18:19—("if two of you shall agree..."), 
              while completely ignoring 1 John 5:14-15— ("if we ask any thing 
              according to His will..." we are assured He will hear and answer). 
              The power of God to heal anyone, anytime, any place, cannot be 
              questioned. But, the false Charismatic teaching that every 
              believer will be healed whenever two or more other believers agree 
              in prayer for his healing is neither Scriptural nor in accordance 
              with reality.</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Furthermore, 
              erroneous Charismatic instruction concerning prayer has 
              increasingly led them to deduce that prayer should emphasize 
              demanding rather than asking. Such a false understanding of the 
              nature and purpose of prayer results in another serious error 
              relative to the question of how believers should approach and deal 
              with Satan or evil spirits. Satan is a powerful and deceptive 
              enemy of every Christian.<B> </B>Sometimes he appears as a 
              "roaring lion," and he is to be resisted (1 Pet. 5:8-10). At other 
              times he and his ministers deceptively appear as "angels of 
              light," and they need to be exposed (2 Cor. 11:14-15). There is no 
              Scriptural basis for current Charismatic teachings that claim 
              believers can and should stomp on Satan, bind Satan, command Satan 
              or demand that he return double all he has stolen. Bible-taught 
              believers will put on all the armor of God in order to stand 
              against the wiles of the devil and quench all his fiery darts 
              (Eph. 6:10-18), and their attitude toward Satan will be that which 
              is set forth in Jude 9. The believer's victory over Satan rests on 
              the basis of obedience to God's Word, not upon the pompous 
              commands of Charismatic deceivers.</P>

              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Another 
              major cause of the theological confusion created by Charismatic 
              teachings has to do with their misunderstanding of the nature, 
              purpose and duration of the spiritual gifts bestowed by the Holy 
              Spirit upon the apostles and some believers in the early church. 
              The apostolic gifts were to authenticate their God-given authority 
              and leadership in the first century church (2 Cor. 12:12). The 
              spiritual gifts bestowed upon other believers were necessary since 
              the written Word of God had not yet been completed. But, even at 
              this early date, there was never any suggestion that one could 
              "learn how" to obtain spiritual gifts, even from an apostle. No, 
              these gifts were divinely bestowed by the Holy Spirit upon 
              individuals of His choice who were to use these special gifts for 
              the benefit of the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:4-11).</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Furthermore, 
              contrary to the teaching of most Pentecostals and Charismatics, 
              the gift of speaking in tongues was not given to every believer (1 
              Cor. 12:30); therefore, it cannot be the visible sign of baptism 
              in the Holy Spirit as they claim. A careful study of the major 
              texts dealing with spiritual gifts—Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 11-13 
              and Ephesians 4—will reveal that much of the confusion caused by 
              Charismatic teaching is a direct result of seven major errors: 
</P>
              <OL>
                <LI>the error of teaching that signs, miracles, wonders, 
                healings, etc. authenticate the message and methods of those who 
                claim to be God's anointed messengers even when they speak and 
                act contrary to the Scriptures; Jesus Christ warned about such 
                in Matthew 7:2 1-23; 
                <LI>the error of making a very selective application of what the 
                Bible says concerning the gifts of the Holy Spirit and a failure 
                to recognize and earnestly desire the best gifts (1 Cor. 12:31; 
                13:13); 
                <LI>the error of misinterpreting the nature, purpose and 
                restrictions concerning speaking in tongues (1 Cor. 14:22-23) 
                and the interpretation of tongues (1 Cor. 14:27-28); 
                <LI>the error of disobeying God's command concerning the 
                Scriptural place and responsibility of women in the local church 
                (1 Cor. 14:34); 
                <LI>the error of failing to recognize that some of the spiritual 
                gifts exercised in the early church were to cease upon the 
                completion of the written Word of God (1 Cor. 13:8-10); 
                <LI>the error of accepting and teaching many unscriptural 
                doctrines on the basis that these are supposedly "new winds of 
                the Holy Spirit" rather than recognizing that they are examples 
                of being "carried about with every wind of [false] doctrine" 
                (Eph. 4:14); 
                <LI>the error of practicing and advocating an unscriptural unity 
                with those who preach a false gospel (such as Roman Catholics 
                and all others who teach baptismal regeneration) rather than 
                separation from false teachers, disobedient brethren and the 
                world (Rom. 16:17; 2 Cor. 6:14-18; Gal. 1:6-9; Eph. 5: 11; 2 
                Tim. 4:1-5; 1 Jn. 2:15-18). </LI></OL><FONT color=#0000ff><I><B>

              Hinn is only one of many top Charismatic leaders who teach and 
              promote current Charismatic errors. All of these leaders claim to 
              be ministering under the anointing of the Holy Spirit; claim to 
              have several or all of the spiritual gifts given to the apostles 
              and early church; appear to have the power to "slay people in the 
              Spirit"; amaze people with their supposed revelations in the 
              exercise of the gifts of prophecy, wisdom and knowledge; claim 
              direct communications from and with God, Jesus Christ and the Holy 
              Spirit and increasingly claim to have received power and authority 
              identical to or even greater than that given to the apostles and 
              prophets of the first century. However, among all these 
              Charismatic leaders, one man stands out above all the rest—Benny 
              Hinn.</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Hinn's 
              rise to the top of the Charismatic ladder is due in large measure 
              to the high esteem in which he is held by Paul and Jan Crouch and 
              their promotion of his ministry and teachings on TBN. Hinn indeed 
              appears to have more raw power than any of his peers, even more 
              than the late Kathryn Kuhlman displayed in her ministry. In his 
              meetings, most of those on whom Hinn lays hands immediately fall 
              backward to the floor. Occasionally, some fail to go down, and he 
              quickly turns away from them. But so strong is his "power" that 
              most people fall to the floor even when he blows or waves his 
              jacket at them. Often Hinn will cause whole sections of the 
              audience or the choir to fall backward in their seats as he claims 
              to be bringing the anointing of the Holy Spirit on them. Such 
              occurrences are usually called "being slain in the Spirit" or 
              "coming under the power." No Scriptural foundation can be found 
              for this, but it has become an integral part of most Charismatic 
              meetings.</P>

              Hinn's ministry thus far provides all the evidence a discerning 
              believer should need to shun his teachings and warn about his 
              ministry. Hinn's first book, <I>Come Holy Spirit, </I>became 
              number one on the best-seller list. However, when several serious 
              doctrinal errors were called to his attention, he offered an 
              apology, and the publisher made changes in subsequent editions. In 
              an interview with <I>Christianity Today </I>in 1991, Hinn admitted 
              that "the entire direction of his ministry is in the midst of a 
              fundamental reform." Sadly, the intervening months have seen Hinn 
              moving further and further in the direction of Charismatic 
              heresies rather than in the direction of Biblical doctrine. He and 
              other Charismatic leaders are deceiving and misleading God's 
              children—hence, the necessity of this warning.</P>

              most dangerous and deceptive claims of false teachers today are 
              based upon their insistence that all they say and do is mandated 
              by God who supposedly communicates His will to them by direct 
              revelation apart from and in addition to the Bible. They attempt 
              to justify even some of their most bizarre words and deeds by 
              false claims such as, "God told me to do it" or, "God revealed 
              this new teaching to me." All such claims are spurious, 
              unscriptural and obviously used in an effort to validate their 
              supposed unique leadership. Saying "God told me..." also seeks to 
              silence any who would expose the hypocrisy and duplicity that 
              inevitably accompanies supposedly extra-biblical revelation. What 
              many people do not realize is that so many of the supposed divine 
              revelations and prophecies given to Charismatic leaders have 
              subsequently proved to be absolutely false. Do not make the 
              mistake of listening to and believing any person who claims a 
              message from God apart from the Bible.<B> </B>We must test

              the end of His earthly ministry, Jesus Christ Himself warned about 
              false prophets and false christs who would deceive many by 
              claiming to perform great miracles, signs and wonders in His name. 
              This raises the question about Benny Hinn and others who are able 
              to show "great signs and wonders" and who claim to do many 
              wonderful works in Christ's name. Does the exercise of 
              supernatural power automatically authenticate the ministry of such 
              a person? Of course not! Here again we have the testimony of Jesus 
              Christ Himself who said: "Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, 
              Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth 
              the will of My Father which is in heaven. Many will say to Me in

              in them." In Matthew 6:22-23 Jesus said, "The light of the body is

              Pentecostal teachings, reviewed this book and Hinn's background in 
              its Spring 1991 publication. The following are excerpts from that 
              article:</P><FONT face=Arial size=2>
              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <P>Benny Hinn claims to have had two visions of Jesus before his 
                conversion. The first was at age 11 when he was asleep. The 
                second occurred when he was 19 during a Charismatic prayer 
                meeting when, says Hinn, "suddenly I saw Jesus with my own 
                eyes." This vision resulted in an immediate conversion. Later, 
                Benny had a powerful experience at a Kathryn Kuhlman service ... 
                after this event Hinn claims to have had numerous, ecstatic and 
                supernatural experiences. Members of his family and others 
                supposedly began crying and even falling down when Benny would 
                enter the room or walk by them. This falling down is known as 
                being "slain in the Spirit"—an experience Hinn regularly effects 
                during his services ... Hinn's practice of slaying people in the 
                Spirit by blowing on them or touching their heads bears all the 
                marks of manipulative staged performances. This should be 
                evident whether or not one admits that there is a valid 
                spiritual experience of being slain in the Spirit. Hinn 
                announces to his congregation to get ready for the experience; 
                he positions "catchers" on the stage to catch those who fall; 
                those who are "slain" lose complete control of themselves, while 
                Hinn remains always firmly in control of himself; at times whole 
                sections of the congregation are "slain" at the same instant, 
                and always at Hinn's cue.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>

              being "slain" by Hinn <I>(Charisma, </I>Jan. 1988, p. 54). By 
              presenting these phenomena as incidental, moderate occurrences,

                <P>Publisher Bruce Barber of Thomas Nelson said they made 
                between twelve and fifteen clarifications because the book led 
                some readers to think that Hinn teaches that there are three 
                separate Gods ... Hinn said that before formal discussions 
                started he announced that "he no longer agreed with what he 
                formerly taught about the spiritual death of Christ." This 
                teaching is not in the book but it was the key bone of 
                contention with CRI. Forms of it are traced back to E. W. Kenyon 
                and forward to some Charismatic teachers. Hinn explained: "I no 
                longer agree that Jesus was born again in Hell. That I did 
                teach. I no longer agree that He went down to the underworld 
                under the control of Satan, which at one time I did teach." Now, 
                when he teaches the spiritual death of Christ, he only means 
                "Jesus was separated from the Father." He said he's dropping 
                this teaching altogether for at least a year, to give himself 
                time to study it further.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
              <P>After this, Hinn wrote another book titled: <I>The Anointing 
              </I>in which he records additional information concerning his own 
              recent ministry. Hinn states:</P>
              <DIR><FONT face=Arial size=2>
              <P>As I've said, my ministry took quantum leaps forward in 1990 
              when the Lord told me to begin monthly miracle crusades around the 
              country, in addition to the regular pastoral ministry at the 
              Orlando Christian Center. There have been many extraordinary 
              events. One that seems to happen in every crusade, usually in the 
              teaching meetings on the morning of the second day is the 
              directive from the Lord to have the people get quiet, with eyes 
              closed and hands raised. The Lord will tell me, "Say' now' and I 
              will touch them." That's all He tells me to do: "Say' now."' It's 
              amazing! I do it, and right away there will be gasps and even 
              screams as the power falls. I open my eyes and invariably 
              two-thirds of the ten thousand or more present collapse onto the 
              floor. Healings of all kinds occur and God makes Himself 
              powerfully known (pp. 86-87).</P></DIR></FONT>

              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">No 
              wonder Hinn's following is rapidly growing, but the question 
              remains: "Is he empowered by the Holy Spirit or by a false 
              spirit?"</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">The 
              following excerpts taken from public statements made by Hinn in 
              the early 1990s will leave no doubt as to the fact that many of 
              his teachings are false and very dangerous. One of the supposed 
              spiritual gifts Benny Hinn claims to exercise is the "word of 
              knowledge" in which he reveals the nature of the illnesses of 
              those being allegedly healed in his large meetings and in his 
              television audience. Sometimes he even mentions the name of the 
              person. This is very impressive and persuasive. What many people 
              do not realize, however, is that taped segments of his miracle 
              healing services are replayed over and over again. Many of Benny 
              Hinn's miracle healing meetings and those of other Charismatic 
              leaders are originally presented live on TBN. Later, however, 
              these same telecasts are broadcast over and over again, most times 
              without any indication that they are reruns. This is very 
              deceitful but is defended on the basis that reruns of "anointed 
              telecasts" are just as "anointed" as the originals. But those 
              viewers who did not see the original telecast would naturally 
              assume that when Hinn calls out the specific healings which he 
              claims the Lord has shown him, they are taking place in the 
              auditorium or in the television audience at that very moment, that 
              this applies to them when they see it days, weeks or months later. 
              When Hinn pleads with those in the television audience to put 
              their hands opposite his stretched out hands on the television 
              screen as a point of contact to "claim their healing, "they are 
              unaware that this is a rerun which could not possibly apply to 
              them or their needs. If Hinn named the name and described the 
              physical need of some person being healed at the time of his 
              original meeting, what application could a replay possibly have 
              days, weeks or months later? TBN also reruns many of its fund 
              raising programs in which unscriptural and fraudulent promises of 
              financial or physical blessings are guaranteed to those who 
              contribute. What a sham! Gross deception is involved here which 
              must be exposed.</P>
              <P 
              style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px">Furthermore, 
              Hinn and other Charismatic leaders who capitalize on this supposed 
              gift of knowledge admit that their "words of knowledge" and their 
              "prophecies" are not 100 percent accurate. Here is Benny Hinn's 
              own amazing admission given on TBN February 23, 1992: "Man, I 
              remember when God would give me words of knowledge back when I 
              began in this ministry, but I missed nine out of ten. Of course, 
              nobody knew it except me." Then Hinn tried to explain this strange 
              inconsistency by saying, "Saints, the Holy Ghost is using an 
              imperfect vessel. Are you listening? We are not infallible. When 
              you give a prophecy, sometimes you can be way off. You have to be 
              open enough to say, 'I blew it."'</P>
              <P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 25px" 
              align=left>Knowing that some would question his false concept in 
              light of the fact that God's faithful Old Testament prophets and 
              New Testament apostles had no such failure record, Hinn actually 
              accused Paul, Moses and Elijah of such shortcomings. Hinn said, 
              "Men of God blew it all the time. Paul blew it; Moses blew it; 
              Elijah blew it; even Elisha blew it. They all blew it. Maybe not 
              the prophecies, but they all blew it in all kinds of things." Hinn 
              then went on to point out personal failures in the lives of these 
              men, but, by his own admission, the words these men of God spoke 
              were not their own-they were the words of the Living God; their 
              prophecies and words of knowledge were always 100 percent 
              accurate.</P>

              align=left>Hinn continued his twisted, confusing conclusions and

              but then as you keep going with it, you get better and better and 
              cleaner and purer with it. So today, with the word of knowledge

              align=left>In September of 1991 at the Anaheim Convention Center, 
              some of Benny Hinn's statements were even more dangerous and

              <P>All of us make mistakes. All of us are bound to err. But woe to 
              the man and woe to the station and woe to the group that will 
              expose the nakedness of the man of God to the world. You know, 
              I'll tell you something. I'm not supposed to, but the Holy Ghost 
              is upon me, and I think I need to. The day is coming when those 
              that attack us will drop dead. You say, "What did you say?" I 
              speak this under the anointing of the Spirit. Can I tell you 
              something? Don't touch God's servants; it's deadly. God says, 
              "Touch not My anointed." I'm not afraid to tell you what I think. 
              I owe nothing to no man and don't you dare touch Morris Cerullo; 
              don't touch Rex Humbard; don't touch Billy Graham; don't touch 
              Larry Lea; don't touch Oral Roberts or Richard Roberts; don't 
              touch them. Pray for them. Pray, pray, pray! I speak this under 
              the anointing. Woe to you that touch God's servants. You are going 
              to pay, and the day will come (the Lord said this to me) when I 
              will punish instantly those who touch My chosen. They will fear 
              us. Hear this! Today they mock us; tomorrow they will fear us. 
              When you deal with the supernatural as I do, God allows your eyes 
              to see things that most of you don't see and maybe that you should 
              not see.</P></DIR></FONT>

              statements such as these do not sound an alarm as to the direction 
              in which Hinn is headed, perhaps nothing will. The way in which 
              Hinn twisted and misapplied the Scriptures with regard to the 
              attitude God expects His children to manifest toward God's leaders 
              is shocking, yet this false view is widely held today. God's 
              command to "touch not" His anointed refers to seeking vengeance or 
              causing physical harm. Certainly it cannot be Scripturally applied 
              to the exercise of spiritual reproof or rebuke. In fact, the 
              latter is commanded by God Himself (2 Tim. 4:1-2). Note the 
              reproof of King Saul by the prophet Samuel and the rebuke of Peter 
              by Paul (1 Sam. 15; Gal. 2). Hinn's threatenings against faithful 
              believers who "speak the truth in love"—those who not only 
              proclaim the Truth but also expose error wherever it may be 
              found—merely reveals how desperate he has become in his efforts to 
              defend and justify his false claims and false teachings.</P>

              unlike other Christian broadcasting stations, does not depend upon 
              income from their broadcasters to meet station expenses. The 
              millions of dollars they raise each year by their semiannual 
              financial appeals makes it possible for them to give free time or 
              reduced rates to those who will help build their Charismatic 
              empire. Furthermore, their financial appeals are both deceitful 
              and unscriptural, promising contributors that God will bless them 
              financially if they give sacrificially to TBN. In their most 
              recent financial appeals, Hinn, John Avanzini and other TBN 
              regulars have been promising contributors that not only is healing 
              for their bodies included in the atonement but also financial 
              prosperity and a debt-free existence. This amounts to raising 
              funds by fraudulent means and would certainly subject TBN to legal 
              prosecution if it were not accomplished under a religious 
              umbrella.</P>

              other false claims and false teachings can be expected in the 
              future? God's Word warns that "evil men and seducers shall wax 
              worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived" (2 Tim. 3:13). To 
              a Charismatic audience in Vancouver, British Columbia, Hinn said, 
              "I want to make a shocking statement-you are gods ... Are you a 
              child of God? What does that make you? Ye are gods." This was, 
              indeed, a shocking assertion but not a true one. Hinn attempted to 
              prove his claim by twisting and misapplying Psalm 82. This is the

              claims and extravagant lifestyles of Charismatic leaders like 
              Larry Lea, W. V. Grant, Robert Tilton and, more recently, of Benny 
              Hinn. Although we know that the secular media is no friend of 
              genuine Christianity, it is sad that it took unsaved liberals to 
              blow the whistle on these world-renowned leaders. Of course, their 
              own fellow Charismatics would not dare to reveal these unsavory 
              policies and practices since most of them are involved in the same 
              kind of chicanery themselves. It is amazing that Oral Roberts, who

              bleed money from gullible Christians even after his major 
              projects, which he claimed were mandated by God, have gone into 
              bankruptcy. His latest fund-raising effort, in which he is joined 
              by his son, Richard Roberts, promises a "double portion anointing" 
              to all who send a gift at this time. The Roberts' appeal letter 
              promises that this anointing "breaks the yoke of sin, sickness, 
              disease, fear, poverty, demons, doubt, discouragement, 
              depression—anything and everything that is unlike God." What a 
              deceitful hoax! How any true believer can support and defend such 
              Charismatic leaders can only be due to their loss of spiritual 
              discernment that enables Satan and his angels of light to hide

              individuals are to be classified as false teachers no matter how 
              often their false claims are given "in the name of Christ." We 
              should pray for all who have been taken captive by the snares of 
              the devil, and we must follow God's Word in our attitude toward 
              all men (2 Tim. 3:15; 4:1-8). It could be that some who are mixed 
              up in this delusion might really be saved, but if they are then 
              they are also terribly deceived. The most loving thing that can be 
              done is to warn them of the dangers and point them to the 
              Scriptures that clearly refute Charismatic error. If we keep quiet 
              instead of "speaking the truth in love" as we are commanded, then 
              we are guilty of not caring for those for whom Christ died (see
