Benny Hinn?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=center><STRONG>by G. Richard Fisher and M. Kurt Goedelman</STRONG></P>
<P>There is no doubt that lies sell and are more popular than truth in this day 
and age. </P>
<P>A popular Hollywood film a few years back featured Jim Carrey playing a 
congenital liar who is forced to tell only the truth for a time. Carrey’s 
character is subject to all kinds of hysterics and self-flagellation as he tries 
to resist the urge to prevaricate.</P>
<P>Benny Hinn, who claims to be “one of the great healing evangelists,” is much 
like Carrey’s lawyer character: he just cannot tell all the truth all the time. 
He claims to have an especially deep relationship with the Holy Spirit. Hinn 
even explains away his lack of formal Bible training by claiming that during his 
purported early encounters with the Spirit, “I was receiving an education 
greater than any university or seminary could offer. My teacher was the Spirit 
Himself.”<SUP>1</SUP> It is a wonder then how Hinn can be so mired in 
heresy.</P>
<P>Hinn is a phenomenon of our times. Sadly, many Christians demand heroes and 
icons and for many of them, Hinn answers the call. His broadcasts are full of 
self-serving tributes to his claimed spiritual stature and impact. In spite of 
his many goofs, gaffes and media troubles, he still manages to enchant people. 
False prophecy, heresy and necromancy do not slow the <I>Hinn Express</I>. He 
continues to sweep thousands off their feet — literally, as his followers 
succumb to what Thomas Upham called “sympathetic imitation” and are willing to 
fall on command.<SUP>2</SUP></P>
<P>Hinn’s critics try to force him “to tell the truth” by comparing his 
contradictory public statements and outright lies with documented facts. At 
times, Hinn allows his underlings to apologize or offer alibis for his 
slip-ups.<SUP>3</SUP> Hinn, at other times, simply alters his claims in newly 
released material.</P>
<P>However, even in the revisions and updates, Hinn can’t get it right. The 
careful observer can only wonder if Hinn has been fibbing for so long that he is 
incapable of telling the whole truth and of functioning within the bounds of 
reality. He is a serial prevaricator whose followers don’t seem to notice or 
care. No one around him or within his organization holds him accountable. </P>
<P>In the last decade, Hinn has promised to reform as often as a politician in 
an election year. A video titled <I>The Many Faces of Benny Hinn</I>, helps 
spell out the dilemma. Similarly, the title of PFO’s volume on Hinn captures him 
as a man in a world of deep confusion. There is no reason to believe what Hinn 
says about anything. It is a serious venture to claim to speak for God in the 
manner of prophecies and visions as does Hinn.</P>
<P align=center>WHO TOUCHED WHOM?</P>
<P>In his latest autobiography, <I>He Touched Me</I>, Hinn continues to compound 
contradictions and falsehoods that have been documented in previous articles in 
<I>The Quarterly Journal</I>. The adage, “You can’t tell a book by its cover,” 
applies to Hinn’s latest one. The golden-hued dust jacket is graced with Hinn’s 
subdued face as he would have us believe that he has been touched by God in some 
unique and special way. The back cover says Hinn’s life story “reveals what can 
happen when one person becomes totally yielded to the Holy Spirit.”</P>
<P>Upon examination of the book, however, one can see that Hinn again has 
misrepresented his life story. While these lies are certainly creative and 
artful, they remain lies.</P>
<P>Hinn’s stories keep shifting and changing until one wonders if he ever will 
get it right. Parts of Hinn’s new biography get closer to the truth while other 
parts carry on the deception and give new versions of old stories. </P>
<P>Hinn says that as a young child he underwent a “time of intense religious 
instruction” by Catholic nuns who “had a great spiritual influence” on him. His 
learning included being able to pray “the Nicene Creed.”<SUP>4</SUP> Yet, the 
influence of the Nicene Creed is not apparent in Hinn’s description of the 
Trinity: “If I can shock you, and maybe I should. There are nine of 
them.”<SUP>5</SUP></P>
<P>Whatever differences evangelical and fundamentalist Christians have with 
Roman Catholics, they all share a belief in three persons in the Godhead, not 
nine. Finis Dake’s annotated reference Bible, not any Catholic nuns or Greek 
Orthodox teaching, is the source of this particular idea. </P>
<P>Hinn also has employed other unorthodox influences. At the same time Dake’s 
teachings were influencing his theology, Hinn advanced the heretical teachings 
of the Word Faith movement when he taught “He who is the nature of God became 
the nature of Satan when He became sin”<SUP>6</SUP> and “Jesus Christ knew the 
only way He would stop Satan is by becoming one in nature with him. He [Jesus] 
did not take my sin, He became my sin.”<SUP>7</SUP> </P>
<P align=center>ALTERED STATES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS</P>
<P>Hinn now admits that some boyhood tales in <I>Good Morning, Holy Spirit</I> 
were not recalled correctly. In the early book, he told of a “dream” his mother 
had in which she had “six beautiful roses.”<SUP>8</SUP> In this dream, Jesus 
appeared and asked for one of the roses. In the version of the dream Hinn told 
to his Orlando church in 1987, he said, “There were eight roses in her hand and 
Jesus came and said, ‘One of them belongs to me.’”<SUP>9</SUP></P>
<P>In the new telling of the purported vision, Hinn explains that his mother 
recently “explained it was about lilies,”<SUP>10</SUP> not roses. Despite the 
change in number and flower species, Hinn’s interpretation of the dream remains 
consistent — and herein lies the question as to its divine source and precise 
interpretation. Hinn now explains the dream of “six beautiful lilies” in his 
mother’s hand as:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“When she awakened, Clemence [his mother] asked herself, What does this 
  dream mean? What can it be? Eventually, our family was to have six boys and 
  two girls, yet my mother never forgot her bargain with God. ‘Benny,’ she said, 
  ‘you were the lily I presented to Jesus.’”<SUP>11</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hinn suggests the single flower requested by Jesus in the dream symbolizes 
his call and life as a minister. The problem with Hinn’s (or his mother’s) 
interpretation lies in the fact that Benny is not the only member of his family 
to have become a minister. Four other brothers — Willie, Henry, Sammy and 
Michael — are pastors and evangelists. Why then did Jesus only ask for one 
flower when five of Clemence Hinn’s sons would eventually devote themselves to 
full-time ministry work? Perhaps Hinn’s Jesus is a casualty of open theism or 
process theology — not knowing what the future would hold. Some may say that the 
number and type of flowers, and the dream’s interpretation type is a minor 
issue. Perhaps, but it still does beg the question: How could one misconstrue a 
vision from God? </P>
<P>Then, too, one can ask: How many other tales and claimed revelations were 
misremembered, embellished or complete fiction? Hinn’s more bizarre stories 
often have no witnesses or support whatsoever. And when there are claims of 
videotape evidence, none actually exists.</P>
<P align=center>A MAYOR NO MORE</P>
<P>Sometime following the 1982 death of his father, Hinn began to say that 
during his childhood his father, Costandi, was the “mayor” of Jaffa, 
Israel.<SUP>12</SUP> PFO knew that neither before nor after 1952 (the year Benny 
was born) was there a mayor of Jaffa named Hinn. Israeli historian Dan Kurzman 
tells us that at the time of the 1948 War in Israel, “Jaffa was left virtually 
leaderless.”<SUP>13</SUP> From that point on, Kurzman states, “Jaffa ... became 
a Jewish suburb”<SUP>14</SUP> with <I>Jewish</I> mayors. Costandi Hinn was an 
Arab, which alone precluded him from such an office. </P>
<P>When Hinn’s untruth was exposed by PFO, he scrambled for excuses and alibis. 
For a while he retreated to the claim that his father was only the “unofficial 
mayor” of Jaffa. Then he blamed his book’s publisher and said he tried to 
correct it prior to publication. Hinn apparently has now even abandoned this 
latter claim since it too has been disproven. He has never admitted that the 
claim was an outright lie. </P>
<P>In his new autobiography, Hinn now says his father “can best be described as 
a liaison between the community and the Israeli government.”<SUP>15</SUP> 
Throughout the book, he then ascribes to his father a host of various 
occupations and responsibilities: postal service employee,<SUP>16</SUP> Red 
Cross worker,<SUP>17</SUP> fruit inspector at the Jaffa port,<SUP>18</SUP> 
president of the Greek Orthodox Club,<SUP>19</SUP> movie projectionist for the 
club<SUP>20</SUP> and, following the family’s 1968 move to Canada, insurance 
salesman,<SUP>21</SUP> all of which are a far cry from the political position 
once claimed for him.</P>
<P>Yet, Hinn maintains the pretense that his father held a “unique position in 
the community” and persists in describing him “as a liaison between the 
community and Israeli government.”<SUP>22</SUP> He also maintains he “was deeply 
touched that my father had earned such respect and trust from the Israeli 
government,”<SUP>23</SUP> which is still an undocumented claim.</P>
<P>After Israel re-established itself a nation in 1948, the Arabs of Jaffa (as 
well as Arabs in other parts of the country) were a hated, suspected and 
oppressed security risk to the Israelis. Any history of Palestine in the 1930s 
will establish that the Arab riots in Jaffa, Hebron and other places, leading to 
the Arab massacre of Jews, are remembered to this day. In Jaffa during the time 
of Hinn’s youth Arabs had to get security clearance to perform even the most 
menial jobs because of continuing Israeli animosity toward them. </P>
<P>Two other major factors, which Hinn has forgotten or is unaware, should be 
mentioned as they militate against any Israeli acceptance of Arabs being in any 
way acceptable to Jews during the 1940s and 1950s. First, the Arabs of Israel 
aggravated Jewish hatred and fear by overtly backing Nazi Germany during World 
War II.<SUP>24</SUP> This never has been forgotten.</P>
<P>Second, the Arab-Jewish fighting, bombing and killing, so fierce in the 1930s 
and 1940s, finally came to a head with Israel’s 1948 War of Independence. The 
hatred continues today. In spite of the repeated attempts by the leadership for 
peace throughout the past five decades, the hostility amidst these people can 
and has erupted at any instant — and without warning. No one familiar with 
Israel’s political climate would believe for a moment that Hinn’s father would 
have been treated with “respect and trust” or as an equal by the Israelis.</P>
<P>Hinn actually — perhaps unknowingly — provides for readers insight into the 
socio-economic status of his father and family when he writes: “My father didn’t 
own an automobile the entire time we lived in Israel — he either walked to work 
or took public transportation.”<SUP>25</SUP> A mayor or even a “government 
liaison” would be expected to have a car and driver (as do politicians in Israel 
today) and not be left to walk or take a bus to work.</P>
<P>Moreover, Hinn says, “We were not a wealthy family.”<SUP>26</SUP> Hinn’s 
family left Israel for Canada virtually penniless and was dependent upon the 
sponsorship and goodwill of agencies recommended by the Greek Orthodox Church 
and a neighboring family.<SUP>27</SUP> There was no status or good life but 
rather, as described by Hinn himself, just the opposite. This is not to say that 
poverty is bad but that one should tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth. </P>
<P align=center>BENNY GIBRAN?</P>
<P>Hinn in some ways resembles the late Kahlil Gibran. Gibran was a charmer who 
used others for material gain. Both Gibran and Hinn are best-selling authors 
(with good editors) who have gained a large following. Gibran composed a tall 
tale of being a child of “fortune” growing up in a very well-to-do home of 
culture and love. Many still hold onto Gibran’s myth. However, in fact, Gibran 
was raised in “a harsh life of poverty, with a cruel overbearing father, a 
drunkard who bullied his family.”<SUP>28</SUP></P>
<P>Gibran, like Hinn, was born in the Middle East in an Arabic culture. Gibran 
was Lebanese, Hinn is Palestinian. Exaggeration of pedigree is a way of life all 
over that region. While a Bible believer would say one should not lie about his 
parentage, the Middle Easterner is conditioned in a tradition (of fabricating) 
that is looked upon as honorable. Even conversion to Christianity does not 
change that for some. For believers, words cannot be spoken just to appease 
others but must correspond to reality. </P>
<P align=center>THIS OLD HOUSE</P>
<P>Hinn now also admits that his nine-member family lived in three rooms on the 
ground floor of a building owned by the Greek Orthodox Church.<SUP>29</SUP> This 
is a far cry from his previous description that, “We lived comfortably. Dad’s 
position in government made it possible for us to have a home in the suburbs. It 
was a wonderful home.”<SUP>30</SUP> Strangely though, Hinn qualifies his 
admission by interjecting, “there was ample room.”<SUP>31</SUP> Once again, we 
are confronted with Hinn’s ongoing childhood delusions since the reality of nine 
people living in three rooms would hardly be “ample room.” One can only imagine 
the conditions with seven children living in one bedroom.</P>
<P>Moreover, the location was less than “wonderful” in a minority Arab area of a 
run-down and neglected section of the city. PFO visited the building that housed 
the Hinn basement home in Jaffa. The visit confirmed the idea that conditions 
were crowded. Jaffa neighbors interviewed by PFO talked of poverty there. The 
only attractive thing about the neighborhood is that at the end of the street 
one has a magnificent view of the Mediterranean Sea. And even though the house 
is within view of the Mediterranean, the harsh realities of life in Jaffa in 
that era cannot be wished away. The oppression of the Arab minority is well 
documented and easily proven.</P>
<P>When Hinn’s claims went unchecked, he was able to refer to the house on Ibn 
Rashad street as “a home in the suburbs. It was a wonderful home.” The truth 
that Hinn has been forced to confess is that his family only occupied the ground 
floor of the building which housed the Greek Orthodox Club. He further admits, 
“By the time I was a teen, our bedroom in Jaffa began to resemble a hospital 
ward.”<SUP>32</SUP></P>
<P align=center>TRUTH IS BETTER THAN FICTION</P>
<P>In the past, PFO has been threatened by Hinn’s attorneys over its exposés of 
his exaggerated and false statements. Yet now Hinn is conforming at least parts 
of his story to that which in the past his lawyers said had been misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>Rather than try to keep the pretense going, Hinn perhaps could have gotten 
far more traction with the truth: “Poor Arab boy and high school dropout makes 
good.” Somehow he just seems driven to fabricate his pedigree and spiritual 
experiences. Perhaps all his lies and exaggerations are his way of responding to 
a childhood of humiliation.<SUP>33</SUP> In reality, his new autobiography is 
really just a revision and rewrite of his testimony tapes and a previous 
best-seller, <I>Good Morning, Holy Spirit</I>. </P>
<P>Hinn continues to assert what he labels “a horrible stuttering 
problem”<SUP>34</SUP> as a young child up until the time he was called into 
ministry. This, too, has been a claim that PFO has challenged. Hinn’s response 
has been to misrepresent PFO’s assertions. Hinn says PFO claims he never 
stuttered. PFO never denied that Hinn stuttered; it only questioned the severity 
of his stuttering. </P>
<P>While still trying to claim he was a reclusive, shy, backward stutterer as a 
child, Hinn now says that as a boy he put on shows, productions and 
song-and-dance routines.<SUP>35</SUP> He tells how he loved to strut among his 
mother’s family and rattle off memorized parts from TV shows. He writes:</P>
<P>“At their house I became an extrovert. ‘When are you going to put on the 
show?’ my little cousins begged. They were talking about a skit, or a 
‘production’ I organized every year during our visit. During those years there 
was a popular television comedy program in the region titled, <I>Doctor, Doctor, 
Follow Me!</I> We did our own version of the show — complete with song-and-dance 
routines. You should have seen us — me, Willie, Chris and our cousins 
entertaining a room full of cheering, exuberant relatives.”<SUP>36</SUP></P>
<P>At his relative’s home, gone is the fear and reclusive behavior that he 
claimed dominated his youth. This, too, is the way teenage friends remember him 
in Canada. A showman — sometimes rattling off memorized material — not the 
fearful, tongue-tied, shy, inhibited, reclusive, backward child Hinn repeatedly 
claims to have been.</P>
<P>Hinn goes on to say, “When I was seventeen or eighteen, I believed that some 
day I would go into politics, or perhaps find employment in the travel 
industry.”<SUP>37</SUP> Both occupations are quite ill-suited for a young man 
allegedly crippled with a shattered self-image and humiliation. </P>
<P>Later in the book, he appears to rationalize by claiming a temporary nature 
to his affliction: “There had always been times when I could speak without a 
noticeable problem for a short period before something set the stuttering off 
again.”<SUP>38</SUP> Nevertheless, his admissions in the book reveal a new Hinn 
— a Hinn which PFO previously discovered in personal interviews with Hinn’s 
boyhood acquaintances. It is the same Hinn that as a young man told a Toronto 
newspaper, “I’m an artist. I’ve always been an artist.”<SUP>39</SUP></P>
<P align=center>HABITUAL INCONSISTENCIES</P>
<P>As Hinn assembles his narratives, he has a propensity to misstate or confuse 
facts stated in previous accounts of the same events. His problem arises from 
his inability to recall his earlier versions of a story. <I>He Touched Me</I> 
offers more examples.</P>
<P>For example, Hinn has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue of his secondary 
(high) school education. He had claimed to have been a senior in 1972 at Georges 
Vanier Secondary School in Toronto.<SUP>40</SUP> When it was revealed that 
school records showed him to be an undergraduate in 1972 and a dropout before 
graduation, Hinn replied: “I never said I was a senior, period. Anywhere. It’s 
not in my book. All I mention in my book is that I got saved in high school in 
February of 1972.”<SUP>41</SUP> Now Hinn has returned himself to his original 
standing. In <I>He Touched Me</I>, he writes: “During my senior year at Georges 
Vanier... .”<SUP>42</SUP></P>
<P>The current offering of Hinn’s conversion experience likewise disagrees with 
earlier versions. While Hinn’s description of the event in <I>He Touched Me</I> 
parallels his former account in <I>Good Morning, Holy Spirit</I>, it still 
contains conspicuous differences from an early account. Hinn writes in his <I>He 
Touched Me</I>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“The next morning I awoke early and rushed off to school before class 
  began. I needed to study in the library. I was seated at a large table, 
  concentrating on my work, when a small group of students approached me. 
  Immediately, I knew they were the same ones who had been giving me all this 
  ‘Jesus talk.’ ‘Would you like to join us in our morning prayer meeting?’ one 
  of them asked. They pointed to a room that was just off the library. I 
  thought, <I>Well, perhaps I’ll get them off my back if I agree. After all, one 
  little prayer meeting isn’t going to hurt me.”</I><SUP>43</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Previously Hinn reported the event this way:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“I go into school, open my locker, get my books, a girl shows up called, 
  Michelle. ... She looked a little strange, a little like, you know, flying, 
  spacey. Michelle said, with this big smile, she said, ‘Would you come to a 
  prayer meeting?’ I said, ‘Well, Michelle, I—I, you know it’s only ten 
  minutes.’ It was like quarter to eight, and class begins at eight. And you 
  know, here I’m stuttering back trying to tell her I can’t. She said, you know, 
  she said, ‘It would really be nice if you’ll come.’ Took me by the hand and 
  pulled me to the prayer meeting.”<SUP>44</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hinn’s former narrative was a single-student encounter at a school locker. 
More recently the story has evolved to a multi-student confrontation in the 
school library. Regardless of which report Hinn says is true, the more serious 
concern is lack of a clear Gospel presentation at Hinn’s “prayer meeting” 
conversion. Each version is grossly inadequate when it comes to this vital 
issue. Hinn currently describes the episode:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Suddenly, every member of the group raised their hands toward heaven and 
  began to pray in languages I’d never heard before. My eyes became the size of 
  saucers. These were students I had known in my classes — now talking to God 
  with sounds I did not understand. ... My mind flashed back to Bob in the 
  kiosk, saying, ‘You’ve got to meet Jesus. You’ve got to meet Him!’ Meet Him? I 
  thought I already knew Him. ... In the middle of the room, I closed my eyes 
  and spoke four words that changed my life forever. Out loud I said, ‘Lord 
  Jesus, come back.’ I had no idea why those were the only words that came out 
  of my mouth. Again, I said, ‘Lord Jesus, come back.’ ... Then I said to the 
  Lord, ‘Come into my heart.’ And what a glorious moment that was! His power was 
  cleansing me from the inside out. I felt absolutely clean and pure. Suddenly, 
  in a moment of time, I saw Jesus. There He was. Jesus, the Son of 
  God.”<SUP>45</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As his classmates babbled in tongues, Hinn suggests a genuine conversion 
experience. Absent, however, from the event is any distinct presentation and 
understanding of man’s sinfulness and God’s offer of forgiveness through the 
sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our need for repentance and faith, and the cost of 
our faith and obedience. Hinn’s chronicle is nothing but a mystical, 
easy-believe conversion. But, perhaps, this like other facets of his life 
profile may well change and evolve in the coming years and in its retelling.</P>
<P align=center>DIVORCING KATHRYN</P>
<P>In his latest book, Hinn appears to be distancing himself from Kathryn 
Kuhlman, the woman whom he has said meant so much to his life and ministry. Hinn 
writes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Many times, I’ve been asked, ‘Benny, tell me about Miss Kuhlman. What was 
  she like?’ They are surprised when I say, ‘Oh, I never had the opportunity to 
  meet Kathryn personally.’ Looking back on my journey to Pittsburgh, I believe 
  what happened that day was in God’s providence. As I told members of my staff 
  recently, had I met Kathryn it is possible that I would have forever believed 
  she gave the anointing to me, or that God may have used her in some way to 
  transfer it to me.”<SUP>46</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This, now, is from the man who in the past has visited the burial site of 
Kuhlman where he claims her anointing still lingers — even to the place where 
people are actually healed from visiting the grave.<SUP>47</SUP> Hinn also says 
Kuhlman appears to him in dreams and visions. In one report, she supposedly 
revealed to him a revelation of a heightened level of the miraculous — “greater 
things for the glory of God” — coming to his ministry.<SUP>48</SUP></P>
<P>If Hinn is truly beginning to downplay the significance of Kuhlman in his 
ministry, one can only wonder if Oral Roberts will be next. A three-hour video, 
<I>Miracles: Yesterday, Today &amp; Forever</I>, produced in 1994 by Hinn’s 
organization, emphasizes the influence of Roberts’ life and healing ministry on 
Hinn and suggests that Roberts has passed his mantle to Hinn.</P>
<P align=center>OTHER WHITEWASH</P>
<P>Hinn also uses his new biography to neutralize damaging reports and episodes 
during recent years. An illustration of this is in his description of the death 
of longtime aide David Delgado. Hinn says “Dave was converted from a life of 
drug addiction and became a personal assistant to me.”<SUP>49</SUP> He then 
writes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Later in his life, after becoming deathly ill with hepatitis, he died 
  prematurely. His death was a mystery to his family, our staff, and myself. 
  Although reports of a drug relapse came to our attention following his death, 
  knowing David as I did — and how deeply he loved God — I can only leave the 
  circumstance of his passing in the hands of the 
Lord.”<SUP>50</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For over a year, knowledge of Delgado’s death and another heroin-related 
death of a ministry staff member were concealed by law-enforcement and Hinn’s 
church officials. While Hinn asserts Delgado’s death “a mystery,” Delgado’s 
widow, Mary, revealed that her husband knew he was dying from cirrhosis of the 
liver, which can be a side effect of heroin abuse.</P>
<P>More alarming is the fact that according to the Orange County (Fla.) 
sheriff’s records, at the time of his death, Delgado was under suspicion for the 
heroin-related death of ministry staff member Sydney Williams. Williams died in 
November 1997 at his Florida home after injecting himself with a large dose of 
heroin. Before his own death, Delgado was being investigated in Williams’ death 
because Williams appeared to have been drugged following a visit to Delgado’s 
home.</P>
<P>Hinn’s shaded narration of Delgado’s death is also inconsistent with a lofty 
claim of deliverance from drug addiction. During a miracle crusade, Hinn drew 
attention to Delgado and told followers that Delgado was one of his “right-hand 
men” and announced:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“This guy at one time was on drugs. ... He was a — he used to sell drugs. 
  His father is a preacher. He rebelled against God. He used to attend Kathryn 
  Kuhlman services in New York City. She used to come and minister to Teen 
  Challenge when he was there with Dave Wilkerson. And Kathryn one day said 
  there’s somebody that God wants to set free from drugs. And David said, ‘Huh 
  uh, I’m not going.’ But a few years ago, standing in our church he said, 
  ‘Lord, I love drugs. Unless you take that thing out of me, I’m going to die.’ 
  <I>And God took the desire right out of him.”</I><SUP>51</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Another whitewash is his description of his October 1998 service at “The 
Pond” in Anaheim, Calif. Hinn described this event at the service:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“That night I felt led to ask my children to come to the platform — I was 
  going to introduce them to the audience. However, God had something else in 
  mind. The moment they approached me in the center of the stage, the anointing 
  became so strong that when I turned toward them, all four of my children fell 
  to the floor. There were Jessica, Natasha, Joshua, and Eleasha, slain in the 
  Spirit by the power of God. It was a beautiful sight, and I began to weep 
  before the Lord.”<SUP>52</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here, Hinn demonstrates just how far from reality he can take his readers. A 
videotape of that evening’s service shows Hinn to be a man out of control. His 
stage mannerisms and voice inflections would strike mortal fear into most 
individuals. It was not a simple matter of wanting to bring his children on 
stage for an introduction. “<I>Get my children up here! ... Get my wife up 
here!,”</I> he wildly commanded in a deep voice. As his family was ushered onto 
the stage, bodies were already strewn across the platform. Once onstage, his 
wife, Suzanne, and daughters and son were also subjected to the same intense and 
forceful handling. “<I>Fire, I said! Fire, I said! Fire, I said!</I>,” he 
screamed as he brought his family under the subjection of his “Fire” 
anointing.<SUP>53</SUP> </P>
<P>It is quite suspicious to see Hinn’s wife Suzanne, falling in a controlled 
manner on cue and adjusting her jacket as she lays on the stage.</P>
<P>In <I>He Touched Me</I>, he evaluates the event by claiming, “God did an 
amazing work that night. When they returned to Orlando their Christian witness 
took on a boldness we had never seen — and the effects of that meeting are still 
evident.”<SUP>54</SUP> The last part of Hinn’s comment may well be one of the 
more honest statements he has ever made. The harsh and abusive conduct by Hinn 
toward his family — which is a clear reality on the crusade’s video highlights — 
could very well have left “effects of the meeting [which] are still 
evident.”</P>
<P>Over the years, and as his ministry has grown to a multi-million dollar 
enterprise and thus come under closer scrutiny, Hinn has nuanced and shaded his 
legacy of false doctrine, false prophecies, lies and exaggerations. <I>He 
Touched Me</I> is really just another volume to sell and help subsidize his 
grand empire. In reality, Hinn’s professed calling as a minister continues to be 
contrary to the Word of God:</P>

  <P>“Since an overseer is entrusted with God’s work, he must be blameless — not 
  overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not 
  pursuing dishonest gain. Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is 
  good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. He must hold 
  firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can 
  encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it” (Titus 
  1:7-9).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
