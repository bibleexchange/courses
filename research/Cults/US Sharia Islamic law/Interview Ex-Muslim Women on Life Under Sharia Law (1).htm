<P>
<P>For 30 years, Nonie Darwish lived under sharia law as a Muslim in Egypt. 
After moving to the United States, she became a follower of Jesus Christ and 
quietly lived the American dream. 
<P>But the 9/11 terrorist attacks awakened her to the threat of Islamic 
terrorism and spurred her to research what the Quran, sharia law, and Muslim 
religious literatures actually teach its followers. 
<P>Her latest book, Cruel and Usual Punishment: The Terrifying Global 
Implication of Islamic Law, dives into the history of sharia law and what it 
calls for, and examines the global campaign that aims to install the legal 
system in Western countries, including the United States. 
<P>The following are excerpts from a recent Christian Post interview with 
Darwish. 
<P><FONT color=blue><B>CP:</B></FONT> In the North West Frontier Province, 
Pakistan, sharia law was recently enacted in exchange for terrorist groups to 
stop their violent campaign in the region and to establish what the local 
government is claiming to be “peace.” To many westerners unfamiliar with sharia 
law, the system appears to be just strict Muslim laws and seems like a good 
bargain for an end to terrorist-instigated violence. What don’t Westerners 
understand about sharia law and what do they need to understand about the 
dangers of imposing sharia in Pakistan? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> Unfortunately, sharia - even in Muslim countries - is so 
against human nature that it has to be imposed by force because often it is 
rejected. So wherever you see sharia being practiced, it has always come and 
existed in that society through violence. 
<P>So the same dynamic is happening in Western Europe now. Muslims always use 
the word “impose” sharia. They never say let’s pass sharia, no, they say let’s 
impose sharia. The word impose is used. 
<P>It’s very important to the West before they start considering sharia as a 
religious right for Muslims to know what it is. 
<P>I don’t believe that sharia is a religious right. The West must really define 
what is a religious right and one of the basics in my opinion is that it does 
not hurt non-members of that religion. You can have all the religious rights you 
want but if your right to practice your religion violates the human rights of 
other people then that ceases to be a religious right. 
<P>Sharia law violates the human rights of women, of non-Muslims because it is 
part and parcel of sharia law to discriminate against non-Muslims. The 
commandment to do jihad is perhaps the centerpiece of Islam. It is not just the 
duty of a Muslim individual to do jihad, it is the duty of the Muslim head of 
state. 
<P>According to sharia books and mainstream Islam, the definition of jihad is 
“to war against non-Muslims to establish the religion.” 
<P>So after 9/11 in America a lot of Muslims appeared on Western TV and said no 
the meaning of jihad does not mean violence, it means an inner struggle, 
self-analysis. But the truth is they are denying what the word jihad really 
means. 
<P>Jihad 97 percent of the time when it is mentioned in the Quran it refers to 
violence, annihilation, subjugation, humiliation, [and] subdue. So the word 
jihad almost always comes in the context of aggression. 
<P>If you read the Quran or Muslim scriptures, jihad is really the centerpiece 
of the ideology, which is the constant growth of Islam. In sharia books, it is 
one of the main jobs of Muslim heads of states to do offensive and aggressive 
jihad, especially against neighboring non-Muslim countries. 
<P>That means the sovereignty of neighboring countries are not really respected 
by Islam. And that law can explain to us why the Arab conflicts exist. 
<P>There is a story in the book about a young woman who was gang raped by seven 
men in Saudi Arabia who was sentenced to flogging because she was seen talking 
with a man not her relative. As a westerner, this is a mind-boggling unfair 
justice system. Can you say if this only happens in a few extreme countries or 
just in a few cases? How widespread is this? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> I heard that the men who raped her were punished. I think, 
but I’m not sure, they got some jail time. But when men rape women they don’t 
get beheaded, but if a women gets raped and cannot prove rape because if she is 
not a virgin anymore and cannot prove rape then she is considered to be a major 
violator and she will be beheaded. 
<P>Under sharia law, for a woman to prove that she has not committed adultery, 
she can only prove rape by having four male witnesses. So how can a woman prove 
rape? She can’t. How can she get four male witnesses? 
<P>So what happens is usually men who commit rape are either not proven or they 
will not get punished as much as she will get punished. 
<P>Muslim countries range from extreme countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, and 
then very moderate countries like Turkey, and all in between. But unfortunately, 
sharia can apply unofficially. So the beheading done in Saudi Arabia, or the 
stoning, can happen in Turkey unofficially by her family. 
<P>So sharia can happen in a Muslim country or in a Muslim family in Europe. 
They can do honor killing. 
<P><FONT color=blue><B>CP:</B></FONT> You made an intriguing observation that 
Muslim woman living under sharia law are in an odd predicament because they are 
like prisoners who guard their own jail cells. Could you explain what you mean? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> Islam gives no way out of the prison for women. For example, 
a woman can be beaten by her husband, she has no right for divorce, her 
testimony in court is half the value of the man, her inheritance is half what 
her brother gets, she cannot leave the house officially without her husband’s 
permission, she cannot do anything without her husband’s permission – she cannot 
leave the country. 
<P>So the rights of a woman in the Muslim world is so so weak. Even if she gets 
raped, she is the one to blame. So in order for a woman to have some sort of 
dignity, she must act as radical if not even more radical than men. She must act 
as if she is the guardian of Islam, the guardian of her own prison. She becomes 
an advocate for obedience of women to Islam. She will actually report on girls 
who don’t cover their heads. 
<P>The predicament of women is it divides women. Women are not allowed to freely 
meet and very often men tell the wife that you can’t befriend this woman. If a 
Muslim woman living in the Middle East, or even in the West, starts adopting 
activities such as joining a feminist movement she becomes an apostate 
immediately. And the punishment for apostasy is death. 
<P>So in this environment women are placed almost in an impossible situation 
where they are almost forced to become against each other instead of supporting 
each other. 
<P><FONT color=blue><B>CP:</B></FONT> There are moderate Muslim countries like 
Jordan and Algeria. Jordan has a Sunni Muslim population of over 90 percent and 
only about a 4 percent Christian population but they are praised for their 
religious tolerance. Their queen promotes woman’s right and interfaith dialogue. 
So when people see this kind of Muslim country, they hope that Islam and 
Christianity can co-exist and that extremist Islamic nations can one day “see 
the light” and become a moderate Muslim country like Jordan. How would you 
respond to people who believe that Islam is a peaceful religion and everyone can 
co-exist? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> But Jordan has a very high rate of honor killings. Most 
Muslims are cultural Muslims. Most have not read sharia, they are not even 
allowed to question or analyze the Quran or doubt. So because Muslims don’t 
really know what is in their scripture - these kinds of Muslims are really 
nominal Muslims - but by the West’s standard they are considered moderate 
Muslims. 
<P>There is nothing in the Middle East called moderate Muslim. You’re either a 
Muslim or not. The problem is not so much the people but the ideology. Cultural 
Muslims are like sheep almost. They have to abide. They just want to survive. 
But anyone who takes Islam seriously and believes Islam seriously must follow 
sharia. That is the predicament. The [Jordan] queen can be a western minded 
woman, the King could be a moderate, peaceful man, but unfortunately the destiny 
of a country does not depend on honorable leaders who want to have peace. 
<P>Muslim leaders who want to live in peace and reject jihad, they want to 
reject sharia, become apostates. And what happens to those leaders? Many of them 
get killed. And that is why if you listen to the Jordanian queen or king or 
whatever Muslim leader, they have to present moderation in a very diplomatic way 
or else they will become apostates and their life will be threatened. 
<P><FONT color=blue><B>CP:</B></FONT> How would you explain all the Muslim women 
living in the Middle East who are well treated by their husbands? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> Women have adapted themselves to living knowing that men are 
the power in their lives. That does not mean that all Muslim women are walking 
slaves in chains. No. You know why some Muslim women are living a good life? 
There’s one reason – their husbands are good people, they are humane people. But 
the reason why their husbands are good people is not because of Islam, it’s 
because of their humanity. 
<P>When I say that women don’t have much rights because men have all the rights, 
it doesn’t mean that all Muslim men are evil or bad. The majority of Muslim 
people are just human being - good and bad like everybody else. But I don’t 
attribute the goodness between Muslim men and women towards each other to Islam. 
I attribute it to the humanity and observing the Judeo-Christian culture and 
emulating them. 
<P><FONT color=blue><B>CP:</B></FONT> You warn that American-born Muslim 
students are advocating for sharia laws to be imposed in the U.S. Many 
American’s first reaction is that could never happen. Do you think it could 
happen, why? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> Yes, and I’ll tell you how that can happen. There is a French 
Algerian Muslim sociology professor by the name of Mohamed Sabaoui. He recently 
said the following in France, a western nation, a democracy: 
<P>The laws of your Republic do not conform to those of the Koran, and should 
not be imposed on Muslims, who can only be governed by Sharia law. We are 
therefore going to seize the power that is our due. We will start in Roubaix, 
which is a town with a Muslim population of over 60% ... and the next mayor will 
be Muslim… we will declare Roubaix an independent Muslim enclave, and we will 
impose Sharia (the law of God) on all the inhabitants. We will declare Roubaix 
an independent Muslim enclave, and we will impose Sharia (the law of God) on all 
the inhabitants. The Christian minority will have the status of dhimmis 
[non-Muslims with fewer rights]. This will be a category in which you will be 
able to buy back your rights in exchange for a tax. 
<P>Can you believe that this is being said today in France? As soon as Muslims 
congregate in one area and become a political power in that area, they will 
elect their own leaders. And as soon as they elect their own leaders they will 
say we will impose sharia law. 
<P>That is how sharia can happen - by congregating in one area and they have a 
very high birth rate. Compared to western women, the Muslim women birth rate is 
about three times more. And it is just a matter of time and there are already 
cities in France that are 60 percent Muslim. 
<P>In America it can happen, it is just a matter of time. It is just how fast 
they can congregate and extend their population in one area. 
<P><FONT color=blue><B>CP:</B></FONT> Have you ever received death threats from 
speaking against Islam and sharia law? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> Not directly, but in my e-mail box I have hate mail. In 
Egyptian papers, someone wrote that if she (Darwish) ever comes back to visit 
Egypt she doesn’t need a return ticket, which means she will be killed. 
<P>I never speak against Muslim people. My purpose is not to speak against the 
Muslim people. I have no intention whatsoever to hurt the feelings of people. 
But I speak against an ideology against the laws because they are evil laws. 
<P><FONT color=blue><B>CP:</B></FONT> Is there anything you want to add? 
<P><B>Darwish:</B> Yes, I want to make sure that every American that feels 
hesitant or doubtful that it is not proper to criticize sharia Islamic law 
because it is a religious right to read my book or read about sharia on the 
internet. If you read about it you’ll discover it is the most horrific and cruel 
law that was ever created on earth. And in order for sharia to gain legitimacy, 
to make people respect and abide by it, they had to link it to religion. 
<P>But it was created 150 years after Mohammed died and also it was inspired by 
the Quran, the Hadiths and the lifestyle of Mohammed and it is really not a 
religion. It is really not a religion because it violates the rights of 
non-Muslims. It actually demands Muslims to kill non-Muslims. It is allowed. 
That is why we cannot consider it a religion.

<P>Top Six Reasons HBO is a muslim: 
<P>1 - HBO won't keep a dog even after he promised his kids he would get one 
<P>2 - He doesn't celebrate Christmas 
<P>3 - He can't find a 'church' like the one he attended in Chicago - the Rev 
Wright is an ex-muslim. And since there is no such thing as an ex muslim - the 
rev Wrights church served the purpose of providing 'cover' for ex-muslims 
needing to look like christians -wink wink, nod nod. 
<P>4 - HBO bowed to the Saudi King. And HBO laughed in the face of Gordon Brown 
and the Queen. Muslims have no respect for the English people and signs of 
disrespect increased his bona fides with the muslim onwatchers. 
<P>5- HBO is happy to stand back and watch servicemen die since that is their 
function - according to the muslim jihad mentality. And as the jihadist in chief 
- destruction of our miltary (its dismemberment and demoralization) are the 
prime directive. 
<P>6- The only person that was close to a father figure for HBO was his 
stepfather Sotoero in Indonesia where HBO attended a Muslim blab school. HBO is 
still looking for a father figure and bowed to the Arab warloard in hopes of 
some such recognition. <BR clear=all></P></DIV>

<P>Back when it was not considered politically incorrect to criticize Islam, 
SALLY FIELD was in this movie: NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER</P>
<P>Why are Hollywood and the left-wing bleeding hearts so SILENT about Islam and 
the abuse of women?</P>
<P>Please watch this trailer to refresh your memory:<BR><A

<P>I wonder what Sally Field’s opinion on Sharia Law is today.</P><BR

<P>“The laws of your Republic do not conform to those of the Koran, and should 
not be imposed on Muslims”</P>
<P>That’s easy to fix. The Muslims simply go to some country that already has 
Sharia law and live there, and everybody lives happily ever after.</P><BR

<DIV class=b2><I><B>CP:</B></I><I> You warn that American-born Muslim students 
are advocating for sharia laws to be imposed in the U.S. Many American’s first 
reaction is that could never happen. Do you think it could happen, why? </I>
<P><I><B>Darwish:</B></I><I> Yes, and I’ll tell you how that can happen. There 
is a French Algerian Muslim sociology professor by the name of Mohamed Sabaoui. 
He recently said the following in France, a western nation, a democracy: </I>
<P><I>The laws of your Republic do not conform to those of the Koran, and should 
not be imposed on Muslims, who can only be governed by Sharia law. We are 
therefore going to seize the power that is our due. We will start in Roubaix, 
which is a town with a Muslim population of over 60% ... and the next mayor will 
be Muslim… we will declare Roubaix an independent Muslim enclave, and we will 
impose Sharia (the law of God) on all the inhabitants. </I>
<P>This is what the Left has done: create urban enclaves and then agitate and 
transform the culture within them until they have a power base. 
<P>No reason why Muslims, such as those in enclaves through the US, especially 
in areas such as Dearborn, Michigan, can't do the same. <BR clear=all></P></DIV>
