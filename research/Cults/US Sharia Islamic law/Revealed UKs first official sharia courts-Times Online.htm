<P>ISLAMIC law has been officially adopted in Britain, with sharia courts given 
powers to rule on Muslim civil cases. </P>
<P>The government has quietly sanctioned the powers for sharia judges to rule on 
cases ranging from divorce and financial disputes to those involving domestic 
violence. </P>
<P>Rulings issued by a network of five sharia courts are enforceable with the 
full power of the judicial system, through the county courts or High Court. </P>
<P>Previously, the rulings of sharia courts in Britain could not be enforced, 
and depended on voluntary compliance among Muslims. </P><!--#include file="m63-article-related-attachements.html"-->
<P>It has now emerged that sharia courts with these powers have been set up in 
London, Birmingham, Bradford and Manchester with the network’s headquarters in 
Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Two more courts are being planned for Glasgow and 
Edinburgh. </P>
<P>Sheikh Faiz-ul-Aqtab Siddiqi, whose Muslim Arbitration Tribunal runs the 
courts, said he had taken advantage of a clause in the Arbitration Act 1996. 
</P>
<P>Under the act, the sharia courts are classified as arbitration tribunals. The 
rulings of arbitration tribunals are binding in law, provided that both parties 
in the dispute agree to give it the power to rule on their case. </P>
<P>Siddiqi said: “We realised that under the Arbitration Act we can make rulings 
which can be enforced by county and high courts. The act allows disputes to be 
resolved using alternatives like tribunals. This method is called alternative 
dispute resolution, which for Muslims is what the sharia courts are.” </P>
<P>The disclosure that Muslim courts have legal powers in Britain comes seven 
months after Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was pilloried for 
suggesting that the establishment of sharia in the future “seems unavoidable” in 
Britain. </P>
<P>In July, the head of the judiciary, the lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, 
further stoked controversy when he said that sharia could be used to settle 
marital and financial disputes. </P>
<P>In fact, Muslim tribunal courts started passing sharia judgments in August 
2007. They have dealt with more than 100 cases that range from Muslim divorce 
and inheritance to nuisance neighbours. </P>
<P>It has also emerged that tribunal courts have settled six cases of domestic 
violence between married couples, working in tandem with the police 
investigations. </P>
<P>Siddiqi said he expected the courts to handle a greater number of “smaller” 
criminal cases in coming years as more Muslim clients approach them. “All we are 
doing is regulating community affairs in these cases,” said Siddiqi, chairman of 
the governing council of the tribunal. </P>
<P>Jewish Beth Din courts operate under the same provision in the Arbitration 
Act and resolve civil cases, ranging from divorce to business disputes. They 
have existed in Britain for more than 100 years, and previously operated under a 
precursor to the act. </P>
<P>Politicians and church leaders expressed concerns that this could mark the 
beginnings of a “parallel legal system” based on sharia for some British 
Muslims. </P>
<P>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, said: “If it is true that these 
tribunals are passing binding decisions in the areas of family and criminal law, 
I would like to know which courts are enforcing them because I would consider 
such action unlawful. British law is absolute and must remain so.” </P>
<P>Douglas Murray, the director of the Centre for Social Cohesion, said: “I 
think it’s appalling. I don’t think arbitration that is done by sharia should 
ever be endorsed or enforced by the British state.” </P>
<P>There are concerns that women who agree to go to tribunal courts are getting 
worse deals because Islamic law favours men. </P>
<P>Siddiqi said that in a recent inheritance dispute handled by the court in 
Nuneaton, the estate of a Midlands man was divided between three daughters and 
two sons. </P>
<P>The judges on the panel gave the sons twice as much as the daughters, in 
accordance with sharia. Had the family gone to a normal British court, the 
daughters would have got equal amounts. </P>
<P>In the six cases of domestic violence, Siddiqi said the judges ordered the 
husbands to take anger management classes and mentoring from community elders. 
There was no further punishment. </P>
<P>In each case, the women subsequently withdrew the complaints they had lodged 
with the police and the police stopped their investigations. </P>
<P>Siddiqi said that in the domestic violence cases, the advantage was that 
marriages were saved and couples given a second chance. </P>
<P>Inayat Bunglawala, assistant secretary-general of the Muslim Council of 
Britain, said: “The MCB supports these tribunals. If the Jewish courts are 
allowed to flourish, so must the sharia ones.” </P>
