      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><BR>Often used by the Sabbatarians as "proofs" 
      that Gentiles and Christians are to keep the Sabbath day of the Jews are 
      the scriptures in book of Acts.&nbsp; For the casual reader, who may be 
      unfamiliar with the Synagogue and the rest of the teachings of both the 
      Jews and Scripture, it may appear to be "proof”. But, for the real student 
      of Judaism, Christianity and the Scriptures, i.e., the learned, they do 
      not substantiate the claim made by the Judaizing brands of 
      Christianity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The Jew 
      First</SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">From the beginning of the 
      gospel of salvation through Christ, it was first to be taught and preached 
      among the Jews and later the Gentiles.&nbsp; Christ taught only among the 
      Jews. In Mt.15:21-27 Christ speaks to a woman of Canaan, a gentile and 
      says that He (Christ) is only sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of 
      Israel.&nbsp; Though, he greatly honors this woman for her faith, a 
      foresight of the things to come when all the Gentiles will be saved by 
      their faith.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Paul, a Jew himself, 
      taught the gospel first among the Jews in every city starting at the 
      synagogue and then in the city.&nbsp; On the Sabbath day, Paul would go in 
      to the Synagogue where the Jews gathered to worship on the Sabbath.&nbsp; 
      There he would preach Christ's birth, suffering, death and resurrection 
      from the Old Testament Scriptures.&nbsp; And some Jews within the 
      Synagogue would believe and some would not.&nbsp; The gospel must first be 
      preached to the Jew and then to the Gentile.&nbsp; As Paul writes in 
      Rom.1: <SUP><SPAN style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">16 "</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of 
      Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation <B>to every one that 
      believeth; to the Jew first,</B> and also to the Greek. <SUP>17</SUP>For 
      therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is 
      written,&nbsp; The just shall live by faith."</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN

      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">It is appropriate to first 
      have an understanding of who were in the synagogue and why were they 
      there.&nbsp; Of course, the devout Jews participated in the Synagogue 
      worship as a matter of keeping the commandment given to the Jews in Exodus 
      20 to observe the Sabbath day.&nbsp; Thus, we find the faithful Jews, whom 
      had been circumcised in the flesh and keeping all the laws of Moses as 
      well as the Sabbath day among those in the Synagogue.&nbsp; Though, they 
      are not the only people gathered there to worship.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">The Gentile is gathered as 
      well. </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">There are two terms used in the 
      scriptures to define two different stages of gentile’s conversion to 
      Judaism. The term <B>"God Fearer" or "one who fears God</B>" was a term 
      that was used to describe the gentile who believed in the one true God and 
      denied the idols and foreign gods of the gentile world, including emperors 
      as gods. The "God Fearers" attended the synagogue on the Sabbath, yet were 
      not bound to the restrictions of not working on the Sabbath. They did not 
      eat with the Jews and could not keep the Passover without circumcision. 
      &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A "God Fearer" became a 
      "proselyte" when he was circumcised in the flesh, and vowed to keep the 
      whole Law of Moses. The term, which is used in the scriptures, is the 
      term, "proselyte," (which means in Greek, "to sojourn") is a term for a 
      gentile who became circumcised and thereby bound to the Sabbaths and all 
      of the laws under the Law of Moses. Nearly all "proselytes” were God 
      Fearers first, and then from there they could become proselytes. Because 
      not all gentiles could be free enough or desired to rest on Sabbaths, 
      clean and unclean meats and the other non-moral requirements of the Law of 
      Moses, most of the gentiles remained "God Fearers". The term proselyte is 
      used in the follow verse by Christ himself when he rebukes the 
      self-righteous Pharisees, Matt 23:15"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
      hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he 
      is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than 
      yourselves".&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      known about the Jew's and their beliefs concerning the gentiles from the 
      time of Noah, during the time of Christ and until this present day is that 
      the none of the Jews at any time believed that the Sabbath was ever 
      binding upon the gentiles in order for them to be accepted by God or to 
      inherit eternal life.&nbsp; In the later part of this document you will

      the Sabbath, Holy Days and meat restrictions were binding on Gentiles. In 
      the book, "Jewish Literacy, The Most Important Thinks to Know About the 
      Jewish Religion, Its People, and Its History" by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin, 
      Chapter 278, "RIGHTOUS NON-JEWS/HASIDEI UMMOT HA-OLAM" the Rabbi begins 
      the first line of the chapter in this manner: <B>"Judaism has never taught

      </SPAN>The Jews do not believe that anyone prior to Abraham keep anything 
      more than the "Noahide Law" or "Seven Laws of Noah". Quoting from the 
      EVERYMAN'S TALMUD, "Judaism regards any non-Jew (gentile) who keeps these 
      laws as a righteous person who is guaranteed a place in the 
      world-to-come."&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      we read this concerning the Gentile whom is about to receive circumcision. 
      "He is told, "you must know that before taking <B>this</B> step 
      (circumcision) <B>you partook of forbidden fat and profaned the Sabbath 
      without incurring punishment</B>; BUT HENCEFORWARD if you do these things 
      dire penalties will befall you." We note that the Jews fully allowed the 
      Gentile, "God Fearers" to "profane the Sabbath" and eat unclean meats, 
      (forbidden fats) without judgment from God or themselves until they were 
      circumcised in the flesh. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      reach a higher level and hence be assured of greater proximity to the

      Non-Jews, too have their "Torah". A Torah of seven not 613. <B>If a 
      non-Jew observes those seven, then he or she is reckoned among "the

      sacrifices and offerings of the uncircumcised Gentiles who did not observe 
      the Sabbath, Holy Days or meat restrictions of the Jews.&nbsp; They did so

      of circumcision of the flesh and the vowed to keep the "whole law of 
      Moses” Paul writes in Gal.3:<SUP><SPAN style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">

      </SPAN>The uncircumcised Gentile who is known as the "God Fearer" or "one 
      who fears God" and is or was under no obligation to keep the Jewish 
      Sabbaths or meat restrictions but may attend and worship in the Synagogue 
      on the Sabbath but then return to work.&nbsp; These three make up the 
      Synagogue and Temple worship.&nbsp; He was held as one "righteous among 
      the nations" because he had forsaken idols and learned to observe the Laws 
      of Noah, which governed all the Gentile nations. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">It is from this genre and 
      background context that we must then understand the scriptures and read 
      them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And from this we may understand that the Christian 
      Church grew having a mixed company of Jewish believers, Gentile Proselytes 
      and Gentile God Fearer's in each Synagogue on the Sabbath.&nbsp; 
      </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Returning to the 
      scriptures, Acts 13 occurs well after the Apostle Peter had been shown 
      that uncircumcised Gentiles were not considered "unclean" once they 
      believed in Christ, Acts 10.&nbsp; Both Peter and Paul had begun to preach 
      that the Church and Christianity was not only for the Jewish Christians 
      and Jewish converts but even for the Gentiles who were outside the Jewish 
      faith.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">So it was, that in every 
      city, the Apostles would begin to preach Christ to the Jew first, in the 
      Synagogue or wherever the Jewish people gathered.&nbsp; For they must hear 
      the word having already known God to some degree and desiring to live a 
      righteous life.&nbsp; Indeed, what we find in every case, is that the 
      Apostles are not preaching Judaism in the Synagogue but Christ as the 
      suffering Messiah and Christianity.&nbsp; Acts 13 demonstrates the 
      Apostolic preaching so vividly.&nbsp; Paul goes in to the Synagogue on the 
      Sabbath day, preaching Christ to the Jew first, who must hear the word and 
      after them, the Gentile.&nbsp; Paul makes no statement regarding the 
      keeping of the Sabbath to the Gentiles because the uncircumcised are not 
      under any obligation to keep the covenant God made with Israel regarding 
      circumcision of the flesh or the Sabbath.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In Acts 13 as it has 
      happens so often among at the Jewish Synagogue, the Jews begin 
      contradicting and blaspheming, a sign of their rejection of Christ as the 
      Messiah.&nbsp; But, the Gentiles believe.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Acts 15</SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">After sufficient time, a 
      "Sect of the Pharisees" whom believed that Christianity should only be a 
      Jewish sect and not inclusive of the uncircumcised Gentile peoples from 
      every nation, started an uproar over their belief which has been renewed 
      in the Adventist and Armstrong movement. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">But, the Apostles came 
      together in the first council of the Apostles and Elders and condemned the 
      doctrine that Christians must become or should live, as do the Jews to be 
      saved.&nbsp; The Sect of Pharisees preaching was Judaism rather than 
      Christ as is followed by the Adventist and Armstrong movement today.&nbsp; 
      The gospel preached by them is rather about the Law of Moses and learning 
      to be Jewish rather than learning to be as Christ.&nbsp; They often use 
      Christ and the Apostle Paul who were Jews to teach others learn to live as 
      do the Jews but this was sorely condemned as a corruption of the gospel by 
      the Apostles in Acts 15 and Galatians as well as other scriptures 
      throughout the New Testament. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">What about Acts 15:21 
      Moses Is Preached in Every City. </SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Acts 15: 21 "For Moses of 
      old time hath in every city them that preach HIM (Moses), being read in 
      the synagogues every Sabbath day."&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">We should not let 
      Sabbatarians disturb us, with this verse. The Sabbatarians, Judaizers 
      teach that the Gentiles are to be sent into the synagogue in every city 
      where they will learn, "Moses" and that they are obligated to keep the Law 
      of Moses.&nbsp; That is in direct contradiction to EVERYTHING that the 
      Apostles have said before and will say afterwards.&nbsp; It is absolutely 
      false. The Apostles and Elders foregoing statements all tell us, they are 
      opposed to adding anything further than the four things 
      listed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">When the gospel was 
      preached among the gentiles Christ had commanded that the gospel first go 
      to the Jew and then the gentile. The Jew in the synagogues had made a 
      habit of trying to convert the gentile and thus make the gentiles become 
      circumcised and "commanding him to keep the Law of Moses." They were 
      preaching Moses and this is what started the entire problem. After God had 
      given salvation and the Holy Spirit by grace through faith as Peter 
      declares, some of the Sect of the Pharisees began preaching Moses. Let me 
      post verse five of this chapter here, "5But there rose up certain of the 
      sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to 
      circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. In order to 
      avoid any confusion, this letter was sent to the churches so that there 
      would be no confusion or misunderstanding. The decree supplied written 
      proof that the Gentiles are to left alone and not to be nagged, pestered 
      and troubled over keeping the law of Moses and circumcision. 
      &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The gentiles were not to 
      be made bound to either circumcision or the Law of Moses. The point in 
      verse 21 is to say that it was necessary to write to the gentiles because 
      in every city was a synagogue where the Jews would preach Moses (not 
      Christ, not the gospel, but Moses as ADDITIONAL TO the way to salvation, 
      ADDED TO CHRIST. The apostles wanted no misunderstanding, the gentiles 
      were not to be circumcised and commanded to keep the law of Moses because 
      faith in Christ is the way unto salvation. When the Apostles and Elders 
      wrote "NO OTHER BURDEN" , they didn't mean go to a synagogue and learn the 
      rest of the burdens of Law of Moses. Peter said it was a burden, which 
      "they nor their fathers were able to bear."&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">When the Apostles and 
      Elders wrote "NO OTHER BURDEN", they didn't mean go to a synagogue and 
      learn the rest of the burdens of Law of Moses. Peter said it was a burden 
      which "they nor their fathers were able to bear. " It is entirely wrong to 
      think that the Apostles desired to send Gentile Christians into the 
      synagogue so they could be "troubled" and have their faith further 
      "subverted" by those preaching Moses and further "tempt God" as Peter 
      said.&nbsp;&nbsp; The context clearly spells out, the last thing the 
      Apostles wanted was for the faith of the uncircumcised Gentiles to be 
      further "troubled", "subverted" and corrupted by those preaching the law 
      of Moses in the synagogue. So they put a decree in writing that says, 
      leave the Gentiles alone! Do not trouble them! &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In Acts 16: Immediately 
      after the council of Jerusalem condemning the doctrine of Judaizing the 
      Gentiles, we find Paul in 16:13 continuing to preach the gospel of Christ, 
      going first to where the&nbsp; Jews would gather on the Sabbath.&nbsp; 
      <B>What is occurring is that rather than making Christians Jewish, Paul is 
      busy making Jews Christians</B>. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Acts 
      17:</SPAN></B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"> shows how Paul after first 
      preaching to the Jews, then preaches to the Gentiles.&nbsp; From one city 
      unto the next even unto Mars hill.&nbsp; Yet, none of these places do you 
      find Paul preaching that Gentiles must live as do the Jews and become 
      Sabbath and Jewish Holy Day observers and keep the meat and diet 
      restrictions of the Jews. That is far from his teachings and had already 
      been settled forever at the council of Jerusalem by all the Apostles and 
      Elders of the Church.&nbsp; </SPAN><B><SPAN

      <P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Acts 18</SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Acts 18 is no different 
      than the rest of the scriptures.&nbsp; Paul first preaches the gospel to 
      those in the Jewish Synagogue and then to the whole city.&nbsp; Verse 4 
      shows that Paul made it an appointment in this city to reason in the 
      synagogue every Sabbath day.&nbsp; These verses are often used by the 
      Adventist and Armstrong followers to claim to be "proof" that the Paul 
      taught Gentiles to live as do the Jews.&nbsp; Not at all is it proof. Paul 
      was a Jew, when he lived among the Jews he lived as the Jews but condemned 
      any Jewish Christian that might teach that the Gentiles had to become 
      Jewish too. That was an absolute corruption of the gospel.&nbsp; The 
      learned Jews of the scriptures held no such doctrine.&nbsp; 
      &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">When Paul heard how some 
      or most the Jews refused to believe the gospel, he said in verse 6: 
      <SUP>6</SUP>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook 
      <I>his</I> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <I>be</I> upon your own 
      heads; <B>I <I>am</I> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the 
      Gentiles</B>. " Never does Paul make any requirement that Gentiles either 
      attend the Sabbath, the Synagogue or keep any of the Jewish laws of 
      distinction.&nbsp; To do so, would first require circumcision of the flesh 
      (Acts 15:5, Gal.3:5) and is totally contrary to the council condemnation 
      of the Judaizing of Gentile Christians.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Again, what is sorely 
      missing from the Adventist and Armstrong learning is the reality of the 
      fact that neither the Jews or the Apostles approved of preaching that the 
      Gentiles had to become or live a Jewish life in order to be righteous or 
      saved by God.&nbsp; Jews nor the Christians held any such belief that one 
      must keep the Sabbath or Annual Holy Days of the Israel to be saved. No, 
      both Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians lived and worshiped among 
      and with each other and did not proclaim one as better than the other. 
      Because, they were all one in Christ and "Abraham's seed and heirs 
      according to the promise" Gal.3:27&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Finally, after the Sect 
      of Pharisees saw their defeat, yet insisted on teaching Judaism among the 
      Gentile Christians, Paul let it be known, that if even HE changed his mind 
      or the Apostle Peter or an Angel of God came down and corrupted the gospel 
      by preaching something, in this case a requirement to be or live as a Jew 
      to be saved, then the congregation of Christians were to "<B>LET THEM 
      </B>be anathema". &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line; COLOR: black">To 
      demonstrate that nothing whatsoever had changed after the Council in 
      Jerusalem of Acts 15, more than a decade later in Acts 21, Paul had 
      returned to the center of Judaism, Jerusalem. "Paul had come to Jerusalem 
      and they had heard from other Jews, that Paul was not only teaching the 
      Gentiles not to circumcise their children or to walk after the customs of 
      Moses, but also the Jews.&nbsp; James asks Paul to clear himself of the 
      charges by performing the ceremonial rites of uncleanness and once again 
      confirms that nothing had changed in the ten years or more, saying to 
      confirm that&nbsp; “</SPAN><SPAN

      Gentiles to keep were known as the "Laws of Noah" . </SPAN><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Paul, as Jew continued to 
      live as a Jew among the Jews. In 1Cor.9:<SUP><SPAN

      style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I 
      might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, 
      that I might gain them that are under the law."&nbsp; Paul's words are 
      very well stated.&nbsp; And it gives us a good deal of understanding how 
      he might do both live a Jew among the Jews and follow the Sabbath, Holy 
      Day and meat restrictions.&nbsp; Paul as a Jew, he knew well that the 
      uncircumcised Gentiles were free from the Sabbath, Holy Day and meat 
      restriction obligations and were able to live as "the righteous among the 
      nations" by keeping the laws of the covenant with Noah, repeated in the 
      council of Jerusalem. And more excellently the commandments of Christ and 
      the Apostles to love one another fulfilled all the law, Gal.5:13-14.

      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">There is no scriptural 
      support for the Judaizing of Christians. There is abundant scriptural 
      condemnation of anyone that preaches that Gentiles must live as or become 
      Jewish to be saved.&nbsp; For all the shouting by the Adventist and 
      Armstrong followers about Paul entering the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, 
      you won't find one of them who is willing to be so bold as the Apostle and 
      enter a Synagogue on the Sabbath and Preach Christ they way Paul 
      did.&nbsp; Nor, will you find them to be as willing to defend the freedom 
      of the Gentiles from the requirements of the Sabbaths, New Moons and Holy 
      Days, as the Apostles.&nbsp; <B>They are nothing like the true Apostles

      become the Christian Sabbath?</SPAN></B></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Christianity was a new 
      religion. Many of the first Christians were Jewish long before they had 
      heard the gospel.&nbsp; It was natural for these Christians to continue 
      keeping the observance of the Law of Moses as the book of Acts generally 
      makes clear.&nbsp; However, when the uncircumcised Gentiles who converted 
      to Christ became Christians, they were not to be commanded to live a 
      Jewish life, in order to saved.&nbsp; The Jewish Christians are warned in 
      the first council of the church in Acts 15 not to pester, discriminate or 
      belittle the Gentile Christian who did not keep the Jewish Sabbath days 
      and meat distinctions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">During the early 
      centuries of the church, the Lord's Day, "Upon the first day of the week" 
      had special meaning because it was the resurrection of the Christ from the 
      dead.&nbsp; It was the living proof of Christ being the Messiah and Savior 
      of Man.&nbsp; At first the Lord's Day was celebrated by the sharing of the 
      body of Christ and communion of the saints in worship in recognition and 
      celebration of Christ as Lord and Savior.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the first 
      Christians were slaves and had no opportunity to refuse to serve their 
      masters.&nbsp; It was unchristian and not according to mercies and justice 
      taught by Christ to force slaves to rebel against their masters in order 
      to keep the Lord's Day sacred as the new day of rest in Christ.&nbsp; The 
      earliest Christians would meet early in the morning or at night "upon the 
      first day of the week" to celebrate the resurrection and memorial of 
      Christ.&nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal align=left><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In the course 
      of time, Christianity was able to influence world leaders to allow the 
      Christians free to worship "upon the first day of the week", The Lord's 
      day worship became a Sabbath rest for the Gentiles as the Saturday was the 
      Sabbath was for the Jews.&nbsp; Hence, it has been understood the Sunday 
      does not replace the Jewish Sabbath, but was added along side the Jewish 
      Sabbath as day of rest for Christians.&nbsp; The Sabbath for the Jew 
      keeping the Law of Moses will always be Saturday. But, Sunday, the day our 
      Lord was resurrected, called "The Lord's Day" is known as the Christian 
      Sabbath, as Saturday is known as the Jewish Sabbath. </SPAN></P>
