<P>A sustained assault on Arab Christians has led to their fleeing the

<!-- attribution --><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size=3>What some observers are 
calling a <A href="http://www.answers.com/pogrom&amp;r=67">pogrom</A> took place 
near Ramallah, West Bank, on the night of Sep. 3-4. That's when fifteen Muslim 
youths from one village, Dair Jarir, rampaged against Taybeh, a neighboring 
all-Christian village of 1,500 people.<BR>
<P>The reason for the assault? A Muslim woman from Dair Jarir, Hiyam Ajaj, 23, 
fell in love with her Christian boss, Mehdi Khouriyye, owner of a tailor shop in 
Taybeh. The couple maintained a clandestine two-year affair and she became 
pregnant in about March 2005. When her family learned of her condition, it 
murdered her. That was on about Sep. 1; unsatisfied even with this "<A 
href="http://www.secularislam.org/women/dont.htm">honor killing</A>" — for 
Islamic law strictly forbids non-Muslim males to have sexual relations with 
Muslim females — the Ajaj men sought vengeance against Khouriyye and his 
family.<BR>
<P>They took it two days later in an assault on Taybeh. The Ajajs and their 
friends broke into houses and stole furniture, jewelry, and electrical 
appliances. They threw Molotov cocktails at some buildings and poured kerosene 
on others, then torched them. The damage included at least 16 houses, some 
stores, a farm, and a gas station. The assailants vandalized cars, looted 
extensively, and destroyed a statue of the Virgin Mary.<BR>
<P>"It was like a war," <A 
href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1125831262172&amp;p=1101615860782">one 
Taybeh resident</A> told <I>The Jerusalem Post</I>. Hours passed before the 
Palestinian Authority security and fire services arrived. The fifteen assailants 
spent only a few hours in police detention, then were released. As for 
Khouriyye, the Palestinian police <A 
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1562709,00.html">arrested 
him</A>, kept him jail, and (his family says) have repeatedly beat him.<BR>
<P>As the news service <A 
href="http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Religion&amp;loid=8.0.204471774&amp;par=0">Adnkronos 
International</A> notes, for Palestinian Christians "the fact that the Muslim 
aggressors have been released while the Christian tailor-shop owner is still 
being held, at best symbolizes the PA's indifference to the plight of 
Palestinian Christians, at worst shows it is taking sides against them."<BR>
<P>A cousin, <A 
href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-palestinians-fatal-feud,1,4237246.story?coll=sns-ap-world-headlines">Suleiman 
Khouriyye</A>, pointed to his burned house. "They did this because we're 
Christians. They did this because we are the weaker ones." The Khouriyyes and 
others recall the assailants shouting <I>Allahu Akbar</I> and anti-Christian 
slogans: "Burn the infidels, burn the Crusaders." To which, an unrepentant 
cousin of Hiyam Ajaj replied, "We burned their houses because they dishonored 
our family, not because they are Christians."<BR>
<P>This assault fits a larger pattern. According to the Catholic Custodian of 
the Holy Land, <A 
href="http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=38551&amp;eng=y">Pierbattista 
Pizzaballa</A>, Christians in the Bethlehem region alone have suffered 93 cases 
of injustice in 2000-04. In the worst of these, in 2002, Muslims murdered the 
two Amre sisters, 17 and 19 years old, whom they called prostitutes. A 
post-mortem, however, showed the teenagers to have been virgins — and to have 
been tortured on their genitals.<BR>
<P>"Almost every day — I repeat, almost every day — our communities are harassed 
by the Islamic extremists in these regions," Pizzaballa says. "And if it's not 
the members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad, there are clashes with … the Palestinian 
Authority." In addition to the Islamists, a "Muslim land mafia" is said to 
operate. With PA complicity. it threatens Christian land and house owners, often 
succeeding to compel them to abandon their properties.<BR>
<P>The <A href="http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp490.htm">campaign</A> of persecution 
has succeeded. Even as the Christian population of Israel grows, that of the 
Palestinian Authority shrinks precipitously. Bethlehem and Nazareth, historic 
Christian towns for nearly two millennia, are now primarily Muslim. In 1922, 
Christians outnumbered Muslims in Jerusalem; today, Christians amount to a mere 
2 percent of that city's population.<BR>
<P>"Is Christian life liable to be reduced to empty church buildings and a 
congregation-less hierarchy with no flock in the birthplace of Christianity?" So 
asks <A href="http://www.meforum.org/article/15">Daphne Tsimhoni</A> in the 
<I>Middle East Quarterly</I>. It is hard to see what will prevent that 
ghost-like future from coming into existence.<BR>
<P>One factor that could help prevent this dismal outcome would be for mainline 
Protestant churches to speak out against Palestinian Muslims for tormenting and 
expelling Palestinian Christians. To date, unfortunately, the Episcopalian, 
Evangelical Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, as well as the 
United Church of Christ, have ignored the problem.<BR>
<P>Instead, they pursue the self-indulgent path of <A 
href="http://www.ird-renew.org/atf/cf/{8548C466-7ECE-4AF1-B844-49C289CE5165}/Human_Rights_Report.pdf">venting 
moral outrage against the Israeli bystander</A> and even <A 
href="http://www.belief.net/story/155/story_15507_1.html">withdrawing their 
investment funds</A> from it. As they obsess with Israel but stay silent about 
Christianity dying in its birthplace one wonders what it will take to awaken 
them. </FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
