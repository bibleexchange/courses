<P>According to Benny Hinn, God moves in “marvelous” ways — even to the extent 
of calling off professional sporting events. Or does He? On the Oct. 22, 1997, 
installment of his daily broadcast of <I>This Is Your Day</I>, Hinn claimed 
divine intervention for his ministry over the Miami Panthers, the southern 
Florida city’s National Hockey League team.</P>
<P>The faith healer asserted that: “The Lord spoke to me while in Miami, here 
the first day, and said, ‘Come back here for Good Friday.’ We were supposed to 
go somewhere else. And I said, ‘Lord, open the way.’ And guess what? The manager 
of the Miami Arena canceled the hockey game so we can have the arena for Good 
Friday, April 10th, 1998. And I think that’s marvelous, don’t you?”</P>
<P>Author and critic of Hinn’s ministry, Yves Brault, contacted the Miami Arena 
concerning the alleged cancellation. His call was directed to the “special 
events” department of the facility and he was told that “no” hockey game was 
ever scheduled for April 10. Brault was informed that a game slated for April 9 
between the Panthers and Philadelphia Flyers remains on the schedule.</P>
<P>The arena spokesperson further stated, “We can’t cancel a game because the 
tenants take preference and the Panthers are the tenants in our building. But 
right after the hockey game, we’ll start setting up for Benny Hinn.”</P>
<P>The schedule of the National Hockey League is released in July. Hinn’s Miami 
Miracle Crusade, where he claims God spoke to him concerning the Good Friday 
service, was held Oct. 8 and 9 at the arena. <BR></P>
