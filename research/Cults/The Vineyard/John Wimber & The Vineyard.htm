<H1><B>John Wimber &amp; The Vineyard </B></H1>
<H3><B>by Albert James Dager*</B></H3>
<P>In 1963, a young jazz musician by the name of <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/wimber/general.htm">John 
Wimber</A> made a profession of faith in Jesus Christ. In 1970, he joined the 
staff as an assistant pastor at the Yorba Linda Friends Church (Quaker) in Yorba 
Linda, California.</P>
<P>In 1974, Wimber left the pastorate of Yorba Linda Friends Church to join the 
staff of the Charles E. Fuller Institute of Evangelism and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/cgrowth/">Church Growth</A> 
at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. For four years he 
studied factors that lead to church growth. He was impressed by the statistics 
which showed that the most dramatic growth was being enjoyed by <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/pente.htm">Pentecostal</A> 
and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/">charismatic</A> 
churches. Wimber's attitude toward signs and wonders greatly changed, not 
because of his study of Scripture, but as a result of the reported growth of 
Pentecostal and charismatic churches.</P>
<P>Wimber's wife had become a charismatic. She had undergone what she called a 
"personality meltdown" through the work of the Holy Spirit to change her 
attitude toward charismatics (Carol Wimber, "Hunger for God: A Reflective Look 
at the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/vine/">Vineyard</A> 
Beginnings," <I>The Vineyard Newsletter</I>, Vol. 2, No. 3, Fall, 1987, p. 
1).</P>
<P>The man who would have the most impact on Wimber's philosophy was <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/vine/vineyard.htm">C. Peter 
Wagner</A>, alleged expert on church growth, and a strong proponent of signs and 
wonders for the purpose of church growth. Affiliations at Fuller convinced 
Wimber to study the relationship between <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/areview.htm">spiritual 
gifts</A> and evangelism. The result was his development of what he called 
"power evangelism," predicated upon the supposition that the Gospel is largely 
ineffective unless accompanied by signs and wonders.</P>
<H3><B>The Beginning of the Vineyard</B></H3>
<P>In his book <I>Power Healing</I> (Harper and Row), Wimber relates that on 
Mother's Day in May of 1977, he preached his first sermon as pastor of what is 
now called the Vineyard Christian Fellowship. Wimber's pastoral association with 
<A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/smith/">Calvary Chapel</A> 
began in 1978 when he requested "Calvary Chapel covering" for his new group. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"In 1978, God spoke to me about returning to the pastorate, ... I resigned 
  my position at the Institute of Evangelism and Church Growth and returned to 
  the pastorate ..." (John Wimber &amp; Kevin Springer, <I>Power Evangelism</I>, 
  p. 84).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It wasn't long before Wimber began to categorize methodologies for healing, 
music ministry, leadership, outreach, evangelism, etc. All aspects of body life 
became studies of method.</P>
<P>Within a short time, Wimber brought on Sam Thompson, a licensed psychologist, 
as an assistant pastor in charge of counseling. Thompson developed the 
ministerial aspects of the Vineyard, combining <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/psych.htm">psychological 
theory</A> with charismatic practices. He taught how to look for signs of 
spiritual and physical problems, and how to deal with them. The emphasis was, 
and still is, on attaining spiritual power. The congregation would stand in 
circles, holding hands and commanding demons to manifest themselves in order to 
cast them out.</P>
<P>The church was growing in numbers, and had the outward appearance of a 
typical Calvary Chapel. Wimber's "signs and wonders" philosophy was developing 
and gaining adherents under the Calvary Chapel label. Concerned Calvary Chapel 
pastors began to ask Wimber about the reports of people levitating, being "slain 
in the spirit," engaging in aura reading, and other bizarre practices.</P>
<P>Wimber made two statements in defense of the manifestations at Yorba Linda on 
which <A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/smith/">Chuck 
Smith</A> challenged him: 1) "God is above His Word"; and 2) "God is not limited 
by His Word." In other words, Wimber did not need a Scriptural basis for the 
manifestations.</P>
<P>Smith then offered the Calvary Chapel pastors the opportunity to either 
remain with Calvary Chapel and stress the teaching of Scripture, or follow after 
Wimber and stress manifestations. Many chose to follow Wimber, converting their 
churches to Vineyards.</P>
<P>The rest is history. The Vineyard has grown to more than seven hundred 
congregations in eight countries. They claim some one hundred thousand members. 
In 1982, shortly after taking over the Vineyard, Wimber returned to the Fuller 
Theological Seminary to co-teach with C. Peter Wagner a course entitled MC:510, 
"The Miraculous and Church Growth." It was a laboratory for experiments in signs 
and wonders.</P>
<H3><B>The Vineyard Philosophy</B></H3>
<P>The Vineyard philosophy of signs and wonders is expressed primarily in the 
teachings of John Wimber. Major points he emphasizes are:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(a) The need for a paradigm shift in the Church (we must change our Western 
  world view to that which integrates reliance upon supernatural 
influences);</P>
  <P>(b) The charismatic movement is "where it's at" in church growth;</P>
  <P>(c) We should be doing the "stuff" Jesus did;</P>
  <P>(d) The supernatural practices beginning to emerge were of the Lord, and to 
  be desired and pursued (i.e., hot, tingly sensations indicating healing taking 
  place during prayer; trance-like euphoric states of "worship" characterized by 
  a restful "alpha-wave"-type feeling, which is verification of the "presence" 
  of the Lord; supposed "words of knowledge," "discerning of spirits," "personal 
  prophecy," etc.);</P>
  <P>(e) Every believer can walk, talk, and do the very things Jesus and the 
  apostles did;</P>
  <P>(f) The signs-and-wonders movement is the third wave of God's power 
  manifesting in the 20th century (the first wave was turn-of-the-century 
  Pentecostalism; the second wave was the charismatic movement);</P>
  <P>(g) We are involved in <A 
  href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/warfare/">spiritual 
  warfare</A> to take the Kingdom by force; for this, the major weapon is "power 
  evangelism."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><B>The Paradigm Shift</B></H3>
<P>Wimber stated that the Western Church is largely out of touch with the power 
of God because of Western materialism. Third World countries are more open to 
God's power because they have a different world view or "paradigm."</P>
<P>Looking at the influences in Wimber's paradigm shift (originally a <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/newage.htm">New Age</A> term 
suggesting a shift from Western materialism and pragmatism to Eastern 
spirituality), we can see how he had crossed the line from sound Biblical truth 
to Eastern spiritual methodologies, while espousing a Biblical Christology. The 
fact is that the Vineyard does adhere to a sound doctrine in statement. But the 
words don't line up with the deeds.</P>
<P>The call for a new world view, a shift from an objective approach to God's 
truth, to an almost entirely experiential approach, to attempt to abandon your 
entire world view, particularly, your "Western rationalistic paradigm," and 
replace it with a more subjective view, leaves you quite vulnerable.</P>
<H3><B>Power Evangelism</B></H3>
<P>In simple terms, "power evangelism," according to Wimber, means the combining 
of the proclamation of the Gospel with the demonstration of supernatural power 
through the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The premise is that signs and wonders such 
as healing, raising the dead, and other miracles, are especially effective as 
tools to reinforce the truth of the Gospel. <U>Wimber has said that the Gospel 
is largely </U><B><U>ineffective</U></B><U> without signs and wonders</U>.</P>
<H3><B>The Other Side of the Pragmatism</B></H3>
<P>Wimber suggests that we must demonstrate supernatural power in order to win 
souls, especially among "primitive peoples": </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Primitive peoples often need to see the superior power of the gospel 
  demonstrated for them to believe" (<I>Power Evangelism</I>, p. 
54).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>First, there is no such thing as "primitive peoples." Mankind is unchanged 
since his creation. What has changed is his knowledge of science, which has 
produced some advanced civilizations. Second, Wimber fails to see that reliance 
upon signs and wonders for belief is just as pragmatic as intellectual 
investigation of the Gospel. (cf. John 20:29)</P>
<P>True, lasting faith comes to those who do not need signs and wonders to 
validate God's truth. The flesh looks for a sign; the Holy Spirit impresses the 
truth upon our minds.</P>
<H3><B>Method Ministry</B></H3>
<P>The problem with Wimber's ministry was not only that he insisted that the 
[sign] gifts of the Spirit are still operable today, it was also the assumption 
that the gifts of the Spirit can be manifested through a particular methodology 
-- also, that every supernatural gift of the Holy Spirit should be manifested in 
every believer on a regular basis. This, most often, leads to the abuses and 
excesses of human flesh masquerading as the work of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Compounding the problem is the penchant on the part of those obsessed with 
signs and wonders to cite Scripture erroneously in order to validate their 
attempts at getting God to work in their behalf. An example was Wimber's citing 
of Jesus' miracles to validate power evangelism. In fact, he believed that Jesus 
taught His disciples <B><I>how</I></B> to perform signs and wonders.</P>
<P>There were many ways in which Wimber's attempts at signs and wonders differed 
from the simple, direct, and unfailing ministry of the Holy Spirit. With the 
Wimber/Vineyard method, in order to effect a healing one must "interview" the 
subject, often taking him or her back into the past to relive circumstances (<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/inheal.htm">inner 
healing</A>) that may have lead to their problem. Casting out demons is likewise 
a process that may take days or even years. The byword for all Wimber/Vineyard 
ministry is <I>method</I>.</P>
<P>In spite of Wimber's statements that seem to warn against the use of 
methodology, it is methodology that typifies the Vineyard form of ministry. 
Their methods include inner healing techniques, visualization, meditation, and 
psychological integration. Wimber's book <I>Power Evangelism</I> has even been 
updated to include a study guide on how to perform signs and wonders, replete 
with methodologies.</P>
<H3><B>Experimentation</B></H3>
<P>Two words characterize Wimber's methodology: experience and experimentation. 
In the former case, most of Wimber's teachings were anecdotal, drawing from 
unverifiable but seemingly credible testimonies of signs and wonders, rather 
than from Scripture. Often, Scripture was used as a proof text to validate the 
anecdotal. In the latter case, Wimber encouraged his disciples to experiment 
through trial and error. And his idea of prayer went beyond petition to 
commanding healing.</P>
<P>Having begun in the flesh, it is no wonder that the Vineyard ministry 
continues in the flesh. Yet even the flesh will be gratified eventually, if not 
by God, certainly by Satan, or even by psychosomatic reactions to 
suggestion.</P>
<H3><B>The Same As Jesus?</B></H3>
<P>Wimber acknowledged that his healing techniques didn't always work. His 
approach to "prophetic words" was similar:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Many if not most personal prophetic words given today are conditional, and 
  as such are invitational, not certainties" (John Wimber &amp; Kevin Springer, 
  <I>Power Points: Your Action Plan to ...</I>, p. 56).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is a convenient way to explain why many personal prophecies do not come 
to pass. But what about John 14:12? -- <I>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He 
that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works 
than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</I> Wimber often cites this 
verse to validate his attempts at signs and wonders. Up to his death date, after 
over 15 years of trying, he still hadn't done as well as Jesus, let alone 
greater.</P>
<H3><B>Psychic Healing</B></H3>
<P>The methods of inner healing, including meditation, visualization, and other 
psychic and psychological manipulations gleaned from the writings of Agnes 
Sanford and her disciples, are the same as those of psychic healers. So is the 
evidence of healing power described by Wimber.</P>
<P>Because Wimber rejected the "Western worldview" and accepted certain forms of 
Eastern mystical practices, he confused the deceptions of Satan and the flesh 
with the power of the Holy Spirit. Although he cited psychic healing as a false 
system, by using the intuitive approach to healing Wimber nonetheless dabbled in 
the occult realm of psychic healing. His methodology included exercises similar 
to those of psychic healers, such as aura healing.</P>
<P>Psychic healing is predicted upon the belief that the mind is capable of both 
causing and healing disease. This was also affirmed by Wimber as far as the 
cause of disease is concerned (Wimber &amp; Springer, <I>Power Healing</I>, pp. 
44-45). Unlike psychic healers, however, Wimber would also say that illness can 
be caused by Satan or demonic attack. This, too, is partially true.</P>
<P>Seldom if ever taken into account by practitioners of so-called "divine 
healing" is the fact that God Himself causes illness, and brings calamity upon 
the world (cf. Isa. 45:7; Ex 4:11). Unless one includes God's will in the 
equation, one will be found fighting against God in the name of Holy Spirit 
ministry. Not recognizing God's design, those who attempt trial-and-error 
healing methodologies are utilizing occult techniques. This is why the Vineyard 
healing teams are encouraged to use the mind-science inner healing techniques of 
Agnes Sanford, which include visualization, meditation, and other psychic 
healing methods.</P>
<P>Wimber would deny that he believed in a cosmic consciousness. But because he 
had been influenced by deceivers masquerading as ministers of the gift of 
healing, he had adopted their psychic healing methods. How can an 
self-proclaimed apostle of Christ learn spiritual truth from those who deny 
Christ?</P>
<P>The Vineyard's inner healing methods are especially rooted in psychic healing 
practices which, in turn, are based on the belief in karma. Karma is said to be 
"the unconscious memory or knowledge of, and attachment to, unfinished 
relationships, unfulfilled desires, and other incomplete cycles." Karma does not 
relate only to alleged past lives; it also relates to memories of childhood and 
even of the womb.</P>
<P>Wimber would have denied such concepts as psychic surgery, and most of what 
is taught by psychic healers philosophically. But in practice, he adopted 
virtually every form of psychic healing without being able to relate any of it 
to Scripture. This should be cause for concern to all believers who would have 
any contact with the Vineyard.</P>
<H3><B>Discrepancies</B></H3>
<P>Wimber seemed oblivious to the many contradictions in his writings. His 
suggestion that methodologies are improper, countered by the fact that his 
entire ministry was methodologically empowered, is only one such 
discrepancy.</P>
<P>Wimber insisted that Scripture must be the basis for all belief and practice. 
In reality, the experiences themselves were to him validation enough that they 
were from God, unless they came in the name of an overtly occult philosophy 
(i.e., mind science, T.M. <I>est</I>, psychic healing, or some other movement). 
As long as they came in the name of Jesus, or were perpetuated by one who called 
himself a Christian, they were accepted by Wimber, <B>even if</B> they 
originated in <A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/newage.htm">New 
Age</A> occultism or, at best, <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/">Roman Catholic</A> 
mysticism.</P>
<H3><B>Influences</B></H3>
<P>In order to properly understand Wimber's metamorphosis from that of a 
hard-line dispensationalist to an ecumenical, charismatic "apostle" and healing 
practitioner, one must understand the influences upon his beliefs.</P>
<P>Morton Kelsey's name popped up frequently in Wimber's teachings, and Wimber 
had even dedicated a seminar series to him. One wonders how one who claimed to 
be an apostle of Jesus could give credibility to someone who equated the 
ministry of Jesus with that of a shaman -- a witch doctor.</P>
<P>Wimber evidently hoped to justify his learning from Kelsey by saying that he 
didn't agree with some of his teachings. But there is no justification for 
"learning from" someone who equated Jesus with a witch doctor, or His divine 
ability to know with "extra-sensory perception." Kelsey's errors extended far 
beyond this blasphemous teaching. Anyone with a modicum of Holy Spirit 
discernment wouldn't touch Kelsey's writings with a ten-foot pole, let alone 
dedicate a teaching to him.</P>
<P>There were many other influences whom Wimber cited in his teachings:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(a) Agnes Sanford -- pantheist and "mother" of inner healing in the 
  churches;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(b) Ruth Carter Stapleton (former President Jimmy Carter's sister) -- 
  disciple of Agnes Sanford, who claimed that one could be "born again" by 
  listening to greater music or gazing upon certain works of art;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(c) Dennis and Rita Bennett -- disciples of Agnes Sanford, and early 
  pioneers of the charismatic movement;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(d) John and Paula Sanford -- pantheists, and disciples of Agnes Sanford; 
  </P>
  <P>(e) Francis MacNutt -- Roman Catholic charismatic priest, disciple of Agnes 
  Sanford, proponent of inner healing methodologies;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(f) Michael Scanlan -- Roman Catholic charismatic priest, disciple of Agnes 
  Sanford, proponent of inner healing methodologies;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(g) <A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hagin/">Kenneth E. 
  Hagin</A> -- "father" of the word-faith movement, mentor of <A 
  href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/copeland/">Kenneth 
  Copeland</A>, and disciple of E.W. Kenyon, whose theology was heavily 
  influenced by science of mind teachings;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Space does not allow for more except to say that Wimber often sprinkled 
warnings about the New Age, the occult, and erroneous charismatic suppositions 
as if his power evangelism methodologies were removed from them. This, coupled 
with his listing in his bibliography the words of men like Kurt Koch and Doug 
Groothuis, acted as a smoke-screen</P>
<H3><B>Roman Catholic Influences</B></H3>
<P>Wimber gave much credence to Roman Catholic sources for establishing the 
validity of miracles. (<I>Power Healing</I>, p. 7). He contrasted the false 
claims of healing by "Elmer Gantrys, men and women out for material gain at the 
expense of the faithful," with the Catholic Church's "stringent criteria" for 
validating true miracles from God (<I>Power Healing</I>, p. 10). Wimber implied 
that the Roman Catholic approach to miracles was more trustworthy than that of 
Protestants (<I>Power Healing</I>, p. 11).</P>
<P>But why should this surprise us? Wimber's wife Carol was raised in the Roman 
Catholic Church. Wimber stated that after having separated for awhile over 
marriage difficulties, he and Carol were remarried in the Catholic Church. 
Neither of the Wimbers ever renounced their Roman Catholic experiences -- 
another reason why the occult influences of Roman Catholic mysticism find 
expression in the Vineyard.</P>
<P>Additionally, Wimber wrote for the Catholic charismatic publication, <I>New 
Covenant</I> (June, 1988). His article, "Why I Love <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/mary.htm">Mary</A>," 
didn't affirm the Catholic dogmas of Mary's sinlessness, her perpetual 
virginity, or her assumption into heaven. But neither did it offer any 
refutation of them. Knowing the Catholic belief in Mary as "the Mother of God," 
and the unbiblical doctrines that attend her veneration, such an article left 
the impression that Wimber had no problem with the Catholic approach to Mary. 
(Moreover, in his ecumenical fervor, Wimber publicly apologized to the 
Archbishop of Los Angeles on behalf of all Protestants.)</P>
<H3><B>Holy Laughter</B></H3>
<P>A phenomenon that has swept through many Vineyard churches is that known as 
"<A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/holylaugh.htm">holy 
laughter</A>." Many churches are reporting spontaneous, uncontrollable laughter 
erupting from their congregations, even during times of solemn ceremony or 
messages from the pulpit. Some report uncontrollable weeping, falling to the 
floor in ecstatic trances, and animal noises such as barking like dogs and 
roaring like lions. Some stagger and reel like drunken people, unable to walk a 
straight line. For simplicity's sake, all these have come to be called "holy 
laughter," since laughter is the pre-eminent phenomenon displayed. In simple 
terms, it is physical manifestations in the form of virtually any expression 
attributed to absolute control by the Holy Spirit. Proponents of these phenomena 
say they are evidence of a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit in response to 
the people's desire to see a new sign from God.</P>
<P>The phenomena was imported into the United States and Canada from South 
Africa through one Rodney Howard-Browne. It erupted in 1994 at the Toronto 
Airport Vineyard in Toronto, Canada, pastored by John Arnott. The bizarre 
exhibitions of human flesh in this movement are in every way similar to what, 
for centuries, have been regarded as evidence of demonic influences. It's little 
wonder that the Vineyard has led the charge, considering the lack of discernment 
on the part of its leadership. Actually, these manifestations were in evidence 
during the early years of Wimber's Vineyard ministry.</P>
<P>Initially, John Wimber kept a wait-and-see attitude, while validating the 
experiences as perhaps fleshly at times, but, overall, a move of God -- "There's 
nothing in Scripture that supports these kinds of phenomena that I can see, and 
I can't think of anything throughout the church age that would. So I feel no 
obligation to try to explain it. It's just phenomena. It's just people 
responding to God" (2/95, <I>Charisma</I>). In December, 1995, he moved to 
disenfranchise the Toronto Airport Vineyard. This was perceived by some as 
evidence that the Vineyard was acting reasonably to keep such phenomena separate 
from its "legitimate" ministry.</P>
<P>However, the reason given by the leadership of the Association of Vineyard 
Churches (AVC) was <B>not</B> that the Association rejected the goings-on at 
Toronto, but that the Toronto Airport Vineyard had gone "over the edge" by 
<U>promoting and encouraging</U> the animal sounds and accompanying behavior 
(Marcia Ford, "Toronto Church Ousted From Vineyard," <I>Charisma and Christian 
Life</I>, 2/96, p. 12). In September 1994, the AVC issued guidelines which 
indicated that, while they were not against such phenomena, they did not want it 
promoted.</P>
<P>It needs to be emphasized, John Wimber never did reject the laughing revival. 
He endorsed John Arnott's book, <I>The Father's Blessing</I>. He merely rejected 
some of the grosser aspects of this movement. The Vineyard Association's 
statement of December 1995 concluded:&nbsp;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"OUR ACTION DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE HAVE REJECTED THE CURRENT RENEWAL. Many 
  of our churches have benefited greatly from this current renewal and have 
  incorporated it into their church life within the healthy and biblical 
  guidelines reflected in the articles and policies published over the past two 
  years. WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE RENEWAL IN THIS 
WAY."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Why would Wimber and the AVC take such harsh measures since Wimber himself 
had endorsed the Toronto phenomena, and since he had allowed the same behavior 
in his own meetings? Are they manifestations of God or not? If so, why not allow 
Arnott to promote and encourage them? If not, why has the AVC not condemned them 
and taken similar action against the other almost 50% of Vineyard churches that 
encourage the phenomena?</P>
<P>Not ever being able to take a firm stand on the authority of these things, 
the AVC decided to dissociate from the most visible and central Vineyard church 
promoting these phenomena, on the basis that its pastor did not comply with the 
AVC Board's position. The AVC Board took the same non-committal stance that 
Wimber had taken. In fact, they allowed their statement to be subject to the 
discretion of the local pastors.</P>
<H3><B>The Kansas City Connection</B></H3>
<P>Toward the mid to late 1980s, Wimber became enamored by the ministry team of 
the Kansas City Fellowship, or as they became known as, "The Kansas City 
Prophets." At an August 1989 conference in Denver, Colorado, Wimber called on 
Vineyard pastors to receive their ministry.</P>
<P>Interestingly enough, in 1990, when the Kansas City Prophets began to be 
exposed as fraudulent, it was to Wimber that they went for "correction." But, he 
never stopped promoting the erroneous teachings of Paul Cain, Mike Bickle, Bob 
Jones, and John Paul Jackson. In 1991, he did stop promoting Bob Jones, but not 
because of heresy, but because of immorality.</P>
<P>The point is that Wimber, by his acceptance of false prophets, paved the way 
for an unquestioning acceptance of "prophets" in general. Of course, there is 
nothing wrong with "modern day prophets" as long as they will submit to the 
tests of Deut. 18 and Deut. 13. But, these prophets actually boasted about the 
margin of error that the Lord had graciously allowed them! </P>
<H3><B>The Gifts of the Spirit</B></H3>
<P>God always has performed and always will perform His miracles according to 
His own purpose and pleasure. The excesses and errors of the Vineyard, as well 
as many within the charismatic and Pentecostal churches, merely prove that most 
of what is transpiring in the name of God's power is really the flesh of man 
seeking a sign to validate the truth of God's Word.</P>
<P>Essentially, the [permanent] gifts of the Spirit are given primarily for the 
edification of the Church, not for evangelism. The sign gifts, i.e., the 
miraculous gifts, have ceased. This does not negate the fact that God might 
occasionally use the gifts to convict and convince those He has chosen for 
salvation. But first and foremost, the gifts are for "power edification," not 
"power evangelism."</P>
<H3><B>Conclusion</B></H3>
<P>To hear virtually every major teacher in the Church today, there are no false 
teachers except those who call out the false teachers and staunchly insist on a 
defense of the Faith -- the so-called "heretic hunters." Why are few leaders of 
any real magnitude warning the brethren about false teachers? Because most 
<B><I>are</I></B><I> </I>the false teachers. They are compromising with the 
Vatican to lead all of Christendom back under the papal umbrella. And the 
central force for that unity is not the true Gospel; it is false "love" combined 
with false doctrine and lying signs and wonders -- miracles of God -- 
implemented through occult methodologies.</P>
