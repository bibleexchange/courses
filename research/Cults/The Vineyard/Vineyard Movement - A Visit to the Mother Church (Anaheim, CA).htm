<H1>A Visit to the Vineyard Church (Anaheim, CA)</H1>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;September 5, 2003 (Adapted and/or excerpted from: David 
Cloud, <A 
href="http://www.wayoflife.org/fbns/fbns-index/indexfbns.htm">Fundamental 
Baptist Information Service</A>, P.O. Box 610368, Port Huron, MI 48061) -- The 
<A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/vine/">Vineyard 
Fellowship</A>, which numbers more than 500 churches worldwide, prospered under 
the leadership of the late <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/wimber/general.htm">John 
Wimber</A> (1934-1997). In 1977, Wimber started a church in Anaheim, California, 
which eventually grew to 6,000 members and became the mother church of the 
Vineyard Association. These churches have exercised an influence far beyond 
their numbers. They have promoted a radical ecumenism and a <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/">charismatic</A>-style 
experience orientation among evangelicals who do not claim to be charismatics. A 
large part of this experience derives from the use of powerful <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/rockm/">rock music</A> to 
help create a sensual worship experience. The Vineyard music has gone around the 
world and is very influential in the contemporary praise and worship movement. 
Recently, for example, I [David Cloud] obtained a Vineyard tape that was 
produced in India and was sold in a bookstore in Kathmandu, Nepal.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>John Wimber opened the floodgates to many errors by 
downplaying the importance of Biblical discernment. He warned against being "too 
rigid" and "too heavily oriented to the written Word" (<I>Counterfeit 
Revival</I>, p. 109). He warned against "worshipping the book" and mocked those 
who judge everything strictly by the Bible, saying they have "God the Father, 
God the Son, and God the Holy Book" (<I>Ibid.</I>). One would say something like 
that only if he were attempting to promote things which were not in accordance 
with the Word of God. The Psalmist said the written Word "is a lamp unto my feet 
and a light unto my path" (Psa. 119:105). It is impossible to be <I>too strongly 
oriented</I> toward the Bible!&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>In his healing seminar, Wimber made the following statement: 
"It's evil when you hide behind doctrinal beliefs that curtail and control the 
work of the Spirit. The Church today is committing evil in the name of sound 
doctrine. And they are quenching the work of the Holy Spirit" (Wimber, Healing 
Seminar Series, cited from <I>Testing the Fruit of the Vineyard</I>, by John 
Goodwin).&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>In 1994, a visitor to the Anaheim Vineyard, the mother church 
pastored by Wimber, was told by one of the Vineyard pastors: "In a moment, I'm 
going to call down the Holy Spirit. Things like you've never seen will begin to 
happen. Don't be alarmed by anything you see. And above all, don't try to 
rationally evaluate the things you will see. Subjecting the revival to doctrinal 
tests is the surest way to put out the fire." At the same meeting, a woman 
church staff member led in public prayer with these frightful words: "We refuse 
to critique with our minds the work that You want to do in our hearts. We refuse 
to subject Your work to our little doctrinal tests."&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Such a mindset leaves one open to spiritual delusion. If the 
Holy Spirit operates contrary to the Word of God, there is absolutely no way to 
discern between the true Spirit and false spirits. This subtle undermining of 
Biblical authority is one reason why strange and unscriptural things (such as 
spiritual drunkenness and prophets who learn how to prophesy by making mistakes) 
have been accepted in the Vineyard movement.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>On August 31, 2003, I [David Cloud] attended the Sunday 
morning service of the Anaheim Vineyard in order to report on what I saw and 
heard. The dress was casual in the extreme. The people dressed as they would for 
a sporting event. Shorts were the rule. The service was divided into four 
segments: praise and worship, prophecy, sermon, and "personal 
ministry."&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The praise and worship segment was led by a large rock style 
band consisting of a drummer, three or four guitars, a piano, a keyboardist (who 
also played saxophone and a wind midi), and several singers. A large percentage 
of the people participated enthusiastically in the worship service, many lifting 
up their hands, some kneeling, most swaying to the music, some 
dancing.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The Vineyard music is very influential and is crossing most 
denominational lines. One of its themes is ecumenical unity. Vineyard worship 
leader David Ruis' song "Break Dividing Walls" is an example. It says, "We will 
break dividing walls; we will be one. We will break dividing walls between the 
Baptist and the Methodist, between the Episcopalian and the Presbyterian, 
between the Pentecostal and the Charismatic; the walls are coming down between 
all denominations."&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>During the prophecy segment, a few people, both men and 
women, gave personal prophecies or led out in a song. One prophecy boldly 
proclaimed, "The time will come when the taverns and the malls will be places of 
worship." This is a prophecy that has often been made by those who believe that 
the coming of Christ will be preceded by a great spiritual revival characterized 
by the redeeming of large segments of society accompanied by signs and wonders. 
Many of the prophets who have been associated with the Vineyard, such as Paul 
Cain and Mike Bickle, have made such prophecies.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The message was on contemplative prayer and it was deeply 
influenced by <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/">Roman Catholic</A> 
spirituality. The speaker, who is a pastor emeritus in a Vineyard church, 
described four types of prayer: crisis prayer, evangelical prayer, "Come, Holy 
Spirit" prayer (calling upon the Holy Spirit to demonstrate "kingdom power"), 
and contemplative prayer. He described the latter as "gazing at length on 
something" and as "coming into the presence of God and resting in the presence 
of God." He described contemplative prayer as lying back and floating "in the 
river of God's peace." The speaker described sitting on a couch "in the manifest 
presence of Jesus." He quoted St. John of the Cross: "It is in silence that we 
hear him."&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The Vineyard speaker recommended the writings of the late 
Thomas Merton (a Catholic priest who converted from the Anglican Church), who 
wrote a book on contemplative prayer and whose voice is influential in the 
"centering prayer" movement. Merton spent the last 27 years of his life in a 
Trappist monastery <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/mary.htm">devoted to 
Mary</A> (Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Kentucky) and promoted the 
integration of pagan practices such as Zen Buddhism and Christianity. The titles 
of some of his books were <I>Zen and the Birds of the Appetite</I>, <I>The Way 
of Chuang Tzu</I>, and <I>Mystics and the Zen Masters</I>. For three years, 
Merton lived as a complete hermit.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The Vineyard speaker described personal revelations that he 
had allegedly received from God. He claimed that on one occasion Jesus said to 
him, "Come away, my beloved," and he obeyed by staying in a monastery for some 
days. He mentioned at least two occasions in which he has spent time in 
monasteries. The speaker claimed that there are five benefits from contemplative 
prayer: (1) An abiding sense of peace, (2) prophetic revelation, (3) love that 
is felt, (4) personal transformation, and (5) power ministry. He used several 
Catholic "saints" as examples of the benefit of contemplative prayer, and there 
was no warning whatsoever about their false gospel, their blasphemous prayers to 
Mary, or any other error. In fact, he recommended that his listeners read the 
lives of the saints. He mentioned St. Catherine of Siena and said that Christ 
appeared to her and placed a ring on her finger signifying her marriage to Him. 
He claimed that Catherine experienced the benefit of contemplative prayer by 
being able to exercise supernatural healings. He mentioned "St. Anthony," one of 
the fathers of the deeply unscriptural Catholic monasticism. Anthony spent 20 
years in isolation, and after that, according to the Vineyard pastor, the 
"saint's" ministry was characterized by "signs and wonders."&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The growing emphasis on Catholic spirituality in evangelical 
and charismatic circles is very dangerous, but it is the outgrowth of the 
ecumenical philosophy which has torn down the walls of separation between many 
Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church. When Ronald Atwood left the Episcopal 
church and was ordained a Catholic priest in the St. Francis de Sales Cathedral 
in Oakland, California, in December 1984, he cited Thomas Merton as one of his 
influences. Atwood testified that the practice of Catholic-style contemplative 
prayer "led him to seek spiritual direction from a Catholic priest" (<I>The 
Christian News</I>, Jan. 7, 1985).&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>After the sermon, the Vineyard speaker gave an invitation for 
the people to come forward to receive personal ministry by the workers. He first 
led the congregation in repeating silently to themselves, "Jesus, Son of David, 
have mercy on me." He said, "Receive his presence that is coming upon you." He 
said, "Holy Spirit, I pray for your merciful presence to rest on each of us." 
The people were urged to pray, "Lord Jesus, have mercy on me a sinner," but the 
gospel was never given. There was no explanation of why sinners can receive 
mercy or what sin is or what it means to receive mercy. Nothing was clarified; 
all was vague religiosity. A Roman Catholic would have interpreted the 
invitation within the context of his sacramental gospel and would doubtless have 
"received Jesus" again just as he has been taught to do repeatedly but without 
coming to the once-for-all experience of the new birth.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Many people went forward, but I did not observe the 
traditional charismatic phenomena such as spirit slaying and shaking. Those were 
typical at the Anaheim Vineyard in the 1990s, but there weren't any signs and 
wonders this day.</P>
