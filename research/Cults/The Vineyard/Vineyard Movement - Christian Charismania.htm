<H1>Vineyard Movement</H1>
<H2>"Christian" Charismania</H2>
<P>-&nbsp; The Vineyard movement is a hyper-charismatic organization that is 
also known by the names of "third wave," "Signs and Wonders Movement," and 
"power theology." It was officially begun in 1982 with <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/wimber/">John Wimber</A>'s 
affiliation with a small group of Southern California churches (then affiliated 
with the <A href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/smith/">Chuck 
Smith-Calvary Chapel movement</A>). The "mother" church was named the Vineyard 
Christian Fellowship of Anaheim, California, as part of the Association of 
Vineyard Churches (AVC). From five churches in 1982, the AVC had grown at the 
time of Wimber's death in November of 1997 to approximately 450 churches in the 
U.S. and another 250 abroad, with an estimated 200,000 members throughout the 
world. (Counting those churches "friendly" to the Vineyard without being 
officially affiliated with it, the Vineyard can boast that it influences the 
faith and practice of more than 1500 churches.) AVC's goal is to have 2,000 
churches in the Vineyard fold by the year 2000.</P>
<P>-&nbsp; The Vineyard movement draws the vast majority of its support from 
those who were originally non-charismatic "evangelicals." In fact, the Vineyard 
has infiltrated, currently or in the recent past, such evangelical seminaries as 
Dallas Theological Seminary (three DTS "Vineyard-professors" were dismissed in 
1987), Trinity International University, an -<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/efca.htm">E-Free</A> 
affiliated school (formerly Trinity Evangelical Divinity School -- two 
"Vineyard-professors" employed), Fuller Seminary (three "Vineyard-professors" on 
the Missions Dept. faculty), and Biola Seminary (two "Vineyard-professors" on 
the faculty). The Vineyard has also infiltrated such organizations as the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/pk/">Promise Keepers</A> 
(top PK leaders are Vineyard members), and has been instrumental in the 
unscriptural "<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/holylaugh.htm">Laughing 
Revival</A>." Todd Hunter is now the National Director of the Association of 
Vineyard Churches (USA). In an interview with <I>The Voice of The Vineyard</I>, 
Hunter said, "What was core to our original vision? Winning the lost and 
planting churches. How do we get there? We get there by trying to be an 
expression of the best of evangelical thinking and <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/pente.htm">Pentecostal</A> 
practices."</P>
<P>-&nbsp; As an overview, the Vineyard movement's teachings err dramatically in 
three main areas (each one of these is addressed in more detail in our report on 
John Wimber): (<I>MS</I>, p. 22)<B>*</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(1) Dependence on <U>experience rather than Scripture</U>, leading to both 
  a pragmatic (if it works, it must be from God) and a subjective approach (all 
  sources of truth are equally valid) -- "experience first, then mold theology 
  to fit the experience," seems to be the Vineyard's motto.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(2) Acceptance of <U><A 
  href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/newage.htm">occult/New Age</A> 
  practices</U> in "Christian" forms, such as aura reading and manipulation, the 
  teaching of "<A 
  href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/inheal.htm">inner 
  healing</A>," astral projection, contact with familiar spirits, and 
  psychological and occult methodologies.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(3) A <U>mystical view of <A 
  href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/warfare/">spiritual 
  warfare</A></U> that comes dangerously close to spiritism, culminating in the 
  belief that even <U><A 
  href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/warfare/demonp.htm">Christians 
  can be possessed by demons</A></U>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>-&nbsp; The Vineyard's approach to healing is not the mere laying on of hands 
accompanied by fervent prayer, but the incorporation of an unholy mixture of <A 
href="http://www.psychoheresy-aware.org/jungleg.html">Jungian psychology</A> and 
Agnes Sanford's "inner healing" techniques, both of which have their roots in 
the occult, but have become popularized in our day through the New Age Movement 
(Albert James <I>Dager, Vengeance Is Ours</I>, p. 155). "There is every 
indication that the Vineyard movement, chasing after signs and wonders, has 
become caught up in a mystical [New Age] mindset that will lead inevitably to a 
greater religious deception to which the vast majority of the world's populace 
will succumb" (Dager, p. 156).</P>
<P>-&nbsp; The Vineyard movement teaches that signs and wonders were <U>the 
essential ingredient</U> for success in first century church evangelism (a claim 
which is <U>not</U> supported anywhere in the Book of Acts), and that for today, 
the <U>only way</U> to get people to believe the Gospel is to startle them into 
believing through healing, prophecy, and the casting out of demons. (This is 
called "power evangelism," and is officially defined as a presentation of the 
gospel that is rational, but also transcends the rational -- a gospel 
presentation with a demonstration of God's power through signs and wonders; 
i.e., a spontaneous, spirit-inspired, empowered presentation of the gospel that 
is preceded and undergirded by supernatural demonstrations of God's presence.) 
The Vineyard teaches that only by startling the world by demonstrations of 
clairvoyance and powerful healings will the gospel message receive respectful 
attention, because (apparently) by itself, the Gospel is too weak and powerless 
to break the stubbornness and rebellion of the human heart (Peter Masters, 
<I>The Healing Epidemic</I>, pp.74-75).</P>
<P>-&nbsp; Although the Vineyard movement will not commit itself, it is 
inherently <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/cor/">Dominionist/Kingdom 
Now/Reconstructionist</A> in its theology; i.e., the application to the present 
age of features which are unique to the Millennial reign of Christ on the earth. 
They believe in the present victory of the church, which is the essence of 
post-millennialism, and their emphasis on certain gift operations are 
characteristics of the Millennial reign of Christ rather than this present age. 
As a result, third-wave teaching is adamantly opposed to any form of 
dispensational theology (Robert Dean, Jr., <I>Biblical Perspectives</I>, "Don't 
Be Caught By The Undertow Of The Third Wave," p. 5). (Although the speaking in 
tongues is not discouraged in the Vineyard movement, the "more desired gifts," 
and thereby the most "practiced," are those of healing, casting out of demons, 
and binding Satan.)</P>
<P>-&nbsp; The Vineyard's teachings on the person and work of Christ 
(Christology) are heretical at best and blasphemous at worst. They teach that 
though Jesus was fully divine, He set aside His divinity while on earth, and 
thereby, His miraculous ministry was accomplished solely as a human, but through 
the power of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Vineyard teaches that mortal man 
today can perform signs and wonders on the same basis Jesus did -- through the 
Holy Spirit's empowering alone, we can do the same miracles, works and knowledge 
as Jesus, and more! Peter Wagner, one of the central leaders of the Vineyard, 
states that, "Jesus exercised no power of and by Himself. We today can expect to 
do the same or greater things than Jesus did, because <U>we have been given 
access to the same power source</U>." (Emphasis added.)</P>
