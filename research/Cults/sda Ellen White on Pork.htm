<P><IMG src="sda Ellen White on Pork_files/pork.jpg" align=right border=0> After 
Mrs. White got onto the health bandwagon in the 1860s, she frequently warned her 
followers of the dangers of eating pork:</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>Never should one morsel of swine's flesh be placed upon your 
  table.</B>"<SUP>1</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>What few Adventists are aware of is a 
testimony written in the late 1850s in which Mrs. White rebukes the Curtis 
family in Iowa for <B>not eating pork</B>. (Of course, this testimony was 
written prior to Mrs. White's 1864 visit to the <A 
href="http://www.ellenwhiteexposed.com/refute9.htm">Jackson Health Institute</A> 
in New York where the vegetarian diet was strongly advocated.) Sister White 
wrote: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>If God requires His people to abstain from swine's flesh, He 
  will convict them on the matter</B>. He is just as willing to show His honest 
  children their duty, as to show their duty to individuals upon whom He has not 
  laid the burden of His work. <B>If it is the duty of the church to abstain 
  from swine's flesh, God will discover it to more than two or three.</B> He 
  will teach His church their duty."<SUP>2</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>Analysis</H1></FONT></CENTER>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#000000>A Testimony of God's 
Spirit?</FONT></H3>Brother and Sister Curtis studied their Bibles and came to 
the conclusion that eating pork was wrong. How does the church's prophetess 
respond? Does she congratulate them for their good, scholarly Bible study? What 
message does God have for them? Is God pleased that this family is ahead of 
their time in realizing the dangers of eating pork? Apparently not! Mrs. White 
soundly rebukes them!<SUP>3</SUP> Was it God's Spirit that led her to write this 
testimony? If brother Curtis's health practices were in accordance with God's 
health plans, then why would God's messenger rebuke him? 
<P>H.E. Carver, an early Adventist who was friends with the Curtis family, 
shares what happened to this family: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Brother and Sister Curtis were among my most intimate friends for 
  many years, and as we lived side by side a portion of the time, I knew some of 
  the circumstances connected with the vision instruction given above. Sister 
  Curtis was a very conscientious woman, and becoming satisfied (long before any 
  movement was made in that direction by Eld. and Mrs. White) that pork-eating 
  was injurious, she tried to banish it from the table. This produced trouble. 
  Sister C. was a sincere believer in Mrs. White's divine inspiration, and from 
  the extract given above, it appears that she must have written to her for 
  instructions, which she received as above; and that professedly through 
  vision. ... Bro. Curtis also stated that Eld. White had endorsed on the back 
  of the letter the following in substance: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Short Hand" color=#d00000 size=+2 MT?,?Arial? Script 
    ,?Brush>"That you may know how we stand on this question, I would say that 
    we have just put down a two hundred pound porker."</FONT><SUP>4</SUP> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Question: Was God the <B>source</B> of this testimony to Sister Curtis? Or 
was her testimony influenced by James, who was quite fond of eating pork? 
<P>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#000000>James White's article on pork</FONT></H3>In 
1850, James White wrote an article defending the eating of pork by Christians. 
Here is how he concludes the article: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Some of our good brethren have added "swine's flesh" to the 
  catalogue of things forbidden by the Holy Ghost, and the apostles and elders 
  assembled at Jerusalem. But we feel called upon to protest against such a 
  course, as being contrary to the plain teaching of the holy scriptures. Shall 
  we lay a greater "burden" on the disciples than seemed good to the Holy Ghost, 
  and the holy apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ? God forbid. Their decision, 
  being right, settled the question with them, and was a cause of rejoicing 
  among the churches, and <B>it should forever settle the question with 
  us.</B>"<SUP>5</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>It is easy to understand why Sister Curtis's 
health practices seemingly irritated the Whites because they thought they had 
already settled the matter forever! Furthermore, the Whites probably felt that 
they were God's channel of truth to the church, and they apparently did not take 
too kindly to someone else bringing truth to their flock. 
<P>
<H3><FONT face=arial color=#000000>Pork Causes Cancer and Leprosy?</FONT></H3>
<P>A few years later, of course, Mrs. White adopted the exact same stance as 
Mrs. Curtis on pork, and then she brought it to the church as if she had 
received the instruction from God through visions. The Curtis family no doubt 
found that to be confusing, but to add to all the confusion about whether or not 
pork is proper for Christians to eat, Mrs. White claimed that pork caused 
various diseases, including leprosy and cancer: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"God did not prohibit the Hebrews from eating swine's flesh merely 
  to show his authority, but because it was not a proper article of food for 
  man. It would fill the system with scrofula, and especially in that warm 
  climate produce <B>leprosy</B> and disease of various kinds."<SUP>6</SUP> 
  <P>"The eating of pork has produced <B>scrofula, leprosy, and cancerous</B> 
  humors."<SUP>7</SUP> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>These dire warnings turned out to be 
completely false. Scientists now know that pigs do not carry leprosy. Therefore, 
it is impossible for them to transmit leprosy to humans. Here is confirmation 
from a veterinary scientist: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"As per our phone conversation of 15-Feb-93, <B>swine are not a 
  known host for <I>Mycobacterium leprae</I>, the cause of 
  leprosy</B>."<SUP>8</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Here is further confirmation that leprosy 
is not found in pigs: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Infectious agent—<I>Mycobacterium leprae</I>, the leprosy 
  (Hansen's) bacillus. Other than in man it has multiplied in the footpads of 
  mice, in the tissues of immunosuppressed rodents, and in the armadillo. 4. 
  Reservoir— <B>Man is the only known reservoir</B>."<SUP>9</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mrs. White was closer to being accurate when it comes to pork causing cancer. 
Heavy pork eating does raise the chances of a person developing certain types of 
cancers.<SUP>10</SUP> However, the cause is not the one suggested by Mrs. White. 
It is a myth to suppose that eating cancerous meat causes cancer in humans. Even 
when injected with live cancerous organisms, laboratory animals do not develop 
cancers: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"It is true that many varieties of germs, molds, and microscopic 
  parasites can often be cultivated from various kinds of tumors, but when these 
  microscopic organisms are injected into animals they fail to cause any 
  cancerous or other tumors to grow."<SUP>11</SUP> </BLOCKQUOTE>Dr. Gregory Hunt, 
in his book <I>Beware This Cult</I>, adds, "If they fail to cause cancer when 
injected, they won't when ingested."
