<P class=pcmaintitle align=left><STRONG>Hillary Clinton Will Not Become 
President </STRONG></P>
<P>Nothing strikes terror in the majority of Americans more than the thought of 
Hillary Clinton being the next President. That terror is one of the reasons she 
will never reach the goal she now cherishes and is pursuing. Americans have made 
foolish decisions in the past, but nothing close to electing Hillary .She 
presents a persona of compassion but has a heart of cold steel. She is an evil 
woman and it would be hard to imagine America ever recovering from eight years 
of her design.</P>
<P>She is the dream world of every godless humanistic segment in our America. 
God's prophetic plan for us as a nation would be disrupted. Satan's cohorts 
would dance in glee. Liberals see her as the hope of fmal and absolute defeat of 
all core conservative policies and the complete entrenchment of the liberal 
design. President George Bush and the present climax in our nation has started a 
slow return to a more conservative atmosphere. The road back from judicial 
activism gone completely berserk has begun. The liberals have slowly hijacked 
our once proud nation of her strong faith in God and her commitment to decency. 
With their flagship foot soldiers, called the American Civil Liberties Union, 
they have intimidated almost every local government and public school to kick 
God out the back door. All of this is changing.</P>
<P>Hillary Clinton wants to be the President so that she can go far beyond her 
husband's policies. His reckless life compelled him to adopt middle of the road 
policies to stay in office. She exudes a self-righteous demeanor that would 
seduce the many spineless politicians to cloak her plans in grandeur. Her 
appointments to judges and key offices would undercut every conservative value 
that America has loved and holds dear .Bloody Mary of England's past would win 
sainthood after Hillary.</P>
<P>Most Americans remember when she stood shoulder to shoulder with Arafat and 
endorsed this terrorist as a statesman. Our greatest protection as a nation is 
our unfailing support of Israel and our deep unity of faith in the same 
sovereign God of the Bible. This kind of Biblical foundation means nothing to 
liberals, including Senator Hillary Clinton. It is our only hope of survival in 
this post 9/11 world.</P>
<P>It is only because of pro-life Americans weeping and sighing over the million 
of aborted babies, and other horrible evils, that have diverted even greater 
judgment on this nation. The spilled blood of these innocent souls cries out 
from our soil and those cries have already reached the ears of our God. He gave 
us a pro-life President because of the weeping and sighing. This victory is not 
going to be lost on Hillary. The present bill to be signed by our President that 
ends Partial Birth Abortion is by far the greatest moral accomplishment of 
President Bush's legacy to this point.</P>
<P>Hillary is a pro-choice hardcore. Unborn children would have less rights than 
African-Americans ever imagined. The only kind of persons she would ever 
consider for a judicial appointment are equally hardcore on this issue. The 
funding of population control by abortion would be high on her agenda. Not one 
unborn child would be safe in America while she was President. </P>
<P>The champions of women's rights have always been the true church of Jesus 
Christ. The women's rights championed by "President" Hillary would not be moral 
in the least but would lean towards lesbianism and the end of marriage, as we 
have known it in our great American traditions. Every report I have read of her 
in the White House has been wild radicalism on this issue. Some key women that 
served the Clinton White House looked more like "butches" than ladies.</P>
<P>While all the things we know about Hillary are dangerous, the most scary 
things are the things we do not know. A woman of her demeanor, if it were 
possible for her to be elected President, would take on a degree of haughtiness 
that would border on insanity. She would be emboldened by the kind of staff she 
would surround herself with, and they would certainly further her ego. It would 
be "Queen Hillary" in her mind, and the very grandeur that would be seen by 
Americans would make her impossible to defeat. Think of the conduct and attitude 
that Bill Clinton got by with and double it for Hillary Clinton.</P>
<P>Please believe me when I say this woman is dangerous. Every great nation, 
institution, church denomination, or business must follow discemment in the 
placing of individuals in places of leadership. Most of the decision is made on 
the persona that hides behind the face. As America approaches the future, we 
must leam to be discerning in electing our leaders. God has a prophetic place 
for our nation. Our great culture of the past has been wounded to the edge of 
extinction. It must be resurrected. We need a spiritual awakening that goes far 
beyond the church face we wear on Sunday morning. Our leaders we elect actually 
represent what is happening spiritually in the hearts of the voting majority 
.Let's prepare on our faces before God for the next election. If we do, and I 
believe many will, Senator Hillary Clinton does not have the possibility of 
winning.</P></BODY></HTML>
