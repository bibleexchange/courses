      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">The Karaite Jews has now confirmed that the 
      "Day of Atonement" in 1844 was late September and not Late October. Their

      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><B>Why is the Karaite date of 
      the Day of Atonement important?<O:P> </O:P></B></P>
      <P>Seventh-day Adventists claim that in 1844, a very small Jewish sect 
      called the "Karaites," used a different calendar and thus celebrated the 
      Day of Atonement (10th of Tishri) on October 22, <I>one month later</I> 
      than the Rabbinical/Orthodox Jews who did so on September 23. Thus the 
      entire Seventh-day Adventist teaching regarding the 2300 days of Daniel 
      8:14, the Investigative Judgment, the Great Disappointment, and Jesus' 
      entrance into the Most Holy Place, hinges only on the words of their 
      prophet Ellen White and on their claim Karaites celebrated the Day of 
      Atonement on October 22 in 1844. If either of these assertions is 
      incorrect, then Seventh-day Adventism is in serious theological 
      trouble.</P>
      <P>The Rabbinical Day of Atonement in 1844 is easy to for anyone to prove 
      from Jewish sources, that it came on September 23, 1844.</P>

      <P>Subject: Yom Kippur 1844</P>
      <P>Date: Fri, 27 Nov 1998 18:07:55 +0200</P>
      <P>From: The Karaite Korner <SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><A 
      href="mailto:karaite@netvision.net.il">karaite@netvision.net.il</A></SPAN></P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>In the past you have asked regarding the Karaite date of Yom Kippur 
      1844. I have recently received further inquiries in this matter and have 
      done some investigation of this subject. Here are my preliminary 
      results:</P>
      <P>In the Middle Ages the Karaites ardently maintained that the Biblical 
      year begins with the ripeness of the Barley crop in Israel (called in the 
      Bible "Abib"). The Rabbinic calendar had originally followed this practice 
      but around the 9th century CE they adopted a 19 year cycle of 
      intercalation (leap years) which approximates the Abib but which is far 
      from accurate. This often caused a difference of a month between the 
      Karaite and Rabbanite calendars. The Seventh Day Adventist tradition seems 
      to have heard of this Karaite practice or perhaps they assumed it was the 
      Karaite practice based on their (correct) assumption that the Karaites 
      strictly follow the Bible. The Abib was a central issue to the Karaites 
      and to this day the Karaite marriage contract includes a vow that the 
      marrying couple will celebrate the holidays "according to the visibility 
      of the moon and the appearance of the Abib in the land of Israel." 
      However, already in the Middle Ages there were Karaite communities who 
      slowly adopted the Rabbinic 19 year cycle. At first it was only Karaites 
      in the distant lands of the Dispersion who followed the Rabbinic 19 year 
      cycle. They claimed that it was difficult to receive reports of the state 
      of the Barley crop in Israel from so far away. As late as the 15th century 
      though the Karaites of the Holy Land continued to follow the Abib even 
      though their compatriots in the Dispersion accepted the 19 year Rabbinic 
      cycle. The 15th century Karaite Hacham Elijah Baschyatchi writes:</P>
      <P>"Having explained that the beginning of the year according to the law 
      of our Torah is according to the Abib which is found is the Land of Israel 
      in the conditions which we have mentioned, because of our great sins we 
      have been distanced from the Holy Land and we do not have the capability 
      of finding the Abib, we have been forced to follow the Calculation of 
      Intercalation like that done by our brothers the Rabbanites..."</P>
      <P>Baschyatchi continues further down the page:</P>
      <P>"And the Hacham R' Aharon [ben Elijah] author of the book 'Etz Haim' 
      also said** that in the 269th cycle we heard that in the 4th year of the 
      cycle [i.e. 1354/1355 C.E.] what was for us the month of Elul was for the 
      people of the Land of Israel the month of Tishrei...' ... And this has 
      also happened in our [Baschyatchi's] times in the year 5240 [i.e. 
      1479/1480 C.E.], the 15th year of the cycle, people went from our 
      community in the</P>
      <P>Holy City [i.e. Jerusalem] and said that the 14th year of the 276 
      cycle, which we are in, which was for us an intercalated year [i.e. 13 
      months] was for them a regular year [i.e. 12 months]. And our faith should 
      not be weakened by this because they [in Israel] go after the observable 
      and we [in the Diaspora] go after approximation... The end of the matter 
      is, all maintain the legal decision that the inhabitants of the Land of 
      Israel should go according to the Abib in the Land of Israel and those far 
      away should go after the calculation of intercalation of leap years and 
      simple years." (From "Aderet Eliyahu" by Elijah Baschyatchi, Israel 1966, 
      p.39a (written in the 15th century) [translation from the Hebrew by 
      Nehemia Gordon, square brackets added by translator for clarity])</P>
      <P>As can be seen, in Baschyatchi's's own time the Karaites of the 
      Dispersion followed the Rabbinic 19 year cycle while those of Israel 
      followed the actual appearance of the Abib and at times this caused a 
      difference of one month in the calendar.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, by the 19th century the Karaites universally followed the 
      19 year Rabbinic cycle both in the Diaspora and in Israel. The 19th 
      century Karaite Hacham Shlomoh ben Afedah Hacohen wrote an abridged 
      paraphrase of Elijah Baschyatchi's Aderet Eliyahu. In his abridgement, 
      Shlomoh Afedah paraphrases the above quoted passage but adds the following 
      words:</P>
      <P>"And for some time now the quest for the Abib has been abandoned even 
      in the Land of Israel and they [the inhabitants of Israel] intercalate 
      years using the above mentioned system [i.e. the 19 year Rabbinic cycle] 
      like we do outside of Israel, [this is] against the legal decision of the 
      Rav [i.e. Baschyatchi] and the Hachamim [mentioned in the above quoted 
      passage of Aderet Eliyahu] perhaps in order to unite with all the 
      communities and so that we will not have a disagreement between them and 
      us in fixing the year."</P>
      <P>(From "Gefen Ha'Aderet", Shlomoh ben Afedah Hacohen, Israel 1987, 
      pp.22-23 (written in 1860) [translation from the Hebrew by Nehemia Gordon, 
      square brackets added by translator for clarity.])</P>

      <P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">That Yom Kippur 1844 was celebrated by the 
      Karaites in September and not October</SPAN></B> is confirmed by a Karaite 
      Tomb Stone inscription cited by Abraham Firkowitz in his book "Avnei 
      Zicharon" (lit. 'Stones of Remembrance'. published Vilna 1872). It should 
      be noted that while claims have been made that Firkowitz altered some of 
      the inscriptions cited in his book, all of these dubious accusations are 
      in regards to Tomb Stones from the early centuries of the Common Era and 
      there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the later Tomb Stones, 
      especially those from the 19th century. On p.242 Firkowitz quotes from a 
      Karaite Tomb Stone from the "New Cemetary" in Gozlow which reads:</P>
      <P>ý"And Yosef Shlomoh died at seventy five years of age. And all Israel 
      mourned him and cried for him 'Woe master and woe his glory'. And they 
      buried him in great honor on the 12th day of the month Tevet in the year 
      605 of the sixth millenium since creation according to our counting, and 
      according to the counting of Rome, the tenth of the month December in 
      their year 1844 here in Gozlow, or Yeupetoria, on the Crimean Peninsula in 
      the reign of the master the great and mighty Czar, King of Russia and the 
      other lands, that is, the Emporer his majesty Nicolai the first Pavelovitz 
      in the twentieth year of his reign, and in the sixty-first year of this 
      Crimean Peninsula being under the rule of the Kings of Russia since the 
      days of the Czarina Catherine the Second who conquered it from the hand of 
      the Tartaric king and Shekhan Gari Khan who was king of Crimea at that 
      time."ý [Translation from the Hebrew by Nehemia Gordon]</P>
      <P>As can be seen the Karaite date 12 Tevet corresponds to December 10, 
      1844. Bearing in mind that the Russian Empire used the Julian calendar, 
      December 10 of the Julian year must be understood to refer to December 22 
      in the Gregorian year (i.e. the system used universally today). If 12 
      Tevet was equivalent to December 22, 1844 (Gregorian) then Tevet would 
      have begun on December 10 (Gregorian<B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">). Bearing 
      in mind that Tevet is the tenth Hebrew month and Tishrei (in which Yom 
      Kippur falls out) is the seventh Hebrew month it becomes clear that Yom 
      Kippur 1844 must have been celebrated in late September and not late 
      October. This is illustrated in the following correlation of months for 
      months in late 1844:<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>
      <P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">September 14/15* = Tishrei 1 (Yom Kippur = 
      September 23)<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></B></P>

      <P>*The correct date for the beginning of these months, based on the 
      predicted visibility of the New Moon, would have been September 15 and 
      October 14 (both beginning the prior evening). However, it is possible 
      that with some of the inaccurate calculation system used by the Karaites 
      in the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century some Karaites may have observed the 
      beginning of these months one day earlier. It would seem that according to 
      the system of Isaac ben Solomon, which was wide-spread in the 19th 
      century, some Karaites would have celebrated September 14th as the 
      beginning of the month and not September 15th [this last fact has been 
      relayed to me by Magdi Shamuel, an expert on the Karaite calendar and 
      lunar crescent visibility]. October 13th would not have been celebrated as 
      the beginning of the month even according to Isaac ben Solomon's system. 
      However, further investigation is required to rule out the possibility 
      that some Karaites would have celebrated the beginning of the month on 
      October 13th instead of October 14th.</P>

      one month between the Karaite calendar in Israel and the Diaspora in 
      1354/1355 C.E. can be found in his book "Gan Eden", Israel 1972 (written 
      in the 14<SUP>th</SUP> century), p.22a</P>

      <P><B>We would like to ask the Seventh-day Adventist researchers why they 
      did not go to the Karaite Jews for documentation as we have done and as 
      was done by Ballenger in 1941? Could it be they did and did not reveal 
      their findings as it would nullify their prophet's date?<O:P> 
      </O:P></B></P>
      <P><B>E.S. Ballenger found the truth by a letter from the Karaite. 
      "</B>The defenders of the creed declare that while the orthodox Jews may 
      have celebrated the Day of Atonement on Sept. 23, the Karaite Jews 
      observed it on Oct 22. We have made careful investigation, and we find 
      that this is a false claim. The leading Karaite rabbi of Cairo, Egypt, 
      Youseff Ibrahim Marzork, in reply to an inquiry as to the day on which 
      they celebrated the atonement in 1844, wrote:</P>
      <P>"As to the dates of the Passover and Yom Kippur they are the 
      following:— "According to the Karaite Jews in the year 1843 the Yom Kippur 
      is on Wednesday the 4th October, and just the same date according to the 
      Rabinnical." <B>"In the year 1844 it is on Monday 23rd September for the 
      Karaite and Rabinnical." </B><I>The Gathering Call </I>by E. S. Ballenger, 
      May-June 1941, pp. 14-15.</P>
      <P><B>In conclusion,</B> Ellen G. White had the wrong year, wrong month, 
      wrong day of the return of Jesus Christ, and when that failed, she had the 
      wrong year, month, and day to begin her false Sanctuary and Investigative 
      Judgment doctrines that were to begin on the Day of Atonement in 1844.</P>
