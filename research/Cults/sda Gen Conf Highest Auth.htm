      style="COLOR: red">"<I>I have been shown</I></SPAN></B> that no man's 
      judgment should be surrendered to the judgment of any one man. But when

      is exercised, private independence and private judgment must not be 
      maintained, <I>but be surrendered</I>." 3T<I> </I>p. 492.</P>
      <P><B>Note:</B> Should we give up our private judgment and independence 
      when we are convicted by the Holy Spirit of truth to man or group of men? 
      Never! The Reformers such as Martin Luther would never make an Adventist 
      surrender their souls. Seventh-day Adventists still quote this 1875 
      statement today, and believe the General Conference is their holy 
      authority in all matters. They meet every four years to update their holy 
      27 Fundamental beliefs. What is the difference in this and the Papal 
      authority of the Catholic Church?</P>
      <P><B>1889: <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">No,</SPAN></B> "The question of the 
      great need of the soul deserves in these meetings of the [General] 
      Conference far more attention, and many questions that are tossed into the 
      Conference should never appear, be worked out in your State Conferences. 
      It has become habit to pass laws that <B><I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">do 
      not always bear the signature of heaven</SPAN></I></B><I>."</I> November 
      4, 1889, Ms. 6-1889.</P>
      <P><B>Note:</B> EGW's highest authority on earth, the GC, does not at 
      times "<I>bear the signature of heaven."<O:P> </O:P></I></P>
      <P><B>1890: <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">No,</SPAN></B> at the 1888 GC 
      session; <B><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">"the opinion of men was looked to as 
      the voice of God.</SPAN></B> <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">The enemy took 
      possession of minds and their judgment was worthless,</SPAN></B> their 
      decisions were evil, for they did not have the mind of Christ. They were 
      doing continual injustice to the persons they talked about, and they had a 
      demoralizing effect upon the conference." February 1890, Ms. 37-1890.</P>
      <P><B>Note:</B> Why was the "opinion of man looked to as the voice of 
      God?" Was it not Ellen that told them that idea in 1875 when she said, 
      "<B><I><SPAN style="COLOR: red">the General Conference, which is the 
      highest authority that God has upon the earth,?" </SPAN></I></B>Did Satan 
      indeed take possession of the minds of the men at the GC and was their 
      decisions evil? That same year1890 Ellen wrote to the GC president: "I do 
      not expect to be at <I>your</I> General Conference. <B><SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">I would rather run the other way</SPAN></B>." EGW to O. 
      A. Olsen, May 8, 1890, O46-1890.</P>
      <P><B>Note:</B> Why would Ellen run from God's highest authority on earth? 
      Shouldn't she yield her private judgment to them as she advised others to 
      do? She was disobeying God according to her 1875 vision. This is good 
      advice for all Seventh-day Adventists members, to run away from the 
      authority of the General Conference of SDAs. In fact it would be better 
      yet to run away from the Seventh-day Adventist Church with all their non 
      biblical teachings and corruption.</P>
      <P><B>1898: <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">No,</SPAN></B> "It has been some 
      years since I have considered the General Conference as the voice of God." 
      August 26,1898, in 1899 GC Bulletin, p. 74.</P>
      <P><B>1901: </B><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">N<B>o,</B></SPAN> "It is working 
      upon wrong principles that has brought the cause of God into its present 
      embarrassment. The people have lost confidence in those who have the 
      management of the work. Yet we hear that the voice of the Conference is 
      the voice of God. Every time I have heard this, I thought it was almost 
      blasphemy. The voice of the Conference ought to be the voice of God, but 
      it is not, because some in connection with it are not men of faith and 
      prayer, they are not men of elevated principle." April 1, 1901, Ms. 
      37-1901.</P>
      <P><B>Note:</B> Where does the Bible ever tell us that the leaders of the 
      church are the voice of God? Never, it is only by the uninspired Ellen G. 
      White!</P>
      <P><B>1909: <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Yes,</SPAN></B> "When in a General

      <P>"I was rereading your section on "The General Conference the Highest 
      Authority on Earth. You said something very amazing to me in your 
      statement # 7<B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">. 'Is not the Holy Spirit God's 
      highest authority on earth?'</SPAN></B> Mrs. White has promoted the 
      General Conference to take the place of the Holy Spirit." When Christ was 
      on earth in bodily form, teaching his disciples, He was the Highest 
      Authority on Earth. When He went back to Heaven, He appointed a Vicar to 
      take his place, the precious Holy Spirit. The Catholic Church says "No, 
      but the true Vicar of Christ is the Pope" This statement is blasphemy 
      against the Holy Ghost and is not forgivable. For anyone or any 
      organization to claim to do this thing, the worse curse in the Bible is 
      pronounced against them. Revelation 14:9-12."</P>
      <P>When Ellen White promoted the General Conference above the Spirit, she 
      was following the instruction of Devil, Blasphemed the Holy Spirit and 
      would have all of her followers do likewise. Can you think of a quicker 
      way for the Devil to make sure of his prey than to get people to do 
      this?</P>

      <P><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">There were many honest Seventh-day Adventists 
      that did not sell their souls by yielding their beliefs to the General 
      Conference or to the Testimonies of Ellen G. White. Men such as the 
      Kelloggs, Ballengers, Conradi, Canright, Waggnor, Jones, and thousands of 
      others. I thank God for men that were honest with God and did not 
      surrender their God given right to free independent judgment. They would 
      rather be free from the bonds of the Seventh-day Adventist hierarchy than 
      be paid to uphold non-Biblical beliefs and lose eternal life.<O:P> &nbsp;
