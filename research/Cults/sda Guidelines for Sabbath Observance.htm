            <P><B>Purpose and Perspective</B></P>
            <P>The main objective of this document on Sabbath observance is to 
            provide counsel or guidelines to church members desiring a richer, 
            more meaningful experience in Sabbath keeping.&nbsp; It is hoped 
            that this will provide an impetus toward a real reform in Sabbath 
            keeping on a worldwide basis.</P>
            <P>Conscious of the fact that the worldwide worshiping community 
            encounters numerous problems in Sabbath observance arising from 
            within a given cultural and ideological context, an attempt has been 
            made to take these difficulties into consideration.&nbsp; It is not 
            the intent of this document to address every question pertaining to 
            Sabbath keeping, but rather to present Biblical principles and 
            Spirit of Prophecy guidelines that will assist the church members as 
            they endeavor to follow the leading of the Lord.</P>
            <P>It is hoped that the counsel given in the document will be 
            helpful.&nbsp; Ultimately, however, decisions made under critical 
            circumstances must be motivated by one's personal faith and trust in 
            the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
            <P><B>Sabbath - A Safeguard of Our Relationship With God</B></P>
            <P>The Sabbath encompasses<I> </I>our entire relationship with 
            God.&nbsp; It is an indication of God's action on our behalf in the 
            past, present, and future.&nbsp; The Sabbath protects man's 
            friendship with God and provides the time essential for the 
            development of that relationship.&nbsp; The Sabbath clarifies the 
            relationship between God and the human family, for it points to God 
            as Creator at a time when human beings would like to usurp God's 
            position in the universe.</P>
            <P>In this age of materialism, the Sabbath points men and women to 
            the spiritual and to the personal.&nbsp; The consequences for 
            forgetting the Sabbath day to keep it holy are serious.&nbsp; It 
            will lead to the distortion and eventual destruction of a person's 
            relationship with God.</P>
            <P>When the Sabbath is kept, it is a witness to the rest that comes 
            from trusting God alone as our sustainer, as the basis of our 
            salvation, and as the ground of our hope in the future.&nbsp; As 
            such, the Sabbath is a delight because we have entered God's rest 
            and have accepted the invitation to fellowship with Him.</P>
            <P>When God asks us to remember the Sabbath day He does so because 
            He wants us to remember Him.</P>
            <P><B>Principles and Theology of Sabbath Observance</B></P>
            <P>1)&nbsp;<I>Nature and Purpose of the Sabbath</I>.&nbsp; The 
            origin of the Sabbath lies in Creation when God rested from His work 
            on the seventh day (Gen 1-3).&nbsp; The Sabbath has significance as 
            a perpetual sign of the everlasting covenant between God and His 
            people in order that they might know who it is that created them (Ex 
            31-17) and sanctifies them (Ex 31:13; Ezek 20:12), and that they 
            might recognize Him as the Lord their God (Ezek 20:20). </P>
            <P>2)&nbsp; Uniqueness of the Sabbath.&nbsp; The Sabbath is a 
            special occasion for worshiping God as Creator and Redeemer and as 
            the Lord of Life with whom the human family will be reunited at the 
            second advent.&nbsp; The Sabbath commandment forms the center of the 
            moral law as the seal of God's authority.&nbsp; Since it is a symbol 
            of God's love relationship with His earthly children, human beings 
            are obliged to respect this gift in the sense that they will do 
            everything in their power to promote and engage in activities that 
            will help establish and enhance a lasting relationship with 
            God.&nbsp; Thus His people will engage only in those activities that 
            are directed toward God and their fellowmen and not in those that 
            lean toward self-gratification or self-interest.</P>
            <P>3)&nbsp; <I>Universality of the Sabbath</I>.&nbsp; The 
            universality of the Sabbath is rooted in Creation.&nbsp; Thus its 
            privileges and obligations are binding in all nations, sectors, or 
            classes. (See Ex 20:11; 23:12; Dent 5:13; Isa 56:1-8.) Sabbath 
            observance pertains to all members of the household including 
            children and extends even "to the stranger that is within thy gates" 
            (Ex 20:10).</P>
            <P>4)&nbsp; <I>Time Frame of the Sabbath</I>.&nbsp; Biblical Data: 
            The Sabbath starts at the end of the sixth day of the week and lasts 
            one day, from evening to evening (Gen 1; Mark 1:32).&nbsp; This time 
            coincides with the time of sunset.&nbsp; Wherever a clear 
            delineation of the time of sunset is difficult to ascertain, the 
            Sabbath keeper will begin the Sabbath at the end of the day as 
            marked by the diminishing light.</P>
            <P>5)&nbsp; <I>Principles Guiding Sabbath Observance</I>.&nbsp; 
            Although the Bible does not deal directly with many of the specific 
            questions we may have regarding Sabbath observance in our day, it 
            does provide us with general principles that are applicable today. 
            (See Ex 16:29; 20:8-11; 34:21; Isa 58:13; Neh 13:15-22.)</P>
            <P>"The law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the 
            toil that gains a livelihood must cease; no labor for worldly 
            pleasure or profit is lawful upon that day; but as God ceased His 
            labor of creating, and rested upon the Sabbath and blessed it, so 
            man is to leave the occupations of his daily life, and devote those 
            sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and to holy deeds."--The 
            Desire of Ages, p 207</P>
            <P>This concept, however, is not supportive of total 
            inactivity.&nbsp; Both the Old and New Testaments invite us to care 
            for the needs and alleviate the sufferings of others, for the 
            Sabbath is a good day for all, particularly the lowly and the 
            oppressed (Ex 23:12; Matt 12:10-13; Mark 2:27; Luke 13:11-17; John 
            9:1-21).</P>
            <P>Yet even good works on the Sabbath must not obscure the chief 
            Biblical characteristic of Sabbath observance, namely, rest (Gen 
            2:1-3).&nbsp; This includes both physical (Ex 23:12) and spiritual 
            rest in God (Matt 11:28).&nbsp; The latter leads the Sabbath 
            observer to seek the presence of, and communion with God in worship 
            (Isa 48:13), both in quiet meditation (Matt 12:1-8) and in public 
            worship (Jer 23:32, 2 Kings 4:23; 11:4-12; 1 Chron 23:30 ff; Isa 
            56:1-8).&nbsp; Its object is to recognize God as Creator and 
            Redeemer (Gen 2:1-3; Dent 5:12-15), and it is to be shared by the 
            individual family and the larger community (Isa 56:1-8).</P>
            <P>6)&nbsp; <I>Sabbath and the Authority of God's Word.</I>&nbsp; 
            Ellen White points out that the Sabbath commandment is unique, for 
            it contains the seal of God's law.&nbsp; It alone "brings to view 
            both the name and title of the Lawgiver.&nbsp; It declares Him to be 
            the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and thus shows His claim 
            to reverence and worship above all others.&nbsp; Aside from this 
            precept, there is nothing in the Decalogue to show by whose 
            authority the law is given."--The Great Controversy, p 452.</P><BR 
            clear=all>
            <P>The Sabbath as a sign of the Creator points to His ownership and 
            authority.&nbsp; Meaningful Sabbath observance, therefore, indicates 
            the acceptance of God as Creator and Owner and acknowledges His 
            authority over all creation, including oneself.&nbsp; Sabbath 
            observance is based on the authority of God's Word.&nbsp; There is 
            no other logical reason for it.</P>
            <P>Human beings have the freedom to enter into a relationship with 
            the Creator of the universe as with a personal friend.</P>
            <P>Sabbath keepers may have to face resistance at times because of 
            their commitment to God to keep the Sabbath holy.&nbsp; To those who 
            do not recognize God as their Creator, it seems arbitrary or 
            inexplicable for someone to cease from all work on the Sabbath day 
            for merely religious reasons.&nbsp; Meaningful Sabbath observance 
            testifies to the fact that we have chosen to obey God's 
            commandment.&nbsp; We thus recognize that our life is now lived in 
            obedience to God's Word.&nbsp; The Sabbath will be a special test in 
            the end time.&nbsp; The believer will have to make a choice either 
            to give allegiance to God's Word or to human authority (Rev 14:7, 
            12).</P>
            <P><B>Home and Family Life as Related to the Sabbath</B></P>
            <P>1)&nbsp; <I>Introduction</I>.&nbsp; Home life is the cornerstone 
            of proper Sabbath observance.&nbsp; Only when individuals keep the 
            Sabbath conscientiously in the home and assume their assigned 
            responsibilities as members of the family will the Church as a whole 
            reveal to the world the joys and privileges of God's holy day.</P>
            <P>2)<I>&nbsp; Different Kinds of Homes</I>.&nbsp; In the twentieth 
            century there are various kinds of homes, for example, the home in 
            which there is a husband, wife, and children; the home in which 
            there is husband and wife and no children; the home in which there 
            is a single parent and children (where because of death or divorce 
            one parent must function in both maternal and paternal roles); the 
            home in which a person has never married or where death or divorce 
            has left one single, and no children are involved; or the home in 
            which one parent only is a member of the Church.&nbsp; In addressing 
            the needs and problems of these categories, it should be understood 
            that some of the principles and suggestions enunciated will apply to 
            all groups and some will be more specialized.</P>
            <P>3)&nbsp; <I>Two Sacred Institutions--The Home and the 
            Sabbath</I>.&nbsp; "In the beginning" God placed a man and a woman 
            in the Garden of Eden as their home.&nbsp; Also, "in the beginning" 
            God gave to human beings the Sabbath.&nbsp; These two institutions, 
            the home and the Sabbath, belong together.&nbsp; Both are gifts from 
            God.&nbsp; Therefore both are sacred, the latter strengthening and 
            enriching in its unique manner the bond of the former.</P>
            <P>Close fellowship is an important element of the home.&nbsp; Close 
            fellowship with other human beings also is an important element of 
            the Sabbath.&nbsp; It binds families closer to God and binds the 
            individual members closer to one another.&nbsp; Viewed from this 
            perspective, the importance of the Sabbath to the home cannot be 
            overestimated. </P>
            <P><I>4)&nbsp; Responsibilities of Adults as Teachers</I>.&nbsp; In 
            choosing Abraham as the father of the chosen people, God said, "I 
            know him, that he will command his children and his household after 
            him" (Gen 18:19).&nbsp; It seems clear, then, that an enormous 
            responsibility has been given to adults in the home for the 
            spiritual- welfare of their children.&nbsp; By both precept and 
            example, they must provide the kind of structure and atmosphere that 
            will make the Sabbath a delight and such a vital part of Christian 
            living that, long after leaving the home, the children will continue 
            the customs they were taught in childhood.</P>
            <P>In harmony with the injunction, "Thou shalt teach them (God's 
            commandments) diligently unto thy children" (cf Dent 6:4-9), the 
            adult members of the family should teach their children to love God 
            and keep His commandments.&nbsp; They should teach them to be loyal 
            to God and to follow His directives.</P>
            <P>From earliest infancy, children should be taught to participate 
            in family worship so that worship in the house of God will become an 
            extension of a family custom.&nbsp; Also from infancy, children 
            should be taught the importance of church attendance, that true 
            Sabbath observance involves going to God's house for worship and 
            Bible study.&nbsp; Adults in the family should set the example by 
            attending services on Sabbath, providing a pattern that will be seen 
            as important when their children make decisions on what is of value 
            in life.&nbsp; Through discussions, as the children grow older and 
            more mature, and through Bible study, the children should be taught 
            the meaning of the Sabbath, its relationship to Christian living, 
            and the enduring quality of the Sabbath.</P>
            <P><I>5)&nbsp; Preparation for the Sabbath</I>.&nbsp; If the Sabbath 
            is to be observed properly, the entire week should be programmed in 
            such a way that every member will be ready to welcome God's holy day 
            when it arrives.&nbsp; This means that the adult family members will 
            plan so that all household tasks--the buying and preparing of food, 
            the readying of clothes, and all the other necessities of everyday 
            life--will be completed before sundown Friday.&nbsp; The day of rest 
            should become the pivot around which the wheel of the entire week 
            turns.&nbsp; When Friday night approaches and sundown is near, 
            adults and children will be able to greet the Sabbath with 
            tranquility of mind, with all preparation finished, and with the 
            home in readiness to spend the next 24 hours with God and with one 
            another.&nbsp; Children can help achieve this by carrying Sabbath 
            preparation responsibilities commensurate with their maturity.&nbsp; 
            The way the family approaches the beginning of the Sabbath at 
            sundown on Friday night and the way Friday night is spent will set 
            the stage for receiving the blessings that the Lord has in store for 
            the entire day which follows.</P>
            <P>6)<I>&nbsp; Proper Sabbath Dress</I>.&nbsp; Where there are 
            children in the home, on Sabbath morning as the family dresses for 
            church, adults may, by precept and example, teach children that one 
            way to honor God is to appear in His house in clean, representative 
            clothing appropriate to the culture in which they live.</P>
            <P>7)<I>&nbsp; Importance of Bible Study Hour</I>.&nbsp; Where 
            children do not have the advantage of attending Adventist schools, 
            the Sabbath School becomes the most important means of religious 
            instruction outside the home.&nbsp; The value of this Bible study 
            hour cannot be overestimated.&nbsp; Therefore, parents should attend 
            Sabbath morning services and do everything possible to take their 
            children with them.</P>
            <P>8)&nbsp; <I>Family Activities on the Sabbath</I>.&nbsp; In most 
            cultures the Sabbath noon meal, when the family gathers around the 
            dinner table in the home, is a high point of the week.&nbsp; The 
            spirit of sacred joy and fellowship, begun upon arising and 
            continued through the worship services at church, is 
            intensified.&nbsp; Free from the distractions of a secular 
            atmosphere, the family can converse on themes of mutual interest and 
            maintain the spiritual mood of the day. </P>
            <P>When the sacred nature of the Sabbath is understood, and a loving 
            relationship exists between parents and children, all will seek to 
            prevent intrusions into the holy hours by secular music, radio, and 
            video and television programs, and by newspapers, books, and 
            magazines.</P>
            <P>Sabbath afternoons, as far as possible, will be spent in family 
            activities--exploring nature; making missionary visits to shut-ins, 
            the sick, or others in need of encouragement; and attending meetings 
            in the church.&nbsp; As the children grow older, activities will 
            enlarge to encompass other members of their age group in the church, 
            with the question always in mind, "Does this activity cause me to 
            understand better the true nature and sacredness of the Sabbath?" 
            Thus proper Sabbath observance in the home will have a lasting 
            influence for time and eternity.</P>
            <P><B>Sabbath Observance and Recreational Activities</B></P>
            <P>1)&nbsp; <I>Introduction</I>.&nbsp; Sabbath observance includes 
            both worship and fellowship.&nbsp; The invitation to enjoy both is 
            open and generous.&nbsp; Sabbath worship directed toward God usually 
            takes place in a community of believers.&nbsp; The same community 
            provides fellowship.&nbsp; Both worship and fellowship offer 
            unlimited potential to praise God and to enrich the lives of 
            Christians.&nbsp; When either Sabbath worship or fellowship Is 
            distorted or abused, both praise to God and personal enrichment are 
            threatened.&nbsp; As God's gift of Himself to us, the Sabbath brings 
            real joy in the Lord.&nbsp; It is an opportunity for believers to 
            recognize and reach their God-given potential.&nbsp; Thus, to the 
            believer the Sabbath is a delight.</P>
            <P>2)&nbsp; <I>Alien Factors to Sabbath Observance</I>.&nbsp; The 
            Sabbath can be intruded upon easily by elements alien to its 
            spirit.&nbsp; In the experience of worship and fellowship the 
            believer must ever be alert to alien factors which are detrimental 
            to one's realization of Sabbath sacredness.&nbsp; The sense of 
            Sabbath holiness is threatened particularly by the wrong kinds of 
            fellowship and activities.&nbsp; By contrast, the sacredness of the 
            Sabbath is upheld when the Creator remains the center of that holy 
            day.</P>
            <P>3)&nbsp; <I>Culturally Conditioned Phenomena in Sabbath 
            Observance</I>.&nbsp; It is important to understand that Christians 
            render obedience to God and thus observe the Sabbath at the place in 
            history and culture where they live.&nbsp; It is possible that both 
            history and culture may falsely condition us and distort our 
            values.&nbsp; By appealing to culture we may be guilty of giving 
            ourselves license or excuse to indulge in sports and recreational 
            activities that are incompatible with Sabbath holiness.&nbsp; For 
            example, intensive physical exertion and various forms of tourism 
            are out of harmony with true Sabbath observance.</P>
            <P>Any attempt to regulate Sabbath observance beyond Biblical&nbsp; 
            principles by developing lists of Sabbath prohibitions will be 
            counterproductive to a sound spiritual experience.&nbsp; The 
            Christian will test his Sabbath experience by principle.&nbsp; He 
            knows that it is the main purpose of the Sabbath to strengthen the 
            bond of union between himself and God.&nbsp; Thus one's activities 
            guided by Biblical principles and contributing toward such a 
            strengthening are acceptable.</P>
            <P>Inasmuch as no one can evaluate rightly the personal motives of 
            others, a Christian must be very careful not to criticize his 
            brethren living in cultural contexts other than his own who engage 
            in Sabbath recreational activities of which they approve.</P>
            <P>While traveling, Adventist tourists should make every effort to 
            observe the Sabbath with their fellow believers in any given 
            area.&nbsp; Respecting the sacredness of the seventh day, it is 
            recommended that Adventists avoid using the day for a holiday set 
            aside for sightseeing and secular activity.</P>
            <P><B>Churches and Church Institutions</B></P>
            <P>In establishing specific guidelines and policies for the 
            corporate Church and Church institutions, the Church is setting an 
            example of Sabbath keeping for the membership at large.&nbsp; It is 
            the responsibility of the members to apply true Sabbath keeping 
            principles in their own lives.&nbsp; The Church can assist by 
            providing Sabbath keeping principles as found in the Bible and the 
            Spirit of Prophecy, but it cannot be conscience for the members.</P>
            <P>1)&nbsp; <I>Churches--Role of Church and Family in Sabbath 
            Afternoon Activities</I>. &nbsp;The pastor and the local church 
            leaders are entrusted with the responsibility of providing carefully 
            planned Sabbath activities for children, youth, adults, and the 
            elderly, and for families and singles, emphasizing the importance of 
            making the Sabbath a day of joy, worship, and rest.&nbsp; Church 
            activities should complement rather than replace family and home 
            activities.</P>
            <P>2)&nbsp; <I>Churches--Sabbath Music</I>.&nbsp; Music has a 
            powerful impact on a person moods and emotions. Church leaders will 
            select music and musicians that will enhance the worshipful 
            atmosphere of the Sabbath rest and the person's relationship with 
            God.&nbsp; Sabbath choir rehearsals should be avoided during 
            regularly scheduled Sabbath meetings.</P>
            <P>3)&nbsp; <I>Churches--Community Outreach</I>.&nbsp; Although 
            Christians may participate in certain types of social work for 
            students, youth, and the poor in inner cities or in suburbs, they 
            still will exert an exemplary influence of consistent Sabbath 
            keeping.&nbsp; When engaged in an extension school or special school 
            for children and youth, they will select subjects and classes that 
            are different from the ordinary secular subjects or classes for the 
            week, including activities that contribute to spiritual 
            culture.&nbsp; Nature or neighborhood walks may replace recesses; 
            nature walks or field trips of minimal effort can replace secular 
            subjects and classes.</P>
            <P>4)&nbsp; <I>Churches--Ingathering.</I>&nbsp; The general practice 
            of Seventh-day Adventist churches is to do Ingathering on days other 
            than the Sabbath.&nbsp; Where there is a practice to do Ingathering 
            on Sabbath, the plan should be implemented so as to bring spiritual 
            benefits to all participants.</P>
            <P>5)&nbsp; <I>Churches--Fundraising on the Sabbath</I>.&nbsp; The 
            doctrine of Christian stewardship is found throughout the 
            Scriptures.&nbsp; The act of giving has a definite place in the 
            worship services.&nbsp; When appeals for funds are made, they should 
            be conducted in such a manner as to uphold the sacredness of the 
            service as well as of the Sabbath.</P>
            <P>6)&nbsp; <I>Churches--Sabbath Weddings</I>.&nbsp; The marriage 
            service is sacred and would not in itself be out of harmony with the 
            spirit of Sabbath keeping.&nbsp; However, most weddings involve 
            considerable work and almost inevitably a secular atmosphere 
            develops in preparing for them and in holding receptions.&nbsp; In 
            order that the spirit of the Sabbath not be lost, the holding of 
            weddings on the Sabbath should be discouraged. </P>
            <P>7)&nbsp; <I>Churches--Sabbath Funerals</I>.&nbsp; In general, 
            Adventists should try to avoid Sabbath funerals.&nbsp; In some 
            climates and under certain conditions, however, it may be necessary 
            to conduct funerals without delay, the Sabbath 
            notwithstanding.&nbsp; In such cases arrangements should be made in 
            advance with morticians and cemetery employees to perform their 
            routine tasks for the deceased in advance of the Sabbath day, thus 
            reducing the labor and commotion on the Sabbath.&nbsp; In some 
            instances a memorial service could be held on the Sabbath, and 
            interment take place later.</P>
            <P>8)&nbsp; <I>Seventh-day Adventist Health-care 
            Institutions</I>.&nbsp; Adventist health care institutions provide 
            the only contact many people have with the Seventh-day Adventist 
            Church.&nbsp; Adventist hospitals are to be more than merely 
            health-care delivery systems.&nbsp; They have a unique opportunity 
            to bear a Christian witness 24 hours a day to the communities they 
            serve.&nbsp; In addition, they have the privilege of presenting the 
            Sabbath message by example every week.&nbsp; In healing the sick and 
            loosing the bonds of the physically infirm, even&nbsp; on the 
            Sabbath, Christ set an example that we look to as the basis for 
            establishing and operating Adventist health-care institutions.&nbsp; 
            Therefore, an institution offering medical care to the public must 
            be prepared to minister to the needs of the sick and suffering 
            without regard to hours or days.</P>
            <P>This places a great responsibility on each institution to develop 
            and implement policies that reflect the example of Christ and apply 
            the principles of Sabbath observance as found in the Scriptures and 
            taught by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.&nbsp; Administrators 
            have a special responsibility to see that all departments maintain 
            the true spirit of Sabbath keeping by instituting appropriate 
            Sabbath procedures and by guarding against laxity in its 
            observance.</P>
            <P>The following applications of Sabbath observance principles are 
            recommended:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>a.&nbsp; Provide emergency medical care willingly and 
              cheerfully whenever needed with high levels of excellence.&nbsp; 
              However, neither Adventist institutions nor physicians and 
              dentists should provide the same office or clinic services on the 
              Sabbath as they do on weekdays.</P>
              <P>b.&nbsp; Discontinue all routine activities that could be 
              postponed. Usually this means a complete closing of those 
              facilities and departments not immediately related to patient 
              care, and the maintenance of a minimum number of qualified people 
              in other departments to handle emergencies.</P>
              <P>c.&nbsp; Postpone elective diagnostic and therapeutic 
              services.&nbsp; Decisions as to what is necessary or of an 
              emergency nature should be made by the attending physician.&nbsp; 
              If this privilege is abused, it should be dealt with by the 
              hospital administration.&nbsp; Nonadministrative institutional 
              employees should not become involved in making these decisions nor 
              should they be obliged to confront the attending physicians.&nbsp; 
              Misunderstandings may be avoided by making it clear in medical 
              staff bylaws that only surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
              procedures which are not postponable because of the condition of 
              the patient, will be done.&nbsp; A clear understanding with all 
              who are appointed to staff membership, at the time of appointment, 
              will do much to avoid misunderstandings and abuses.</P>
              <P>Convenience and elective surgery should be discouraged or 
              limited on Fridays.&nbsp; Procedures thus scheduled allow the 
              patient to be in the hospital over the weekend and hence lose 
              fewer days at work.&nbsp; However, this places the first 
              post-operative day, usually with the most intensive nursing care, 
              on the Sabbath.</P>
              <P>d.&nbsp; Close administrative and business offices to routine 
              business. Although it may be necessary to admit or discharge 
              patients on the Sabbath, it is recommended that the rendering of 
              bills and the collection of money be avoided.&nbsp; Never should 
              the keeping of the Sabbath be a source of irritation to those we 
              seek to serve and to save, but rather a hallmark of "the children 
              of light" (Eph 5:8; <I>Acts of the Apostles</I>, p 260).</P>
              <P>e.&nbsp; Make the Sabbath a special day for patients, providing 
              a memory of Christian witnessing never to be forgotten.&nbsp; 
              Meaningful Sabbath-keeping is much easier to achieve in an 
              institution that employs a predominantly Adventist staff.&nbsp; 
              Presenting the Sabbath in a proper light can be accomplished by 
              the believing workers employed in patient care, and may well be a 
              convicting influence in the lives of those not of our faith.</P>
              <P>f.&nbsp; The direct care of the sick is a seven-day-a-week 
              activity.&nbsp; Illness knows no calendar.&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
              when scheduling all personnel, health-care institutions should 
              take into consideration the sincere religious beliefs, 
              observances, and practices of each employee and prospective 
              employee.&nbsp; The institution should make reasonable 
              accommodation for such religious beliefs unless it is demonstrated 
              that such accommodation would place an undue hardship on its 
              operation.&nbsp; It is recognized that the consciences of 
              individuals vary in regard to the propriety of Sabbath 
              employment.&nbsp; Neither the Church nor its institutions can act 
              as the conscience for its employees.&nbsp; Rather, reasonable 
              accommodation should be made for individual conscience.</P>
              <P>g.&nbsp; Resist pressures for relaxing Seventh-day Adventist 
              standards.&nbsp; Some institutions have been pressured by the 
              communities, the medical staffs, and/or employees (where a 
              majority is comprised of non-Adventists), to abandon or weaken 
              Sabbath keeping principles and practices so that the Sabbath would 
              be treated as any other day.&nbsp; In some cases, pressure has 
              been applied to maintain full services on the Sabbath and reduce 
              them on Sunday instead.&nbsp; Such action should be vigorously 
              resisted.&nbsp; Compliance would cause serious reexamination of 
              the relationship of such an institution to the Church.</P>
              <P>h.&nbsp; Educate employees who are not Seventh-day Adventist 
              concerning Sabbath keeping principles practiced by the 
              institution.&nbsp; Every non-Adventist, at the time of employment 
              at an Adventist health care institution, should be made aware of 
              Seventh-day Adventist principles, especially institutional 
              policies regarding the observance of the Sabbath.&nbsp; Though 
              non-Adventists may not believe as we do, they should know from the 
              very beginning how they are expected to fit into the institutional 
              program to help it reach its objectives.</P>
              <P>i.&nbsp; Foster an attitude for continuing Christian witnessing 
              by Adventist employees.&nbsp; The only contact that many 
              non-Adventist workers ever may have with Seventh-day Adventists 
              may be in the institution employing them.&nbsp; Every relationship 
              should be friendly, kind, and expressive of the love that 
              exemplified the life and work of the Great Physician.&nbsp; 
              Compassion for the sick, unselfish regard for our fellowman, an 
              eagerness to serve, and unstinted loyalty to God and the Church 
              may well prove to be a savor of life unto life.&nbsp; The keeping 
              of the Sabbath is a privilege and an honor as well as a 
              duty.&nbsp; It should never become burdensome or obnoxious to 
              those who keep it or to those about us.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>9)&nbsp; <I>Sabbath Work in Non-Adventist Hospitals</I>.&nbsp; 
            While it is essential in medical institutions that a minimum of 
            labor be performed at all times in order to maintain the welfare and 
            comfort of the patients, Seventh-day Adventists employed in 
            non-denominational institutions where Sabbath hours bring no relief 
            from routine duties are under obligation to remember the principles 
            that regulate all Sabbath activities.&nbsp; In order to avoid 
            situations where our church members may be faced with problems of 
            Sabbath keeping in non-Adventist institutions, it is recommended 
            that:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>a.&nbsp; When Seventh-day Adventists accept employment in 
              non-Seventh-day Adventist hospitals, they make known their Sabbath 
              keeping principles and request a work schedule that will exempt 
              them from Sabbath duties.</P>
              <P>b.&nbsp; Where work schedules or other factors make this 
              impossible, Adventists should clearly identify the duties, if any, 
              they can conscientiously perform on the Sabbath and the frequency 
              thereof.</P>
              <P>c.&nbsp; Where the above accommodations cannot be arranged, 
              members should make loyalty to God's requirements paramount and 
              abstain from routine work.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>10)&nbsp; <I>Seventh-day Adventist Educational 
            Institutions</I>.&nbsp; Seventh-day Adventist secondary boarding 
            schools leave a major role in shaping the Sabbath observance habits 
            of future generations of members of the Church, and Seventh-day 
            Adventist colleges and universities do much to mold the thinking of 
            the Church's clergy and professional class.&nbsp; It is important, 
            therefore, that both the theory and practice of how to maximize the 
            joyful blessings of the Sabbath be as close as possible to the ideal 
            in these institutions.</P>
            <P>Applications of this principle should include:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>a.&nbsp; Adequate preparation for the Sabbath.</P>
              <P>b.&nbsp; Demarcation of the beginning and ending of the Sabbath 
              hours.</P>
              <P>c.&nbsp; Appropriate school-home activities: worships, prayer 
              bands, witness, etc.</P>
              <P>d.&nbsp; Keeping necessary duties to a minimum, preferably 
              entrusting them to people who volunteer their service rather than 
              to those who do the same work for pay during the week.</P>
              <P>e.&nbsp; Inspiring worship services, preferably modeling what 
              is expected to characterize such services in the churches of the 
              school's constituency.</P>
              <P>f.&nbsp; Adequate and varied activities on Sabbath 
              afternoon.</P>
              <P>g.&nbsp; Structuring of the weekly program so that the Sabbath 
              will be a lingering joy and the climax of the week, rather than a 
              prelude to contrasting activities on Saturday night.</P>
              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <P>1.&nbsp; <I>Cafeteria Sales</I>.&nbsp; School cafeterias are 
                designed to serve students and their visiting parents and bona 
                fide guests; they should not be open to the public on the 
                Sabbath.&nbsp; To avoid unnecessary business transactions during 
                sacred time, each institution should make provision for payment 
                outside of the Sabbath hours. </P>
                <P>2.&nbsp; <I>Attendance of Faculty at Professional 
                Meetings</I>.&nbsp; In some countries, Seventh-day Adventists 
                are privileged to attend professional meetings in order to keep 
                abreast of current developments in their given field of 
                specialization.&nbsp; It may be tempting to justify attendance 
                at these meetings on the Sabbath.&nbsp; However, it is 
                recommended that academic personnel join fellow members in 
                worship rather than fellow professionals at work.</P>
                <P>3.&nbsp; <I>Radio Stations</I>.&nbsp; College radio stations 
                can be a blessing to their communities.&nbsp; To maximize the 
                blessings, programming during the Sabbath hours should reflect 
                the philosophy of the Church.&nbsp; If fund-raising appeals are 
                made on the Sabbath, they should be conducted in such a way as 
                to uphold the sacredness of that day.</P>
                <P>4.&nbsp; <I>Promotional Trips</I>.&nbsp; In order to maintain 
                the worshipful nature of the Sabbath, promotional tours should 
                be planned in such a way as to minimize travel on the Sabbath 
                and to provide maximum time for worship with fellow 
                believers.&nbsp; The Sabbath hours should not be used for travel 
                to provide a Saturday night program.</P>
                <P>5.&nbsp; <I>Sabbath Observance in Education for the 
                Ministry</I>.&nbsp; Pastors have a large responsibility for 
                shaping the spiritual life of the Church by their personal 
                example.&nbsp; Therefore institutions training ministers and 
                their spouses need to help their trainees form a sound 
                philosophy of Sabbath observance.&nbsp; Proper guidance received 
                at school can be instrumental in the experience of a genuine 
                renewal of the Sabbath joys in their own life as well as in the 
                life of their church.</P>
                <P>6.&nbsp; <I>Sabbath Examinations</I>.&nbsp; Seventh-day 
                Adventists who face required examinations given on the Sabbath 
                in non-Adventist schools or for certification by professional 
                governing boards face special problems.&nbsp; In dealing with 
                such situations we recommend that they arrange for 
                administration of the examinations on hours other than the 
                Sabbath.&nbsp; The Church should encourage its members in 
                careful Sabbath observance and where possible intercede with the 
                appropriate authorities to provide for both reverence for God's 
                day and access to the examinations.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P><B>Secular Employment and Trade as Related to the Sabbath</B></P>
            <P>1)&nbsp; <I>Statement of Principle</I>.&nbsp; The Biblical view 
            of the Sabbath includes both a divine and a human dimension (Matt 
            12:7).&nbsp; From the divine perspective the Sabbath invites the 
            believer to renew his commitment to God by desisting from the daily 
            work in order to worship God more freely and more fully (Ex 20:8-10; 
            31:15,16; Isa 58:13,14).&nbsp; From the human perspective, the 
            Sabbath summons the believer to celebrate God's creative and 
            redemptive love by showing mercy and concern toward others (Dent 
            5:12-15; Matt 12:12; Luke 13:12; John 5:17).&nbsp; Thus the Sabbath 
            encompasses both cessation from secular work for the purpose of 
            honoring God and performing deeds of love and kindness toward fellow 
            beings.</P>
            <P><I>2)&nbsp; Essential and Emergency Work</I>.&nbsp; In order to 
            uphold the sanctity of the Sabbath, Seventh-day Adventists must make 
            wise choices in matters of employment, guided by a conscience 
            enlightened by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Experience has shown that 
            there are hazards in choosing vocations which will not allow them to 
            worship their Creator on the Sabbath day free from involvement in 
            secular labor.&nbsp; This means that they will avoid types of 
            employment which, although essential for the function of a 
            technologically advanced society, may offer problems in Sabbath 
            observance.</P>
            <P>The Scriptures and the Spirit of Prophecy are explicit about our 
            duties as Christians to our fellowman, even on the Sabbath 
            day.&nbsp; In the modern context, many employed in occupations 
            involved with the saving of life and property are called upon to 
            deal with emergencies.&nbsp; Arranging for regular weekend work 
            requiring the use of the Sabbath hours for gainful emergency 
            employment or accepting work only on weekends in emergency 
            occupations to augment the family budget is out of harmony with 
            Sabbath keeping principles given by Christ.&nbsp; Responding to 
            emergency situations where life and safety are at stake is quite 
            different from earning one's livelihood by routinely engaging in 
            such occupations on the Sabbath which are often accompanied by 
            commercial, secular, or routine activities. (See Christ's comments 
            on rescuing oxen or sheep from ditches and helping people in 
            need.&nbsp; Matt 12:11; Luke 13:16.) Absenting one's self from God's 
            house and being denied fellowship with the believers on the Sabbath 
            can have a chilling effect on one's spiritual life.</P>
            <P>Many employers in so-called essential service areas willingly 
            make accommodations for Sabbath keepers.&nbsp; Where such is not 
            granted, members should review carefully Biblical principles of 
            Sabbath keeping and in that light examine the type of activity, 
            environment, requirements of the job, and personal motives before 
            committing themselves to working on the Sabbath.&nbsp; They should 
            ask of the Lord as did Paul on the Damascus road, "Lord, what wilt 
            thou have me to do?" When this attitude of faith prevails, we are 
            persuaded that the Lord will lead the believer to discern His will 
            and supply strength and wisdom to follow it.</P>
            <P><I>3)&nbsp; Moral Decision Regarding Sabbath 
            Observance</I>.&nbsp; Sabbath privileges are sometimes curtailed or 
            denied by military, educational, political, or other 
            organizations.&nbsp; To prevent and/or alleviate these regrettable 
            situations, the following suggestions should be considered:</P>
            <P>A competent church official, preferably the Public Affairs and 
            Religious Liberty director, should be appointed to keep abreast of 
            developments that could undermine freedom of worship on the 
            Sabbath.&nbsp; When necessary, this official will approach 
            responsible authorities to intercede when an adverse impact upon 
            Seventh-day Adventists is present in any contemplated measure or 
            legislation.&nbsp; This course of action may prevent enactment of 
            laws that could curtail or deny Sabbath privileges.</P>
            <P>Adventist members should be encouraged to stand by faith for the 
            principle of Sabbath keeping regardless of circumstances, resting in 
            the assurance that God will honor their commitment to Him.</P>
            <P>Church members should offer spiritual, moral, and, if 
            needed&nbsp; temporal help to other members experiencing Sabbath 
            problems.&nbsp; Such support will serve to strengthen the commitment 
            to the Lord not only of the individual member facing Sabbath 
            problems but also of the Church as a whole.</P>
            <P>4)&nbsp; <I>Purchase of Goods and Services on the Sabbath</I>. 
            </P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>a.&nbsp; The Sabbath is designed to provide spiritual freedom 
              and joy for every person (Ex 20:8-11).&nbsp; As Christians, we 
              must be supportive of this basic human right granted to each 
              individual by the Creator.&nbsp; As a general rule, the purchasing 
              of goods, eating out in restaurants, and paying for services to be 
              provided by others ought to be avoided because they are out of 
              harmony with the principle and practice of Sabbath keeping.</P>
              <P>b.&nbsp; Furthermore, the above-mentioned commercial activities 
              will turn the mind away from the sacredness of the Sabbath. (See 
              Neh 10:31; 13:15 ff.) With proper planning adequate provisions can 
              be made in advance for foreseeable Sabbath needs.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>5)&nbsp; <I>Sabbath Travel</I>.&nbsp; While Sabbath travel may be 
            necessary for engaging in Sabbath activities, one should not allow 
            Sabbath travel to become a secular function; therefore, preparation 
            should be made in advance. Automobile fuel and other needs should be 
            cared for before the Sabbath begins.&nbsp; Travel on commercial 
            carriers for personal or business reasons should be avoided.</P>
            <P>6)&nbsp; <I>Treating a Specific Employment Problem</I>.&nbsp; 
            When a member of the Church finds it necessary to resign from a 
            position, or loses his job because of Sabbath problems, and is 
            reemployed by the denomination in similar work, and where the new 
            job, because of its essential nature, requires the member to work on 
            the Sabbath, the following suggestions are recommended:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>a.&nbsp; A careful explanation of the essential nature of the 
              work will be given to the member.</P>
              <P>b.&nbsp; All efforts should be made by the organization to as 
              certain that only the essential aspects of the new job will be 
              performed on the Sabbath.&nbsp; Administrators should also explain 
              to the new employee the religious purposes and basic objectives of 
              the employing organization.</P>
              <P>c.&nbsp; A rotation schedule will be adopted in order that the 
              member who can conscientiously accept such work on the Sabbath may 
              frequently be able to enter into a fuller celebration of the 
              Sabbath day.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>7)&nbsp; <I>Shift work.</I>&nbsp; When a Seventh-day Adventist 
            works for an employer where Shift work is the rule, he may be 
            requested to work on the Sabbath or a portion thereof.&nbsp; Under 
            such circumstances the member involved is encouraged to consider the 
            following:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>a.&nbsp; The member should strive to be the best possible 
              worker, a valuable employee whom the employer cannot afford to 
              lose.</P>
              <P>b.&nbsp; If a problem develops, the member should seek to 
              resolve it by appealing to the employer personally for an 
              accommodation based on goodwill and fairness.</P>
              <P>c.&nbsp; The member should assist the employer by suggesting 
              such accommodations as:</P>
              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <P>1.&nbsp; Working a flexible schedule;</P>
                <P>2.&nbsp; Taking a less desirable shift;</P>
                <P>3.&nbsp; Trading shifts with another employee; or</P>
                <P>4.&nbsp; Working on holidays.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>8)&nbsp; If the employer resists an accommodation, the member 
            should immediately seek assistance from the pastor and from the 
            Public Affairs and Religious Liberty Department in countries where 
            they are involved in such activities.</P>
