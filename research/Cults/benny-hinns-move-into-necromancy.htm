HINN’S<BR>MOVE INTO NECROMANCY</FONT><BR><FONT size=5>Faith Healer Claims 
Contact with the Dead<BR>Foretells New Direction for His Ministry</FONT></H3>
<P align=center><STRONG>by G. Richard Fisher </STRONG><FONT size=3><STRONG>with 
M. Kurt Goedelman<BR></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The Disney Corporation in Orlando, Fla., is always coming up 
with new theme parks and new attractions with which to captivate and draw in 
tourists. Disney has to get not only new customers but repeat customers to 
survive. The world of televangelism appears almost the same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>To keep the gears of the ministry well-lubricated with the 
donations and gifts of the faithful, it seems nearly every month there has to be 
a new attraction, a new “prophecy,” a new “word from the Lord” or some new 
sovereign act of God. These claims and revelations serve to hold onto a 
floating, thrill seeking, quickly dissatisfied Charismatic 
population.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>EASILY DISSATISFIED</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The superstars of televangelism over-promise to an audience they 
know is fickle and has a short attention and commitment span. What is popular 
this month may not be next month. What’s hot and what’s not depends on the 
creativity of the man and his organization. Rising fortunes and empires can 
begin to dwindle if new “power” centers or new spiritual “power brokers” offer a 
new and more exciting ride, attraction or innovation. <I>Charisma</I> magazine 
and the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) are the main marketplaces for the 
wild, weird and bizarre world of Charismania. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>So what does Benny Hinn have to offer? As repeatedly documented 
in PFO’s <I>The Confusing World of Benny Hinn</I>, the Orlando-based faith 
healer has spawned many a new vision, a new testimony, a new claim, a new 
gimmick, a new cure-all, and a new twist on an old “deliverance” scheme over the 
past several years.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>In all, the world of televangelism really has become as 
unrestrained as professional wrestling with Hinn being crowned as the current 
“reigning champ.” False prophecies, heretical doctrines, spurious healings, an 
exorbitant lifestyle and fabricated personal historical accounts have not been 
able to dethrone Hinn as the leading guru of Charismatics.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>In the mid-1990s, Hinn sought donations from those attending his 
crusades and from the viewers of his daily telecasts to go head-to-head on cable 
and television networks featuring psychic hot lines. The donations he received 
would permit his evangelistic efforts to reduce the spread and success of 
occultism being broadcast into homes. Yet today, these psychic hot lines are 
bigger and more intense than ever and Hinn has become a fellow traveler in the 
world of the occult. </FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>KATHRYN KUHLMAN RETURNS</B></FONT><FONT 
size=4><B> </B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn has long been infatuated with the late faith healer, 
Kathryn Kuhlman. His books and sermons are replete with the impact she 
supposedly made on his life and ministry. Now, Hinn has her as a female spirit 
guide. And with this claim, he is introducing a deadly spiritist virus to his 
followers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn recently claimed that he was shown the future of his 
ministry from Kuhlman and Jesus in what he described as a “vision of the night.” 
This revelation undoubtedly will electrify the bulk of his following. But 
perhaps, for some, they may now view Hinn as having crossed the line into dark 
and dangerous territory. This may be a ride that sounds the alarm and wakes them 
up to Hinn’s pragmatic unorthodoxy and false teaching. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>His account of this alleged vision was delivered to those 
attending a recent “Partner Conference” in Atlanta and to those viewing the June 
11, 1997 installment of his daily <I>This Is Your Day</I> program.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>On the broadcast, he stated:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“Ladies and gentlemen, I’m going to tell you something right 
  now. The Lord showed me a vision about—goodness it’s almost been a year now. 
  And I—I—I—I can tell you I sense now the time has come when this vision is 
  gonna be fulfilled. I had a vision of the night. What I saw, myself walk into 
  a room. I’ve shared this before but just in case you—you’ve not heard it I 
  want you to hear it. I saw myself walk into a room and there stood Kathryn 
  Kuhlman. And I’ve not seen Kathryn in a dream or a vision [in] years. Uh, when 
  she died, the day she died, the morning she died, I had a dream what I—what I 
  saw in a—in a—in a—in a casket with a white dress. And when I woke up in—in 
  the morning I knew she had died, and it was on the news that same morning. And 
  so it’s been many years. And there she was standing in this room and she said 
  to me—of course this was a dream, but really more of a vision. A lot of times 
  dreams are really visions of the night, and the Bible calls them that. 
  When—when God gives to you in the fashion it really came with me. When I was a 
  little boy, I saw the Lord in this dream. It was really so real, it was really 
  a vision because when—when he appeared to me my body became electric just like 
  electricity went through me and when I awoke that electricity was still on my 
  body.”<SUP>1</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn goes on recounting his “vision”:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“Well, anyway, in this one, in this vision that—that I saw—saw 
  Miss Kuhlman. And she said, ‘Follow me.’ That’s all she said. And I followed 
  her to a second room. In that second room stood the Lord. When the Lord, 
  uh—when—when I saw the Lord, Kathryn disappeared. She was just gone [Hinn 
  snaps fingers]. And now the Lord looked at me and said, ‘Follow me.’ And I 
  followed him to a third room. In the third room sat a gentleman—I still 
  remember his face. I can tell you, I still remember the man’s face. And the 
  man sat in this wheelchair in that third room. There was a big hole in his 
  neck. A tube down his throat. He was crippled on that wheelchair. And he had 
  tubes down his body. Totally crippled, totally para—totally, of course, 
  paralyzed. The Lord laid his hands on this man and as he did the tubes 
  disappeared, the hole closed, he was completely healed and got up off the 
  wheelchair. It was a creative miracle. Now I’m standing watching the Lord in 
  this vision heal this man. And now as the man was healed, the Lord looked at 
  me with piercing eyes—I’ll not forget that one I’ll tell you. Looked at me 
  with piercing eyes and said, ‘Do it!’ And the [Hinn snaps fingers] — and the 
  dream and the vision came to an end.”<SUP>2</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn next interprets the “vision” for his faithful:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“When I woke, when I got up, when I came out of the vision, I 
  was trembling and perspiring from head to toes. I know exactly what that 
  vision means. It was Kathryn Kuhlman who took me, who introduced me to the 
  Holy Spirit. That is the meaning of that first room when she said, ‘Follow 
  me.’ But when Kathryn was gone, Jesus was there. Kathryn did her job and was 
  gone and the Lord said, ‘Follow me’ into a third room. And there was this man. 
  I believe I’m about to enter that third room. [Audience applause.] I’m telling 
  you I feel it. I sense it. I believe that room speaks of a dimension, a new 
  dimension in the Spirit. I believe I’ve been in that second room now for the 
  last seven years. What is amazing to me, what’s amazing to me is God works or 
  has worked in my life in seven year cycles. I’m now in the seventh 
  year—beginning the eighth of the ministry of these crusades. 1990 we 
  started—March. This is what? ‘97. And just now I feel another platform, 
  another dimension, another level is really coming. Well, saints, you’re going 
  to be a part of it. God—God has sent you as partners to be a part of it. So 
  how many are ready to see greater things for the glory of God?”<SUP>3 
  </SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn’s description is somewhat confusing and at one point he 
says the apparition “was a dream.” And, if left at that, would be less of a 
concern. However, he qualifies the nature of the “dream” by claiming it was 
“really more of a vision.” In fact he uses the word “vision” ten times to 
describe the experience. Moreover, he is using this event as a mystical 
prescription from the other side. This apparition, Hinn says, declares and 
describes what is to become the new by-product of his ministry. It moves him to 
a claimed oracle from Jesus of new “creative miracles”—a higher level of signs 
and wonders. He is using it to solicit support from his followers. And as such, 
must be considered and examined in a serious and biblical manner.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>HINN’S “MOUNT OF TRANSFIGURATION”</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>A few months earlier, Hinn lured the audience at his Honolulu 
Crusade with his revelations of not only Kuhlman but the Old Testament prophet 
Elijah.<SUP>4</SUP> “I have not just seen angels, I’ve seen saints,” he 
announced. His narrative there being even more brazenly spiritistic:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“You may have a problem with this, I honestly don’t really 
  care. I’ve walked in that [supernatural] world. I’ve seen things you will 
  never be able to understand, unless you’ve been in it. <I>I’ve had individuals 
  appear to me in my room.</I> Not only angels. I’ve seen sights in prayer, 
  incredible sights!”<SUP>5</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>What were the “incredible sights” Hinn had “seen”? He detailed 
for his faithful one powerful encounter:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“Can I tell you something? I have never shared this. Never! I 
  was in prayer one day and a man appeared in front of me. It happened two—for 
  two days in a row. Ev—twice one day and the next day. The same man appeared. 
  I’ve never told this, never. ...This is recently, I’m not talking about a long 
  time ago. He was about six feet two. Old man. Had a beard. ... Glistening 
  white beard. His face was somewhat thin, but very bold! Eyes—crystal blue. He 
  had on a white garment, whiter than my shirt could ever get. On his head was 
  a—like a shawl—like a—like a—like a covering. He looked like a priest. But 
  every part of him glistened like crystal. And I spoke out and I said, ‘Lord, 
  who is this man I see?’ Now, I know you may think I’ve lost my mind, but the 
  Lord said, ‘Elijah, the prophet.’”<SUP>6</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn next brought Kuhlman into the performance:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“Seven and half years ago, just before the ministry started, 
  before these crusades began, I was in prayer when suddenly in front of me I 
  saw a group of people. I couldn’t even tell you who they were. I recognized 
  only one of them. It was Miss Kuhlman. And every one of them seemed to be 
  urging me to pray. Now, I know this sounds crazy, but it’s all right. I don’t 
  mind if you call me crazy, because I liked what I 
saw.”<SUP>7</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>The purpose of Kuhlman’s and the saintly host’s visitation is 
then explained by Hinn:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“At least fifty to seventy of them were sitting in a group, 
  and they were saying to me, ‘Pray! Ask God to give you a healing ministry that 
  will touch the world!’ And suddenly I heard Kathryn’s voice, [Hinn snaps 
  fingers] and out of the blue, suddenly there—there she was, it’s crystal 
  clear. And she in her beautiful smile, the way she said, ‘Ask! We’re waiting 
  for you to ask! We’re praying with you to ask!’ And the vision 
  disappeared.”<SUP>8</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Interestingly, video tapes of Hinn’s 1997 Honolulu Crusade are 
not being made available by Hinn’s ministry.<SUP>9</SUP> Perhaps, someone more 
theologically astute in the faith healer’s organization realizes the occultic 
implications of his revelations.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>ON DEADLY GROUND</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>From the very inception of his ministry, Hinn has had a penchant 
and an obsession with the late Kuhlman. Hinn has publicly stated that Kuhlman’s 
grave carries a supernatural “anointing.” He alleges the same effect from the 
body and grave of Aimee Semple McPherson. The theatrical, twice divorced 
McPherson, who probably died by suicide, is hardly a model of Christian 
anointing.<SUP>10</SUP></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>During a sermon on the Holy Spirit, Hinn offered the following, 
eerie, testimonial:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“One of the strangest experiences I had a few years ago [was] 
  visiting Aimee’s tomb in California. This Thursday I’m on TBN. Friday I am 
  gonna go and visit Kathryn Kuhlman’s tomb. It’s close by Aimee’s in Forest 
  Lawn Cemetery. I’ve been there once already and every so often I like to go 
  and pay my respects ‘cause this great woman of God has touched my life. And 
  that grave, uh, where she’s buried is closed, they built walls around it. You 
  can’t get in without a key and I’m one of the very few people who can get in. 
  But I’ll never forget when I saw Aimee’s tomb. It’s incredibly dramatic. She 
  was such a lady that her tomb has seven-foot angels bowing on each side of her 
  tomb with a gold chain around it. As—as incredible as it is that someone would 
  die with angels bowing on each side of her grave, I felt a terrific anointing 
  when I was there. I actually, I—I, hear this, I trembled when I visited 
  Aimee’s tomb. I was shaking all over. God’s power came all over me. ... I 
  believe the anointing has lingered over Aimee’s body. I know this may be 
  shocking to you. ... And I’m going to take David [Palmquist] and Kent [Mattox] 
  and Sheryl [Palmquist] this week. They’re gonna come with me. You—you—you 
  gonna feel the anointing at Aimee’s tomb. It’s incredible. And Kathryn’s. It’s 
  amazing. I’ve heard of people healed when they visited that tomb. They were 
  totally healed by God’s power. You say, ‘What a crazy thing.’ Brother, there’s 
  things we’ll never understand. Are you all hearing 
me?”<SUP>11</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>The prophet Isaiah talked about the abomination of seeking an 
“anointing” and contact with the other world at a grave and called it 
“rebellious” and “a way that is not good” (65:2), “iniquity” and blasphemy (v. 
7). He further indites those: “Who sit among the graves, and spend the night in 
the tombs” (v. 4). The worst of judgments are pronounced on these vile practices 
(vs. 13-15). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Jewish teaching was that dead bodies were unclean (for instance 
Numbers 19:11), but Hinn thinks otherwise. Hinn apparently has never shaken his 
Arab roots. Arabic people superstitiously believe in the efficacy of praying at 
tombs of famous or “saintly” people. Arabs regularly make pilgrimages to 
“venerated, holy” graves.<SUP>12</SUP> It seems Hinn has never gotten rid of the 
superstitions of his childhood.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>A GRAVE DECEPTION</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn tries to buttress his morbid preoccupation with graves and 
the dead (in the above) by referring to the Old Testament miracle of Elisha’s 
bones bringing a man to life. In a similar vein one could refer to manna to 
insist on getting free food from heaven, but it just won’t work. A close 
examination of the Elisha event shows no comparison or parallel to what Hinn is 
claiming.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The miraculous event after the death of Elisha is found in 2 
Kings 13:20-21. A dead man was thrown into the tomb of Elisha and upon coming 
into contact with Elisha’s bones “he revived and stood up on his feet.” A 
careful study of the passage will note clearly four things:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>1. This is a miracle of resurrection from the dead—not some 
nebulous feeling or quivering. There is nothing in the verses in 2 Kings 13 
about some subjective or lingering “anointing.” Hinn is not raising the dead and 
neither are the corpses of Kuhlman or McPherson. The Elisha event is clearly 
about life from death—resurrection of a body.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>2. It is obviously a seal of divine attestation to Elisha’s 
dying prophecy regarding Joash’s victory over Syria (2 Kings 
13:14-19).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>3. Even though Elisha died of sickness (2 Kings 13:14) God’s 
approval was still on his life and death. Certainly this is contrary to the 
faith teachers like Hinn and others. You can be sick and die of that sickness 
and still have God’s favor and approval. This event contradicts and proves just 
the opposite of the health gospel preached by Hinn.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>4. Hinn’s loose use of the passage opens the way for all kinds 
of weird excesses. Adam Clarke cites one of the misuses: “This is the 
<I>first</I>, and I believe the <I>last</I>, account of a <I>true miracle</I> 
performed by the bones of a dead man; and yet on it and such like the whole 
system of miraculous working <I>relics</I> has been founded by the popish 
Church.”<SUP>13</SUP> As creation was unique, as manna was unique, as clothes 
that would not wear out were unique, this was a unique resurrection event. Hinn 
cannot claim it for validation of his trips to the graveyard. </FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>VISION OR REVISION?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn’s Atlanta claim of a “vision of the night” with Kuhlman and 
Jesus also demonstrates his blatant misuse of the vocabulary of the Bible. It is 
a failed attempt to make what he is practicing, somehow, appear to have 
justification from the Word of God. He is deceptive in this. Even a cursory look 
at this expression, its context, and biblical meaning demonstrates Hinn’s 
erroneous interpretation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The word “vision” appears approximately 100 times in the Bible, 
most of which are Old Testament passages. And, except when referring to false 
prophets and false visions, the majority of these have to do with <I>God giving 
direct revelation of Himself, about Himself and His plan, or prophetic 
information</I>. It is revelatory, special, life-giving information. This 
information was written and inscripturated for us in the Bible. Hinn is trying 
to impress his followers that his extrabiblical revelation is on a par with the 
inspired Scriptures. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Never, ever, when used in a positive way (of legitimate 
information and revelation from God) is the word “vision” ever linked with the 
occult or the dead. The exact phrase “visions of the night” is found in Genesis 
46:2 and has to do with God revealing Himself directly to Jacob. It is not a 
message from the realm of the dead. Our God is the Living God. It is a message 
from heaven. Messages from demons and the dark underworld should not be referred 
to as “visions of the night.” This is clear and obvious chicanery on Hinn’s 
part.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The word “vision” in Hebrew is <I>marah</I> and literally means 
to “see.” Jacob saw God in some form and fashion (a theophany or Christophany) 
and heard Him give promises and comfort. To connect this with efforts to raise 
funds to support one’s ministry is Scripture twisting of the most horrible and 
pernicious kind. Shame on Hinn for this deception and distortion of God’s truth. 
Once again Hinn has proven that he does not have even an elementary 
understanding of biblical interpretation. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn’s so-called “vision of the night” fits better into the 
category of Jeremiah 14:14 and 23:16:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“And the Lord said to me, the prophets prophesy lies in my 
  name. I have not sent them, commanded them, nor spoken to them; they prophesy 
  to you a false vision, divination, a worthless thing, and the deceit of their 
  own heart.”</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“Thus says the Lord of hosts: Do not listen to the words of 
  the prophets who prophesy to you. They make you worthless; They speak a vision 
  of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord.”</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>DARK SEDUCTION: A GRAVE DELUSION</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Perhaps Hinn’s “visions” detailed in Atlanta and Hawaii are 
merely contrived fiction as foretold by the Apostle Peter (2 Peter 2:3). Or the 
tales may be the result of actual dreams or delusions and embellished for 
effect. Yet, a worse case scenario does exist—if he is receiving “visions” of 
the dead, he is in contact with demons! If the latter is true, then Paul’s 
warning surely is being fulfilled:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“The Spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times some 
  shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of 
  demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their consciences seared with a hot 
  iron” (1 Timothy 4:1).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>For all the moral failings of Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart, 
they did not try to introduce their followers to the world of spiritism and 
spiritualistic practices. Hinn has entered into a dangerous practice called 
necromancy which literally means <I>divination by consulting the 
dead</I>.<SUP>14</SUP> In practicing necromancy, hidden, secret or clandestine 
knowledge is brought forth by someone who has died. Direction is sought from the 
other side. However, the Bible reveals that the real source of the information 
when obtained can be demonic entities or evil spirits <I>who imitate the 
dead</I>. This practice is at odds in every way with the Bible and the true 
worship of God.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>A careful reading of Isaiah 8 and research into the language 
shows a medium being manipulated by a demon spirit. Isaiah’s blunt question (v. 
19) cries out for an answer: “And when they say to you seek those who are 
mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter, should not a people seek their God? 
Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living?” The obvious answer is that 
God’s people should <I>never</I> seek the dead on behalf of the 
living.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Bible commentator, Dr. H.A. Ironside’s observation on Isaiah’s 
words is both “prophetic” and chilling:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“It is a grievous offense in the eyes of God for anyone to 
  turn from His revealed Word to those who profess to have power to summon the 
  spirits of the departed in order to give light and help. Such are either 
  charlatans deceiving those who go to them or else possessed by impersonating 
  demons misleading all who follow them.”<SUP>15</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><STRONG>DEAD END</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>So there are numerous strong prohibitions against contacting the 
dead <I>in any fashion</I>. Our guidance is to come from Scripture, not the 
departed. The ancient pagan cultures that clashed with Israel, practiced this 
and other occultic abominations. To consult mediums or familiar spirits was 
viewed as apostasy from God. The death penalty was required for the practice of 
necromancy.<SUP>16</SUP></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>J.R. Dummelow’s <I>A Commentary on the Holy Bible</I> spells out 
who the objects of this severe judgment are in Leviticus 19:31 with these words: 
“That have familiar spirits; necromancers who profess to hold communication with 
the dead.”<SUP>17 </SUP></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>King Saul earned the death penalty as a severe judgment from God 
for the practice of seeking enlightenment and information from the dead. “So 
Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he committed against the Lord, because he 
did not keep the word of the Lord, and also because he consulted a medium for 
guidance,” First Chronicles 10:13 declares.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Merrill Unger captures the demonic underpinnings of 
necromancy:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“But mediumship and spiritism are closely connected with the 
  ventriloquil whispers and mutterings, which the seducing demons employ in 
  their human agents in subtle imitation of the utterances of the dead, in order 
  thoroughly to deceive and win over their ready 
dupes.”<SUP>18</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Unger also forcefully reminds us:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“If it is forbidden in the Scriptures for a child of God to 
  resort to a ‘familiar spirit,’ then it is equally wrong for the departed dead, 
  either godly or wicked, to communicate with the living. By so doing, both 
  infringe upon the law of God.”<SUP>19</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Indeed, a familiar spirit can be translated as the spirit of a 
departed family member or friend as demons convey information as if from someone 
close or familiar to us.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>GLEANINGS FROM THE GREAT VINE</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The vigilant research of W.E. Vine on “Spirit (of the Dead), 
Necromancer” is worth reading in its entirety:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“The word usually represents the troubled spirit (or spirits) 
  of the dead. This meaning appears unquestionably in Isa. 29:4 ‘...Thy voice 
  shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy 
  speech shall whisper out of the dust.’ Its second meaning, ‘necromancer,’ 
  refers to a professional who claims to summon forth such spirits when 
  requested (or hired) to do so: ‘Regard not them that have familiar spirits, 
  neither seek after wizards’ (Lev. 19:31 — first occurrence). These mediums 
  summoned their ‘guides’ from a hole in the ground. Saul asked the medium 
  (witch) of Endor, ‘Divine for me from the 
hole.’”<SUP>20</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Vine then points out God’s prohibitions:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“God forbade Israel to seek information by this means, which 
  was so common among the pagans (Lev. 19:31; Deut. 18:11). Perhaps the pagan 
  belief in manipulating one’s basic relationship to a god (or gods) explains 
  the relative silence of the Old Testament regarding life after death. Yet 
  God’s people believed in life after death, from early times (e.g., Gen. 37:35; 
  Isa. 14:15ff).... Necromancers’ unusual experiences do not prove that 
  theytruly had power to summon the dead. For example, the medium of Endor could 
  not snatch Samuel out of God’s hands against His wishes. But in this 
  particular incident, it seems that God rebuked Saul’s apostasy, either through 
  a revived Samuel or through a vision of Samuel. Mediums do not have power to 
  summon the spirits of the dead, since this is reprehensible to God and 
  contrary to His will.”<SUP>21</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>The message delivered to Saul for the above practice was a 
message of judgment and death.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>In Jesus’ account of the afterlife in Luke 16 a man seeks to go 
back from the dead to warn others of torment. He is not permitted and told, 
“they have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them” (v. 29). The Word of God 
is to be our information source for our life and ministry, not occultic 
pursuits. </FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>SPIRITISM BY ANY OTHER NAME</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>According to Robert Burrows of the Spiritual Counterfeits 
Project, full blown spiritism hit our country in the mid-1880s, beginning in New 
York and generated by the teenage sisters, Margaret and Katie Fox. At its 
height, it had ten million followers including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the 
creator of Sherlock Holmes. Its “central belief is implicit in the spirit 
contact foundational to it: the dead continue to exist and communication with 
them is possible.”<SUP>22</SUP></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Spiritism went through ebbs and flows of popularity and then 
mutated into its modern form—channeling. Actress Shirley MacLaine is probably 
the most well-known endorser of channeling. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>British apologist Alan Morrison traces the modern revival of 
necromancy through Jane Roberts:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“In the present New Age scenario, Channelling began with a 
  vengeance with the contribution of a woman called Jane Roberts (1929-1984). In 
  1963, she and her husband had begun to experiment with an ouija-board and they 
  were soon contacted by an alleged spirit-entity calling itself <I>Seth</I>. 
  Within a short time, she found she could go into a trance during which this 
  spirit-being would speak through her. This led to a series of best-selling 
  books in which a great deal of occult information about every aspect of 
  life—past, present and future—is presented in a readable style. Interestingly, 
  it is common for these spirit-entities which channel through humans to adopt a 
  biblical name. Whether this is the case with Jane Robert’s ‘Seth’ is not 
  immediately apparent. ... Other well-known chanelling [sic] works are Virginia 
  Essene’s ‘New Teachings for an Awakening Humanity’, and Amy Brown Loomis’ 
  channelled messages which were alleged to be from Jesus Christ and several of 
  the Apostles. By far the best known and most popular of all the New Age 
  channelled works is the 1200-page book, ‘A Course in 
  Miracles’.”<SUP>23</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Spiritists have “churches” in which they practice seances and 
other occultic specialties. <I>They even claim healings and prophesies</I> and 
have joined together under the umbrella of the National Spiritualist 
Association. The N.S.A. lists as one of its nine principles:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“5. We affirm that communication with the so-called dead is a 
  fact scientifically proven by the phenomena of Spiritualism.”<SUP>24 
  </SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn would fit better with the N.S.A. than anywhere else. J. 
Stafford Wright reminds us:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“If for a moment we consider what the Bible says about 
  attempting to communicate with the departed, we may be astonished to find 
  that, whenever this is mentioned, it is condemned as something evil. ... The 
  Christian similarly is not to aim at gathering information from the departed, 
  but at hearing the message of Christ. ... It is clear that the Biblical 
  verdict on Spiritualism is completely hostile. One may assume that the reason 
  is because the deception (conscious or unconscious) that is inherent in it. 
  There may, in fact, be two sources of deception. 1. <I>The unconscious mind of 
  the medium.</I> ... The sitter cannot be certain of being in touch with the 
  one who has passed on, for the medium may in fact be interpreting a projected 
  image from the sitter’s own mind. 2. A more dangerous deception would arise if 
  we suppose <I>the intervention of evil spirits.</I> Spiritualists themselves 
  recognize this possibility.”<SUP>25</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn’s move in the direction of the occult should not be a 
surprise. The modern-day Pentecostal movement, which began in 1906, has muddled 
beginnings and a prior history of involvement in spiritism. Azusa Street drew in 
spiritualists and mediums and contemporaries of that day were reporting seances, 
trances and other outlandish and occultic behavior.<SUP>26</SUP> Once the door 
of unrestrained subjective mysticism is opened, Satan and the flesh can have a 
field day. God’s Word is our <I>only</I> protection against the demonic as well 
as ourselves. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>In all of this, Hinn moves toward the worst groups in history. 
He even, knowingly or unknowingly, mirrors in himself and his following the 
bizarre Convulsionaries of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century whose focus was tombs and 
miracles:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=3>“Groups of visitors to the tomb were gripped by uncontrollable 
  urges to dance or fall into seizures. In these states the ‘convulsionaires’, 
  as they came to be called, seemed to lose contact with the external world, 
  even to the point of becoming insensitive to pain. They had religious visions 
  and reported miraculous healings. On one occasion, a skeptic who came to the 
  tomb to mock the proceedings found herself struck with 
  paralysis.”<SUP>27</SUP></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><STRONG>BACK TO BASICS</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>How many more dead people will Hinn report “visions” of? Hinn 
has yet spun another yarn as he has so often or is being duped by demons. God’s 
Word leaves him no other options. Either choice ushers his followers into deep 
deception and may well give them leave to seek such encounters from the other 
side. In either case, Hinn needs to repent before God and seek the forgiveness 
of the body of Christ. Following that, he needs to step down and enroll in some 
basic doctrine courses and stop his overt approval of the occult. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Hinn, in the recent past resigned from the Assemblies of God 
denomination. Following his resignation he returned to being accountable and 
answerable to no one but himself. His new attraction and “ride” is a ride that 
can lead his faithful to darkness and destruction. These followers need to get 
off quickly and stay off. The truth is out. But will even the truth be able to 
convince the emotion intoxicated followers?</FONT></P>
