<H1>C.S. Lewis (1898-1963)</H1>
<H2><CITE>General Teachings/Activities</CITE></H2>
<P>- &nbsp;C.S. Lewis was born in Belfast, Ireland, the younger of two sons; he 
was named Clive Staples Lewis. He claimed to have been converted to Christianity 
in 1931 and was, as he put it: "A very ordinary layman of The Church of 
England." (Lewis was a member of the apostate Church of England, an institution 
whose history is based largely on theological compromise with Rome.) He had no 
theological training. He was the author of 40-plus books which included poems, 
novels, children's books, science fiction, theology, literary criticisms, 
educational philosophy, and an autobiography.&nbsp;</P>
<P>From 1954 until his death, he was professor of medieval and Renaissance 
English at Cambridge University. Today, C.S. Lewis is known as a distinguished 
literary scholar and Christian apologist. <I>Mere Christianity</I> (a book upon 
which the beliefs of many professing Christians are based) is considered one of 
the most profound and logically irrefutable writings on Christian apologetics. 
Nevertheless, even this book is fraught with theological error. (For example, 
the concept of "mere Christianity" means agreeing on a small common denominator 
of Christian truth, while tolerating great areas of disagreement.)</P>
<P>-&nbsp; <FONT face="Charter BT" size=3>In 1993, <I>Christianity Today</I> 
explained why C.S. Lewis is so popular among Evangelicals. Among the reasons 
given for his popularity was the following "<B>Lewis's</B> … <B>concentration on 
the main doctrines of the church coincided with evangelicals' concern to avoid 
ecclesiastical separatism</B>" (<I>Christianity Today</I>, 10/25/93). <I>CT</I> 
admits that C.S. Lewis is popular to Evangelicals today because, like them, he 
despised <A

separation</A>. </FONT>As an indication of Lewis's continued popularity, annual 
book sales remain over two million ( half of which comes from <I>The Chronicles 
Of Narnia </I>series, an occult fantasy series written for children -- see the

fascination with occult <A

<FONT face="Charter BT" size=3>In an article commemorating the 100th anniversary 
of Lewis's birth, <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/packer/">J.I. Packer</A> 
called him "our patron saint." <I>Christianity Today</I> said Lewis "has come to 
be the Aquinas, the Augustine, and the Aesop of contemporary Evangelicalism" 
("Still Surprised by Lewis," <I>Christianity Today</I>, 9/7/98). Wheaton College 
sponsored a lecture series on C.S. Lewis, and Eerdmans published "The Pilgrim’s 
Guide" to C.S. Lewis.</FONT> <FONT face="Charter BT" size=3>In April 1998, 
Mormon professor Robert Millet spoke at Wheaton College on the topic of C.S. 
Lewis. In a recent issue of <I>Christianity Today,</I> Millet, dean of Brigham 
Young University, is quoted as saying that <B>C.S. Lewis "is so well received by 
Latter-day Saints [Mormons] because of his broad and inclusive vision of 
Christianity</B>" (John W. Kennedy, "Southern Baptists Take Up the Mormon 
Challenge," <I>Christianity Today</I>, 6/15/98, p. 30).</FONT></P>
<P>- &nbsp;By the time of his death, Lewis had moved from Idealism (no idea of a 
personal God) to Pantheism (an impersonal God in everything) and then to Theism 
(the existence of God). In <I>Letters to Malcolm</I> (p. 107), Lewis indicates 
that shortly before his death he was turning toward the <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/Catholicism/">Catholic 
Church</A>. Lewis termed himself "very Catholic" -- his prayers for the dead, 
belief in purgatory, and rejection of the literal resurrection of the body are 
serious deviations from Biblical Christianity (<I>C.S. Lewis: A Biography</I>, 
p. 234); he even went to a priest for regular confession (p. 198), and received 
the sacrament of extreme unction on 7/16/63 (p. 301). His contention that some 
pagans may "belong to Christ without knowing it" is a destructive heresy 
(<I>Mere Christianity</I>, pp. 176-177), as was his statement that "Christ 
fulfils both Paganism and Judaism ..." (<I>Reflections on the Psalms</I>, p. 
129). Lewis believed that we're to become "gods," an apparent affirmation of 
theistic evolution. He also believed the Book of Job is "unhistorical" 
(<I>Reflections on the Psalms</I>, pp. 110), and that the Bible contained 
"error" (pp. 110, 112) and is not divinely inspired (<I>The Inklings</I>, p. 
175). <FONT face="Charter BT" size=3>Lewis used profanities, told bawdy stories, 
and frequently got drunk with his students (5/19/90, <I>World</I> magazine). 
</FONT>Christians need to read more critically <I>The Abolition of Man, The 
Problem of Pain</I>,<I> Miracles</I>,<I> The Great Divorce</I>,<I> </I>and 
<I>God in the Dock</I>. For example, Lewis never believed in a literal hell, but 
instead believed hell is a state of mind one chooses to possess and become -- he 
wrote, "... every shutting-up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind 
is, in the end, Hell" (<I>The Great Divorce</I>, p. 65).&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>If it is true to say that 'you are what 
you eat,' then it is also true to say that 'a Christian is what he hears and 
reads,' since this is how he gets his spiritual food. Thus <STRONG>if Christians 
are brought up on a diet of C.S. Lewis, it should not surprise us to find they 
are seeking 'to continue the legacy of C.S. Lewis.</STRONG>' The apostle Paul 
said, 'A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump' (Gal. 5:9). Thus, 
<B>if</B><STRONG> evangelicals read and applaud such books as <I>Mere 
Christianity</I>, it should come as no surprise if we find them ‘working towards 
a common mission’ with the enemies of the gospel. The young Christian should be 
very careful what he reads, and those in positions of authority (pastors, 
teachers, parents) should be very careful what they recommend others to 
read</STRONG> (Dr. Tony Baxter, "The Enigma of C.S. Lewis," <I>CRN Journal</I>, 
Winter 1998, Christian Research Network, Colchester, United Kingdom, p. 
30).</FONT></P>
<P>- &nbsp;It is difficult to attempt to evaluate the theology of a man regarded 
by many as the greatest contemporary lay writer for the Christian faith. With 
his witty English humor, sharp and simple logic, and seeming loyalty to the 
tenets of the Christian faith, C.S. Lewis won the admiration of thousands in 
England and here in the United States. Nevertheless, the following is such an 
attempt. For the sake of argument, references are made only to points of 
disagreement (GD=<I>The Great Divorce</I>; LM=<I>Letters to Malcolm</I>, 
M=<I>Miracles</I>, MC=<I>Mere Christianity</I>; PP=<I>The Problem of Pain</I>; 
RP=<I>Reflections on the Psalms</I>, SJ=<I>Surprised by Joy</I>, SL=<I>The 
Screwtape Letters</I>):<BR><BR><STRONG>Theology Proper<BR><BR></STRONG><U>On 
Creation</U>: Lewis believed that evolution was true to an extent in the past, 
but that it will be superseded in the future (MC, p.169). "... for we have good 
reason to believe that animals existed long before men. ... For long centuries 
God perfected the animal form which was to become the vehicle of humanity and 
the image of Himself ... [Eventually,] God caused a new kind of consciousness to 
descend upon this organism" (PP, pp.133,77). "... Man, the highest of the 
animals" (MC, p.139); "... but he (man) remains still a primate and an animal" 
(RP, pp.115,129); "If ... you mean simply that man is physically descended from 
animals, I have no objection" (PP, p.72) "He made an earth at first 'without 
form and void' and brought it by degrees to its perfection" (M, p.125). Nature's 
"pregnancy has been long and painful and anxious, but it has reached its climax" 
(MC, p.172). He held that the Genesis account came from Pagan and mythical 
sources -- <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">"I have 
therefore no difficulty accepting, say, the view of those scholars who tell us 
that the account of Creation in Genesis is derived from earlier Semitic stories 
which were Pagan and mythical."</SPAN> (RP, 
p.110).<BR><BR><STRONG>Anthropology<BR><BR></STRONG><U>On the depravity of 
man</U>: "... when the consequence is drawn that, since we are totally depraved, 
our idea of good is worth simply nothing -- may thus turn Christianity into a 
form of devil worship" (PP, pp.37-38). The divine goodness differs "from ours 
not as white and black but as a perfect circle from a child's first attempt to 
draw a wheel" (PP, p.39). Total depravity was rejected by Lewis ("I disbelieve 
that doctrine") because: (1) If we were totally depraved we could not know 
ourselves to be depraved; (2) Experience shows that there is much goodness in 
human nature (PP, p.66).<BR><BR><STRONG>Soteriology<BR><BR></STRONG><U>How 
salvation (the general scope) works</U>: "There are people in other religions 
who are being led by God's secret influence to concentrate on those parts of 
their religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to 
Christ without knowing it ... For example a Buddhist of good will <SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">may 
be led to concentrate more and more on the Buddhist teaching about mercy and to 
leave in the background (though he might still say he believed) the Buddhist 
teaching on certain points. </SPAN>Many of the good Pagans long before Christ's 
birth may have been in this position" (MC, pp. 176-177). God "often makes prizes 
of humans who have given their lives for causes He thinks bad on the monstrously 
sophistical ground that the humans thought them good and were following the best 
they knew" (SL, p.26). "There are three things that spread the Christ-life to 
us: <A 
href="http://www.fundamentalbiblechurch.org/Tracts/fbcbaptr.htm">baptism</A>, 
belief, and that mysterious action which different Christians call by different 
names -- Holy Communion, the Mass, the Lord's Supper" (MC, pp.62,63). In the 
other world "there will be every occasion for being the sort of people that we 
can become only as the result of doing such acts here" (MC, p.63).</P>
<P><U>On losing salvation</U>: "There are people (a great many of them) who are 
slowly ceasing to be Christians ..." (MC, p.162). "... a Christian can lose the 
Christ-life which has been put into him, and he has to make efforts to keep it" 
(MC, p.49).</P>
<P><U>On being "Born Again"</U>: "... ye must be born again. Till then, we have 
duty, morality, the Law. A schoolmaster, as St. Paul says.... But the 
schooldays, please God, are numbered" (LM, p.115). [Note: In context, to be "<A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Introduction/newbirth.htm">born 
again</A>," for Lewis, is somewhere down the road yet (MC, 
pp.59,60).]<BR><BR><STRONG>The Hereafter<BR><BR></STRONG><U>On heaven</U>: "All 
the scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, etc.) is, of course, a merely 
symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible. Musical instruments are 
mentioned because for many people (not all) music is the thing known in the 
present life which most strongly suggests ecstasy and infinity. Crowns are 
mentioned to suggest the fact that those who are united with God in eternity 
share His splendor and power and joy. Gold is mentioned to suggest the 
timelessness of heaven (gold does not rust) and the preciousness of it" (MC, 
p.106). "The point is not that God will refuse you admission to His eternal 
world if you have not certain qualities of character: the point is that if 
people have not got at least the beginnings of those qualities inside them, then 
no possible external conditions could make a 'Heaven' for them ..." (MC, 
p.63).</P>
<P><U>On animals in heaven</U>: "The redemptive function" of man toward animals 
-- "It seems to me possible that certain animals may have an immortality, not in 
themselves, but in the immortality of their masters" (PP, pp.136,139-140). Lewis 
also pictures animals in heaven as partaking of the Christ-life through a 
saintly woman (GD, p.108).<BR><BR><STRONG>Bibliology</STRONG><BR><BR>"I have the

<P><B><U><FONT size=+1>Brief Analysis</FONT></U></B>:</P>
<P>(a) Although the free will of man and the sovereignty of God were both 
propounded, it is difficult to clearly delineate their inter-play as presented 
by Lewis. Man seems to be always presented as making choices as a result of his 
own self-will; yet in his own conversion, Lewis seemed to think that he was 
almost compelled to believe.</P>
<P>(b) It is most unfortunate that theistic evolution had pervaded Lewis's 
theological climate, as it led him to a non-literal interpretation of the 
Scriptures. It was also the beginning of a lower doctrine of anthropology and 
ensuing doctrinal deviations. This position eventually affected all of Lewis's 
doctrinal concepts, even his concept of salvation.</P>
<P>(c) To substantiate his view concerning total depravity, Lewis overlooked the 
clear statement of Scripture that our righteousness is like filthy rags and that 
there is none that are doing good. He looked at the subject from man's point of 
view rather than from God's as revealed in the Bible. What he referred to as 
"animal nature," should instead be termed "sin nature" or the "natural man."</P>
<P>(d) C.S. Lewis's most outrageous misunderstanding was that concerning the 
purpose of the death of Christ, which of course mars all subsequent propositions 
about the effects of the cross and salvation. Tragically, he did not hold to the 
Substitutionary Atonement, but saw Christ's death as something analogous to the 
Roman Catholic concept of the storing-up of grace. It is distressing to find the 
large number of references to loss of salvation and ceasing to be Christians. 
Lewis realized that "mere improvement is not redemption," but that redemption 
results in transformation was foreign to him. Rather, he thought that 
transformation is the <I>process</I> of redemption. Lewis conceived of 
Christians as <I>being</I> born again rather than being born-again <I>once 
</I>-- he viewed salvation as a process rather than an act.</P>
<P>(e) We find some rather strange ideas concerning those who are Christians. 
Lewis made the distinction between those who are saved through Christ (everyone) 
and those who are saved and <I>know</I> Him. Lewis seemed to think that there is 
sufficient revelation in other religions for God to covertly direct man's 
attention to this revelation and bring salvation without knowing of the 
particulars of Christ.</P>
<P>(f) Lewis held to one of the most fallacious errors of our day -- that God 
accepts those that are sincere even though they are very wrong. The Church of 
England's influence on his theology was also evidenced by his belief that the 
Christ-life is spread by baptism and communion as well as belief.</P>
<P>(g) In his speculations on the hereafter, Lewis is to be criticized for being 
so extra-Biblical. At times, his speculations are so much of a contrast with the 
plain statements of Scripture as to become absurd to the Bible reader. Perhaps 
the most striking example of this is his attempt to get animals into heaven 
through partaking of the Christ-life through their human masters.</P>

<P><B><U><FONT size=+1>Note on Lewis's "Christianity"</FONT></U></B>: The 
following excerpt is from "A Conversation with Thomas Howard ..." (a Roman 
Catholic), considered one of the foremost experts on the life and work of C.S. 
Lewis (12/6/98). It again raises the question: Why do today's "evangelicals" 
view C.S. Lewis as a true Christian?</P>
<P><B>Q</B>: I have not read the whole book [<I>JACK: C.S. Lewis and His 
Times</I>, by George Sayer, a biography about C.S. Lewis], but someone drew my 
attention to a certain section describing a holiday where George Sayer, C.S. 
Lewis and C.S. Lewis' wife, Joy, went off to Greece. C.S. Lewis attended some 
Greek liturgies and a Greek wedding. I was quite surprised that Sayer quotes 
C.S. Lewis as telling him that of all the liturgies he'd ever attended, he 
preferred the Greek Orthodox liturgy to anything that he had seen in the West, 
Protestant or Roman Catholic. Then he went on to say that of all the priests and 
monks that he had ever had the opportunity to meet, the Orthodox priests that he 
ran across in his sojourn in Greece were the holiest, most spiritual men he had 
ever met. C.S. Lewis referred to a certain look they had, a sense.</P>
<P>I know you are a scholar and an expert on C.S. Lewis, so I'd like your 
comments. I find it odd to read this pro-Orthodox statement stuck in the middle 
of a biography being sold by a Calvinistic, Protestant publishing company. This 
brings up a point: isn't it strange that C.S. Lewis is an "evangelical hero" 
when he certainly cannot be described as Protestant, let alone "evangelical" in 
the classical sense?</P>
<P><B>Howard</B>: You've put your finger on a very, very interesting point. I 
had an article in a Roman Catholic magazine called <I>CRISIS</I> several months 
back on this very point: on C.S. Lewis and his evangelical "clientele." Not only 
is it an irony, it is a contradiction. Lewis would have been appalled by the 
evangelical adulation of his work. He would have been horrified, even enraged by 
a lot of what he would see today in American evangelical circles. He was not a 
free church evangelical. <B>C.S. Lewis was a sacramentalist, an Anglican who 
really did not want to pursue the ecclesiological question further than he 
did.</B> He resisted, rather angrily sometimes, the Church questions. But he was 
not at all attracted to Protestant evangelicalism, or even Anglicanism. Actually 
I can bring it in closer than just George Sayer's speaking about C.S. Lewis' 
attraction to the Greek Orthodox liturgy. Lewis himself, and I probably can find 
the quote for you, in one of his letters, I think it's in <I>LETTERS TO 
MALCOLM</I>, <B>Lewis speaks of having been at an Orthodox liturgy and he said 
he loved it. He said some stood, some sat, some knelt and one old man crawled 
around the floor like a caterpillar! He absolutely loved it! </B>[Bold 
added.]</P>
<P>Lewis' good, very close friend, J.R.R. Tolkien, the man that wrote the hobbit 
books, was a very devout Roman Catholic and tried hard over the years to budge 
Lewis across the line. He got nowhere. Lewis would not speak about Church 
questions. We only know for sure that C.S. Lewis loved the Orthodox Church, 
though, of course, he never joined it and remained in the Anglican Church.</P>
<P><B>Q</B>: Speaking just as a layman, it seems to me that the "theology" you 
get out of <I>THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA</I>, <I>THE GREAT DIVORCE</I>, <I>THE 
SCREWTAPE LETTERS</I> is Orthodox. I was recently rereading <I>THE SCREWTAPE 
LETTERS</I> and Lewis has a section where Screwtape (the lead demon writing to 
the little demon, Wormwood) says something like, "In misleading your Protestant 
convert, the best thing to do is get him to pray extemporaneously; make sure 
that above all he does not pray the liturgical prayers his mother taught him; 
let him think that everything he says is original." When I read C.S. Lewis I 
hear an Orthodox voice. I hear a sacramentalist and liturgical traditionalist 
writing. <U>How do evangelical, let alone fundamentalist, Protestants read C.S. 
Lewis and think that they are reading someone who is on "their side?</U>" 
[Emphasis added.]</P>
<P><B>Howard</B>: Maybe I'm being a little bit naughty, but the answer is, 
probably the same way they read the Bible! You and I would say the Apostolic 
Church is there, in its seed, in the Bible, but apparently it's possible to read 
the Bible as a Protestant for sixty or seventy or eighty years and never see it! 
By the same token, Lewis' evangelical American "clientele" simply don't get it. 
When C.S. Lewis speaks of the blessed sacrament, they don't hear it. When Lewis 
speaks of the prayers of the Church, they don't hear it. When <B>Lewis speaks of 
auricular confession, which he practiced</B>, they don't hear it. I think when 
Lewis smokes a cigarette or drinks his whiskey, they don't see it, either; not 
that that's on the same level as his ecclesiology! (Laughter) C.S. Lewis would 
have been very, very ill at ease with his eager North American free church 
clientele. Very, very ill at ease and out of his métier. [Bold added.]</P>

<P>[This section has been excerpted and/or adapted from a 1985 <I>Media 
Spotlight</I> Special Report: "C.S. Lewis: The Man and His Myths."]</P>
<P>In spite of what many believe to be brilliant exegesis on Christian 
apologetics (In light of the above, one wonders which of Lewis's books these 
people have been reading?), there appears to have been in C.S. Lewis a seemingly 
irresistible attraction to the shadow world of occult fantasy -- a mingling of 
darkness with light evident in writings apart from his apologetics. As a child, 
Lewis's fertile imagination was greatly influenced by fantasy and fairy tales 
told to him by his mother. His brilliant mind was quick to seize upon these 
experiences, and his favorite pastime became drawing what he later called the 
"anthropomorphized beasts of nursery literature." He and his brother referred to 
them as "dressed animals" (C.S. Lewis, <I>Surprised by Joy</I>, p. 6).</P>
<P>Lewis's early favorite literature included E. Nesbit's trilogy: <I>Five 
Children and It</I>,<I> The Phoenix and the Wishing Carpet</I>, and <I>The 
Amulet </I>-- all occult fantasies. Even after having been a professing 
Christian for twenty-five years, he maintained, "I can still read with delight" 
(p. 14). So much was Lewis's life steeped in fantasy that he wrote, "The central 
story of my life is about nothing else" (p. 17). From Nesbit and Gulliver he 
advanced to Longfellow's <I>Saga of King Olaf</I> and fell in love with the 
magic and pagan myths of Norse legend. By the age of twelve, there had grown in 
Lewis's mind an intense relationship with the world of fantasy and elves: "I 
fell deeply under the spell of Dwarfs -- the old bright-hooded, snowy-bearded 
dwarfs we had in those days before Arthur Rackham sublimed or Walt Disney 
vulgarized, the earthmen. I visualized them so intensely that I came to the very 
frontiers of hallucination; once, walking in the garden, I was for a second not 
quite sure that a little man had not run past me into the shrubbery. I was 
faintly alarmed ..." (p. 55). Although one would expect childhood fantasies to 
subside after a time, in Lewis's case they became more a delight as he grew 
older.</P>
<P>When Lewis was sent to boarding school in Hertfordshire, England, his first 
impression was one of revulsion toward the unpleasant urban environment compared 
to his Irish countryside. He immediately hated England. Of this same time he 
writes, "I also developed a great taste for all the fiction I could get about 
the ancient world: <I>Quo Vadis</I>,<I> Darkness and Dawn</I>,<I> The 
Gladiators</I>,<I> Ben Hur</I> ... the attraction, as I now see, was erotic, and 
erotic in rather a morbid way ... what I took to at the same time, is the work 
of Rider Haggard; and also the 'scientification' of H.G. Wells ... The interest, 
when the fit was upon me, was ravenous, like a lust" (p. 35).</P>
<P>After advancing to preparatory school at Wyvern, Lewis gradually "ceased to 
be a Christian." He became interested in the occult and embraced an attitude of 
pessimism about what he considered a faulty world. His taste for the occult was 
nurtured and grew as he became enthralled with Wagnerian operas and their Norse 
sagas derived from Celtic mythology.</P>
<P>At the age of twenty-seven, after having been elected Fellow and Tutor in 
English Language and Literature at Magdalen College, C.S. Lewis met John Ronald 
Reuel Tolkien at a meeting of the English faculty at Menton College (5/11/26). 
J.R.R. Tolkien, though wary of Lewis at first, enrolled him in the "Coalbiters," 
a club founded by Tolkien for the study and propagation of Norse mythology. The 
two became close friends, sharing their common interest in occult fantasy. 
Tolkien argued that there is an inherent truth of mythology: that all pagan 
religions point in the direction of God. Through this faulty argument, Lewis 
reasoned the story of Christ to be a "true myth" -- a myth much the same as 
others, but a myth that really happened.</P>
<P>It was during their long association that both Lewis and Tolkien developed 
their most prestigious "sword and sorcery" material. Tolkien, of course, became 
well-known for his mythological tale, <I>The Hobbit</I>, and his later work, 
<I>The Lord of the Rings</I>, released as three volumes: <I>The Fellowship of 
the Ring</I>,<I> The Two Towers</I>, and <I>The Return of the King</I>. Lewis 
turned to expounding intermittently on Christian apologetics and to writing 
fantasy.</P>
<P>Perhaps the best-known fantasy from Lewis's pen is the seven-volume <I>The 
Chronicles of Narnia.</I> In it some see a parallel to the warfare between God 
and Satan. Many of Lewis's fantasies see the great lion, Aslan, as Christ. This 
because Aslan lays down his life to free the children from the curse of the evil 
witch (believed to represent Satan). He possesses knowledge of a greater "magic" 
than that of the witch -- a magic that brings him back to life and destroys the 
witch's power.</P>
<P>It is argued that in presenting a blend of fantasy with analogy to Christian 
truth, Lewis hoped to encourage his readers to search out the truth 
further.<B><A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/lewis/general.htm#*" 
name="Return to Text2">*</A></B> This, however, was <U>not</U> Lewis's intention 
in writing his fantasies. Rather, he was genuinely enamored of mythology and 
believed the "Story" to take precedence over any preconceived moral. In Lewis's 
own words:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Some people seem to think that I began by asking myself how I could say 
  something about Christianity to children; then fixed on the fairy tale as an 
  instrument; then collected information about child-<A 
  href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/psych.htm">psychology</A> 
  and decided what age group I'd write for; then drew up a list of basic 
  Christian truths and hammered out 'allegories' to embody them. This is all 
  pure moonshine. I couldn't write in that way at all. Everything began with 
  images; a faun carrying an umbrella, a queen on a sledge, a magnificent lion. 
  At first there wasn't even anything Christian about them; that element pushed 
  itself in of its own accord" (<I>Of Other Worlds</I>, p. 36).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So we see that <I>Narnia</I> was not by design Christian allegory. Yet even 
if Christian allegory or analogy was Lewis's intention, the fact is that the 
truth of God, when couched in terms less than accurate, is open to question. 
Aside from the fact that when presented as myth the truth may be mistaken for 
myth, no clear understanding can be forthcoming without prior knowledge of the 
truth -- in which case the allegory or analogy is useless. In any case, it is 
dangerous to present evil as good, and magic as synonymous with the 
miracle-working power of the Holy Spirit (Isa. 5:20, Acts 8:9-23).</P>
<P>Many of Lewis's characters in his fantasies depicted as "good" are in reality 
associated with witchcraft, pagan mythology, and the Norse mysteries. They are, 
in fact, gods of nature. And magic in these stories is used for either "good" or 
"evil" purposes depending upon the source of that magic. One of the more 
pronounced confusions of good and evil is <I>Till We Have Faces</I>, Lewis's 
retelling of the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, written just a few years before 
his death. In this work, several ungodly concepts are espoused as valid truths. 
One such is a strong hint at <A 
href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Cults/unitari.htm">universalist</A> 
doctrine:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"We're all Timbs and parts of one Whole. Hence, of each other, Men, and 
  gods, flow in and out and mingle" (<I>Till We Have Faces</I>, pp. 
300-301).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When such ideas are presented by one of the chief protagonists, heralded as a 
purveyor of wisdom by the author, one cannot but think the author also believed 
that way. So, too, one might for this same reason think Lewis looked upon 
suicide as an acceptable act:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Have I not told you often that to depart from life of a man's own will 
  when there's good reason is one of the things that are according to nature?" 
  (<I>Till We Have Faces</I>, p. 17).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Was Lewis necessarily aware of his error? He apparently saw no 
incompatibility between his professed faith and occult fantasy. His imagination, 
welded upon fantasy in preference to what he considered a faulty reality, set 
the theme for his writings and became the basis for confusion by readers who 
perceived them as "Christian" allegory.</P>
<P>While millions accept Lewis's apologetics as evidence of a genuine faith 
[mistakenly so, in our opinion], they forget that he was a fallible human being 
whose writings in total must be subjected to testing by God's Word. We see in 
Christian bookstores Lewis's treatises on Christian thought along side his 
occult fantasies. It has apparently escaped notice that Lewis is highly 
respected among those involved in occultism. In fact, there has developed a cult 
of sorts which venerates the fantasies of Lewis along with those of other 
writers who do not claim to be Christians. Evidence of this is the fact that 
Lewis's <I>Chronicles of Narnia</I> is listed along with other occult writings 
as recommended inspirational reading by the makers of the demonically-oriented 
game <I>Dungeons and Dragons</I>!</P>
<P>To some degree, we've all been infected by the world's philosophies. But 
those philosophies should be discarded as we come to a knowledge of truth. Yet, 
it's difficult to discard them when they are perceived as "Christian" allegory. 
While there may be insights into life that are profitable to be found in the 
works of C.S. Lewis, we think it not wise to encourage young or untaught 
Christians to feed on such a presentation of so-called Christian truth. Some may 
be readily attracted to Lewis's style and logic, but let us not be blinded and 
thus miss the plain and simple truth of Scripture.&nbsp; [<A

<P><B><A name=*>* </A></B>A prime example of how a fantasy novelist is able to 
weave truth and untruth and fact and fable, thus distorting God's Word, is found 
in the C.S. Lewis book <I>The Last Battle </I>of <I>The Chronicles of Narnia 
</I>series. Young people who read this book are falsely led to believe that all 
the sin and evil that a person has committed, <U>in serving Satan</U>, can in 
the end be counted <U>as service rendered to God</U>!</P>

  <P>"Then I fell at his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for 
  the Lion (who is worthy of all honour) [supposedly the Narnian representation 
  of Christ] will know that I have served Tash [supposedly the Narnian 
  representation of Satan] all my days and not him [the Lion/Christ]. ... But 
  the Glorious One bent down his golden head ... and said, Son, thou art 
  welcome. But I said, Alas, Lord, I am no son of thine but the servant of Tash. 
  He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as 
  service done to me.</P>
  <P>" ... I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is 
  it then true, as the Ape said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so 
  that the earth shook (but his wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. 
  Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the 
  services which thou hast done to him. For I and he are of such different kinds 
  that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile 
  can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for 
  the oath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, 
  and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, 
  though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed 
  is accepted. .. But I said also (for the truth constrained me), Yet I have 
  been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy 
  desire had been for me thou shouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For 
  all find what they truly seek."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Lewis is teaching damnable false doctrine here, and it is even more wicked, 
in that it is intended for the indoctrination of children. First, according to 
Lewis, those who sincerely serve the devil (Tash) are actually serving God 
(Aslan), and will eventually be accepted by God. That is the heresy of 
Universalism, believing that God will somehow receive unbelievers and followers 
of false religions into Heaven even though they do not know Jesus Christ in this 
life. Furthermore, Lewis is teaching that salvation can be achieved by works and 
religious seeking, and that is a false gospel that is cursed of God in the book 
of Galatians. (Source: 5/29/01, FBIS.)</P>
