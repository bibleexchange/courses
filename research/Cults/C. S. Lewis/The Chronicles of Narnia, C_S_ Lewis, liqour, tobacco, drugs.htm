          thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the

          <P><B>C.S. Lewis certainly had some strange women in his stories - 
          both "good" and bad. &nbsp;He also uttered extremely perverse things 
          in his books. &nbsp;The poison of "<FONT color=#990000>that old 
          serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan,</FONT>" (Rev. 20:2) is clearly 
          visible in his life. &nbsp;It is hardly surprising then that he was a 
          drunkard.</B> </P>
          <P><B>Lewis' appetite for beer, rum and wine is visible in the fact 
          that the characters consume them regularly in his <I>Chronicles</I>. 
          This is&nbsp;mostly by the good characters. &nbsp;Not only does he put 
          it in the stories, but it is associated in <IMG height=198

          <P><B>I've Never heard of mixing mud in with tobacco, but, before the 
          Lord converted me, I was with a witchcraft coven. This instance of 
          adding things to tobacco brings back painful memories. At some of the 
          ceremonies, drugs played a major part, and occasionally, potions were 
          placed in the tobacco to induce visions. Also, Black smoke was used 
          for the conjuring of "spirits". It was run through a container of dry 
          ice to make it stay low to the ground, like smoke does when it's 
          chilled. I don't know if this was exactly what Lewis was referencing, 
          but Judging from the...research...it could have been. I hope that this 
          information helps... A. W.</B></P>
          <P><B><FONT color=#000000>Editor: This is a revealing insight. It is 
          certainly possible that Lewis was aware of this. Though I found no 
          evidence that he was active in a coven, his wide knowledge of occult 
          doctrines and practices certainly could have included this type of 
          thing. The fact that the smoke was black and drifted along the ground 
          in both cases is very curious. It almost seems too much to be a mere 
          coincidence. Also, it is interesting to note that Puddleglum was a 
          froggish type being. Remember what John said</FONT><FONT 
          color=#800080> in</FONT><FONT color=#990099> <FONT 
          color=#990000>Revelation 16:13,</FONT></FONT><FONT color=#990000> And

          the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of 
          the false prophet.</FONT></B> <B><FONT color=#000000>Even if Lewis did 
          not intentionally arrange this odd combination in his story, it 
          certainly has the fingerprints of Satan. Once again we see the way 
          paved for acceptance of witchcraft practices and 
          activity.</FONT></B><BR></P>

          <H2 align=center>Hashish</H2>
          <P><B>Here we come to a very strange thing that C.S. Lewis included in 
          his story. &nbsp;As if the references to liquor and tobacco were not 
          enough, he makes a very covert reference to hashish, or marijuana.</B> 
          </P>
          <P><B>When Edmund meets the White Witch she gives him first a strange 
          drink, as described previously. She&nbsp;then asks him what he would 
          like best to eat, and to his reply, makes him a box of Turkish Delight 
          by means of her magic. Lewis portrays Edmund as eating this greedily, 
          and the more he eats the more he wants it - implying addiction.</B> 
          <B>This is explained in that the witch (or Queen) knows that the 
          Turkish Delight is "enchanted" and that once a person has tasted it, 
          they will&nbsp;want more and more of it and, if allowed to, would eat 
          themselves to death. She promises Edmund all the Turkish Delight he 
          can eat for the rest of his life if he will bring his sibling to her, 
          and he leaves after begging for just one more piece. (p.32-36; <I>The 
          Lion, the&nbsp;Witch and the Wardrobe</I>)</B> </P>
          <P><B>Lewis' Turkish Delight is not an enchanted candy from fairyland, 
          though.</B> <B>In the book <I>Marihuana: The First Twelve Thousand 
          Years</I></B> <B>by Ernest Abel (New York and London, Plenum Press, 
          1980), we find out&nbsp;where Lewis quite likely got his "inspiration" 
          for "enchanted" Turkish Delight.</B> </P>
          <P><B>"As in India, local officials in Egypt were alarmed at the large 
          numbers of inhabitants who used hashish directly or in confections, 
          many of which were exported to Europe. Among the variety of 
          confectionery treats containing hashish that were sent abroad were 
          'Turkish Delight,' square pieces of hashish containing sugar and 
          gelatin which were a particular favorite of the students at Cambridge 
          University in England.(p. 133.)</B></P>
          <P><B>"It was not that the English were above using drugs that altered 
          consciousness, but rather that they were more content with alcohol, 
          and saw little need to experiment with mind-altering drugs. Those who 
          did were either members of minority groups, artists, writers, 
          criminals, or students. It was the isolated cases that came to the 
          attention of the press and gave the impression that hashish was 
          rampant in parts of England.</B> </P>
          <P><B>"One such case took place in 1886 in the dormitories of staid 
          old Cambridge University. According to a newspaper report, some 
          students had obtained 'Turkish Delight' and not being experienced 
          users of the hashish-laden confection, had taken an overdose and 
          became ill as a result. Oxford also had its share of cannabis users.

          <P><B>As we shall see further on, Lewis' <I>Chronicles of Narnia</I> 
          are nothing more than a manual of witchcraft for children. What Lewis 
          is doing here is introducing the use of drugs in sorcery. This is 
          commonly used in the Craft. However, the secret meaning here will only 
          be&nbsp;recognized by the "initiate," so what is&nbsp;the big deal? 
          Simply this, the seed has been planted, and if given the proper 
          attention by the devil's servants, human or otherwise, it can later be 
          developed into something. There are&nbsp;probably quite a few children 
          who would be foolish enough to try "Turkish Delight"</B> <B>or 
          something similar "just like in <I>The Chronicles of Narnia</I>."</B> 
          <B>As a matter of fact, kids <I>have</I> been given drugs in candy. 
          What an "interesting" lesson for the kiddies from Mr. Lewis!</B></P>
