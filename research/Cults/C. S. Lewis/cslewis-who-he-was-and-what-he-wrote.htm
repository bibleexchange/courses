<H2 align=center><BR>C. S. Lewis—Who He Was &amp; What He Wrote </H2>
<P>Due to the many questions and requests about C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, 
their books, and their subsequent videos and movies, we have added considerable 
information to our review section. The body of this review has been slightly 
updated and it has a very large addendum now attached containing much more of 
the kind of information that people are seeking in wanting to know just who C. 
S. Lewis was. But this is no longer a standalone review. Please visit the review 
on J. R. R. Tolkien also. The lives and ideas of the two men were so 
intertwined, as were their longstanding relationships, that a review on either 
must, at some points, include the other. As we have tried to keep duplication of 
information to a minimum, we suggest that if you are interested in a fuller 
picture of one man or the other, simply read both reviews.<BR>
<H3 align=center>C. S. Lewis—Who He Was &amp; What He Wrote</H3><BR>The name “C. 
S. Lewis” usually brings forth a number of accolades customarily used to 
describe him— “Brilliant, great Christian, great mind, great apologist, greatest 
lay champion in the 20th century.” His book sales, still today, remain over two 
million dollars annually, half of which come from the sales of his famous 
fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia.<BR><BR>Who is this man, and what were 
his beliefs that he should be touted as such a monumental Christian? C.S. Lewis 
(1898-1963) was a college professor, and author, and had his own radio broadcast 
for many years. He was an atheist, who converted to theism, and later professed 
Christianity. His most notable work, for which he has won much acclaim, is Mere 
Christianity. The author basically describes the book’s intent as an effort to 
set forth the fundamentals that form the basis of Christianity, excluding all 
doctrines and opinions that are not integral to Christianity (or, at least his 
definition of Christianity), thus, the name Mere Christianity. The exclusion of 
all such doctrines allows for the inclusion of all faiths.<BR><BR>This book has 
received raves from the liberal Christian press as a great apologetic work, but 
we should bear in mind as we review any apologetic work that not all apologetes 
are Christians. An apologete poses arguments that defend his view of what 
constitutes Christianity. In this endeavor, Lewis might well be unequaled in 
combining impressive logic, perceptive examples, and convincing object lessons 
to make his points. No one “hits the nail on the head” so squarely and so 
descriptively on issues of Christian morals and tenets, Christian growth, and 
explanations of difficult-to-understand theological concepts. Mere Christianity 
can almost leave a reader awe-struck as one continues to encounter such 
brilliant exegeses, and such keen insights into problems and resolutions in the 
Christian walk, in chapter after chapter. The book identifies so adeptly with 
temptations and thought processes that even the most serious Christian cannot 
help feeling an intimate association with the thoughts 
expressed.<BR><BR>However, unlike the Christian who seeks proof of what is true 
in the Word of God, Mr. Lewis proves everything through his own logical 
arguments and examples. Like some other apologists, he treats Christianity as a 
belief system, as opposed to other belief systems such as atheism or Buddhism. 
However, God’s Word never defines Christianity, as a belief system, or 
otherwise. For the Christian, it describes a relationship that rules his every 
moment and decision—a relationship that exists only by faith, as logic simply 
cannot take a man that far.<BR><BR>Again, contrary to what most people believe, 
men who argue the existence of God with atheists, especially publicly, are not 
all real believers, despite what they claim. Many are simply debaters and 
showmen. It is not a difficult debate to win, because there is a God, and the 
evidence is all around us. Proving the existence of God by logic is meaningless 
to the Christian. To a believer, God is not “something” that exists, He is a 
Person. We do not believe in His existence—we know Him, and not by logic, but 
through faith. We have no need to give time to such doubtful disputations, and 
the Bible teaches us to avoid them anyway. We need not follow too hard after 
those who engage, even successfully, in them.<BR><BR>Mere Christianity is 
basically a treatise on the rightness and wholesomeness of behavior of the 
individual as prescribed by Christian precepts. Mere Christianity continually 
instructs us that our thinking processes about our behavior are either becoming 
good or becoming evil, and that a creature with good thinking processes will go 
to heaven, and one with evil thinking processes will go to hell. It is 
stunningly logical, and keenly accurate and intuitive into proper behavior and 
improper behavior, man’s sinful reasons for improper behavior, and the logical 
reasons for proper Christian behavior. However, Christian behavior is not the 
point of Christianity. Absolute faith in, and a personal relationship with, 
Jesus Christ are the point.<BR><BR>Mere Christianity is focused upon who or what 
a Christian is. This idea is based on the premise, or, more correctly put, 
supposition of what a Christian is according to C. S. Lewis. His arguments are 
also based on another premise, or false assumption, that anyone, of any faith 
willing to be called Christian, is a Christian. This is the real basis of his 
mere or no-frills Christianity under which everyone ought to be herded into one 
corral. In Chapter 4 of What Christians Believe, book two of Mere Christianity, 
he shows which corral that is, as he includes even such churches as the Church 
of England of which he was a member, and the Church of Rome, both of which 
oppose Scripture as the final authority on spiritual truth. Any doctrine that 
conflicts with this doctrine of unity, he dismisses as unimportant theories of 
men. However, we must remind ourselves that his theories are based on dogmas 
that do not concur with Scripture, especially his theories about becoming a 
Christian. Chapter 5 of What Christians Believe, the second book in Mere 
Christianity, states, “There are three things that spread the Christ life to us: 
baptism, belief, and that mysterious action which different Christians call by 
different names — Holy Communion, the Mass, the Lord’s Supper.” Notice again his 
personal view of Christianity which was primarily based upon the dogmas of the 
Church of Rome — baptism and transubstantiation. Matthew warned us about such 
doctrinal views when he wrote, “Then understood they how that he bade them not 
beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the 
Sadducees.” Matt 16:12. Later, in Chapter 10 of Beyond Personality, book three 
of Mere Christianity, Lewis takes the “all under one roof” idea even further, as 
he writes, “There are people who do not accept the full Christian doctrine about 
Christ but who are so strongly attracted by Him that they are His in a much 
deeper sense than they themselves understand. There are people in other 
religions who are being led by God’s secret influence to concentrate on those 
parts of their religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus 
belong to Christ without knowing it. For example, a Buddhist of good will may be 
led to concentrate more and more on the Buddhist teaching about mercy and to 
leave in the background (though he might still say he believed) the Buddhist 
teaching on certain other points.” Scripture entertains no concept of belonging 
to Jesus without knowing Him or knowing of Him. This is strictly 
“Lewisology”.<BR><BR>Lewis appears to be the modern-day precursor of the current 
wave of Christian philosophers and psychologists who mention Christ but exalt 
Christian behavior. The effect of the teachings of this persuasion is to unite 
people under a belief system of Christian behavior patterns. It is to draw them 
to large groups or churches that help reinforce such behavior patterns, in the 
name of Christ, of course. (Else, how would those who wish to know Christ accept 
it?) Such persuasions also stress the importance of spreading Christian behavior 
patterns through activism, legislation and other means, propounding the idea 
that “we are all in this together and we are all the same.” However, we are not 
all the same. Some of us believe that what people need is Jesus, and not 
cohesion, whether Christian legislation ever gets passed. Often the idea of 
faith in Christ is proclaimed. It simply loses focus behind struggles over 
physical externals, and the call to unify because there is strength in numbers. 
God’s strength is not in numbers.<BR><BR>A by-product of such movements is that 
they band people into large, controllable, religious groups. The larger and 
fewer they are, the more controllable they are. Hence, we see the purpose of the 
attempts of today’s leaders to form massive inter-denominational, “Christian” 
organizations, and form friendships and alliances with those attempting to merge 
Christians into the Church of Rome.<BR><BR>Lewis was obviously an early 
initiator of what we see proliferating more widely now. Lewis’s Mere 
Christianity attempts to lend credulity to this process by insisting that 
Christianity, in its base and purest form, is simply a set of behavioral 
thinking patterns that excludes doctrine. Lewis’s argument for Christianity as a 
belief system set apart by certain behavior patterns can be seen in the fact 
that Mere Christianity was originally published as three books: The Case for 
Christianity, Christian Behavior and Beyond Personality. In the single volume, 
the first book is titled Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the 
Universe.<BR><BR>Lewis’s claim that doctrines are immaterial is an age-old ploy 
used to unite people under a “good, Christian” set of behaviors. The same 
purpose is shared by those who wish to combine all “Christian” faiths in efforts 
to combat sociological ills. The next step, which we already see taking place, 
is to unite them as one large religion or one large group that is far more 
controllable than many individual, dissimilar groups.<BR><BR>In this country, 
the behaviorists have combined efforts to merge everyone who uses the name 
“Christian” into one mass by forming popular movements which stress love, unity, 
and brotherhood. They also stress the world’s “desperate need” for such unity 
over the truth of Scripture. The desperate need in this world has always been 
for Jesus—not for membership in a world-wide brotherhood. These ideas may not 
pose so much confusion for older Christians who have a proper foundation, as 
they are urged to “embrace all faiths in love.” They may be made, though, to 
think it is sort of godly not to stand up for truth, as “not making waves” 
maintains a certain kind of peace. Yet, it is an expensive peace. When their 
children grow up under the “we are all the same” philosophy, it will be nearly 
impossible for them to discern real salvation, and a need for it, when they have 
already embraced “Christian behavior patterns” as faith.<BR><BR>Behavioral 
psychology is powerful, especially when intertwined with the term 
“Christianity”. Lewis proved it in his day, and others are using it with 
tremendous success in our generation. Today, we are often given accounts of 
extraordinary behavior which are used continually to thrill and heighten the 
emotions of the hearers. Once the story heightens the emotions, the hearer’s 
focus becomes riveted. The final effect, though, is not that the hearer realizes 
more fully his own sinfulness and lack of worth, but that he vicariously joins 
the struggle in the story, and associates himself in such a subconscious yet 
integral way, that the entire experience culminates in the hearer feeling pride 
in bearing the same name (Christian) as the noble character in the story 
(basically, being in the “in crowd”), or feeling a swelling heart (pride) at 
claiming to be a follower of Him Who has delivered someone in some excitingly 
miraculous manner. Anyway, Lewis seems to have been the first behaviorist in 
this century to make great inroads into more sincere Christian circles as a 
“great Christian mind” or “great Christian layman”, and Mere Christianity is the 
horse (methinks Trojan) that he rode in on.<BR><BR>Lewis cites many behavioral 
truths, but they do not equate to being redeemed. They simply equate to natural 
laws of behavior. For instance, he employs the idea that practice develops habit 
in describing the struggles to do right in the Christian life. The idea that 
doing things that we would rather not will help us to enjoy doing such deeds is 
not strictly a phenomenon unique to Christians. It is the same for the 
non-Christian. Practice cannot develop us into a Christian.<BR><BR>There are two 
ways to convince people of error. The first is to use complicated, deceptive 
logic. The second is to use open, profound, brilliant logic, which people easily 
understand, and readily agree with, but to use for its foundation faulty 
untested assumptions of truth. The second is generally the more successful, 
because people, once confronted with logically sound arguments, seldom backtrack 
to check the basis upon which they are founded. In this review, we look at 
several false premises found in Mere Christianity. Lewis is not original in his 
use of this technique, but he certainly has deftly used this approach in 
switching the foundation of Christianity itself to that of a behaviorist 
doctrine.<BR><BR>Something else that is very disturbing is that C. S. Lewis was 
not only quite familiar, by his own words, with the occult, but he even said 
that he had to get into the devil’s mind to write the Screwtape Letters, a book 
in which he describes the devil’s thinking and strategy. Although, such 
practices might be used by someone who proves God’s existence by logic, they are 
not the kind of activities and study that would be engaged in by someone who 
knows Jesus. Great Christian minds have no part with occult 
phenomena.<BR><BR>There are other writers today who claim to be Christian, but 
display a deep and thorough knowledge of the occult and all its workings. How 
can this be? A man cannot serve two masters, nor can he know Jesus and the devil 
intimately.<BR><BR>So, here we have a man who argues the existence of God, is 
involved in the occult, and writes occult books for children. Should we be 
surprised? “Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils 
also believe, and tremble.” James 2:19.<BR><BR>His insightful discussions of the 
Christian walk makes a Christian want to exclaim, “He is one of us!” Yet, he 
admits he is not. In Chapter 11 of Beyond Personality, describing truly 
regenerated Christians, he says, “And I strongly suspect (but how should I 
know?) that they recognize one another immediately and infallibly, across every 
barrier of colour, sex, class, age, and even of creeds.” The quote implies quite 
clearly, “I suspect they do, but not being one of them, I cannot know.” Did we 
say that not all apologetes are Christians?<BR><BR>This quote in Chapter 11 
comes right on the heels of the following quote. “Everyone knows about Evolution 
(though, of course, some educated people disbelieve it): everyone has been told 
that man has evolved from lower types of life.” Notice the capitalization of 
“evolution” in this quote, almost as if it were some theological 
being.<BR><BR>Lewis mentions a number of other ideas in Mere Christianity that 
do not agree with Scripture. In Chapter 2 of Right and Wrong as a Clue to the 
Meaning of the Universe we find, “But surely the reason that we do not execute 
witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did. . .we would 
all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy quislings 
did.” However, God believes in witches because His Word tells us so. It may do 
us well to bear in mind Lewis’s published opinions on the occult when we move on 
to his books for children and the effects that they might have on those 
children.<BR><BR>In Chapter 9 of Beyond Personality, we find purgatory, the old 
Catholic escape clause, where man works off his sin debt after death. The author 
writes as if Jesus were speaking, “Whatever suffering it may cost you in your 
earthly life, whatever inconceivable purification it may cost you after death, 
whatever it costs Me, I will never rest, nor let you rest, until you are 
literally perfect. . .” Actually, Lewis sounds much more like his contemporary, 
Bishop Sheen than a Bible-believing Christian.<BR><BR>In Chapter 1 of Beyond 
Personality we find, “Everyone reads, everyone hears things discussed. 
Consequently, if you do not listen to Theology, that will not mean that you have 
no ideas about God. It will mean that you have a lot of wrong ones — bad, 
muddled, out-of-date ideas.” There is no mention in the book of getting ideas 
about God through reading His Word, or through praying for such wisdom. The only 
suggested sources for such knowledge are theological think-tanks.<BR><BR>Why 
read Mere Christianity at all? A discerning Christian will be able to sift 
through it, and sort much of the error, but if we want to know what real 
Christianity is all about, why not go to the Source of Christianity, and read 
what He has to say about it? Oh, how foolish man is, to continually seek some 
other man’s definition of God.<BR><BR>Let us not forget that this man, who has 
tried very hard to make us feel like he is one of us, has written a number of 
books that our children will very likely be reading if he has convinced 
us.<BR><BR>Let’s look at some of those books for children. Lewis’s most famous 
fictional series for children, is the Chronicles of Narnia. Although adults are 
often discerning when they read, children seldom are. Hence, fictional 
children’s books can be a very dangerous commodity. When there are poisonous 
philosophies in a book, they are generally woven into an exciting story. The 
child is enthralled with the story and swallows the philosophies without knowing 
that they are even there. If you are trying to rear good children, and you are 
seeing atypical results, check what your children are reading. It is there that 
you will usually find the problem.<BR><BR>The Chronicles of Narnia is a 
collection of seven fantasy stories. The jacket cover says, “Here is your 
passport to a most extraordinary excursion into magical lands and enchanted 
happenings. If you’ve never been to Narnia, you can enter it for the first time 
with any of the books below . . .”<BR><BR>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 
is the first in this “Christian” series of occult books for children. The title, 
itself, should be a tip off to a discerning Christian. How can a Christian book 
have such an occult label?<BR><BR>The story involves four children who step 
through a magic wardrobe into the occult land of Narnia. Narnia is populated by 
talking animals who have equal status with humans. (Sounds like New Age?) The 
land of Narnia is ruled by the White Witch who makes the land always to be 
winter. The land is populated with ghouls, werewolves and all manner of evil 
creatures siding with the witch. The witch has powerful magical powers and is 
able to turn all of her enemies into stone. The wicked witch tricks one of the 
children into coming over to her side, and the other children must rescue 
him.<BR><BR>Aslan, a huge lion and the son of the great emperor of the north, is 
the only one who can set things right in Narnia. He negotiates with the witch 
for the salvation of one of the children. He must die to save the child. 
However, he does not stay dead, he has a resurrection and saves the day. Aslan 
responds to the question of what it all means with, “It means that though the 
Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not 
know.” Eventually, the White Witch is destroyed and spring returns to 
Narnia.<BR><BR>Obviously, there is a salvation message in all of that, but is it 
the message of Jesus Christ? Obviously not. It is the salvation message of an 
occult, New Age lion that has, not only more powers than a human, but enough 
power to rival our Savior in the eyes of young readers.<BR><BR>Rather than wade 
through the entire series, we will skip ahead to the last book in the series, 
The Last Battle. This is the story of how evil came to Narnia, and how Aslan led 
his people to a glorious new paradise. It is the story of the confrontation 
between Tash (Satan) and Aslan (Jesus).<BR><BR>The book opens with one of its 
excellent lessons on how to manipulate and exploit another for one’s own 
benefit. This is accomplished by a conversation between and ape (Shift) and a 
donkey (Puzzle) that is not as smart as the ape. The ape uses a number of 
instances of faulty logic and parallelisms to convince the donkey that the best 
course of action would be to simply trust him (the ape), and, thereby, of 
course, fulfill his whims and desires (for the donkey’s good, of course.) This 
is just the sort of technique that you will find an older brother or sister 
using on a younger one the day after they have read it, and simply wonder how 
they figured out how to do such a thing. Throughout the course of the book, the 
ape uses these manipulative routines to make the donkey do anything he wants him 
to do. (Tell me your children won’t be anxious to try that out on 
someone!)<BR><BR>The story culminates in a final showdown between Tash and 
Aslan. Of course, Aslan triumphs over evil, the world of Narnia comes to an end, 
and Aslan takes many into Paradise (heaven).<BR><BR>The disturbing part of all 
this is who is allowed to go to Paradise (heaven). At the end of the book a 
servant of Tash (Satan), who made it into Paradise says, “I overcame my fear and 
questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord is it then true, as the Ape said, 
that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but his 
wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, 
but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to 
him, for I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can 
be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore if any 
man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oath’s sake, it is by me that he has 
truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him. And if any man 
do a cruelty in my name, then though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he 
serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand, Child? I said, 
Lord, thou knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for truth constrained 
me), Yes I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, 
unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so 
truly. For all find what they truly seek.”<BR><BR>In the book, the children 
actually do die and enter heaven. Of course, as we can see from the quoted 
passage, all sorts of creatures, both good and evil, do the same. Some people 
praise this book as an allegory of the gospel, but upon a closer look, it is not 
intended to bring one to Christ at all. It is simply a very misleading occult, 
New Age, fantasy tale, replete with supernaturally-powered animals, and the evil 
philosophy that regardless of how evil we are, we all have that spark of 
goodness in us for which God will surely take us to heaven.<BR><BR>Besides all 
the very apparent evil in the book—witches, magic, spells, demons, and more, 
there are several serious problems which can and will cause damage to our 
children.<BR><BR>A child reading the book, is, as advertised, “stepping into 
another world”—a world of fantasy. Lewis, like Disney, was a New Ager. He built 
entire surrealistic worlds for our children to escape into—escape from reality 
and from real life. These worlds invariably contain creatures of every sort 
endearing our children, performing heroic feats, and displaying often greater 
powers than our Savior displayed when He was on earth. Who will our children 
most readily identify as having awesome power—Lewis characters, Disney 
characters, some time-space traveling hero, or the almighty Jesus? Is it any 
wonder that we have a very difficult time convincing our children to give their 
all to Someone so far down the totem pole of their experience? Why should we 
cloud our children’s minds with meaningless fantasies which can, at their very 
best, only result in doubts and confusions about real spiritual things, and more 
seriously, open the floodgates of their minds to the advancing waves of 
captivating fantasies designed to introduce them to the world of Satan and the 
occult.<BR><BR>These Chronicles would be quite a misleading allegory. As we 
said, in the first book Aslan negotiated with Satan. Truly, our God has never 
needed to negotiate with His creation-turned-evil. Jesus did not negotiate with 
Satan before He went to the cross to die for mankind. It was foreordained before 
the foundation of the world!<BR><BR>If they were allegorical, these stories 
would be a faulty allegory because they imply a salvation by works rather than 
faith. What is worse, we have seen that children are taught that one can even be 
saved for evil works if they are done wholeheartedly. Certainly, one cannot 
serve Satan and count it as service for Christ, and then plead ignorance and 
enter heaven. The Bible says, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for 
there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be 
saved.” Acts 4:12.<BR><BR>Lastly, It would be better never to make the claim of 
allegory. The claim, itself, serves only to condemn the work as blasphemy. 
Romans 1:21-25 tells us, “Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him 
not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and 
their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became 
fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to 
corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. 
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own 
hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: who changed the truth 
of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, 
who is blessed for ever. Amen.” You see, God commands that man never depict Him, 
the Divine Creator of the entire universe, as some beast walking around on all 
fours, named Aslan or otherwise. He also commands us never to view Him in such a 
comparatively despicable manner. What does this do to an impressionable mind? 
(See our Tolkien review for more on this.) Isaiah 5:20 says, “Woe unto them that 
call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for 
darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” We need to be 
careful when we use the word “allegory” because God will hold us accountable for 
what we call Christian.<BR><BR>We can never recommend these books for young 
people. Some people insist that they are simply entertainment, but entertainment 
at what price? Shall we give the minds of our children to C. S. Lewis because he 
makes some compelling arguments for Christianity as an earthly value system? His 
Christianity is one of behavior. It is one in which the Bible is not the final 
authority. It is one that makes no mention of repentance. It is one that does 
not need the blood of Christ. It is one that embraces people of all faiths, 
whether or not they know Christ, as long as they have acceptable works. It is 
one that denies the reality of occult influences such as witches. Is this the 
kind of mentor that we want for our children?<BR><B>****</B><BR>We thought that 
some of our readers might be interested in the following testimonial. It 
contains some ideas about what we have always thought were prime sources of 
nightmares, unexplained fears and spiritual confusion in 
children.<BR><B>****</B><BR>Just a quick “thank You”. We are enjoying all the 
back issues we ordered and are sharing them with friends.<BR><BR>We are so 
thankful for all the Scripture verses in every article. The topics are 
challenging and how do you argue with God’s Word?<BR><BR>We’ve added the 
“Lessons” section to our family devotions. Believe it or not, the children are 
enjoying these lessons and desiring to work on our trouble areas. It’s freeing 
to know exactly what God expects from us.<BR><BR>You mentioned you’re going to 
do a book review on C. S. Lewis. I’d like to share an experience we 
had.<BR><BR>Several years back while attending a certain church, we allowed our 
children to attend children’s church for a short span of time.<BR><BR>We made 
the mistake of not following through and finding out what was being 
taught.<BR><BR>Our daughter, about seven at the time, started having nightmares. 
One night was so bad she screamed hysterically as she heard us coming up the 
stairs, and fought us as we tried to wake her and comfort her. I have never seen 
a child so terrified.<BR><BR>After calming her down and praying for her, she 
told us her nightmare: (I cannot remember it all, but here is the gist of it.) A 
witch was trying to push her down into a black pit and she pointed to where the 
pit was in her bedroom floor. Upon further questioning we found out it came from 
her watching The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in children’s church. We took 
all this to our Heavenly Father Who has all power over darkness and our daughter 
did not have any more dreams of that nature until this past summer when friends 
came to spend the weekend.<BR><BR>Her dream was not as frightening as before, 
but it had the same demonic twist. We came to find out that their daughter had 
watched The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe just before they came to our 
house.<BR><BR>As we study Scripture, we see Jesus healing demonic people (or 
delivering) from their sin, but I don’t see that He used occult symbols to share 
the gospel. I Cor 1:21 says, “For after that in the wisdom of God the world by 
wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them 
that believe.”<BR><BR>Why do we have to borrow the world’s ways when God tells 
us exactly how He wants it done?<BR><BR>I read a quote of C. S. Lewis once where 
he said he had an infatuation with the occult. Eph 5:12 answers that “It is a 
shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in 
secret.”<BR><BR>Sorry this got kind of lengthy, but I hoped it might help. Keep 
pressing on in the Lord. You are in our prayers.<BR>Montana<BR><B>****</B><BR>We 
know that some people will scoff that these fantasies are “not hurting anything 
or anyone”. We will leave that decision up to you 
parents.<BR><BR><B>ADDENDUM</B><BR><BR>We receive considerable response and many 
thanks on our book reviews. However, in particular the responses that we have 
received over the last couple of years seem to indicate that we were not really 
specific enough or detailed enough in our treatment of C. S. Lewis. We thought 
that the following addendum would be an appropriate addition to the review on 
the works of C. S. Lewis. Though we have been blessed by the many parents who 
have thanked us for exposing the real side of C. S. Lewis, it has also become 
obvious, that in revealing only the barest of necessities, we may have done a 
disservice to many who seem not to understand what could make us feel that 
Lewis, his books and their subsequent films are not healthy fare, especially for 
children.<BR><BR>Let me begin with the great “Christian” lie about The 
Chronicles of Narnia. Over the years we have often received correspondence 
asking how we can write a review of C. S. Lewis and be so ignorant as to not 
know that “scholars” have said that The Chronicles of Narnia is a Christian 
allegory. Well, we do know that “scholars” have said as much. However, even 
though we stated it in our original review, we will state it again here. C. S. 
Lewis, himself, denied that this was so. Our question to any such “scholars” is, 
Why are they promoting this falsehood? We do notice that this idea emanates 
generally from ecumenical sources, and therefore assume that they feel that it 
helps their cause of bringing Christians back under the papacy. The following 
quotes sum up the feelings of C. S. Lewis about the allegorical status of the 
Chronicles of Narnia.<BR><BR>Lewis was a member of a literary group called The 
Inklings. The following quote is from The Inklings Handbook, a 
historical/biographical work by a couple of fellows enchanted by the Inklings. 
“CSL [Lewis], however, argued strongly that the Chronicles of Narnia should not 
be viewed as an allegory like Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, though he 
acknowledged the intentional parallels between the main features of Christian 
teaching and the Chronicles, not least in the unambigously supernatural 
Christ-symbol, Aslan the Lion.”<BR><BR>Again from The Inklings Handbook—“The 
earliest hints of Narnia come very early in CSL’s life, long before he became a 
Christian; the common assumption that he wrote the whole series as an extended 
allegory of the Christian faith, with a strong evangelistic motive, is one that 
CSL always denied and which is not borne out by the facts.”<BR><BR>So, who are 
we to believe—scholars who wish to justify their untenable positions favoring 
exploration into occultism, or the author himself? By the way, there is very 
good reason for Lewis’ denial. That is why our original review speaks to this 
argument on the basis of the content in question. We have already examined the 
passage regarding the servant of Tash (Satan) being in paradise and its 
explanation—its idea being that just because God turns the works of His enemies 
to His own advantage, He will also warmly receive those enemies into heaven. It 
is quite easy to expose this as neither scriptural nor Christian to anyone who 
has ever spent any time in the Bible.<BR><BR>Lewis knew that the work was no 
where near parallel to sound theology, and he knew that in that day people were 
not so willing to accept such surreal imaginations as “Christian.” He knew that 
it was much too early to present his New Age, miracle-working animals as actual 
doctrine, such as they are being hailed today. Aslan and Tash are obvious New 
Age manifestations, even without being placed within any context of religion. 
Aslan is not a Christ as the authors of The Inklings Handbook would too eagerly 
suggest. He is a hermaphrodite image—an intangible copy—designed to capture 
hearts and minds—the hearts that God says He wants to be captured only by 
Himself.<BR><BR>The Screwtape Letters is a book written by Lewis and idealized 
as an instructional work about how the devil thinks and works in the lives of 
men. It is set in a series of letters from one demon, Uncle Screwtape, to his 
nephew, Wormwood. Wormwood’s charge is a human who has become a Christian. The 
letters contain Screwtape’s instructions on how to return the human to the 
devil’s camp and ownership. Though it is billed as an instructional work for the 
Christian, it seems much more an instructional work for the New Age ecumenical 
echelons of this generation.<BR><BR>Consider the following advice from Screwtape 
to his nephew. “I have great hopes that we shall learn in due time how to 
emotionalise and mythologixe their [humans] science to such an extent that what 
is in effect, a belief in us [demons] (though not under that name) will creep in 
while the human mind remains closed to belief in the Enemy [Christ]. The ‘Life 
Force’, the worship of sex, and some aspects of Psychoanalysis, may here prove 
useful. If once we can produce our perfect work—the Materialist Magician, the 
man, not using, but veritably worshipping, what he vaguely calls ‘Forces’ while 
denying the existence of ‘spirits’—then the end of the war will be in sight.” 
Lewis is saying that the strategy involved here in bringing Christians under the 
control of the devil is to get them enthused about ‘forces’ while not 
recognizing these ‘forces’ as demonic spirits or ideas.<BR><BR>Is not this 
exactly what is being done right now through the movie versions of the works of 
Lewis and Tolkien. Was it not also accomplished with their books. Is not further 
cover given to this strategy by “scholars” who help hide the truth about this 
spiritual attack by calling it “Christian allegory”? And have not Lewis’ own 
works been used in this very way? Have not the works of Lewis and Tolkien simply 
paved the way to the widespread acceptance of all things Harry Potter? Is it not 
even more ludicrous that some “scholars” would warn us about the demonism and 
witchcraft of Harry Potter, and inform us that the demonism and witchcraft of 
Lewis and Tolkien can be made an integral part of our Christian faith? Notice 
how the idea of ‘forces’ and morphodites has descended from the works of the 
Inklings into an entire culture of Star Wars imaginative nonsense.<BR><BR>Is 
this business about allegories really good counsel? It comes from the right 
sources and movements. These people are pro-life. They are conservatives. They 
are in the “Christian government” movements. However, here is what Screwtape 
says. “Once you have made the World an end, and faith a means, you have almost 
won your man, and it makes very little difference what kind of worldly end he is 
pursuing. Provided that meetings, pamphlets, policies, movements, causes, and 
crusades, matter more to him than prayers and sacraments and charity, he is 
ours—and the more ‘religious’ (on those terms) the more securely ours. I could 
show you a pretty cageful down here.” And again, “On the other hand, we do want, 
and want very much, to make men treat Christianity as a means; preferably, of 
course, as a means to their own advancement, but, failing that, as a means to 
anything—even social justice. The thing to do is to get a man at first to value 
social justice as a thing which the Enemy [God] demands, and then work him on to 
the stage at which he values Christianity because it may produce social 
justice.”<BR><BR>This is very interesting. It reads like a playbook for sending 
people to a lost eternity. Just keep them busy with movements, causes and 
“scholars.” Then interest them in adventure and occultism masquerading as 
“forces.” And, finally, to put the icing on the cake, add some mental 
justification. Interest and involve them in social just and “Christian” 
government as much or more than they are interested in real Christianity (which 
does not involve the other two at all, even according to Lewis). After all, it 
is so easy to ignore the sin of not daily, even hourly, living for God, when we 
can make ourselves constantly aware of some good thing that we see ourselves 
doing.<BR><BR>Can we not speculate that this playbook has been followed 
religiously with an adverse spiritual effect on those in our society? Have we 
not been inundated with Lewis-Tolkien type fantasy from the heathen-owned 
publishing industry? Has not Hollywood reproduced many of them in a more 
captivating medium of film? Has it not followed up with unnumbered versions of 
Star Wars type creatures, Terminators, and the like? And have not social issues 
and “Christian” government become the causes celebres of today’s churches and 
Christian circles. Even the nation’s first politicians are being made over into 
Christians. These things all make us feel quite righteous about our “stand,” but 
our nation continues to spiral downward. Could it be that Screwtape’s creator 
has penned a plan to convince us to replace our concern for personal holiness 
with a concern for national righteousness?<BR><BR>But maybe we should evaluate 
what we view and what we read when we think about our righteousness. Psalms 
101:3 says, “I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of 
them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.” Does Hollywood love the Lord 
Jesus Christ, or do they turn aside? Should we view those works and let those 
images cleave to our minds? What about the witches, demons, and fantasy 
creatures in books? Should those images cleave to us? If C. S. Lewis thinks that 
these things are not good for us, why did he write them for our children? Could 
it be that the people who understand him know that he is instructing in the ways 
of corruption? Are the children of the world wiser than the children of light in 
this matter also?<BR><BR>It is truly baffling that any real Christian should 
think that Lewis was a Christian. It seems that most have only heard the 
advertising rhetoric, but few have taken the time to read the works that expose 
his personal views or biographical works chronicling his habits. Lewis did not 
consider all of the Bible the inerrant Word of God (Reflections on the Psalms). 
He did not believe that faith in Jesus Christ was all that was necessary for 
salvation (Screwtape Letters). He believed that one could lose one’s faith in a 
moment through commission of a mortal sin (Screwtape Letters). He believed in 
Limbo as a place (neither heaven nor hell) of temporary punishment (Screwtape 
Letters). He believed that church sacraments are part of salvation (Mere 
Christianity, Screwtape Letters). He believed that pagans may belong to Christ 
without knowing it (Mere Christianity). He had a participating interest in the 
occult (The Inklings Handbook). And, regardless of his reputation and his “great 
swelling words,” his outlook on death was not that of a Christian. This from C. 
S. Lewis, A Biography: “Like many (most?) religious people, Lewis was profoundly 
afraid of death. His dread of it, when in the midst of life, had been almost 
pathological and obsessive. Physical extinction was a perpetual nightmare to him 
and, whatever his theological convictions and hopes, he was unable, before his 
wife’s death, to reconcile himself to the transition which death must inevitably 
entail.”<BR><BR>The idea of Lewis as a “great Christian mind” has been 
thoroughly impressed upon so many for so long that he has become a very real 
“angel of light.” It was Hitler who said, “If you tell a lie often enough and 
long enough, the people will believe it.” So, now that we know what The 
Chronicles of Narnia is not (a Christian allegory), what is it? The concept of 
God’s enemies going to heaven is not theologically sound, and is by no means 
Christian. It is theosophical. Theology is the study of relating to God. 
Theosophy is the study of relating to God’s opposite or archenemy. The 
Chronicles is full of theosophical beliefs. The idea that God’s enemies go to 
heaven is a distinct theosophical tenet. This only makes sense. Those who serve 
and worship the devil do not expect to spend eternity in hellfire and brimstone 
for doing so.<BR><BR>Most theosophy is thrust upon the world today as its 
opposite—theology. The reason is obvious. Most people would not accept it for 
what is at face value, but disguised as religion, church, faith, etc, it is 
readily acceptable to those who have less care for being discerning. The 
American Theosophical Society met in 1901 to discuss how to plan and implement 
the goal of propagating theosophy throughout this nation and the world. The 
conclusion drafted at that convention stated that such propagation was only 
possible through the churches—that theosophical values must be disguised as 
Christian or religious to be accepted popularly. So what are we being taught by 
these scholars that tell us that all this theosophy is actually 
Christian?<BR><BR>And what about Lewis? Are we still not ready to believe his 
connection to the occult? Why? It is public fact. The following excerpt from a 
letter to a religious magazine.<BR><BR>“Kudos to Roberta green for deftly 
summarizing the trouble with Harry Potter. C. S. Lewis himself experienced the 
dangers of “crossing the line” into obsession with the occult. In Surprised by 
Joy, he writes that, partly because of a school matron who dabbled in the 
occult, “for the first time, there burst upon me the idea that there might be 
real marvels all about us, that the visible world might be only a curtain to 
conceal huge realms uncharted by my very simple theology. And that started in me 
something with which, on and off, I have had plenty of trouble since—the desire 
for the preternatural, simply as such the passion for the Occult. Not everyone 
has this disease; those who have it will know what I mean. It is a spiritual 
lust; and like the lust of the body it has the fatal power of making everything 
else in the wold seem uninteresting while it lasts.”<BR><BR>Some children will 
read Harry Potter and never struggle with such a lust; but for others, it will 
open the door for a maleficent obsession. After reading the first Harry Potter 
novel, I decided that our children do not need that door opened, not even a 
crack.<BR><BR>How about something even more public? In the Screwtape Letters, 
Lewis admittedly takes his reader on a tour of the devil’s mind. This is an area 
of study strictly forbidden by the Bible. This is a study that no Christian 
mind, even a mind as “great” as that of C. S. Lewis is allowed to make in the 
service of God. Pray tell, is this a trip theological or theosophical? Will God 
condone such a trip as long as “scholars” tell us that it came from a “great 
Christian mind”?<BR><BR>Should there be any doubt about Lewis’ theosophism or 
his activity in occultism? Consider the company he kept. He was a star member of 
The Inklings. The Inklings was a literary group that met in taverns to trade 
ideas and discuss how their work should impact society. Many had theosophical 
affiliations, not the least of which was Aleister Crowley, member of the Order 
of the Golden Dawn, who called himself “The Great Beast” and “the wickedest man 
alive.” Charles Williams also became deeply involved in witchcraft and theosophy 
because he was intrigued by its power. Author after author in the group was 
fascinated by pre-Christian paganism, and they credit the ideas they find in 
pre-Christian paganism as the source of much of the thought expressed in their 
works. Isn’t this a little strange for Christian authors? There was plenty of 
pre-Christian theism available to be learned. There are plenty of good thoughts 
and ideas in the Old Testament, and I have seen many of them used as sources for 
some very good reading material. Of course, none of them has been as mesmerizing 
(nor as confusing) as the works of the Inklings, especially those of Lewis and 
Tolkien. For much more information on the Inklings, see our review on 
Tolkien.<BR><BR>Think about this for a moment. In Mere Christianity Lewis tells 
us Christians recognize each other, but he speaks about them—not in an inclusive 
manner, but more as those people—not including himself among them. He also 
published a considerable amount of fantasy full of occult overtones, topped off 
with a major theosophical doctrine. Knowing that he denied that his fantasy was 
Christian allegory, and realizing that theosophists can also recognize each 
other by their own beliefs and works, was Lewis getting across who he was to the 
people familiar with this stuff? Also, is it any wonder that we receive so many 
reports of young children having continual nightmares and demonic type 
experiences after viewing one Lewis’ “allegorical” works? Lewis’ work has been 
compared as “white magic” to Harry Potter’s “black magic.” Is there any white 
magic to God? What does His Word say about all magic? Are Lewis’ magic, demons, 
ogres, monsters, curses, gods, fairies and illusions really pointing people 
toward God? The Bible says, “I will put no evil thing before mine eye.” What are 
we doing reading and watching such things? What is worse, what are we doing to 
our children?<BR><BR>As we said, C. S. Lewis and J. R. Tolkien are just the 
first steps toward Harry Potter and beyond. And how long shall we tolerate all 
the surreal video games corrupting our children? These games are literally 
destroying the proper thinking ability in our young people. This is fact, not a 
lone idea from a Christian voice crying in the wilderness. This is factual 
evidence from studies done by heathen government and medical agencies, endorsed 
by non-Christian psychiatrists and psychologists across the nation. Do the 
research. Find out what games are doing to your children. These games are 
extremely harmful to even adult minds. Also, notice how closely these games 
parallel the books and movies originating from Lewis, Tolkien and others like 
them.<BR><BR>As an aside, J. R. Tolkein was a contemporary of Lewis, and 
received considerable mentoring from him. Tolkein’s works are so similar to 
those of Lewis that, if they had all been published under the same name, few 
would ever know the difference. They are filled with the same occultism, black 
magic, and theosophist views. They also were never purported to be allegorical 
by their author. Tolkein was a Catholic, so he knew of no salvation by faith in 
Christ. Having been Catholic, I can attest through my own experience as well as 
by the last papal encyclical, that the Catholic church teaches of no salvation 
other than through itself. So much for scholars and their 
allegories.<BR><BR>Ecclesiastes 1:9 says, “The thing that hath been, it is that 
which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is 
no new thing under the sun.” The theosophist’s game is not original. It has been 
around as long as man. And the admonishment of Jesus in Luke 16:8 is as good for 
today as it was for the day when He said, “. . . for the children of this world 
are in their generation wiser than the children of light.”<BR><BR>One last 
question—if, in Jesus’ day, the children of light were the Jews, and many Jews 
did not go to heaven (remember, the idea that those Pharisees who murdered Jesus 
went to heaven is a theosophical plank), then how many in our churches today are 
bound for brimstone because they have glibly accepted false doctrines? How many 
are being anxiously awaited by Screwtape? How many are sitting in the place 
where the theosophist scholars have gone to teach them—the church. “The church” 
is where the Pharisees taught “God’s people”—the people who said “Lord, Lord,” 
and He said, “I never knew you.” The Pharisees were scholars. Does education 
make truth? Are we not responsible to discern what we are taught? Are scholars 
teaching what is right—or teaching what is popular? Are we being taught that the 
pure in heart shall see God, or are we being offered garbage packaged as 
Christian parallelism? The path parallel to the narrow way leads to destruction. 
Do not take my word for it. How much time have you spent alone with God’s Word 
allowing the Holy Spirit to teach you the difference? Eternity hangs in the 
balance. He knows the pure in heart.<BR>
