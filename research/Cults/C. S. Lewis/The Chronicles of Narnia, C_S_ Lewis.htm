        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><B>C. S. Lewis' most famous books are perhaps the <I>Chronicles of 
          Narnia</I>, his occult, fantasy books for children. &nbsp;In them he 
          went to great lengths to glorify and promote many occult ideas. 
          &nbsp;While some maintain that the spiritual idea behind the fantasy 
          is the truth of scripture, the cold hard facts point in the completely 
          opposite direction. &nbsp;He was introducing children to witchcraft 
          through esoteric (hidden meanings) writings. Let's take a closer 
          look.</B> </P>
          <P><B>First of all, it is necessary to get some background in order to 
          see where C. S. Lewis was headed with his "fantasy" stories. 
          &nbsp;Lewis was good friends with Charles Williams and J.R.R. Tolkien 
          (author of the occultic <I>Lord of the Rings Trilogy</I>). &nbsp;All 
          three were part of a group of writers called the <IMG height=266 
          src="The Chronicles of Narnia, C_S_ Lewis_files/lewispub.jpg" 
          width=175 align=right>"Inklings." &nbsp;Of this group, one friend felt 
          that Williams, and maybe Tolkien, were the two that influenced Lewis' 
          thinking the most. Williams, a professing Christian, was especially 
          close to him and taught Lewis the "white witchcraft" delusion of being 
          able to take someone's pain for them and suffer it in one's own body. 
          &nbsp;They cast this "talent" in a Christian light, and Lewis later 
          claimed to have this ability and to have used it on behalf of his 
          wife. (1) </B><FONT color=#ff0000><B><FONT color=#990000>Exodus 22:18 
          Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</FONT></B></FONT> <FONT 
          color=#990000>&nbsp; <B>Ephesians 4:27 Neither give place to the 
          devil. </B></FONT></P>
          <P><B>The writings of these three Inklings are so overt in mixing 
          paganism with alleged Christianity, that one reprobate has even 
          suggested them as a shining example for bringing neo-paganism and 
          Christianity together "peacefully!" </B><A 
          href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/7734/xnpaglit.htm"><B>http://www.geocities.com/Athens/7734/xnpaglit.htm</B></A> 
          </P>
          <P><B>Lewis and Williams also drank and smoked together (2) which is 
          hardly surprising considering how often drinking wine and strong drink 
          is mentioned in Lewis' "children's" books! </B><FONT

          mocker, strong drink <I>is</I> raging: and whosoever is deceived 
          thereby is not wise.</FONT></B></FONT><B> &nbsp;(Photo: One of Lewis' 
          favorite pubs, "The Eagle and Child," familiarly known as "The Bird 
          and Baby." See footnote 2a for further information and 
          implications.)</B> </P>
          <P><B>Charles Williams was also a member of the highly devilsh, 
          Qabalistic, "Order of the Golden Dawn," and was an active member for 
          several years. (The "Order of the Golden Dawn" was primarily made up 
          of mystical "christians" and former followers of Madame Blavatsky that 
          still adhered to Luciferianism.) A number of his works reflect this. 
          "<I>Shadows of Ecstasy </I>pulsates with the Hermetic dictum, 'as 
          above, so below.' <I>War in Heaven </I>concerns the Grail, <I>Many 
          Dimensions </I>the Philosopher's Stone, and <I>The Place of the 
          Lion</I> the Platonic archetypes. We are confronted with the Tarot 
          deck in <I>The Greater Trumps</I>, necromancey in <I>All Hallow's 
          Eve</I>, and ghosts, witchcraft, and damnation in <I>Descent into 
          Hell</I>." &nbsp;(3) &nbsp;We are warned in scripture that the friends 
          we choose can influence us to evil, yet Lewis chose this blatantly 
          ungodly man for his close friend. </B><FONT color=#ff0000><B><FONT 
          color=#990000>Proverbs 22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and 
          with a furious man thou shalt not go: 25 Lest thou learn his ways, and 
          get a snare to thy soul.</FONT> </B></FONT><B>Lewis not only got a 
          snare to his own soul, he has tried to pass it on to children!</B> 
</P>
          <P><B>Lewis and Williams are said to have helped to keep the 
          Luciferian concept of the Holy Grail alive. "The symbol of the Grail 
          as a mysterious object of search and as the source of the ultimate 
          mystical, or even physical, experience has persisted into the present 
          century in the novels of Charles Williams, C.S. Lewis..."(4) 
          &nbsp;Lewis and his two writer&nbsp;buddies, Williams and J.R.R 
          Tolkien, of the infamous <I>Inklings</I>, appear to be strongly 
          connected with the Priory of Sion mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau; 
          otherwise known as the so-called "holy bloodline" or "Merovingian" 
          mystery which claims that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were wed, 
          had children and that their descendants became the rightful royalty of 
          Europe, particularly France and Scotland. (5) &nbsp;It would hardly be 
          surprising that Lewis would believe this blasphemous, repulsive lie 
          since he had such a high regard for myths and had studied them so 
          extensively. [See quote above.] &nbsp;The so-called "holy bloodline" 
          is also the same as or symbolized by the "holy grail." &nbsp;</B> </P>
          <P><B>Some of the strange story lines which Lewis "invented" for his 
          stories may not be so strange when compared with the mythology that 
          surrounds the Priory of Sion mystery. &nbsp;The simple fact that plain 
          English school children could actually be royalty smacks of 
          the&nbsp;hidden identity of the members of the "holy bloodline" today 
          and for many years past. &nbsp;Also, we find that "Prince 
          Caspian"marries a wife who has "the blood of the stars" in her veins.

                <P><B>From the Encyclopedia Britannica, 1963 edition, vol. 16, 
                p.119; "a town and episcopal see of the province of Terni, 
                region of Umbria, Italy...picturesquely situated on a lofty rock 
                (787 ft.)...taken by the Romans in 299 B.C....According to some 
                author, the emperor Nerva was born at Narnia. &nbsp;The town 
                played a considerable part in military history. &nbsp;In the 
                middle ages Narni was under papal power..." It is also the 
                geographic center of Italy. &nbsp;</B></P>
                <P><B>A writer at factmonster.com says: "Narnia" was in fact the 
                name of an ancient Roman colony in central Italy, named for the 
                river Nar (now Nera). It has been said that Lewis discovered the 
                name in an atlas as a child, though he may also have come across 
                mention of the city in his university studies. By chance, the 
                modern-day town of Narni (as it is now known) honors a local 
                saint known as "Blessed Lucy of Narnia." Today the town's 
                Cathedral of Narnia adjoins a shrine to this St. Lucy. [<A 
                href="http://www.factmonster.com/spot/narnia-lookback.html">Read 
                it.</A>]</B></P>
                <P><B>There's almost too much coincidence here to believe it was 
                all a grand accident, especially considering Lewis' advanced 
                scholarship (by today's standards).</B></P>
                <P><B>See <A

                <P><B>Curiouser still...<BR>Narni was the site of a religious 
                underground city which included a place where "heretics" were 
                tortured during the Inquisition. <A 
                href="http://www.narnisotterranea.it/eng/index2.htm">Sotterrenea</A> 
                Lewis would not have known about this since it was officially 
                discovered only 20 years ago.</B></P>
                <P><B>Interestingly, the name Pevensie possibly comes from 
                Pevensey Castle in the south of England which was built by 
                Romans also. (6 for links)</B></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

          <P>&nbsp;</P>
          <P>&nbsp;</P>
          <P><B>Add to this the fact that Narnia is not a "make believe" place 
          somewhere in Lewis' imagination, but an actual town that existed in 
          Italy (later called Narni), and you can see that Lewis may have been 
          writing about esoteric things that he believed to be true. Strangely 
          enough, the Priory of Sion lie is said to have resurfaced during the 
          Middle Ages in Calabria, Italy; and then moved to France! (5) 
          &nbsp;(The existence of a Narnia as a real place on earth may account 
          for Lewis' use of the expression "What on earth..." in the 
          <I>Chronicles</I> thus placing all this fantastic story line soundly 
          on our planet. &nbsp;This then makes sense to those in witchcraft and 
          paganism who believe the myths and idolatry from which he gleaned his 
          plots, characters, etc. It is the doctrine of an invisible reality 
          that can&nbsp;only be reached through magical means.) &nbsp;[Photo: A 
          tower in Narni, Italy.]</B> </P>
          <P><B>Remember that these books are passed off as being an allegory of 
          God's truth. &nbsp;In the first place, if this is so, then what is 
          Lewis ashamed of that he must hide it so carefully in allegorical 
          terminology? </B><FONT color=#ff0000><B><FONT color=#990000>Romans 
          1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power

          and also to the Greek.</FONT></B></FONT><FONT color=#990000><B> 
          &nbsp;And again, Romans 9:33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a 
          stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him 
          shall not be ashamed.</B></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000><B> 
          </B></FONT><B>If C.S. Lewis really believed on the Lord Jesus Christ 
          (and there is good reason to believe he did not), then why was he so 
          ashamed of the gospel?</B> </P>
          <P><B>As we study the <I>Chronicles of Narnia</I>, the dark and ugly 
          truth will come to light. We will find that the symbolism that he used 
          and things he included in the stories are extremely blasphemous. 
          &nbsp;In the end he is casting the truth of God as the fulfillment of 
          paganism and witchcraft. (Remember the quotes on Christ fulfilling 
          paganism in his <A

          <P><B>Next, we find that C. S. Lewis put profanity and blaspheming of 
          God's name in his book. &nbsp;While this it most common in his 
          <I>Space Trilogy</I>, it also appears in the <I>Narnia</I> books which 
          are for children. Using profanity and swearing for "realism" is out of 
          line to begin with, and especially so in books for kids! </B><FONT

          no exceptions made here for making fiction "realistic." &nbsp;In fact, 
          the Bible itself gives us an example of how this is to be handled even 
          in a true account. </B><FONT color=#ff0000><B><FONT

          thee. 74 Then began he to curse and to swear, <I>saying</I>, I know 
          not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</B></FONT> </P>
          <P><B><BIG></BIG><I>The Silver Chair</I><SMALL> </SMALL>-- "dam" 
          &nbsp;p.4<BR><I>The Magician's Nephew </I>-- "Gawd", "dem" three 
          times. ("Dam" and "dem" stand for "damn."&nbsp;"Gawd" is 
          "God.")<BR>The word "ass" appears in 4 of the books. Being British, it 
          did not mean the same to him as it does to Americans (as a swear 
          word), but he could have left it out, especially since he only used it 
          four times and did use "donkey" in other places.&nbsp;However, 
          considering the filthy state of his mind, it is possible that he 
          thought this cute. Certainly, he could have had it editted out when he 
          realized the books were going to sold in America as well.</B> </P>
          <P><B>Added to this, in these <I>Narnia</I> books we find the "good 
          guys" swearing by Aslan. &nbsp;Now, IF Aslan is really a picture of 
          Christ, as some would assure us, then would it not follow that 
          swearing by his name is blasphemy? &nbsp;When the Narnians swear "by 
          the mane of Aslan" or "by the Lion's mane" would it not equal swearing 
          by the Jesus' whiskers (commonly shortened to "jeewhiz") if Aslan is 
          <U>really</U> a picture of Christ? &nbsp;And wouldn't it follow that 
          "by Aslan" would equal "by God" and "what in the name of Aslan" would 
          equal "what in God's name" if these people's claims are accurate? Why 
          would Lewis be so careless?</B> &nbsp;<B>It certainly does not fit the 
          picture of a "good, godly Christian" as he was supposed to be!</B> 
</P>
          <P><B>On p. 191 of <I>The Horse and His Boy</I>, Aravis says to the 
          horse Bree, &nbsp;"Why do you keep on swearing by the Lion and by the 
          Lion's Mane? &nbsp;I thought you hated lions." &nbsp;To this Lewis has 
          Bree reply, "so I do, but when I speak of the Lion, of course I mean 
          Aslan. &nbsp;<U>All Narnians swear by him</U>." [emphasis added] 
          &nbsp;</B> </P>
          <P><B>Here we turn our attention to the darker and esoteric meanings 
          of the <I>Chronicles of Narnia</I>. &nbsp;As we progress with this 
          study it will become clear that C. S. Lewis was not glorifying the 
          Lord Jesus Christ with these stories, but rather was putting forth sun 
          worship and other pagan idolatry and witchcraft by using hidden 
          meanings and symbolism. &nbsp;Since he professed to believe that 
          Christ was the fulfillment of paganism ("...as I believe, 
          Christ,...fulfills both Paganism and Judaism..."; p. 129; 
          <I>Reflections on the Psalms</I>) it is not surprising that there are 
          things in these books that would lead one to think that Lewis was 
          writing an allegory of Christianity; but, when his terminology, 
          characters, and such are examined closely it becomes apparent that he 
          had something else on his mind. &nbsp;</B> </P>
          <P><B>Remember, his good friend, Charles Williams, was a member of the 
          "Order of the Golden Dawn." &nbsp;This group is to have been 
          originally composed of two groups -- some professing Christianity, and 
          some who had left Madam Blavatsky's Theosophical Society and did not 
          profess Christianity. &nbsp;So, C.S. Lewis had this imputed into his

                photo of Lewis' sitting room sports a large painting of Ganymede 
                and Jupiter and is reportedly the original "Eagle and Child" pub 
                sign. It bears the name "<A 
                href="http://www.quaffale.org.uk/php/brewery/723">Ind 
                Coope</A>," an old brewing company in Britain. The connection of 
                this picture - a homosexual, pedophiliac myth - is utterly 
                revolting for a so-called Christian's favorite "hang out." With 
                Lewis' knowledge of mythology it's vitually impossible that he 
                "didn't know" what it was. <FONT color=#990000>1Thess. 5:22

          <P><B>Dear Steve, </B></P>
          <P><B>I was browsing thru your site after my previous e-mail and came 
          across this in your section on C.S. Lewis: One of Lewis' favorite 
          pubs, "The Eagle and Child," familiarly known as "The Bird and Baby." 
          </B></P>
          <P><B>This inn-sign is actually a representation of the pagan god 
          Zeus/Jupiter in the form of an eagle carrying off a boy called 
          Ganymede to Olympus to serve as a sexual plaything. I don't know 
          whether that was why Lewis was attracted to it, but it can hardly be 
          coincidental that such a foul and disgusting image should be 
          associated with a pub frequented by such a person as Lewis. </B></P>
