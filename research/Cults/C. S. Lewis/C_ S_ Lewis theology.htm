    <H3><B><I>Mere Christianity</I> --</B> <FONT 
    color=#ff0099>updated</FONT></H3>
    <P><FONT size=4><B>- <BIG>Some heathen may belong to God without knowing 
    it.</BIG></B></FONT><B>&nbsp;"There are people in other religions who are 
    being led by God's secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their 
    religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to 
    Christ without knowing it. For example a Buddhist of good will may be led to 
    concentrate more and more on the Buddhist teaching about mercy and to leave 
    in the background (though he might still say he believed) the Buddhist 
    teaching on certain points. Many of the good Pagans long before Christ's 
    birth may have been in this position." (p.176, 177) If the good pagans are 
    going to heaven anyway, why in the world are we spending our time and money 
    in sending out missionaries and preaching the Gospel?!&nbsp;Speaking of the 
    Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us clearly that there is only one way to 
    be saved -- <FONT color=#cc0000>Neither is there salvation in any other: for 
    there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be 
    saved. Acts 4:12</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000> </FONT></B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>We're saved by works.</BIG></FONT><BIG> 
    </BIG>&nbsp;"There are three things that spread the Christ-life to us: 
    baptism, belief, and that mysterious action which different Christians call 
    by different names--Holy Communion, the Mass, the Lord's Supper" (pp.62,63) 
    <FONT color=#cc0000>Titus 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have 
    done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of 
    regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000> 
    </FONT><FONT color=#000000>Added to this he says that in the next life 
    </FONT>"there will be every occasion for being the sort of people that we 
    can become <U>only as the result of doing such acts here</U>" (p.63) 
    [Emphasis added.] <FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;So, he literally believed that 
    this was the "only" way to be saved.</FONT> Lewis is also wiping out any 
    difference between the Lord's supper of true Christians and the Roman Mass. 
    Jesus told us clearly that it is to be <FONT color=#000000>"<FONT 
    color=#cc0000>in remembrance of me.</FONT>"</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000> <FONT 
    color=#cc0000>1Corinthians 11:24</FONT> </FONT><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;He 
    lumps all beliefs about it into one and claims it is part of salvation as 
    well as calling Roman Catholics "Christians"! </FONT></B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>Theistic evolution is taking place.</BIG></FONT> 
    Nature's "pregnancy has been long and painful and anxious, but it has 
    reached its climax" (p.172). The scripture teaches the exact opposite saying 
    that <FONT color=#cc0000>"...the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in 
    pain together until now." (Romans 8:22)</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000> <FONT 
    color=#000000>waiting for the redemption. It has not 
    reached</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>a climax, it is running down!</B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>Man is an animal.</BIG></FONT> &nbsp;"When we come 
    to man, the highest of the animals, we get the completest resemblance to God 
    which we know of."&nbsp;(p.139) <FONT color=#cc0000>Genesis 2:20 And Adam 
    gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of 
    the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</FONT> 
    &nbsp;No help meet for Adam's needs could be found for him among the animals 
    because he was not an animal! &nbsp;He needed someone created in the image 
    of God like he was himself. &nbsp;God knew this and did so. &nbsp;<FONT 
    color=#cc0000>Genesis 1:27 So God created man in his <I>own </I>image, in 
    the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</FONT> 
    &nbsp;Lewis casts many of the animals&nbsp;as being "like God" in some way 
    since this is necessary to arrive at what the Bible says without actually 
    taking it literally. &nbsp;Thus, man is the closest.</B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>There may be creatures in other worlds, and they 
    may be more like God than man.</BIG></FONT><BIG> </BIG>&nbsp;"There may be 
    creatures in other worlds who are more like God than man is, but we do not 
    know about them." (p.139) &nbsp;This of course lays open all kinds of 
    possibilities of aliens, grays, Martians, etc. &nbsp;"Others worlds," 
    plural, does not mean he was talking strictly of heaven. &nbsp;The only 
    beings that&nbsp;the Bible allows are God Himself; people; angles; 
    cherubim/seraphim; and devils, including Satan. <FONT color=#cc0000>Psalm 
    72:19 And blessed <I>be</I> his glorious name for ever: and let the whole 
    earth be filled <I>with</I> his glory; Amen, and Amen.</FONT><FONT 
    color=#ff0000> </FONT>(Just one example that the Bible gives no indication 
    of there being any life in "other worlds.")</B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>We can lose our salvation.</BIG></FONT> &nbsp;"... 
    a Christian can lose the Christ-life which has been put into him, and he has 
    to make efforts to keep it" (p.49) &nbsp;"There are people (a great many of 
    them) who are slowly ceasing to be Christians ..." (p.162) <FONT 
    color=#cc0000>Romans 5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled 
    to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be 
    saved by his life. </FONT>&nbsp;We cannot lose our salvation any more than 
    Jesus can die again now that He is risen from the dead. &nbsp;Our salvation 
    is as eternal as Jesus' life! (Also see Acts 15 where the leaders of the 
    church determined that works are not necessary to earn nor to keep 
    salvation.)</B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>The descriptions of heaven found in the Bible are 
    all symbolism.</BIG></FONT> &nbsp;"All the scriptural imagery (harps, 
    crowns, gold, etc.) is, of course, a merely symbolical attempt to express 
    the inexpressible. Musical instruments are mentioned because for many people 
    (not all) music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly 
    suggests ecstasy and infinity. Crowns are mentioned to suggest the fact that 
    those who are united with God in eternity share His splendor and power and 
    joy. Gold is mentioned to suggest the timelessness of heaven (gold does not 
    rust) and the preciousness of it" (p.106) This is revolting to say the 
    least! &nbsp;Jesus is very clear on this -&nbsp; <FONT color=#cc0000>John 
    14:2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have 
    told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</FONT> &nbsp; Jesus would have 
    told us if all the descriptions of heaven were not real. &nbsp;We have to 
    take it by faith or call Him a liar. &nbsp;A man cannot call Jesus Christ a 
    liar and be saved! (Lewis' problem with the descriptions of heaven being 
    literal is that he judged the Bible by his own half-bushel. As will be seen, 
    <I>The Chronicles of Narnia</I> are absolutely loaded with symbolism, so he 
    read the Bible in light of himself, that is, he made God in his own 
    image.)</B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>Worthiness of heaven is based on "the beginnings" 
    of inner "qualities," not salvation.</BIG></FONT><BIG> </BIG>&nbsp;"The 
    point is not that God will refuse you admission to His eternal world if you 
    have not certain qualities of character: the point is that if people have 
    not got at least the beginnings of those qualities inside them, then no 
    possible external conditions could make a 'Heaven' for them ..." (p.63) 
    <FONT color=#cc0000>Revelation 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in 
    the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000> 
    </FONT>&nbsp;It has nothing to do with inner qualities that would make you 
    like whatever Heaven it is that God has made, it depends entirely on whether 
    your name is in the Lamb's book of life or not. <FONT 
    color=#cc0000>Ephesians 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and 
    that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man 
    should boast.</FONT></B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>Lewis did not consider himself a "new man."</BIG> 
    </FONT><FONT color=#cc0000>2Corinthians 5:17 Therefore if any man <I>be</I> 
    in Christ, <I>he is</I> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, 
    all things are become new. </FONT></B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>Repentance is not necessary for 
    salvation</BIG></FONT><BIG>. </BIG>&nbsp;"This process of surrender...this 
    willing submission...is not something God demands of you before He will take 
    you back...." (p. 59-60) &nbsp;[Note that salvation is a <U>process</U>.] 
    &nbsp;<FONT color=#cc0000>Acts 20:21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also 
    to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus 
    Christ.</FONT> &nbsp; There is no salvation without repentance. &nbsp;If you 
    are not sorry for your sin, you do not need a sacrifice and therefore what 
    reason would there be to be saved?&nbsp; <FONT color=#cc0000>Luke 15:18 I 
    will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned 
    against heaven, and before thee, 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy 
    son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000> 
    </FONT>&nbsp; Notice that the prodigal son had already repented before he 
    started for home! &nbsp;This is probably the reason that Lewis claimed to be 
    a reluctant convert. He believed God took him before he became willing. 
    &nbsp;Sadly, he apparently never did willingly submit to God in 
    repentance.</B></P>
    <P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>There is a purgatory after death in which we will 
    be purified.</BIG></FONT> &nbsp;"...whatever inconceivable purification it 
    may cost you after death." &nbsp;(p.108, 172, 174, 175, 182) &nbsp;<FONT 
    color=#cc0000>2Corinthians 5:6 Therefore <I>we are </I>always confident, 
    knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the 
    Lord: 7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 8 We are confident, <I>I 
    say</I>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present 
    with the Lord.</FONT> </B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- He is <I>probably</I> made for another world, but he

    in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, <U>the 
    most probable</U> explanation is that I was made for another world." Please 
    note the "if" and "probable". This is not a concrete statement as some might 
    mistake it to be. It is very nebulous. If he <U>is</U> satisfied with this 
    world, then he was not made for another world.</B></P><B>

    <P><B><FONT size=4>- He may not enjoy Paradise, though he thinks it may 
    exist based upon his desire.</FONT> "Though I do not believe that my desire 
    for Paradise proves that I shall enjoy it, I think it a pretty good 
    indication that such a thing exists and that some men will." Here is a 
    bizarre statement. First, it indicates a lack of concrete faith that there 
    is a heaven and that he is going there. This does not remind us of the 
    faithful in Hebrews 11 who <FONT color=#cc0000>10...looked for a city which 
    hath foundations, whose builder and maker <I>is</I> God... 14 For they that 
    say such things declare plainly that they seek a country... 16 But now they 
    desire a better <I>country</I>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not 
    ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</FONT> 
    [Based upon this verse and Lewis' statement, is it not possible that God was 
    ashamed to be called Lewis' God?] Secondly, his "pretty good" idea that it 
    is there is based, not upon scripture, but upon the fact that he desires 
    such a place. Many false things can be and are based upon such faulty 
    reasoning. <FONT color=#cc0000>1Corinthians 2:12 Now we have received, not 
    the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know 
    the things that are freely given to us of God.</FONT> Thirdly, it could 
    appear from Lewis' statement that he does not know if he will enjoy 
    Paradise. This may either be a lack of confidence that he is going there 
    (which we have already seen), or it could be a lack of confidence that he 
    will be one of those who enjoy it. <FONT color=#cc0000>Romans 8:18 For I 
    reckon that the sufferings of this present time<I> are</I> not worthy <I>to 
    be compared</I> with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</FONT> <FONT

    to not believe it is the extreme suffering that the Roman Church taught in 
    earlier eras, he held that our "souls demand Purgatory..." in order to make 
    them pure enough for heaven. &nbsp;This idea is no doubt based on his heresy 
    of salvation being a continuing and incomplete thing. &nbsp;He does "assume 
    that the process of purification will normally involve suffering." &nbsp;He 
    likens it to being given a mouth wash after having a tooth pulled. 
    "<I>This</I>," he says, "will be Purgatory. &nbsp;The rinsing may take 
    longer than I can now imagine. &nbsp;The taste of <I>this</I> may be more 
    fiery and astringent than my present sensibility could endure." (pp.108-109) 
    &nbsp;Again, see the above scriptures - 2 Corinthians 5:6-8.&nbsp; <FONT

    nature. His logic is circular.)</B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- <BIG>Our goodness is not&nbsp;that different from

    notice that he uses the circle to represent goodness. &nbsp;If it were not 
    for his fantasy books that open up his occultic and pagan thinking so 
    clearly for us to observe, this would not mean much probably. &nbsp;However, 
    in light of other things, the use of this symbolism is highly suspicious. 
    &nbsp;According to J. E. Cirlot's <I>A Dictionary of Symbolism</I> (p. 
    46-47) the circle frequently represents the sun and also can "stand for 
    heaven and perfection..." Thus, Lewis uses it to represent divine 
    goodness.</B></P>

    Did Cain, Abel and Seth need to "attribute" the universe to a Creator when 
    they could hear the story directly from the mouths of their parents? <FONT

    loves us here and now "without impediment". <FONT color=#cc0000>Romans 8:38 
    For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor

    present tense though he was still on this earth. He was also speaking to 
    people who still suffered from the infinities of the flesh. I'm reminded of 
    the Mennonite couplet - "Near, so very near to God, Nearer I could not be; 
    For in the person of His Son, I'm just as near as He." <FONT

    him? Ps 8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast 
    crowned him with glory and honour.</FONT> We are not preserved by Instinct,

    <P><B><FONT size=4>- Apparently - Man is governed by an "animal organism" 
    which must be control through the emotions.</FONT> "Without the aid of 
    trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism." 
    <FONT color=#cc0000>Romans 7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver 
    me from the body of this death? 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our 
    Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the 
    flesh the law of sin.</FONT> Only through Christ can we overcome the sin 
    nature - which is not an animal organism. <FONT color=#cc0000>1Corinthians

    <P><B><FONT size=4>- Man does not necessarily have dominion over God's 
    creation.</FONT> "Man's conquest of Nature turns out, in the moment of its 
    consummation, to be Nature's conquest of Man." "What we call Man's power 
    over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men 
    with Nature as its instrument."<FONT color=#cc0000> Genesis 1:26 And God 
    said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have 
    dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over 
    the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that 
    creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his <I>own </I>image, in 
    the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God 
    blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and 
    replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the 
    sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth 
    upon the earth.</FONT> </B></P>
    <P><B><FONT size=4>- Modern science is mostly based upon a love of

    usually those whose love of truth exceeded their love of power." As we too 
    well know, modern science is all too often in opposition with the truth of 
    God which is His word (John 17:17). <FONT color=#cc0000>1Timothy 6:20 O 
    Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane

    <P><B><FONT size=4>- Apollo is probably a lower species of Christ, and could 
    probably be prayed to as such.</FONT> Perhaps the most spiritually damning 
    and revealing statement that Lewis ever made is quoted in <I>C.S. Lewis: A 
    Biography</I>, by Roger Lancelyn Green. &nbsp;On page 276, Green gives us 
    the quote. &nbsp;Lewis and his ill wife were on a trip when Lewis stated, "I 
    had some ado to prevent Joy and myself from relapsing into Paganism in 
    Attica! &nbsp;At Daphni it was hard not to pray to Apollo the Healer. 
    &nbsp;But somehow one didn't feel it would have been very wrong - would have 
    only been addressing Christ sub specie Apollinis." &nbsp;Dear reader, this 
    man could not possibly be saved!!! &nbsp;Anyone that could even entertain 
    the idea that Apollos, the pagan sun deity, &nbsp;was a lower form of 
    Christ, and could be prayed to as such, could not&nbsp;possibly know the 
    Lord Jesus Christ as his Saviour! &nbsp;No doubt Lewis could explain this 
    all away by references to the Sun of righteousness with healing in his wings 
    in Malachi 4:2 , but the fact that Apollos bears a similar description does 
    not prove that he was something akin to the only begotten Son of God. 
    &nbsp;Rather, it proves that Apollos is an anti-Christ! The Christ that C.S. 
    Lewis worshipped was not the Christ of the holy scriptures, but some pagan 
    deity that he conjured up out of his myth laden imagination. <FONT

          <P><B>In Lewis' final interview, conducted for <I>Decision</I> 
          magazine by editor Sherwood Wirt, he reiterated that <I>The 
          Everlasting Man</I> significantly influenced his faith. In response to 
          the question "what Christian writers have helped you," he also 
          included "Edwyn Bevan's book, <I>Symbolism and Belief</I>, and Rudolf 
          Otto's <I>The Idea of the Holy</I>, and the plays of Dorothy Sayers."

          some of these books call Lewis' brand of Christianity into question,
