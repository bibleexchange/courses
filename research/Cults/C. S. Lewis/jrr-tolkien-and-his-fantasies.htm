<H2 align=center><BR>J. R. R. Tolkien and His Fantasies </H2>
<P>We have received many requests to publish a review of the Tolkien works. We 
had done a fair amount of research, but our schedule has simply not afforded our 
original intentions. We have answered considerable correspondence on the 
subject. Then we received the question shown below. We felt that the answer 
contained sufficient information to help most people understand the issue. So, 
for the benefit of those who are interested in knowing some of the facts, and 
because the schedule may not permit a full-fledged review for some time, we are 
at least posting the answer to this person’s question.<BR><BR>For more 
information on J. R. R. Tolkien/C. S. Lewis fantasy see our review on C. S. 
Lewis. The two are interrelated. The Lewis review will soon receive a major 
addendum. It seems that we were not explicit enough as to who C. S. Lewis 
actually was and what he believed. Numbers of people were confused by the 
article because they thought that he was on the order of a Christian evangelist, 
or at least that he had Evangelical leanings. This idea is not really true, but 
it is widely propagated by ecumenical organizers that erroneously promote the 
works of Lewis and Tolkien as “Christian” allegory. This appears to be 
premeditated, as both men flatly denied this allegation while they were alive. 
Actually, they were both nearly diametrically opposed to theology as it is 
understood by Evangelicals, Fundamentalists, or even most Protestants in 
general. We hope the additional facts provided about Lewis and this review of 
Tolkien will be of some help those who are trying to steer the right course for 
their families.<BR><BR>Hello,<BR><BR>I really enjoyed reading your book reviews. 
I found them very interesting and informative. I would really be interested in 
reading a review of the Lord of the Rings series. We have been struggling with 
one of our children about these books, movies, and games. My husband and I 
previewed the first movie in the series and we felt very uncomfortable with the 
content. Our son disagrees with our feelings and beliefs because some are 
Christian friends of ours have told him that J.R.R. Tolkien was a Christian. 
They have also told him that the book is similar to the Chronicles of Narnia 
series and that the characters and incidences in the movie are Christian 
symbols. My husband and I were not able to see this symbolism. We have since had 
to ban the books and movies until we get more information. Would you consider 
reviewing this series anytime soon? <BR><BR>Name 
withheld<BR><BR>Hello,<BR><BR>We have had it on our list to try to do a review 
of Tolkien for some time. We have had many, many requests, but we just have not 
had the time to sit down and plough through several of his books to pull out and 
organize what is wrong with what he writes. It is certainly not a task to which 
we, as Christians, look forward. However, most parents who want to have any real 
Christian discernment, such as yourselves, can tell that something is wrong by 
just looking at one of the book covers or movie ads. It is normal to assume that 
evil, demonic-looking beings inhabit stories involving occultism. If it looks 
like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s a 
duck.<BR><BR>Sadly, most of Christendom, in this country at least, while 
professing Christ, has turned its interest elsewhere. They want to go to heaven, 
but they want much more fun than they can have by following Jesus. Many churches 
and preachers are willing to tell them that they can have it both ways just as 
in the days of Jeremiah, when he said, “The prophets prophesy falsely, and the 
priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what 
will ye do in the end thereof?”—Jeremiah 5:31. These things never change, as it 
says in Ecclesiastes that there is “nothing new under the sun.”<BR><BR>Though we 
have neither the time nor the stomach to drudge through any of Tolkien’s books 
at present, I can give you some information that may help you explain things to 
your son. Tolkien was never a Christian, and never claimed to be. He was a 
Catholic. I was raised Catholic. The Catholic church does not teach salvation in 
Jesus Christ. It teaches that salvation is by mandatory church membership, works 
and participation in Catholic sacraments. The church recognizes the existence of 
Jesus, but He is, in practice, a mere secondary issue to salvation. 
Notwithstanding the treacherous ecumenical efforts by the Catholic hierarchy and 
many high-ranking Protestants who are benefitting from ecumenicism, even the 
most recent papal encyclicals state that no one outside the Catholic church goes 
to heaven, and ex-Jesuits have testified that the Jesuit order still takes the 
secret oath to annihilate every non-Catholic heretic.<BR><BR>The effort to 
condone Tolkien’s works by claiming them to be allegorical is simply an effort 
to capitalize on this generation’s free-wheeling ecumenical mindset in order to 
get it to swallow the lie that we can bathe in occultism and still be Christian. 
Tolkien, himself, in his day denied any allegorical connotation to these works 
when asked. He likely knew, as C. S. Lewis likely knew, that “Christians” in his 
day had not yet been sufficiently prepared to swallow such a preposterous 
oxymoron.<BR><BR>Tolkien and Lewis were practically partners. Lewis openly 
admitted pursuing an interest in the occult. It is undoubtedly the source of 
material for his book The Screwtape Letters in which he claims to give his 
readers an understanding of the mind of the devil, delving into matters that 
Scripture tells the Christian to avoid. Lewis and Tolkien were part of the same 
local guild. They met regularly—generally every week. The name of this literary 
guild was The Inklings. It met in a tavern called The Eagle and the Child 
(coincidental?), less often, it is said, during the war when there was a 
shortage of beer. Is there any wonder that the writings of the two are so 
similar? Those who have seriously studied The Inklings say that Tolkien was a 
considerable mentor to Lewis.<BR><BR>There has been a considerable amount 
written about The Inklings, so there is no dearth of information about these 
people. Their fascination with the concept of subcreation can be evidenced in 
the following quote. “The three ages recorded in JRRT’s Middle-earth stories and 
annals are pre-Christian. JRRT concludes, ‘God is the Lord, of angels, and of 
man—and of Elves.’ ”1 It would be intriguing to have had Tolkien explain the 
significance of his capitalization of the word “Elves” here.<BR><BR>The next 
quote shows us the roots of his ideology, the basis of his works, and the tenor 
of his purported “Christianity.” “Because of the importance they placed on the 
primary meaning-function of the imagination, both JRRT and CSL were particularly 
preoccupied with the imaginative fruit of pre-Christian paganism, particularly 
what might be called enlightened paganism. Most of JRRT’s fiction is set in a 
pre-Christian world, as was his great model, the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf, according 
to his own interpretation of that poem. Similarly, CSL explored a pagan world in 
his novel, Till We Have Faces.”2 <BR><BR>Though the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf was 
written about 1000 AD, the story was handed down through the centuries, and its 
roots go back to at least sixth century Scandinavia. It is a Scandinavian 
equivalent to Greek mythology—certainly not to Christianity. Notice the 
fascination of these men (and the group as a whole) with pre-Christian paganism. 
We know from Scripture that there was pre-Christian theism at the same time 
there was pre-Christian pantheism or paganism. None of the Inklings showed any 
interest in that direction.<BR><BR>This group was not only interested in 
pre-Christian paganism. Consider this biographical excerpt from The Inklings 
Handbook on Aleister Crowley, another member of this intimate society. “Born 
Edward Alexander Crowley, Crowley became interested in the occult while at 
Cambridge. He was a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn until expelled for 
extreme practices. He was proud of his self-imposed title ‘The Great Beast’ and 
liked to be called ‘the wickedest man alive.’ After leaving the Order of the 
Golden Dawn he founded his own order and attracted great notoriety with rumours 
of child sacrifice and other ceremonies. Those associated with him often met 
strange deaths, and his wife and child died tragically. Crowley was probably the 
inspiration for Montague James’ story ‘Casting the Runes’ and for the character 
Simon the Clerk in All Hallows’ Eve [by Charles Williams].”3 Is it any wonder 
that C. S. Lewis openly admitted his participation in the occult? How could he 
hide it? Look at the company that he kept.<BR><BR>Following are Tolkien’s views 
on any relation of his work to Christianity:<BR>“In a letter to W. H. Auden (in 
1965), JRRT commented on the Lord of the Rings in relation to Christian 
theology: ‘I don’t feel under any obligation to make my story fit with 
formalized Christian theology, though I actually intended it to be Consonant 
with Christian thought and belief.’ ”4<BR><BR>And what kind of Christianity are 
we talking about here? Well, it must be remembered first that Tolkien was a 
Catholic. He believed in praying to statues, in buying masses and indulgences to 
reduce one’s time in purgatory, in the miraculous power of relics, in the saving 
power of wearing a scapular, that Christ is actually imprisoned in a piece of 
bread, that a human priest can forgive sins, that the pope is a god because he 
neither sins nor errs, and numerous other beliefs that have roots not in 
Scripture but in pagan mythology.<BR><BR>From The Inklings Handbook—“Their 
important years as a literary group were from around 1933 to about 1949, 
especially during the war when another key member, CW [Charles Williams who 
wrote All Hallow’s Eve], was resident in Oxford. In these years they met in 
CSL’s rooms in Oxford, as well as in the Eagle and Child and other pubs. CW 
wrote poetry, novels, plays, literary criticism, and off-the-beaten-track 
theology. He powerfully influenced CSL, though JRRT was not so taken with him. 
JRRT played a vital role in CSL’s conversion to Christianity—the latter was for 
many years an atheist, then a pantheist.”5<BR><BR>The authors of The Inklings 
Handbook are either totally unaware of real Christianity, or they are willingly 
purporting this falsehood. As we said, Tolkien was never a Christian. Neither 
was Lewis. Lewis became a pseudo-Catholic. He joined the Anglican church, but he 
slowly gravitated closer and closer to Catholicism. He called himself “very 
Catholic.” His beliefs included purgatory and prayers for the dead. He went to a 
priest for regular confession. Before his death he received the sacrament of 
extreme unction. In short, he depended upon the Catholic church to get him to 
heaven. Real Christians understand that the Bible says that his faith was 
drastically misplaced, and that these things get no man to heaven. What does 
this kind of conversion mean to any discerning Christian—in regards to Lewis or 
Tolkien?<BR><BR>And just what sort of theologian was this Charles Williams? Here 
is a short excerpt from a synopsis of one of his works. “For All Hallows’ Eve is 
remarkable in that the first character whose thoughts and ideas we meet is dead. 
Lester Furnival, a young woman alone on Westminster Bridge, looks out over a 
deserted, twilit London. A plane has crashed into the Embankment, near her home. 
Her husband appears, demanding incredulously how she had escaped from the crash; 
then he fades from her sight. She realizes that she has been killed in the 
crash.”6 The story continues on with dead people interacting in the affairs of 
live people. Are we getting the picture of a Christian group here?<BR><BR>Yet 
the world would sell us on these men being Christians. Another excerpt—“The 
Inklings undoubtedly represent an important part of twentieth-century cultural 
history, in which literature still has a high place. What is remarkable, and 
perhaps unique, is that they were Christians. Much of their work, especially 
JRRT’s explored pre-Christian paganism, the idea of what CSL called the anima 
naturaliter Christiana [Christian temperament given by nature - author’s 
translation], a kind of natural theology. Their pre-modernism has a remarkable 
appeal to our post-modernist culture. It seems that in their apparently foolish 
preoccupation with myth and fantasy, a Christian voice was in preparation that 
would still speak at the beginning of the twenty-first century to the wider 
world.”7 <BR><BR>There is no doubt that their works speak to the wider world, 
but do they speak to the “narrow way”? The quotes from this book, The Inklings 
Handbook, should be continual alerts to any discerning Christian, yet the book 
is obviously written to non-discerning Christians, or to those who have been 
convinced that they are Christians. It continually expects the reader to equate 
pagan, pantheist, fantasy, occult and foolish ideas with Christianity. Judging 
from the success of Tolkien movies evidenced in the news, this feat is being 
accomplished admirably. Is Jesus pre-modernist or post-modernist?<BR><BR>And yet 
what is all this talk about nature and creation? These people care nothing for 
creation. Creation (nature) came from God. He said it was good, and it is. It is 
nothing like the ghoulish, occult-looking creatures that they dream up. There is 
nothing like this in God’s creation. That is why it is labeled subcreation as if 
it has some position or validity in relation to God’s nature. It is simply not 
so. These men and their followers preferred to entertain their own ideas of 
creation over those of God, and they were betting that they could convince many 
others to feel the same way.<BR><BR>In God’s creation we find angels, then man, 
a little lower than the angels, and then the rest of creation. In subcreation we 
find the landscape littered with surreal hermaphrodite gods that create a 
pretense of rivaling the one and only real God in power and miracles. These are 
often animals, which God created lower than man. Since early civilizations, it 
has always been a tenet of New Age occult doctrine to elevate animals to a 
status equal to or higher than man. In many instances, young people are not able 
to mentally create the proper separation between the God of the Bible and the 
gods of the Inklings. They already knew this. That is why we are seeing more and 
more young people finding their way into demonism and theosophy as advertising 
makes fantasy consistently more popular. Even Harry Potter is becoming common 
“Christian” fare. It seems utterly silly to see “Christian” sources decry the 
black magic of Harry Potter, and then throw support behind the dark gray magic 
of Tolkien and his occult, New Age mutants, and call it Christian allegory. 
Whether purposefully, I know not, but surely enough, they, by their testimony, 
are introducing young people to the demonism of Harry Potter and worse by 
starting them down that road.<BR><BR>As an aside, the following quotes are from 
Tolkien about his work as allegory: (1) “I cordially dislike allegory in all its 
manifestations, and always have done since I grew old and wary enough to detect 
its presence.” (2) “There is no ‘symbolism’ or conscious allegory in my story.” 
(3) “As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the 
author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical...” (4) “There is no 
allegory—moral, political, or contemporary—in the work at all. It is a 
fairy-story written for adults.” (5) “Is the book to be considered as an 
allegory?”—The author replied, “No. I dislike allegory whenever I smell it.” It 
is not the intention of this review to delve into the infinite squabbling over 
the word “allegory” and its meanings and how they relate to Tolkien’s works or 
those of C. S. Lewis, who also denied an allegorical intent behind his 
Chronicles of Narnia. We simply wish to draw from this six important points for 
Christians.<BR><BR>First, God gave us many forms of enjoyment in life. We are to 
discern (by His standards) which are good for us. Attempting to allegorize 
Tolkien’s work is counterproductive to discernment. It will not do for a real 
Christian to try to stretch reality, and stick a label that says “Christian” on 
everything in which he would like to dabble (especially when the author, 
himself, vehemently denies the label). This can be summed up by a quote from a 
self-professed non-Christian on the subject. He admitted that there are 
parallelisms that could be construed as allegorical if one should want to do so, 
and closed with, “Look hard enough and you'll find anything, people.” 
<BR><BR>Second, discernment by God’s standards teaches us that the works of 
these men are not only not Christian allegory, but they are not fit for 
Christian consumption. Consider a few quotes now from God’s Word that deal with 
the very same topics dealt with in the works of Tolkien (and Lewis). • 
Deuteronomy 18:10-12—“There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his 
son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an 
observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter 
with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these 
things are an abomination unto the LORD:” Shall God’s people allow men like 
Tolkien or Lewis to bring these practices among them?<BR>• Exodus 22:18—“Thou 
shalt not suffer a witch to live.” Are there any good witches before God? Shall 
we try the terms “white witch” or “white magic” on Him?<BR>• Leviticus 20:6—“And 
the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to 
go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut 
him off from among his people.” Does God want us to turn after these things for 
entertainment? Can we call this “Christian entertainment”? What would God call 
it?<BR>• Revelation 22:14-15—“Blessed are they that do his commandments, that 
they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into 
the city. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, 
and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.” Paul said, “. . . and 
what communion hath light with darkness?”—2 Corinthians 6:14. And what communion 
do Christians have with all these God-forbidden practices and fantasies?<BR>• 
Revelation 21:8—“But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and 
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall 
have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the 
second death.” How many warnings need God give us to stay away from all this? Is 
this Christian allegory, or is it just an underhanded, semi-subliminal way to 
feed our children idolatrous lies.<BR><BR>Third, speaking of children, in one of 
his denials (above) that his work was allegory, Tolkien stated that it was 
strictly fantasy for adults. Even Tolkien said that this material was not fit 
for children—let alone Christian children. Can we spiritualize it, ignore even 
Tolkien’s own warnings, and then even subject children to it—with God watching? 
Did not Jesus say it would be better to be cast into the sea tied to a mill 
stone?<BR><BR>Fourth, where do we draw the line between allegory and blasphemy? 
When we decide to depict the powers of good and evil through images conjured 
from our own imagination, we cross an important line. Romans 1:21-23 tells us, 
“Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were 
thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was 
darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the 
glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and 
to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.” How shall we view such 
images offered us from the imaginations of others? Would not be far better for 
us to simply call these images base entertainment rather than to drag God into 
the mess, and to say that it is a representation of Him?<BR><BR>Fifth, real 
Christian allegory will always speak to the spirit in a wonderful, godly sort of 
way. Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress has often brought me to tears because of Who 
God is, what He has done for me, and what He intends to do for me. No work that 
Tolkien has ever produced falls into this category. He stated explicitly that 
were never intended to do so. The natural, carnal excitement of his books, and 
now the movie series, appeal to the carnal, fleshly side of our nature. He 
stated that as his goal for writing them. What does God say about this as a 
“Christian” diet? Romans 8:7-9 says, “Because the carnal mind is enmity against 
God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then 
they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but 
in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have 
not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” Are Tolkien’s books about right 
and wrong? God is about right and wrong. What does the thrill of watching 
bloodshed (however courageously it is shed), and the butchering of others for 
“right” or “freedom” have to do with a humble spirit, a contrite heart, and the 
handing of one’s freedom over to one’s Redeemer to be used as He sees fit? 
Tolkien’s stories do not enrich the spirit. They embolden the flesh. This is not 
the work of an allegory.<BR><BR>Sixth, it is a serious issue to even speak of 
Tolkien works as allegories. Isaiah 5:20 says, “Woe unto them that call evil 
good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that 
put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” We had better be very careful about 
trying to force our own fancies into God’s mold. He will not have it, and He 
will judge us for it.<BR><BR>Going back to the Inklings, an excerpt describing 
poet John Wain’s description of them offers us some insight into their purpose 
and effect. “He admits however that he would be giving quite a false picture of 
CSL and his friends if he presented them as merely reactionary, as if they were 
putting all their energies into negatively being against things. This is far 
from the truth, he says. As he put it: ‘this was a circle of instigators, almost 
of incendiaries, meeting to urge one another on in the task of redirecting the 
whole current of contemporary art and life.’ ”8 They certainly redirected 
contemporary Christian cultural ideas of those who have not examined this issue 
closely. As The Inklings and others sowed their pagan fables in the unsuspecting 
ground of Christian culture, people had little or no inkling of the apostasy 
that would eventually be reaped.<BR><BR>Returning to Romans Chapter 1, Romans 
1:22-25 says, “Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed 
the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image [this has always been the New 
Age image] made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, 
and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the 
lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: who 
changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more 
than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.” Can anyone deny that since the 
literary influence of the Inklings there has been an endless stream of Aslans, 
Hobbits, surreal monsters, Godzillas, Terminators, morphodite Star Wars 
creatures, and the like paraded before society, and that they have had a 
tremendous influence upon our society? We now have children all over the world, 
who, during their formative years, are learning to be captivated by every 
malformed image that comes along, as these images are spawned by an 
ever-increasing number of maniacal imaginations. We even have this entering and 
corrupting Christianity, itself, with the concoction of fictitious “Christian” 
cartoon characters like Bibleman (Superman’s counterpart) perverting the reality 
of even Christianity for children, and this before they can reach the age of 
reason, and have a chance to discern truth without a pre-installed bias. Does 
almighty God wish to be associated with, and even preempted by, cartoon 
characters with equal powers? How far will this go?<BR><BR>Who can predict the 
effect that this inundation of New Age images is having, and will have, on 
society? Only God can—and He has. This passage in Romans goes on to say, “For 
this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did 
change the natural use into that which is against nature: and likewise also the 
men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward 
another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in 
themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.”—Romans 1:26-27. Would 
anyone like to argue with God on that one? Has the rise in homosexuality during 
this post-Inkling period not been as stellar as the popularity of Star Wars, 
King Kong or Terminator? Think about it. How much time do people spend in the 
Word of God today? How much time do they spend enjoying such fictitious image 
fare rather than the truth and reality of God? If God said that homosexuality 
would parallel the use of these types of images, is the homosexual mania that we 
are witnessing today a mere coincidence? The Inklings were pagans pretending to 
bear a Christian standard. How long will we let them dupe us? How long will we 
rail against homosexuality, while we condone the influences that brought it to 
us as “Christian allegory”?<BR><BR>I hope that the information contained herein, 
will give your son pause for thought. He will face God and eternity some 
day—though we hope not, maybe sooner than he thinks. Will he follow the wide 
world or the narrow way? He should not think for a minute that the wide way is 
not packed full of “Christians.” This is why Jesus said, “Many will say to me in 
that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have 
cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I 
profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work 
iniquity.”—Matthew 7:22-23. Will He speak differently to those who follow 
iniquity? This is surely an issue on which godly wisdom would want to stay on 
the safe side. Jesus said many will say “Lord, Lord” in that (judgment) day. 
These will not be murderers and whoremongers. They will be Bible-packing church 
people. People who have convinced themselves and many of us that belong to 
Jesus, but as He said, they do not. According to Jesus, wide is the way to 
destruction, and it is full of “Christians.” Narrow, and yes, sometimes 
unpopular, is the straight gate, but the rewards are worth it.<BR><BR>And then 
there is Psalms 101:2-4 which says, “I will behave myself wisely in a perfect 
way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect 
heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that 
turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. A froward heart shall depart from me: I 
will not know a wicked person.” What about the people who produce Hollywood 
films? Do they produce them mainly for the glory of God or mainly for money? 
What about the writers, directors and actors? Do they live for God, or do they 
turn aside? We cannot go through the checkout line at any major store without 
seeing all the magazines that tell us that they most vigorously turn aside. So 
we are to hate their works? Are we not to allow them to cleave to us? How do we 
do that? Seeing such a film creates thousands of indelible impressions in a 
person’s mind—many of which we are not even aware. The Inklings knew that, thus 
their name. They knew that everything starts small—just an inkling. If Hollywood 
loves J. R. R. Tolkien’s work, does God? Should we? If we are to know no wicked 
person, should we get to know the actors and the people (or creatures—ugh!) that 
they portray? Should we offer up our minds to their influence? Is this the 
behavior that Jesus expects, yea requires, of His own? People are bringing every 
sort of ungodly printed matter, video media and music into churches, and saying 
that because some church people condone it, it is therefore Christian. This 
always reminds me of the disobedient little boy that says, “Johnny does it all 
the time!” The definition of what is Christian is in God’s Word, and it is not 
“what the other guy does.”<BR><BR>Lastly, has your son prayed about this issue? 
Has he received it from the Lord Jesus Christ that seeing such fare is something 
that Jesus wants him to do to God’s glory? After all, we are to do all (that 
would be everything that we do) to the glory of God. Knowing who creates this 
stuff should give us some strong clues about the answer long before we even go 
to prayer. And when we pray, let us not try to fool God. Some folks always 
receive the answers they prefer when they pray about such subjects, but then so 
did those found saying “Lord, Lord.”<BR><BR>I hope that this information has 
provided some understanding into why you feel uncomfortable with the symbolisms 
dispersed by the Inklings and their followers and supporters. They are simply 
occult—well lathered with excuses, but occult nonetheless. I hope it has 
provided your son with enough information to follow your godly guidance with a 
heartfelt willingness. God bless you. I have prayed for you and will pray for 
you.<BR><BR>References:<BR>1) The Inklings Handbook, p 42<BR>2) The Inklings
