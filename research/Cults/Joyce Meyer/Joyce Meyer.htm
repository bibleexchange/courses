not to deal with oddball or wacko Word/Faith teachings. It is to confront heresy 
head on, wherever it's found. And it is found in abundance in Joyce Meyer's 
book. Apart from the heresy, the book is also very aberrant and problematic. Our 
focus will be on the heretical material. If her book finds a place in your 
personal library, it should be in the cult section, not the evangelism 
section.</FONT><FONT size=2></P>

      <P align=justify>Debunking Common 
    Objections</FONT></P></B></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT 
face="Book Antiqua">
<P align=justify>First off, let me preface the following by debunking a few 
common responses from Charismatics (I am referring, of course, to Word/Faith 
Charismatics) when they're challenged and confronted about heresy within their 
camp.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>1) I do not question Joyce's motives. This is not a 
  subjective issue but an objective one.</P>
  <P align=justify>2) I never argue or divide over peripheral doctrines. I only 
  argue and divide over essential doctrines. Charismatics do not understand the 
  difference between essentials and peripherals and that is exactly why they 
  become defensive when someone criticizes the doctrines of demons that they 
  hold dear. And it's also why they themselves are very divisive when it comes 
  to the gifts of the Holy Spirit and other non-essential issues.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>Charismatics, when asked, would be hard pressed to explain the 
difference between essentials and peripherals or even list a few of the 
essentials. Essential doctrines are essential for salvation. Non-essentials are 
not essential for salvation.</P>
<P align=justify>For example, if someone says that the Trinity is a pagan 
doctrine from Satan (as did William Branham), they cannot be considered a 
believer. But if someone has the "wrong" view of the Rapture, they would not for 
that reason be considered a non-Christian. Salvation hinges upon the essentials 
just as life on this planet hinges upon having food, air, and water. Our 
physical lives do not hinge upon clothes, cars, and buildings. We can live 
without them. They are not essential to life and are thus non-essentials.</P>
<P align=justify>Not in all my years as a Charismatic did I ever hear <I>any 
</I>Charismatic teacher, pastor, or evangelist explain the above or make a clear 
distinction between the two different types of doctrine. Rather, time and time 
again they would "knock down all doctrinal walls" and make great claims of super 
spirituality over "dead churches" and "theologians" who differ with them on the 
subject of the Gifts.</P>
<P align=justify>Heresy, by the way, is when an essential is distorted beyond 
recognition or replaced with a counterfeit. Aberrant is when a peripheral 
doctrine is distorted or replaced with something else. A wrong view of the 
Rapture is merely aberrant. It only becomes heresy when salvation hinges upon a 
"correct" interpretation of it.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>3) I do not take Mrs. Meyer out of context or twist her 
  words. My experience<FONT size=2> </FONT>has been that in any attempt to 
  defend such teachers, most Charismatics put words in the mouths of their 
  mentors rather than face up to solid, word-for-word quotations. The blade cuts 
  both ways, I will not read into what is said nor will I allow others to 
  interpret plain statements to mean things other than what was intended by the 
  speaker/writer.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>4) I am not an "anti-Charismatic." I was led to the Lord by 
  watching The 700 Club, belonged to Grace World Outreach Center (now called 
  Grace Church-St. Louis) for a couple of years, and then belonged to Life 
  Christian Center for 8 years or so. All these ministries are local Charismatic 
  ministries and I love these folks dearly.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify><I>5) </I>I am not "attacking" Charismatics, I'm "responding" 
  to <I>their attacks </I>upon the body of Christ. All cults cry, "You're 
  attacking us." Ain't so. Those who proclaim and believe damnable doctrines of 
  demons had better get used to good Christian folks responding to their attacks 
  upon our faith. It's not only a good defense of the faith, it's biblical! In 
  fact, one of my favorite pastors, Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel, is a 
  Charismatic and he is very vocal in his opposition to the heresies within the 
  Word/Faith Charismatic movement.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>6) The most popular charge is that this type of criticism is 
  "unloving and divisive." 1 Corinthians 13:6,7 says that love rejoices with the 
  truth" and "always protects." It is very loving to protect someone from a 
  damnable lie that masquerades as the truth. And about division, are we to 
  unite with cultists or remain separate from them?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>7) "Judge not lest you be judged!" Matthew 7: 1. In verse 15 
  Jesus warns us to "watch out for false prophets." How can we evaluate whether 
  or not someone is a false prophet unless we use some degree of judgment? Jesus 
  was speaking about judging self righteously and hypocritically. Paul tells us 
  in I Corinthians 5:3, "And I have already passed judgment on the one who did 
  this.." (New International Version) And in verse 12 he states, "Are you not to 
  judge those inside [the church]?" Judging in a biblical manner is the result 
  of discernment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>8) "It's wrong to name names." I don't know where Christians 
  ever got such an unbiblical idea except from those who wish to guard their 
  prey. Did not Paul name names? Names like Hymenaeus, Philetus, Demas, and 
  Alexander. And did not David mention Doeg the Edomite? What do people have to 
  hide by not wanting their names named? If someone was molesting young children 
  in your neighborhood and I knew their name, would you be content to only know 
  that they were out there or would you want to know their name?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>Consider the Tylenol scare years ago. Would you have been 
satisfied if the media had said, "Watch out! There's a popular pain reliever on 
the market that's been tampered with which could kill you. We don't want to 
upset the company that produces it lest we offend them. Therefore, we won't name 
them. Lots of luck!" I don't think so. Such would be a "warningless-warning." 
Good for nothing and only protecting the guilty.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>9) "Did you go to Joyce Meyer personally as laid out in 
  Matthew 18 before writing this review?" Do not make the mistake that the cults 
  make by reading into (eisegesis) a passage something that is not there. 
  Instead, read out of (exegesis) the passage what is there. Read verses 15 - 17 
  and you'll find that we are to approach those who have personally sinned 
  against us. Joyce has done me no personal wrong. So in accordance with Matthew 
  18, 1 did not go to her personally.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>Even if I were to attempt to approach her with the heresy she 
presents in her book, do you think she would hear me out? Not a chance in 
Purgatory. Those close to her were given the cold shoulder when attempting such 
a thing. Who then am I? I am not a supporter. I am not a well known pastor of a 
big church. I am a nobody. To try would only be an exercise in futility.</P>
<P align=justify>Did she did bother to consult me before publicly proclaiming a 
doctrine that is dangerous to my lost loved ones and "neighbors" within my local 
community? No. Should she have? No, the public arena is open to all who would 
use it. Therefore, I am not doing Joyce any personal wrong, either. If she so 
chooses to poison people's minds with heresy, 1, and others like me, are just as 
free to inoculate people's minds to such poison.</P>
<P align=justify>"Is this biblical?" Anyone who knows their Bible would not ask 
such a question. The Apostle Paul dealt with Peter over a non-personal issue 
that involved sound doctrine. And he did so publicly.</P>
<P align=justify>"When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of 
<I>the gospel, I </I>said to Peter <I>in front of them all,</I> "You are a Jew, 
yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force 
Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?" Galatians 2:14</P>
<P align=justify>Had Peter personally sinned against Paul? No. Did Paul have a 
reason to be concerned? Yes. Did Paul go privately to Peter and only later take 
two others with him before "telling it to the church?" No. Why? Matthew 18 does 
not apply to such instances. What we have in Galatians chapter two is a 
precedence for publicly handling doctrinal issues and disputes. Scripture is 
replete with such examples.</P>
<P align=justify>Notice, too, that Paul was not nit-picking. Peter was starting 
to undermine the Gospel with rules and regulations thus producing "another 
gospel" and Paul was rightfully concerned. As you read on, you'll see that I am 
not criticizing Joyce over benign doctrines. What she espouses in her book is a 
cancer that has spread within the body of Christ.</P>
<P align=justify>I realize that some folks find it hard to stomach 
confrontation, but we are commanded to "defend the faith, contend for the faith, 
and fight the good fight of the faith." Consider the Apostle Paul's attitude in 
responding to heretics.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P align=justify>"And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut 
    the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal 
    with us in the things they boast about. For such men are false apostles, 
    deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ." 2 Corinthians II: 
    12-13</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>Paul was relentless in his defense of the truth. He would, no 
doubt, be considered a "heresy hunter" by today's Word/Faith Charismatic pastors 
and evangelists. They, like Paul's enemies, want to be considered peers with 
Evangelical pastors and evangelists. The fact that many Evangelicals do consider 
them their peers is regrettable. For,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P align=justify>"Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do 
    righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light 
    have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial ? What 
    does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?" 2 Corinthians 
  6:14-15</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>If Word/Faith Charismatics want to be considered believers, let 
them prove it by renouncing the heresy that is so prevalent within their camp. 
Because of my involvement with the Charismatic movement, I know what I'm talking 
about. I was repeatedly exposed to heresy as a Charismatic. And because of my 
intense involvement in cult research and evangelism for about 9 years, I don't 
feel that I can be criticized as one unfamiliar with sound doctrine.</P><B>
<P align=center>"What Should You Believe?"</B></P>
<P><I>"What Should You Believe?" </I>is the title to chapter 4 (page 35) and the 
chapter I will focus on. Since the book's title implies that its purpose is to 
help someone to make "the most important decision (they) will ever make," we can 
assume that this chapter will discuss the facts whereby they may make an 
intelligent decision.</P>
<P>Joyce writes, "During that time He entered hell, where you and I deserved to 
go (legally) because of our sin. He paid the price there. ...no plan was too 
extreme. ... <U>Jesus paid</U> on the cross and in hell." (Underlining in the 
original) On page 36, she continues....... God rose up from His throne and said 
to demon powers tormenting the sinless Son of God, 'Let Him go.' Then the 
resurrection power of Almighty God went through hell and <B>filled </B>Jesus. 
...He was resurrected from the dead - the first <U>born-again man</U>. 
(Underlining in the original.)</P>
<P>The first subchapter heading is, <U>"WHAT HAPPENED ON THE CROSS?"</U> (Caps 
and underlining in the original) The heading is similar to Kenneth Copeland's 
infamous tape, <I>"What Happened From The Cross To The Throne" (I </I>984) in 
which he goes into great detail about the subject. Copeland apparently borrowed 
the title from E. W. Kenyon's book by the same name as well as the same 
heretical theme. Joyce no doubt has been greatly influenced by both these men. 
Both works are Charismatic "classics."</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In this subchapter she writes, "His spirit went to hell because that is 
  where we deserved to go. Remember in the very beginning of this, I said, 'When 
  you die, only your body dies. The rest of you, your soul and spirit, goes 
  either to heaven or hell."'</P><U>
  <P>"There is no choice of anyone going to heaven unless they believe this 
  truth I am presenting. You cannot go to</U> <U>heaven unless you believe with 
  all your heart that Jesus took your place in hell."</U> (Underlining 
  added.)</P>
  <P>On page 38 she claims, "Jesus went to hell for <U>you."</U> (Underlining in 
  the original)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What she's just covered is the classical (and damnable) Word/Faith 
"Born-Again Jesus Gospel." It's been espoused by the likes of Kenneth Copeland, 
Kenneth Hagin, Fred Price, John Jacobs, Charles Capps, Benny Hinn, Jan Crouch, 
and (locally) David Crank just to name a few. It's usually presented under the 
guise of "revelation knowledge" given by the Holy Ghost and based upon 
Scripture. Odd how none of these folks give credit to the originators of this 
heresy but rather credit (in reality, blame) such blasphemy on the Holy 
Spirit.</P>
<P>Does this message have "the power of God for the salvation of everyone who 
believes it" as Joyce implies. If so, it is the Gospel (Romans 1: 16). And if 
not, it is a "different gospel." (Galatians 1:6-9) Let's see for ourselves as 
good Bereans (Acts 17:1 1).</P>
<P>Let's start with the idea of Jesus in Hell. Charismatics, not understanding 
the Born-Again Jesus Gospel or its implications, try to make their case by 
saying, "Well of course Jesus went to Hell. Doesn't it say so somewhere in the 
book of Acts?"</P>
<P>While it is true that Jesus went to Hell, the real area of attention needs to 
be narrowed down to this: Did He go there to pay for our sins? Payment is the 
issue, not visitation. What kind of payment? According to Joyce and others, it's 
the same kind of payment that took place on the cross! Perhaps even better.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P>"He paid the price there."</P><U>
    <P>"Jesus paid</U> on the cross and in hell." (Underlining in the 
    original)</P>
    <P>"...Jesus took your place in hell."</P>
    <P>"Jesus went to hell for <U>you."</U> (Underlining in the

<P align=center>Enemies Of The Cross</B></P>
<P>Can anything be clearer? Does it sound as if she is "glorying in the cross" 
(Galatians 6:14)? Rather, she and the others share the one common denominator of 
every cult in the whole world; they disparage the cross. Thus they are "enemies 
of the cross of Christ (Philippians 3:18).</P>
<P>Remember this definition. An enemy of the cross is one who implies that the 
work of Jesus Christ on the cross was insufficient for our salvation. Period! 
Their destiny? Destruction! (Philippians 3:19) Thus, no enemy of the cross can 
be my brother in Christ.</P>
<P>Look into it. <I>Every </I>cult disparages the cross. And the cross being the 
core, the very crux of the Gospel makes any message that disparages the cross 
"another gospel."</P>
<P>Think about it, Jehovah's Witnesses view the work of Christ as simply a down 
payment for their salvation. It was not sufficient in and of itself. It must be 
supplemented with a regular serving of field service, literature placement, 
baptism, obedience to dress and hair codes, meeting attendance, and a myriad of 
good works on the "salvation treadmill."</P>
<P>&nbsp;On top of that they claim that the cross is a pagan symbol. Likewise, 
Mormons don't display crosses. Why? They believe that part of the atonement was 
accomplished in the Garden of Gethsemane where "He sweat as it were great drops 
of blood." That's why a Mormon who commits murder must have his own blood shed 
(i.e., firing squad) in order to atone for that particular sin (the dreaded 
Blood, Atonement doctrine).</P>
<P>Reverend Sun Myung Moon teaches that Jesus failed His mission on earth by 
allowing Himself to be crucified.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>"If Jesus had not been crucified, what would have happened? He would have 
    accomplished the providence of salvation both spiritually and 
    physically."</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Oneness Pentecostals teach that it's <I><B>essential </B></I>for one to be 
baptized in order to be saved. The finished work of Christ was not enough. The 
Church of Christ teaches this also. Both groups also add many works that 
salvation hinges upon. Is it any wonder they have no assurance of salvation.</P>
<P>Roman Catholicism teaches Purgatory. Harmless? It's a place of fiery torment 
equal to the flames of Hell where one is purged (i.e., cleansed) of his sins, 
according to official Roman Catholic doctrine. In fact, the Council of Trent 
anathematizes (curses) anyone who believes that the cross is sufficient. Does 
His blood or <B>fire </B>cleanse us? Enough said. What is more important, the 
cross is relegated to Plan A while Purgatory is Plan B for those to whom the 
cross is insufficient.</P>
<P>Let me define a couple of words I've been using to help make my point. 
Disparage means to belittle, diminish, lessen, reduce, devalue, discount, 
impair, lower, degrade, minimize, curtail, or decrease.</P>
<P>To better illustrate this, let's say that a man says, "I love my wife with 
all my heart. (Then whispering) But listen, don't tell anybody, I've got a 
girlfriend on the side." Does he really love his wife with all his heart? How 
can he? It's double talk. He has just disparaged her. Her value to him is less 
than I 00%.</P>
<P>The word insufficient means not enough, not ample, unsatisfactory, or 
inadequate. The adulterous man's wife is not sufficient to meet his 
needs.</P><B>
<P align=center>"It Is</B> <B>Unfinished??"</B></P>
<P>Did Jesus say, "It is unfinished!"? The Greek word for "it is finished' means 
"paid in FULL." What do the cults claim? It was not paid in full. It was merely 
a down payment.</P>
<P>But does the Word/Faith movement teach about the cross?</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>"When Jesus cried, 'It is finished!' He was not speaking of the plan of 
    redemption. There were still three days and nights to go through before He 
    went to the throne ... Jesus's death on the cross was <U>only the beginning 
    of the</U> <U>complete work of redemption."</U> -- Kenneth Copeland 
    (underlining added.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Compare that with this,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>"...when Jesus uttered his last words on the cross, saying, 'It is 
    finished' (John 19:30), he did not mean that the whole purpose of the 
    providence of salvation was attained through the cross. ...Therefore, Jesus 
    meant by the words 'it is finished' that he finished establishing the basis 
    for the providence of spiritual salvation through the cross, which was the 
    secondary providence of salvation." Sun Myung Moon in his work, <I>"Divine 
    Principle"</I> pages 151 and 152.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Do you smell a rat? Copeland also stated, "Satan <I>conquered </I>Jesus on 
the cross..." <I>Holy Bible: Kenneth Copeland</I> <I>Reference Edition </I>page 
129 (italics in the original). Who should we believe, Jesus or Kenneth? Does he 
glory in the cross or disparage it? He not only <I><B>implies </B></I>that it is 
insufficient, he's blatant, bold, and arrogant about it.</P>
<P>Some are apt to argue that Copeland does glory in the cross. While it is true 
that he has tapes and books on the cross and the blood of Christ and talks a 
good talk, it is also true that he disparages the cross. He is no better than 
the adulterous husband who speaks "highly" of his wife. In the book of 
Galatians, Paul portrays men, like Copeland, who accept "another gospel" as 
"confused, led astray, and bewitched."</P>
<P>Likewise, Joyce is just as confused. On page 38, she writes, "...that sinless 
blood had been shed to pay for man's sins." She cannot both glory in the blood 
and disparage it at the same time. Either it paid for our sins or it was merely 
a down payment. Because it can't be both, which is it? If you read the works of 
the major cults you'll find at times that they too speak "highly" of the cross 
and the blood of Christ.</P>
<P>If we can let Copeland and his ilk off the hook, we must also do the same for 
every cult that disparages the cross. For, "Differing weights and differing 
measures -- the LORD detests them both." (Proverbs 20: 1 0 NIV) Either all 
enemies of the cross are destined to destruction or they are our brothers in 
Christ. We can't be choosy based on who gives us the best "Holy Ghost goose 
bumps."</P>
<P>Does Joyce have a problem with the Born-Again Jesus Gospel? Apparently not. 
She endorses the rantings of one of the worst enemies of the cross in the world 
and makes it the main theme of her book, which, by the way, she offers at her 
meetings to lost souls who are looking for the truth.</P><B>
<P align=center>Hot-line Or Hot Air?</B></P>
<P>Worse yet, Charismatics claim to have a "hot-line" to heaven. They receive 
Words, tongues, prophecies, interpretations, dreams, and visions from "God" yet 
why hasn't He bothered to warn them that they're following false brothers, 
wolves in sheep's clothing, enemies of the cross?</P>
<P>Can you imagine a parent watching their son eat rat poisoning and instead of 
warning him of the danger he's in, patting him on the head and saying, "I love 
you son. Keep loving me. I'll always be with you. I will never leave you or 
forsake you"? Not on your life! That parent's first words would be of warning, 
not praise. To my knowledge, nowhere at any time has God ever given one of these 
"great men or women of God" a public word of rebuke for teaching heresy. Why 
not? Because they have turned their backs on God by rejecting His finished work 
upon the cross.</P>
<P>I believe this fact alone voids their claim of having the true gifts of the 
Spirit. I do not discount the existence of the gifts today, I distinguish the 
difference between the real and the counterfeit. Those with the "gifts" ought to 
be the most discerning. The facts prove just the opposite.</P>
<P>Many Charismatic leaders (Paul Crouch for one) endorse Oneness Pentecostals 
as our brothers in Christ yet Oneness Pentecostals deny <I>and </I>attack (not 
question or doubt) the doctrine of the Trinity which classifies them as a cult. 
Just because Oneness Pentecostals seem to "speak in tongues" and have the "gifts 
of the Spirit" doesn't necessarily make it so. God does not bless cults with His 
precious gifts. And Charismatics would know better if they truly had a hot-line 
to heaven.</P>
<P>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons) claims to have 
the gifts of the Spirit. Yet just a few years ago the leadership of the church 
purchased forgeries of what they thought were documents written by Joseph Smith, 
Jr., the founder of their religion. They paid over one million dollars directly 
to the forger because the documents were potentially damaging to the church.</P>
<P>Their intent was to lock them up in a vault in Salt Lake City, Utah as they 
have had a habit of doing for decades. I ask those of you who are Charismatic, 
does this not void their claim to having the gifts? If this is so, what makes 
them any different from Charismatic leaders who, having the "gifts," do not 
realize they are following bonafide enemies of the cross? Perhaps the line is 
dead.</P>
<P>Charismatics are very divisive over their "gifts." They will tell you 
implicitly and explicitly that they are the super Christians because they have 
the gifts. So this is not a test that's to be put off easily. Their "gifts" 
either work or they don't. The bottom line: They fail the test with flying 
colors.</P><B>
<P align=center>Lost And Found Deity</B></P>
<P align=justify>Paul not only warned the Corinthian church of accepting 
"another gospel," he warned them of accepting "another Jesus." (2 Corinthians 
11:4) On page 38, Joyce writes,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P align=justify>"For three days He was alone paying for our sins as 
    <U>"only a man."</U> (underlining in the original)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>Here again she regurgitates the teachings of Kenyon and 
Copeland. It's all part of the myth of Jesus losing His Deity on the cross, 
going to Hell as a <I>mere man, </I>being reborn in Hell, receiving back His 
Deity and thus becoming God once again. Since we are reborn, we too (they 
reason) become "little Gods" (which she does not go into in her book).</P>
<P align=justify>You would think that Hebrews 13:8, which Charismatics are so 
fond of quoting, would prevent this sort of heresy since it says, "Jesus Christ 
is the same yesterday and today and forever." Charismatics frequently quote it 
but do not read out of it what is there (exegesis) but rather read into it what 
is not there (eisegesis).</P>
<P align=justify>Instead of reading that He is immutable (unchangeable,) they 
read it to mean that "Jesus Christ <I>does </I>the same (things) yesterday and 
today and forever." Whenever they quote this verse, its usually in reference to 
healing and miracles. This is just another example of "anointed" Scripture 
twisting.</P>
<P align=justify>And no, Jesus does not do the same things today that He did in 
the past. Let Charismatics provide just <I>one </I>person who having been born 
blind can now see with 20/20 vision.</P>
<P align=justify>It is heresy to say that at some point in time, God ceased 
being Triune in nature. When the nature of Jesus is changed, "another Jesus" is 
produced. Keep in mind that the Gospel is a Who and a what: Who is Jesus and 
what did He do. The theology of the Word/Faith movement, as clearly spelled out 
in Joyce's book, has both "another Jesus" and "another gospel." Lest 
Charismatics think this a minor point, let me point out that the majority of all 
cults have "another Jesus." Not good company to be in.</P><B>
<P align=center>Counterfeit Scripture &amp; Bible Butchering</B></P>
<P>Next, as if enough hasn't been covered, is attributing things to God that He 
never said. Can Joyce or any other Charismatic give me "chapter and verse" where 
God said "Let Him go"? Or as others have said, "It is enough!" Is this not 
mythology? Are their ears itching so much that anything goes?</P>
<P>Charismatic creation of Scripture is nothing new. Who hasn't heard the 
"verse," "No one can come to the Father except the Spirit draws him"? When 
confronted with this "verse," pastors Jeff Perry (St. Louis Family Church) and 
Rick Shelton (Joyce's pastor-Life Christian Center) both reference it as John 
6:44.</P>
<P>The <I>New International Version </I>quotes Jesus as saying, "No one can come 
to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the 
last day."-John 6:44. Where do you see the word "Spirit"? And who is drawing us 
to whom? Sloppy? For a new believer, yes. For a minister of the Gospel, 
unthinkable! Teachers will be judged more strictly for their handling (and 
mishandling) of God's Word.</P><B>
<P align=center>Firstborn = Reborn = Born-Again???</B></P>
<P>Remember, a non-Christian is reading this book and thinking that Joyce Meyer 
knows her Bible better than he does so what she said He said must be so. This is 
not commendable. There are no heavenly brownie points for putting words (and 
doctrines) in God's mouth.</P>
<P>Did the Jesus you and I serve and worship become <I><B>"the first born-again 
man"? </B></I>I believe it was Kenneth Copeland who played biblical 
sleight-of-hand in a paragraph of one of his books where he mentioned 
"firstborn" then "reborn" then "born again" in reference to Jesus' visit to 
Hell. Jesus being the firstborn has absolutely nothing to do with being born 
again. It has to do with His preeminence. Anyone who has studied to show himself 
approved unto God, properly handling the word of truth would not make such a 
grievous error.</P>
<P>Satan seems to enjoy twisting the meaning of the word "firstborn." He's 
taught Jehovah's Witnesses that it means that Jesus is the "first and greatest 
creation of Jehovah God." Ask any JW how he knows that Jesus was only a mere man 
and they'll always bring up the fact that He is called the firstborn. Smell a 
rat yet?</P>
<P>When I first became aware of this aspect of the Born-Again Jesus Gospel, red 
flags went up immediately. My Jesus was not born-again. God does not need to be 
born-again.</P>
<P>Joyce, if she had "studied to show herself approved unto God, a workman who 
does not need to blush with embarrassment, properly handling the word of truth" 
(2 Timothy 2:15 Walter Martin paraphrase), would never believe or teach such 
damnable heresy. The very fact that one would follow enemies of the cross is 
proof that they have not studied to show themselves approved unto God.</P>
<P>What is needed is not a defensive attitude but rather repentance. Neither 
Joyce nor local Word/Faith pastors Rick Shelton, Ron Tucker (Grace Church-St. 
Louis), or Jeff Perry have repented of either teaching or allowing to be taught 
to their flocks such heresies and for allowing them to follow enemies of the 
cross. They have not renounced those who continue to teach them, nor have they 
denounced such damnable doctrines. How then can they win this city (St. Louis, 
MO) for Christ, protect their flocks, equip the saints, or contend for the 
faith? They haven't, they aren't, and they can't. Period!</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>Extracting Some, But Not All, Of The Cancer or How Not 
To Edit Heresy</STRONG></P>
<P>I was notified by a mutual acquaintance that Joyce was corrected by a pastor 
about this book before he would allow her to speak at his church and as a 
result, made some changes in her book. I soon purchased the "Second Printing - 
May, 1993" edition and found that it was definitely revised but found that no 
mention is made of the fact. (Up to this point, I have been quoting from the 
"First Printing - August, 1991" edition.) The only chapter that appears to have 
been changed is chapter four. Some of the Born-Again Jesus Gospel was altered or 
deleted but the bulk of it remained.</P>
<P>Assuming Mrs. Meyer believes that error has been deleted and that the book is 
now clean, this prompts me to ask: Why hasn't she warned anyone to trash the old 
book? Why hasn't she recalled the original edition? Why hasn't she made a note 
in the new edition of her errors in the previous edition? Why has she opted to 
let the changes go by quietly unnoticed? Has she explained to her pastor what 
she's done so that he may publicly repent of allowing her to fall into and teach 
such error in her previous printing of the book?</P>
<P>Or were the changes simply insignificant? Not really worth mentioning? In 
reality, the changes were very significant. She deleted the following <B>bold 
faced </B>words from the second printing,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><B>
    <P>"As God's Spirit left Him." </B>(page 37)</P>
    <P>"...this truth <B>I am presenting." </B>(page 37)</P>
    <P>"Jesus took your place <B>in hell." </B>(page 37)</P>
    <P>"...the Father <B>filled His spirit again. </B>For three days He was 
    alone <B>paying for our sins as </B><U>"only a man." </U><B>The</B> <B>price 
    had to be paid by someone just like us." </B>(page 38, underlining in the 
    original)</P>
    <P>"He went to hell <B>to pay the debt you owed,. </B>(page 4 
  1)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>These deleted portions are indeed significant. They represent a 
mix of doctrines peculiar to the Word/Faith movement's Born Again Jesus Gospel. 
(An odd deletion is the "I am presenting." Whether she explicitly states that 
she is presenting it or not, she is still "presenting" it. And it doesn't become 
more "truth" by this deletion.) But perhaps they are merely minor issues in 
Joyce's mind. By her editorial actions, she seems to be saying, "Yes, having 
Jesus' atonement in Hell is error but nothing to lose any sleep over. In fact, 
it's so trivial that I only edited part of it out of my book." If that's her 
thinking, I must ask, is "another gospel" which sends the lost to Hell a 
doctrine to be treated as a secondary doctrine along with the rapture, baptism, 
eschatology, tithing, or the gifts?</P>
<P align=justify>I don't know why she made any changes at all because the book 
is still poisoned with heresy. If she had a grip on the Gospel (as the title of 
the book declares), she would have publicly repented of <I><B>all </B></I>the 
error published in the first printing, renounced the Born-Again Jesus Gospel, 
and denounced those who still teach it.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify>Some would argue that it's no big deal. Let's check to see 
  what the word of God has to say.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P align=justify>"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one 
    who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different

    you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even 
    if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we 
    preached to you, <I>let </I><B>him be eternally condemned! </B>As we have 
    already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel 
    other than what you accepted, <I>let </I><B>him be eternally condemned!"</B> 
    Galatians 1:6-9</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>Benny Hinn changed his mind about the Born-Again Jesus Gospel 
(but treated it as if it were merely a non-essential issue-no repentance was 
thus necessary.) Perhaps Joyce should at least take a tip from Benny.</P>
<P align=justify>Ask former Jehovah's Witnesses if they left the Watchtower or 
former Mormons if they left The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
because these organizations hold a wrong view on some peripheral doctrine or 
because they proclaim a counterfeit-gospel. They leave as fast as possible 
because the gospel that's presented is counterfeit and therefore deadly.</P><B>
<P align=center>Summary??</B></P>
<P><U>"Summary"</U> is the subchapter heading on page 40. It covers eleven 
points (though unnumbered) which would be considered the Gospel if it weren't 
for the seventh point. It reads, "He went to hell in your place and gained 
victory there, triumphing over the enemy. (Acts 2:3 1)" Since she notes Acts 2:3 
1, let's see what she's referring to. The <I>King James Version</I> reads,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>"He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul 
    was not left in <I>hell, </I>neither his flesh did see 
  corruption."</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>King James Version reads,</P></I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>"Foreseeing, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul 
    was not left in <I>Hades, </I>nor did His flesh see 
  corruption."</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Hades, the realm of departed spirits, consisted of at least two compartments: 
one for the wicked and the other for the righteous. We see this clearly 
illustrated by Jesus Himself in the story (not parable) of the rich man and 
Lazarus (Luke 16:19-3 1). The area for the righteous was also called Paradise 
before Jesus moved its occupants to the third Heaven (Ephesians 4:8-10 and 2 
Corinthians 12:2,4).</P>
<P>Jesus told the thief on the cross, "I tell you the truth, <I><B>today 
</B></I>you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43). How do we reconcile 
passages like these? In interpreting a Scripture like Acts 2:3 1, we use a rule 
of interpretation called the Full Counsel of God, or Scripture Interprets 
Scripture. With it we look at <I>all </I>the passages that deal with a given 
subject to determine what is being said and taught. It's nothing more than 
looking at the overall context of the entire Bible.</P>
<P>We also use a rule that says that vague, unclear, and problematic passages 
are interpreted by the clear passages, not the other way around. These basic 
rules of interpretation are part of what's called hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is 
the science of biblical interpretation. As a Charismatic, I was <I>never 
</I>taught anything about hermeneutics. Properly handling the word of truth is 
foreign to the Word/Faith movement. And it shows.</P>
<P>Having said that, did He pay for our sins and redeem us in Hell or upon the 
cross? It's really very simple. The question is answered by the super-abundance 
of Scriptures that points us to the cross. Most notably, Paul gloried in the 
cross, not hell.</P>
<P>Adding just one work to the finished work of the cross disparages the cross 
thus creating "another gospel." Although the Born-Again Jesus Gospel does not 
require any additional work on the part of the repentant sinner for his 
salvation (as the cults teach), the result is the same. Any work, whether Jesus' 
torment in Hell or our works implies that the work of Christ upon the cross is 
insufficient. Only enemies of the cross disparage the cross. Not true 
Christians. Except for her statement, "He went to hell to pay the debt you 
owed," her summary could be called the Gospel. What a shame.</P><B>
<P align=center>"You Put Up With It Easily Enough"</B></P>
<P>That's what Paul said to the Corinthians for receiving a "different gospel, 
Jesus, and Spirit" (2 Corinthians 11:4). Why then should we put up with someone 
who proclaims a counterfeit-gospel just because they are within the flock? Is 
spiritual cyanide less deadly when it's within the camp of God than when it's on 
the outside? Should we sit idly by wringing our hands? Or worse yet, continue to 
fellowship with those trapped within the kingdom of the cults without so much as 
giving a word of warning?</P>
<P>To those of you who are in the Word/Faith movement, ask yourself what 
"gospel" you accepted in order to be saved? Was it the Born Again Jesus Gospel? 
(i.e., the death, burial, <I><B>torment in hell, born-again in hell, </B></I>and 
bodily resurrection of Christ for our sins.) Or was it the death, burial, and 
bodily resurrection of Christ for our sins? (I Corinthians 15:1-4) Which one do 
you proclaim? Which one will you defend?</P>
<P>Is it true that,</P>

    <P>"There is no hope of anyone going to heaven unless they believe this 
    truth. You cannot go to heaven unless you believe with all your heart that 
    Jesus took your place"? (still referring to hell and not the cross - page 
    37, Second Printing - May, 1993)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Apostle Paul thinks not. And most of all, God thinks not. Joyce Meyer has 
stood the Gospel on its head. She has perverted it beyond recognition. And 
beyond its ability to save.</P>

    <P>"Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for 
    light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for

<P>And woe to those who put "another gospel" for the Gospel! Mrs. Meyer would 
not have made such a grievous statement if she had not gotten her theology from 
a brood of vipers, enemies of the cross of Christ.</P>
<P>Finding Christ is certainly <I>"The Most Important Decision You Will Ever 
Make" </I>but is the information provided in Joyce Meyer's book helpful or 
damnable? Can an intelligent decision be made based upon it? I think not. Just 
as a counterfeit life preserver is useless no matter how strongly and sincerely 
one clings to it, a counterfeit gospel is useless no matter how much faith or 
sincerity is attached to it. Nor is Joyce Meyer's book "A complete and thorough 
understanding of what it means to be born again." It is anything but.</P>
<P>If Charismatics and others who are sympathetic to the Word/Faith movement are 
mad as a result of this review, they should be mad at those who promote 
heresy-not those who expose it. As the Apostle Paul has well said,</P>
