AMBIGUITY OF A WANDERING STAR<BR></FONT><FONT color=#000080 size=6><STRONG>THE 
CHANGING VIEWS<BR>OF JOYCE MEYER<BR></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=center><STRONG>by G. Richard Fisher and Paul R. Belli</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Christians have come to presume that teachers and authors who profess to 
speak and write out of a calling from the Holy Spirit will present a message 
that is doctrinally sound and consistent from sermon to sermon and book to book. 
However, anyone who has watched the Christian Charismatic scene over the past 
several years knows that such a presumption is dangerous and often will fail to 
be borne out.</P>
<P>Joyce Meyer, a rising star on the Charismatic horizon with a weekly program 
on cable TV and the Trinity Broadcasting Network and a new book, <I>The Word, 
The Name, The Blood, </I>is the latest example.</P>
<P>The dust jacket of her latest book highlights her prominence and promises big 
things:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Joyce Meyer is the author of the best-sellers, <I>Beauty for Ashes</I>, 
  <I>The Root of Rejection</I> and <I>Battlefield of The Mind</I>, and has 
  taught on emotional healing and related subjects in meetings all over the 
  country. Her ‘Life in The Word’ radio broadcast is aired on 200 stations 
  nationwide. Her thirty-minute ‘Life in The Word With Joyce Meyer’ television 
  program is broadcast throughout the United States and Canada. She also travels 
  extensively conducting Life in The Word conferences, as well as speaking in 
  local churches.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such prominence might suggest that Meyer has a firm grip on what she 
believes. However, by her own admission, her teachings are evolving. A review of 
her weekly program and tapes reveals that her preaching style, though 
folksy-sounding, is strident, authoritarian, and aggressive. There is no 
uncertainty in her pulpit manners, just a tone of knowing it all. An excerpt 
from one of her tapes goes as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“You know something? I liked myself before I had started studying on this 
  because that’s something God had just worked in me the last seven years. And I 
  didn’t start out liking myself. I didn’t like myself at all. But I’m telling 
  you after I’ve studied this message, I’m so excited about me that I hardly 
  know what to do.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Still, her current book reveals a startlingly different attitude:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Several years ago I found myself completely worn out from trying to fight 
  the devil. I learned many ‘methods’ of spiritual warfare; however, they did 
  not seem to be working ... I had fallen into the trap that many Christians 
  fall into. I had the right teaching, but the wrong order ... I was feverishly 
  applying methods I had learned — like fasting and prayer ... rebuking and 
  resisting evil spirits ... empty formulas which wear us out and produce no 
  results except maybe a sore throat” (<I>The Word, The Name, The Blood</I>, pp. 
  28, 32, 33).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such uncertainty by the teacher can only foster uncertainty in any discerning 
student or would-be student.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>ATONEMENT AMBIGUITIES</STRONG></P>
<P>Meyer can be classified as a Word-Faith teacher and as such has shown an 
inclination to waffle on major doctrines. In her 1991 booklet, <I>The Most 
Important Decision You Will Ever Make</I>, an evangelistic work aimed at 
nonbelievers, she resounds the Word-Faith view of Christ’s atonement:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“During that time He entered hell, where you and I deserved to go (legally) 
  because of our sin. He paid the price there ... no plan was too extreme ... 
  <U>Jesus paid</U> on the cross and in hell” (pg. 35, underlining in the 
  original).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“God rose up from His throne and said to demon powers tormenting the 
  sinless Son of God, ‘Let Him go.’ Then the resurrection power of Almighty God 
  went through hell and filled Jesus ... He was resurrected from the dead — 
  <U>the first born-again man”</U> (pg. 36, underlining in the 
original).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“His spirit went to hell because that is where we deserved to go. Remember 
  in the very beginning of this, I said, ‘When you die, only your body dies. The 
  rest of you, your soul and spirit, goes either to heaven or hell’” 
(ibid.).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“There is no hope of anyone going to heaven unless they believe this truth 
  I am presenting. You cannot go to heaven unless you believe with all your 
  heart that Jesus took your place in hell” (ibid.). </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“Jesus went to hell for <U>you”</U> (pg. 38, underlining in the 
  original).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All of the above citations are from her chapter entitled, “What Should You 
Believe?”. The first subheading in this chapter is “What Happened on the 
Cross?”. Those familiar with Word-Faith vernacular will recall Kenneth 
Copeland’s 1984 tape, “What Happened From the Cross to the Throne.” Copeland 
apparently borrowed the title and theme from E.W. Kenyon’s book by the same 
name.</P>
<P>Meyer teaches the classic “Born-Again Jesus” gospel that has been taught by 
Copeland, Kenneth Hagin, Fred Price, John Jacobs, Charles Capps, Benny Hinn and 
Jan Crouch, to name a few. It’s usually presented under the guise of “revelation 
knowledge,” given by the Holy Spirit and grounded in Scripture. However, this 
gospel does not stand up under biblical scrutiny.</P>
<P>Charismatics many times will make their case by saying, “Jesus went to hell. 
Doesn’t it say so somewhere in the book of Acts?” </P>
<P>While it is true that Jesus went to hell (Ephesians 4:8-9; 1 Peter 3:18), 
attention should be focused on what He did or didn’t do there. Meyer and her 
kind teach that Jesus went there to pay for our sins, it’s the same kind of 
payment — or better — that He made on the cross.</P>
<P>The reader is asked to recall Meyer’s repeated declarations: “He paid the 
price there ... <U>Jesus paid</U> on the cross and in hell ... Jesus took your 
place in hell ... Jesus went to hell for <U>you.”</U></P>
<P>Every cult and pseudo-Christian sect disparages the cross. An enemy of the 
cross is one who even suggests that Jesus Christ’s sacrifice on the cross was 
insufficient for salvation. Anyone who disparages the cross is teaching another 
gospel. The destiny of such teachers is destruction (Philippians 3:19). Based 
upon Christ’s atonement for their sins, Christians are not going to hell. 
Therefore, no enemy of the cross can be a brother in Christ.</P>
<P>A pastor at whose church Meyer was to speak told her about serious concerns 
he had about her booklet. As a result, she has revised parts of it. Meyer’s 
organization labeled the revised booklet “Second Printing - May 1993” but did 
not mention the key theological revisions, which were limited to Chapter Four, 
where the previously cited passages are found. Nevertheless, the revisions leave 
much of the “Born-Again Jesus” doctrine intact. Apparently she has neither tried 
to disavow or recall the first edition nor has she made any mention of the 
revisions in the second printing.</P>
<P>Her now-unavailable tape, “What Happened from the Cross to The Throne?” 
continued to teach the “Born-Again Jesus” doctrine and is a close, if not 
identical, copy of the Kenyon/Copeland theme and title.</P>
<P>In it she stated that at age 36, she received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit 
and sometime later felt a flipping and a turning in her stomach. This, she said, 
led to an understanding of her justification and a deeper revelation of Jesus’ 
spirit death in hell, where He became sin and was tormented by demons. She also 
states that when “God yelled down through the universe, ‘That’s enough. Let Him 
loose,’” Jesus was able to rise. She admits this understanding does not come 
from the Bible, saying it came from our spirit man. Most likely it came from the 
likes of Kenneth Copeland and Kenneth Hagin.</P>
<P>Meyer also declared on the tape that she no longer is a sinner:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“I’m going to tell you something folks, I didn’t stop sinning until I 
  finally got it through my thick head I wasn’t a sinner anymore. And the 
  religious world thinks that’s heresy and they want to hang you for it. But the 
  Bible says that I’m righteous and I can’t be righteous and be a sinner at the 
  same time ... All I was ever taught to say was, ‘I’m a poor, miserable 
  sinner.’ I am not poor, I am not miserable and I am not a sinner. That is a 
  lie from the pit of hell. That is what I was and if I still am then Jesus died 
  in vain. Amen?”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Apostle John says, “If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves 
and the truth is not in us” (1 John 1:8). It is Christ’s righteousness imparted 
to us, not ours, that makes us righteous.</P>
<P>Meyer further adopted the grammatical subterfuge of used by annihilationists 
in her exegesis of Luke 23:43:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“And in Luke 23:43, Jesus said unto him, ‘I say unto you today you shall be 
  in paradise with me.’ There’s no punctuation in the original translations of 
  the Bible. We have punctuated it and in this particular Scripture it was 
  punctuated wrong. They put in there: ‘I say unto you comma today you shall be 
  in paradise with me’ making it appear that the minute Jesus died on the cross 
  He went straight to paradise. No, no no. He did not. The way it should read 
  is: ‘I say unto you today comma. I’m telling you today. Today I’m telling you 
  that you are going to be in paradise with me.’ But He didn’t say, ‘You’re 
  going to be there today.’ He said, ‘I’m telling you this today’” 
(ibid.).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus Meyer has subscribed to the idea that modern Bible translations are 
wrong in quoting Christ: “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in 
paradise.” Meyer’s reading makes way for the union to be some future event. 
However, there would have been no need for Christ to have said, “I say to you 
today,” since the dying man already knew it was today.</P>
<P>PFO wrote to Meyer and asked if the message and theology of the cassette were 
still valid. PFO director Kurt Goedelman received a call from a representative 
of Meyer’s ministry named Paula. Paula told PFO that the tape had been deleted 
from the ministry’s catalog.</P>
<P>PFO was told that because of Meyer’s progression in “revelation knowledge,” 
the message is obsolete and that her latest book is an accurate reflection of 
her current beliefs. Paula, however, was unable to confirm or deny if Meyer 
still subscribed to the gospel of the “Born-Again Jesus.”</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>WORD WIZARDRY</STRONG></P>
<P>Meyer, in her new book, writes, “Words are containers for power” (<I>The 
Name, The Word, The Blood</I>, pg. 37). Word-Faith teachers advocate that 
through speaking and positive affirmations we can create our own reality. They 
usually refer to Genesis 1 and show that God spoke the world into existence and 
extrapolate that we, too, can speak creative words and can speak reality into 
existence.</P>
<P>The fact that the premise breaks down because we are not God does not deter 
Meyer from saying, “Remember then, that the Word of God is both spirit and life, 
use wisdom and begin speaking life to your situation” (ibid., pg. 38).</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>NAME NONSENSE</STRONG></P>
<P>When it comes to the “Name” of Jesus, Meyer admits that she used the “name” 
for many years without “results” (ibid., pg. 47). This suggests we can learn how 
to use the “name” to obtain results. What follows is a mix of truth and error. 
Some of what she says about praying in the name of Jesus and about His name 
being a term for His authority is proper. At various points she lapses and 
transfers all the authority of Jesus directly to the believer. </P>
<P>Christians pray in Jesus’ name and have access to heaven through Jesus but it 
is not true that we, just by use of that name, have “authority over demons, 
sickness, disease, lack and every form of misery” (ibid., pg. 70). It confuses 
the believer with Jesus and reduces His name to a magic word. <I>The Zondervan 
Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible</I> reminds us, “The name here is His person 
and the belief in that name is not magical but it is an acceptance or receiving 
of His messianic person and mission and thereby acquiring the right to enter a 
new relationship with the heavenly Father, John 1:12” (Vol. IV, pg. 365).</P>
<P>The New Testament believers saw the name of Jesus as standing for all He is 
and all He accomplished. To believe in His name was to believe in Him and His 
messianic mission. To speak in His name was to speak with His authority but 
there is no hint of name magic in the New Testament.</P>
<P>If we presume to speak in the name of Jesus, we should be sure that we 
represent the name, character and attributes of that One or we surely take His 
name in vain. A police officer can speak “in the name of the law.” However he 
cannot command what the law forbids. Anything we say or do in the name of Jesus 
must be regulated by the commands and directives of Scripture.</P>
<P align=center><STRONG>BLOOD BALLYHOO</STRONG></P>
<P>In Scripture, blood usually stands for life poured out. Jesus Himself said, 
“The good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep” (John 10:11). Christ’s shed 
blood stands for all the merits secured by His death and the riches of His grace 
given because of His death and resurrection. We focus on Him and the great 
riches of our salvation, not the red fluid.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Meyer’s teaching on Christ’s blood and how to “use” it is 
essentially a repeat of her teaching on how to “use” Jesus’ name, along with a 
repeat of many of the same doctrinal errors. Though Meyer says some things that 
are right about the blood of Christ, she lapses into a magical use of the word 
“blood” much like the relic system and fetish worship of the Middle Ages. For 
example, she writes, “One of the ways we can honor the blood is by singing about 
it, talking about it, studying about it and meditating on it” (pg. 100).</P>
<P>Consider these further statements:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“I know the devil is afraid of the blood” (ibid., pg. 101).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“We must learn to ‘use’ the blood” (ibid., pg. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“My husband and I stay in various hotels because of our travels in 
  ministry. Quite frequently when unpacking and settling into a hotel room I 
  will ‘plead’ the blood or ‘put’ the blood on the room, to cleanse or remove 
  any wrong spirits that may be there from other guests. I do this by praying, 
  by speaking the blood in my prayer” (ibid., pg. 111).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“We laid hands on the check and prayed. I went and got all of our 
  checkbooks and my pocketbook and Dave got his wallet and we laid hands on them 
  and put the blood on them, asking God to protect our money, to cause it to 
  multiply and to see to it that Satan could not steal any of it from us” 
  (ibid.).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“You <I>need</I> to start praying the blood over your children, your car, 
  your home, your body” (ibid., emphasis in original).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“If you are sick in your body, plead the blood over your body. The life is 
  in the blood; it can drive out the death of sickness” (ibid.).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>First Peter 2:24 and Isaiah 53:5 speak of being saved by the “stripes” of 
Jesus, yet Meyer does not speak the stripes, which carry the same connotation of 
life being poured out.</P>
<P>Church hymnology is highly poetic and allegorical. It is understood as that 
whether we sing about “Beulah land,” “the name of Jesus,” or “power in the 
blood,” the lyrics bring theological truths of salvation and redemption into 
view. Hymns and even Bible passages that speak of being saved by the cross are 
not interpreted to say a hunk of wood has any power to save.</P>
<P>Most evangelical commentaries and scholars agree that the idea of Christ’s 
blood is the conveying of an expiatory offering, a propitiatory sacrifice (see 
<I>Barnes Notes on The New Testament</I>, pp. 572-573). Throughout Scripture 
Christ’s blood is equivalent to His death, His sacrifice, His redemption, His 
atonement for sin. The literal blood of Jesus that spattered on the Roman 
soldiers as they scourged His body and nailed His hands and feet did not 
magically save them.</P>
<P>Hebrews 9-10 clearly states that we are saved by Christ’s body, which is 
called His death and sacrifice. It is also true in those chapters that we are 
said to be saved by Christ’s blood, by Christ’s offering and by Christ’s flesh. 
All these words are roughly equivalent and point to the grand theme of 
atonement. </P>
<P>We do not make a fetish out of any of these words or use them in ritual 
incantation or in an empty, repetitive manner.</P>
<P>Meyer’s evolving, changing Word-Faith views are at best aberrant, confusing, 
misleading and unscriptural. Magic words, magic names and magic blood should be 
deplored and seen for what they are: superstition. </P>
<P align=center><STRONG>RESPONSE TO REVIEW</STRONG></P>
<P>The fall 1994 issue of the <I>Christian Sentinel</I>, the newsletter of 
Eastern Christian Outreach, reviewed the doctrine and practice of Meyer based 
upon her series of speaking engagements in the Philadelphia area. Jackie Alnor 
reported that Meyer’s methodology during the visit to the city was patterned 
after the “laughing” spectacles of Rodney Howard-Browne.</P>
<P>In a cassette tape titled, “Like a Mighty Wind,” Meyer responded to the 
<I>Sentinel’s</I> criticism:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“It amazes me, and not only does it amaze me, it aggravates me. These 
  people who think they’ve got a ministry of exposing what’s wrong with 
  everybody else ... Man, I just got written up in a newspaper in Philadelphia 
  ... they mention in this one article, they mention about 5 or 6 or 7 national 
  ministries. I got my own column. Had my own little column in there, telling 
  how I came to the city and I manipulated the people and I did this and that 
  and something else. Oh garbage, garbage, garbage! Why is it that people think 
  that it’s their call to go around and find out what’s wrong with everybody 
  else and print it? Do you know when people were trying to stop Jesus, finally, 
  some very wise man said, ‘Why don’t you just leave us alone? If it’s of God, 
  you’re not gonna stop it. And if it’s not God, it won’t last too long anyway.’ 
  Hallelujah! I mean, that’s just the way I feel about it.”</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Meyer’s incorrect citation of a speech by the rabbi Gamaliel (Acts 5:34-40) 
is a typical Charismatic reply to evaluations directed toward extremes within 
the movement. Only months before, <I>Charisma</I> magazine editor Stephen Strang 
offered the same logic in an editorial about concerns over Rodney Howard-Browne 
(August 1994, pg. 102).</P>
<P>A recent article appearing in Banner Ministries’ <I>Mainstream</I> newsletter 
debunked the use of Gamaliel’s advice:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>“[Gamaliel] concludes that a genuine work of God will succeed, but a 
  religion of human origin will fail. Gamaliel’s logic is seriously flawed 
  because he allows for only two possible sources or explanations for these 
  religious movements — Human or Divine. But there is a <B>third source</B> of 
  which he is ignorant, precisely because it had most likely inspired him to 
  make this very deduction. The Scriptures warn of <B>demonic or Satanic origin 
  to much counterfeit religious belief and even miraculous phenomena</B>. Using 
  Gamaliel’s logic, we would have to conclude that religions such as Islam, 
  Buddhism, Hinduism, and modern cults such as the Mormons, Baha’i and the 
  Jehovah’s Witnesses are all inspired by God because they have not ‘failed’. 
  Communist persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Islamic intolerance of the 
  Baha’i faith did not crush them ... Gamaliel therefore is not a model of godly 
  wisdom that Christians should emulate. His counsel, both in terms of what he 
  advised the Sanhedrin to do and believe, was seriously flawed and most likely 
  inspired by Satan” (Spring 1995, pg. 10, emphasis in original).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Meyer’s citation of the passage also makes it sound as if Gamaliel had been a 
part of the early Church. Meyer says, “Finally, some very wise man said, ‘Why 
don’t you just leave <I>us</I> alone?” However, the clear Word of God states: 
“Therefore, in the present case, I advise you: Leave <I>these men</I> alone” 
(Acts 5:38).</P>
<P>Meyer’s writings and tapes continue to lack solid biblical exposition. Yet 
perhaps next month, next year, or the year after she will have again changed her 
teachings and be spreading different errors and “revelations.” Scripture is 
clear: We are to avoid those who are devoid of sound doctrine and are like 
wandering stars (Jude 12-13).<BR></P>
