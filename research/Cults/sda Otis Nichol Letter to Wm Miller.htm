      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>(Biographical Portion)</P>
      <P>Brother Miller,</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Although a stranger to you and not accustomed to writing I have 
      desired to write you a few words. I have always believed that God called 
      you to preach the definite time of the Lord's coming in1843, and that it 
      was just as it should be; and if time had not been preached then, the 
      church and world would never been effectually warned. . . .</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Within is a part of the vision of E. G. H. of Portland. [The April 
      6, 1846 Broadside]. I fully believe them to be from heaven. The manner and 
      circumstances attending is unlike any thing I have seen or read of since, 
      the days of the Apostles. I would ask you to lay aside prejudice and 
      suspend judgment until you have read and compared them with the <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">scripture, and present truth.</SPAN> And if they speak 
      not according to this word <SPAN style="COLOR: red">(and present 
      truth)</SPAN> it is because there is no light in them. Isa 8:20. Despise 
      not prophesyings, prove all things, hold<B> </B>fast that which is good. 
      1Thess 5:20, 21. Visions are either from heaven Acts 10:9-1-6 or from 
      satan Deut 18:22. Many of them at the present time are undoubtably satan's 
      counterfeit, so of course there is a true coin. We are to judge of them by 
      their fruits according to the bible and the truth. If they are from heaven 
      with a command to make it known to others, God will hold all accountable 
      that hear. We are told in Deut 18:22: But many now say that every vision 
      has failed. Well this is fulfilling Exe 12:22-28. That proverb has been 
      used to perfection for a few months past in the land of Israel saying the 
      days are prolonged and every vision faileth.<U> </U>But God says "I will 
      make this proverb to cease" with "the effect of every vision."</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>The first vision of E. G. H. was in the fall of 1844 which never 
      was published to the world. It was a view of the travels of the advent 
      company from the 7th mo, 44 and so far as fulfilled they have had as 
      perfect a fulfillment as could possible be especially in most [?]advent 
      bands, and individuals wherever we are acquainted. Her calling was most 
      remarkable only 17 years of age sick with a dropsical consumption and 
      confined to the house for most of the time, for 5 years and been given 
      over by physicians to die. In this state God called her and told her to go 
      out and tell the flock what he had revealed to her -- that an angel 
      should&nbsp;</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: right" align=right>54</P>
      <P>accompany her all the time and sometimes two in time of need ---that no 
      wicked power on earth should have dominion over her if she would obey the 
      Lord.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>At the time she first went out to deliver her message (Jany) 1845) 
      she was scarcely able to walk across the room and could not speak with an 
      audible voice, but she had perfect faith in God and was carried in this 
      state a few miles to deliver her message and when she came to speak her 
      voice was nearly gone but God fulfilled his word: gave her strength of 
      body and a clear loud audible voice to talk nearly two hours with 
      tremendous power and effect on the people and without fatigue of body, and 
      from that time for many weeks she continued to travel day and night 
      talking almost every day until she had visited most of the advent bands in 
      Maine and the easterly parts of New Hampshire.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Her message was always attended with the Holy Ghost, and wherever 
      it was received as from the Lord it broke down and melted their hearts 
      like little children, fed, comforted, strengthened the weak, and 
      encouraged them to hold on to the faith, and the7th month 
      movement<B>;<SPAN style="COLOR: red"> <A name=warrants></A><A 
      name=workdone><SPAN style="mso-bookmark: warrants">and that our work was 
      done for the nominal church and the world, and what remained to be done 
      was for the household of faith.</SPAN></A></SPAN></B> Those that rejected 
      her message very soon fell into the world<B> </B>and a nominal faith, and 
      those that did receive her testimony<B> </B>as from the Lord and afterward 
      denyed it calling it mesmerism or an unholy thing, are many of them like 
      those that are given over to strong delusion and working of Satan ---a 
      ship without a<I> </I>helm or anchor and driven by every wind, thus 
      causing the way of truth to be evil spoken of.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>This class of persons are her greatest enemies, and have done what 
      they could by calumny, and lies, to destroy her influence and character. 
      But God has hitherto protected her in a remarkable manner from all harm; 
      raised up benefactors for her wherever she goes not<I> </I>withstanding 
      the malice of wicked spirits and fallen Adventists: through their 
      influence <B><SPAN style="COLOR: red">there has been a number of warrants 
      for her arrest</SPAN></B><SPAN style="COLOR: red"> </SPAN>but God has 
      signally protected her; at one time a sheriff and a number of men with him 
      had no power over her person for an hour and an half, although they 
      exerted all their bodily strength to move her, while she or no one else 
      made any resistance.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>What I have here written I have a knowledge of and think I can 
      judge correctly. Sister E. has been a resident in my family much of the 
      time for about 8 months.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>I have never seen the least impropriety of conduct in her since our 
      first acquaintance. God has blessed our family abundantly with spiritual 
      things as well as temporal since we received her into our family. The 
      spirit of God is with her and has been in a&nbsp;</P>
      <P style="TEXT-ALIGN: right" align=right>55</P>
      <P>remarkable manner in healing the sick through the answer of her 
      prayers; some cases are as remarkable as any that are recorded in the New 
      Testament. But prejudiced and unbelieving persons find it just as 
      convenient to call it mesmerism and ascribe the power to the devil, as the 
      unbelieving Pharisees did Mat 10:25, 12:24. Is not this sin against the 
      Holy Ghost?<I> </I>See<B><I> </I></B>Mark 3.22, 29, 30. That power which 
      is manifested in her, as far exceeds the power of mesmerism as Moses did 
      the magicians of Egypt. The devil has as much power to imitate and 
      counterfeit the work of God as he did in Moses time and the people can be 
      deceived if they will.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false 
      prophets are gone out into the world 1 John 4:1. To the <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">law and the testimony:</SPAN> if <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">they speak not</SPAN> according <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">to this word it is because there is no light in 
      them</SPAN> Is 8:20: If the thing follow not nor <SPAN 
      style="COLOR: red">come to pass</SPAN> that is the thing which the Lord 
      hath not spoken Deut 18:22. In conclusion the bible has always been a lamp 
      to my feet, and a light to my path for 4 years and is so still, and I 
      desire it should be until Jesus comes the second time to redeem the 
      purchased possession and our vile bodies, <SPAN style="COLOR: red">which I 
      believe will be very soon.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
