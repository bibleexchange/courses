            flesh (Romans 1:3) and the very God Himself according to the Spirit 
            (Matthew 1:23). Jesus is the Christ (Matthew 16:16); the creator of 
            all things (Colossians 1:16-17); God with us (Matthew 1:23); God 
            made flesh (John 1:1-14); God manifested in the flesh (I Timothy 
            3:16);He which was, which is, and which is to come, the Almighty 
            (Revelation 1:8);the mighty God, everlasting Father, and Prince of 
            peace (Isaiah 9:6).<BR>Jesus Himself testified of His identity as 
            God when He said, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (John 
            14:7-11) and "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30).<BR>It took 
            shedding of blood for the remission of the sins of the world 
            (Hebrews 9:22), but God the Father was a Spirit and had no blood to 
            shed. Thus He prepared a body of flesh and blood (Hebrews 10:5)and 
            came to earth as a man in order to save us, for in Isaiah 43:11 He 
            said, "Beside me there is no Saviour." When He came in flesh the

            <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Salvation consists of deliverance from 
            all sin and unrighteousness through the blood of Jesus Christ. The 
            New Testament experience of salvation consists of repentance from 
            sin, water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the 
            remission of sins, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, after which 
            the Christian is to live a godly life (Acts 2:36-41).</FONT>

            <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Water baptism is an essential part of New 
            Testament salvation and not merely a symbolic ritual. It is part of 
            entering into the kingdom of God (God's church, the bride of 
            Christ), and therefore, it is not merely a part of local church 
            membership. (See John 3:5; Galatians 3:27).</FONT>

            size=2>Water baptism is to be administered only by immersion. Paul 
            said, "We are buried with him [Jesus Christ] by baptism (Romans 6:4; 
            see Colossians 2:12), Jesus came up "out of the water" (Mark 1:10), 
            and Philip and the eunuch went down "into the water" and came up 
            "out of the water" (Acts 8:38-39).<BR>Jesus' death, burial, and 
            resurrection are applied to our lives when we experience New 
            Testament salvation: "Repent [death to sin], and be baptized 
            [burial] every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the 
            remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost 
            [resurrection]." (See Acts 2:38; Romans 6:1-7; 8:2).<BR>Sprinkling, 
            pouring, or infant baptism of any kind cannot be substantiated by 
            the Word of God, but are only human traditions.</FONT>

            size=2>The name in which baptism is administered is vitally 
            important, and this name is Jesus.<BR>Jesus' last command to His 
            disciples was, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing 
            them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy 
            Ghost" (Matthew 28:19). We should notice that He said name 
            (singular) not names. As previously explained, Father, Son, and Holy 
            Ghost are not names of separate persons, but titles of positions 
            held by God. An angelic announcement revealed God's saving name in 
            the New Testament: "She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call 
            his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins" 
            (Matthew 1:21).<BR>The apostles understood that Jesus was the name 
            to use at baptism, and from the day that the church of God was 
            established (the Day of Pentecost) until the end of their ministry, 
            they baptized all nations (Jews--Acts 8:16; Gentiles--Acts 19:5) in 
            the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.<BR>In fact, Jesus is the only 
            name given for our salvation. "Neither is there salvation in any 
            other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men,

            <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The baptism of the Holy Ghost is the 
            birth of the Spirit (John 3:5). This spiritual baptism is necessary 
            to put someone into the kingdom of God (God's church, the bride of 
            Christ) and is evidenced by speaking in other tongues (other 
            languages) as the Spirit of God give utterance.<BR>It was prophesied 
            by Joel (Joel 2:28-29) and Isaiah (Isaiah 28:11), foretold by John 
            the Baptist (Matthew 3:11), purchased by the blood of Jesus, and 
            promised by Him to His disciples (John 14:26; 15:16). The Holy Ghost 
            was first poured out on the Day of Pentecost upon the Jews (Acts 
            2:1-4), then upon the Samaritans (Acts 8:17), and later upon the 
            Gentiles (Acts 10:44-46; 19:6). "The promise is unto you, and to 
            your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the 
            Lord our God shall call" (Acts 2:39).</FONT>

              self-edification (I Corinthians 14:4) and for the edification of 
              the church (I Corinthians 14:27-28).<BR>In church meetings the 
              gift of tongues is used to give a public message, and it is to be 
              interpreted. Since this gift can be misused in public, it needs 
              proper regulation (I Corinthians 14:23-28). Not all believers 
              exercise the gift of tongues, which is different in function from 
              tongues given by God as the initial witness of the baptism of the 
              Holy Ghost.<BR>Paul said, "Forbid not to speak with tongues" (I 
              Corinthians 14:39) and "I thank my God, I speak with tongues more
