              edifying believers as well as sounding a faithful warning 
              regarding false teaching and movements in these deceptive last 
              days. All scriptural references and quotes are based on the King 
              James Version. Because the F.E.A. provides these materials at or 
              below cost, it is far more economical to order the actual printed

              <P><BIG><STRONG><BIG>A </BIG>movement called Promise 
              Keepers</STRONG></BIG> is sweeping our nation like a wildfire. Is 
              it of God, or man? Will it solve the problems of those who have 
              embraced its principles and teachings, or will it compound those 
              problems? Can a Biblical answer be given to those important 
              questions now, or is it best to withhold judgment until a later 
              time? </P>
              <P>Obviously, some very conflicting views already exist as to the 
              basis, programs, benefits and goals of the Promise Keepers 
              movement. This report is based upon the actual words of its 
              leaders made in public meetings, contained in press releases, or 
              printed in books, magazines and articles which have either been 
              published or endorsed by leaders of the Promise Keepers movement. 
              It is obvious that this movement is superbly organized and has 
              tremendous financial resources at its disposal. The way it has 
              caught on since its formation in 1990, and its ambitious plans for 
              expansion in the future, require our immediate response and 
              warning.</P>
              <P>Most pastors and other individuals have so far heard only good 
              reports about it. Even though some have questions and a feeling of 
              uneasiness concerning it, they have had little or no opportunity 
              to examine it carefully. While it is true that most if not all of 
              the major evangelical and charismatic leaders are praising, 
              supporting and participating in Promise Keepers, that, in itself 
              is no guarantee that its principles, practices and goals are in 
              accord with the Scriptures. Having personally read every word of 
              the book, Seven Promises of a Promise Keeper, as well as all the 
              latest press releases and many of their other articles, we have 
              come to the inescapable conclusion that this movement represents 
              another massive effort of Satan to mix truth and error in some 
              very deceptive ways.</P>
              <P>Therefore, we do not hesitate to give the strongest possible 
              warning now concerning the dangers of the Promise Keepers 
              movement. Our reasons will be clearly stated and properly 
              documented from original sources so that God’s people may be able 
              to see for themselves how this new movement is mixing truth and 
              error. If for no other reason, the Promise Keepers movement is 
              dangerous because it promotes an unscriptural agenda of forging a 
              religious unity which is absolutely forbidden in God’s Word (2 
              Cor. 6:14-7:1; Eph. 5:11). Its founder and several of its leaders 
              are part of the charismatic movement which is a major catalyst in 
              the effort to bring about fellowship and eventual union with the 
              Roman Catholic Church; whereas, in truth, the Roman Catholic 
              Church is a false church, preaches a false gospel and is not a 
              part of the body of Christ.</P>
              <P>Throughout the centuries, the Roman Catholic Church has been an 
              enemy of all true believers and the blood of hundreds of thousands 
              of martyrs is upon its hands. However, for the past few decades, 
              the Roman Catholic Church has changed its outward appearance and 
              approaches. It has a new face of tolerance and a kindlier public 
              image but the damnable heresies it proclaims remain as dangerous 
              as ever. Furthermore, those who are only familiar with Roman 
              Catholicism, as practiced in this country, would not believe the 
              raw heathenism which is part of their worship in countries where 
              they have been in control for centuries.</P>
              <P>It should be of great concern to every believer to know that 
              the Promise Keepers movement is taught and led by men who blindly 
              praise the Pope and are giving Roman Catholicism an undeserved and 
              unwarranted vote of confidence and even appreciation instead of 
              sounding the warnings God’s Word commands. </P>
              <P>The Promise Keepers movement and its leaders totally reject the 
              many plain commands of Scripture to separate from and warn about 
              false teachers, disobedient brethren and the world. 2 Corinthians 
              6:14-18; 2 Thessalonians 3:6,14,15; 1 John 2:15-17. As a result, 
              those whom they seek to "disciple" are deprived of the warnings 
              God’s Word says are necessary to preserve the purity of the Gospel 
              and the purity of the church. Instead of obeying the command of 
              God’s Word to "preach no other doctrine" (1 Tim. 1:3); and by 
              refusing to heed the warning God gives in Galatians 1:6-10 
              concerning all who preach "any other Gospel," they have become 
              "blind leaders of the blind" about which Jesus Christ warned 
              (Matt. 15:10-14). Since the inevitable result of such spiritual 
              blindness is that "both shall fall into the ditch," the strongest 
              warning must be given.</P>
              <P>Seven Promises of a Promise Keeper is the title of a book 
              published in 1994 by "Focus on the Family," Colorado Springs, CO., 
              and distributed in the USA and Canada by "Word Books," Dallas, TX. 
              It is key to the understanding of what Promise Keepers is trying 
              to do. Contributing authors are: Bill Bright, Edwin Cole, Dr. 
              James Dobson, Tony Evans, Bill McCartney, Luis Palau, Randy 
              Phillips, Gary Smalley, Jack Hayford, Wellington Boone, Howard 
              Hendricks, E. Glenn Wagner, Gary Oliver, Dale Schlafer, H. B. 
              London, Jr., Philip Porter, and Gordon England. This 210-page book 
              was edited by Al Janssen and Larry K. Weeden.</P>
              <P>"Seven solid promises that will change a man’s life forever" -- 
              This bold claim, printed on the back jacket of this book, only 
              serves to heighten the need for an immediate, Scriptural analysis 
              of the Promise Keepers movement; for, indeed, these seven promises 
              are not solidly based upon the sure foundation of God’s Word 
              alone, but upon a mixture of God’s Word with the suppositions of 
              men.</P>
              <P>WHAT ARE THE SEVEN PROMISES?</P>
              <P>Promise one...a man and his God: A Promise Keeper is committed 
              to honoring Jesus Christ through worship, prayer, and obedience to 
              God’s Word in the power of the Holy Spirit.</P>
              <P>Promise two...a man and his mentors: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to pursuing vital relationships with a few other men, 
              understanding that he needs brothers to help him keep his 
              promises.</P>
              <P>Promise three...a man and his integrity: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to practicing spiritual, moral, ethical, and sexual 
              purity.</P>
              <P>Promise four... a man and his family: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to building strong marriages and families through love, 
              protection, and biblical values.</P>
              <P>Promise five...a man and his church: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to supporting the mission of the church by honoring and 
              praying for his pastor, and by actively giving of his time and 
              resources.</P>
              <P>Promise six...a man and his brothers: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to reaching beyond any racial and denominational 
              barriers to demonstrate the power of biblical unity.</P>
              <P>Promise seven...a man and his world: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to influencing his world, being obedient to the Great 
              Commandment (see Mark 12:30,31) and the Great Commission (see 
              Matthew 28:19, 20).</P>
              <P>At first glance, it is not difficult to understand why most 
              Christians might feel that the Promise Keepers movement is greatly 
              needed and should be encouraged and supported. Without question 
              there is a great need today for Godly men who will assume their 
              responsibilities in the home, in the church and in the world. 
              However, a careful examination of the programs and goals as set 
              forth by its leaders in public and in print, and by comparing 
              these with the Scriptures, it becomes clear that discerning 
              believers must raise serious questions now concerning this rapidly 
              growing men’s movement. </P>
              <P>The emphasis upon self-effort within the Promise Keepers 
              program supplants absolute dependence upon the Lord Jesus Christ. 
              Only God can unfailingly keep a promise. Therefore those in the 
              movement will face disillusionment and disappointment because of 
              their failure to look to God and His promises alone. </P>
              <P>Before giving an analysis of the Promise Keepers movement in 
              the light of the Scriptures, we trust it will be helpful to 
              mention several basic issues which should not be disregarded nor 
              treated lightly.</P>

              <P>• Acceptance and promotion of unscriptural Charismatic 
              teachings.</P>
              <P>• Approval and use of psychological approaches and 
              techniques.</P>
              <P>• Use and promotion of corrupted modern versions of the 
              Bible.</P>
              <P>• Twisting, misapplying, and misinterpreting key 
Scriptures.</P>
              <P>• A program stressing the importance of evangelism while 
              ignoring the need of a pure gospel.</P>
              <P>• A subtle and very harmful influence upon local churches which 
              have heretofore resisted unscriptural programs and 
fellowships.</P>
              <P>Are the promises demanded of the Promise Keepers Scriptural? A 
              careful review of their Seven Promises clearly reveals that a 
              mixture of truth and error is involved. For instance:</P>
              <P>Promise One -- A man and his God: A Promise Keeper is committed 
              to honoring Jesus Christ through worship, prayer, and obedience to 
              God’s Word in the power of the Holy Spirit.</P>
              <P>(Analysis): Technically, and if these words are understood in 
              their scriptural and historical meaning, any true believer -- man 
              or woman -- would gladly support such a statement. However, we 
              live in days when wonderful words like these are being abused and 
              misused.</P>
              <P>For example, in the first chapter of the book, Seven Promises 
              of a Promise Keeper, Charismatic leader Dr. Jack Hayford sets 
              forth some precious truths concerning the different aspects of 
              worship as set forth in the Scriptures. However, when he writes 
              about "Redeeming Worship" on page 19, he teaches serious error. 
              Hayford writes: "Redeeming worship centers on the Lord’s Table. 
              Whether your tradition celebrates it as Communion, Eucharist, the 
              Mass, or the Lord’s Supper, we are all called to this centerpiece 
              of Christian worship."</P>
              <P>Is there any difference between the Eucharist and the Mass 
              (celebrated by Roman Catholics and Orthodox), and the Lord’s 
              Table, Lord’s Supper and Communion observed by true believers? Of 
              course there is! Historically the mass has been recognized by 
              Bible believers as blatant blasphemy. Yet, today, Hayford, like 
              other Charismatic* leaders, is teaching Promise Keepers and others 
              that this false view of Christian worship is approved by God and 
              proper for all Christians to accept. Promise One has the right 
              words but the wrong application. Many other examples could be 
              cited of errors concerning prayer and the ministry of the Holy 
              Spirit which are believed and taught by Charismatic leaders. We 
              have to ask, "How could anyone possibly promise to obey God’s Word 
              and in the same breath disobey that Word?" It is this 
              inconsistency and incongruity that makes Promise Keepers a 
              deceptive movement.</P>
              <P>Promise Two -- A man and his mentors: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to pursuing vital relationships with a few other men, 
              understanding that he needs brothers to help him keep his 
              promises.</P>
              <P>(Analysis): How very dangerous is this false premise which is 
              based upon psychological theories rather than on Biblical 
              principles. Of course Godly men can be of help to others and be 
              helped by others. But to encourage the false notion that a godly 
              man cannot make it on his own in these tumultuous times without 
              depending upon other Promise Keepers to help keep him "on the 
              right track" is another trick of Satan to belittle the power of 
              God and negate His "...great and precious promises" (2 Pet. 1:3, 
              4). </P>
              <P>God’s Word repeatedly warns about the danger of putting trust 
              in men. Isaiah 2:22, "Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his 
              nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?" Jeremiah 17:5, 
              "Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and 
              maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord." By 
              contrast, note Jeremiah 17:7, "Blessed is the man that trusteth in 
              the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." God’s Word clearly commands 
              us to "...have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3). God 
              specifically warns in 1 Corinthians 10:12, "Wherefore let him that 
              thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." Those who disregard 
              God’s warnings are surely headed for a fall. </P>
              <P>Promise Three -- A man and his integrity: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to practicing spiritual, moral, ethical, and sexual 
              purity.</P>
              <P>(Analysis): Once again, here is a statement that all Christians 
              should desire to see fulfilled in their lives, not just the men 
              but women also. But if the men have to depend on their brothers to 
              attain these goals, what about the women? Will a women’s Promise 
              Keepers movement also become a necessity and be established as the 
              newest women’s movement on the scene?</P>
              <P>In fact, however, the spiritual, moral, ethical and sexual 
              purity needed by every believer is not to be found in making 
              boastful promises nor in dependence upon other believers but can 
              only be obtained by heeding the Word of God which says, "Whereby 
              are given unto us [all of us!] exceeding great and precious 
              promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine 
              nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through 
              lust" (2 Peter 1:4). It is the promises of God that are 
              all-important and they assure divine power to accomplish His 
              purpose of godliness in an ungodly day, not the promises of even 
              the finest, most sincere men who attempt to formulate what they 
              believe is needed to change men and then the world. </P>
              <P>Promise Four -- A man and his family: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to building strong marriages and families through love, 
              protection, and biblical values.</P>
              <P>(Analysis): Here is another promise which is certainly 
              desirable as stated. However, the question which must be asked and 
              answered concerns just what are these "biblical values?" A careful 
              study of Promise Keepers literature reveals that their programs 
              are based upon some Biblical values given by God, but are also 
              mixed with some very dangerous psychological principles and 
              practices which rest upon the theories of men. This unsound 
              material will continue to flow into churches long after the 
              initial excitement of the program wanes.</P>
              <P>Promise Five -- A man and his church: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to supporting the mission of the church by honoring and 
              praying for his pastor, and by actively giving of his time and 
              resources.</P>
              <P>(Analysis): Whether such a promise is scriptural or 
              unscriptural depends entirely upon which church is involved. Is it 
              a church which proclaims a false gospel (such as the Roman 
              Catholic, Orthodox and liberal Protestant churches)? Is it a 
              church which is disobedient to God’s Word by its fellowship with 
              false teachers and those who "love the world"? (1 John 2:15-17). 
              If so, to "support the mission of such a church, honoring and 
              praying for its pastor, and actively giving of his time and 
              resources" is helping to build the one-world harlot church of the 
              antichrist. Promise Keepers ignore the plain commands of God’s 
              Word concerning separation from those who teach error, and fail to 
              "reprove" such (Eph. 5:11). As a result, the men in the Promise 
              Keepers movement are totally unprepared to stand against all the 
              "wiles of the devil" (Eph. 6:11).</P>
              <P>Promise Six -- A man and his brothers: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to reaching beyond any racial and denominational 
              barriers to demonstrate the power of biblical unity.</P>
              <P>(Analysis): This required promise once again mixes truth and 
              error and provides another example of how the word "biblical" is 
              misused. While reaching beyond racial barriers is Scriptural, 
              reaching beyond denominational barriers as Promise Keepers are 
              doing amounts to open defiance of God’s plain commands. It is not 
              "biblical unity" which Promise Keepers think they are 
              demonstrating, but an unbiblical unity which will bring God’s 
              eventual judgment. 2 Peter 2:1-3.</P>
              <P>Should anyone doubt the fact that the Promise Keepers movement 
              seeks an unbiblical unity, just read the words of its founder, 
              Coach Bill McCartney, as found on pages 160, 161 of Seven Promises 
              of a Promise Keeper: "Now, I don’t mean to suggest that all 
              cultural differences and denominational distinctives are going to 
              disappear. But what I know is that Almighty God wants to bring 
              Christian men together regardless of their ethnic origin, 
              denominational background, or style of worship. There’s only one 
              criterion for this kind of unity: to love Jesus and be born of the 
              Spirit of God. Can we look one another in the eye -- black, white, 
              red, brown, yellow, Baptist, Presbyterian, Assemblies of God, 
              Catholic [emphasis ours], and so on -- and get together on this 
              common ground: ‘We believe in salvation through Christ alone, and 
              we have made Him the Lord of our lives’? Is that not the central, 
              unifying reality of our existence? And if it is, can we not focus 
              on that and call each other brothers instead of always emphasizing 
              our differences? Men, we have to get together on this!"</P>
              <P>In this statement, McCartney’s contradictory words should be 
              noted concerning the necessity of believing in salvation through 
              Christ alone -- and then including Roman Catholics as "brothers" 
              in spite of the fact that they do not believe in salvation through 
              Christ alone, adding sacraments and good works as requirements for 
              salvation.</P>
              <P>Promise Seven -- A man and his world: A Promise Keeper is 
              committed to influencing his world, being obedient to the Great 
              Commandment (see Mark 12:30, 31) and the Great Commission (see 
              Matthew 28:19, 20).</P>
              <P>(Analysis): The Great Commandment referred to in Mark 12:30, 31 
              records the words of Jesus Christ in which love to God and love to 
              one’s neighbor are commanded. However, Promise Keepers presents a 
              faulty understanding of genuine Christian love in which 
              reconciliation with a disobedient brother is insisted upon, 
              whereas, in truth, separation from disobedient brethren is 
              commanded by God (2 Thess. 3:6, 14, 15). In these days of 
              increasing compromise, Satan has succeeded in blinding the eyes of 
              many believers to the fact that separation from disobedient 
              brethren is not only for the preservation of a pure church, but is 
              also for the disobedient brother’s spiritual welfare. Promise 
              Keepers’ mistaken premise that genuine Christian love necessitates 
              fellowship with, rather than separation from disobedient brethren, 
              will do untold harm.</P>
              <P>The Great Commission referred to in Matthew 28:19, 20 involves 
              not only the preaching of the Gospel, but also teaching those who 
              believe "...to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded 
              you." Giving the impression that it does not matter what church is 
              attended or what doctrinal creed is embraced by any true believer 
              is foolish -- it does matter to God and a warning against error 
              must be given. The apostle Paul, one of the greatest evangelists, 
              pastors, missionaries, and teachers of all time, writing by 
              inspiration of the Holy Spirit in Acts 20:17-32, reminded the 
              Ephesian elders that he had not shunned to declare "all the 
              counsel of God" (v. 27), warning "every one night and day with 
              tears" for three years (v. 3l). What were these warnings about? 
              The grievous wolves (false teachers) who would enter in, "not 
              sparing the flock" (v. 29), and those from within the church who 
              would arise, "speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples 
              after them" (v. 30). Separation from, not reconciliation with such 
              false teachers, is God’s way of preserving the purity and power of 
              the church.</P>
              <P>Much of the strong appeal of the movement is based upon 
              humanistic psychological principles and techniques. Many of its 
              leaders, however, have become very proficient in using such 
              dangerous theories even while claiming to repudiate humanistic 
              psychology. In another of Satan’s "dangerous mixture" deceptions, 
              the term "Christian Psychologist" has mesmerized its proponents 
              into believing that it is possible to take the "good things" from 
              humanistic psychology and combine these with Biblical teachings. 
              The result supposedly provides answers to problems Christians are 
              experiencing which can be found in no other way. As a result, Dr. 
              James Dobson, who is one of the Promise Keepers leaders, and other 
              well-known "Christian Psychologists" such as Gary Smalley, John 
              Trent, and Robert Hicks are leading many astray.</P>
              <P>We fully concur with the statement of Martin and Deidre Bobgan 
              on page 29 of their 41-page booklet, "Promise Keepers &amp; 
              PsychoHeresy." We quote: "If men are to come together as men, they 
              would do well to follow what the Bible says rather than Freudian 
              fables, Jungian myths, and other self-serving, man-made 
              psychologies. And they would do well to gather together in the 
              place where they are meant to grow -- in the local church -- not 
              in huge rallies with "mob psychology" or in groups using encounter 
              group techniques and undermining important doctrinal 
              distinctives." For a comprehensive and Biblical analysis of the 
              highly-questionable book, The Masculine Journey -- Understanding 
              The Six Stages of Manhood, which has been given massive 
              distribution to Promise Keepers, write to PsychoHeresy Awareness 
              Ministries, 4137 Primavera Rd., Santa Barbara, CA 93112. A second 
              book, Against Biblical Counseling &amp; For the Bible (200 pages) 
              will also be very helpful to all those who want the facts 
              concerning the dangers of Christian Psychology.</P>
              <P>Our own publication, "The House That Freud Built," will provide 
              valuable information concerning the dangers of "sensitivity 
              training" and "small group" psychological techniques as devised 
              for those who claim to be evangelical believers. This 40-page 
              booklet gives the history of how "sensitivity training" was 
              introduced into evangelical churches. Originally printed in the 
              September/October 1994 issue of Foundation, this reprint will be 
              an eye opener to all who want to know the truth.</P>
              <P>What does Promise Keepers say about its history and future 
              plans? The following information is quoted in full from the Fact 
              Sheet which was part of the official press packet prepared in 
              January 1995:</P>
              <P>How we started: On March 20, 1990 University of Colorado Head 
              Football Coach Bill McCartney and his friend Dave Wardell, Ph.D 
              were on a three-hour car ride to a Fellowship of Christian 
              Athletes meeting in Pueblo, CO, when the idea of filling a stadium 
              with Christian men first came up. Later in 1990, seventy-two men 
              began to pray and fast about the concept of thousands of men 
              coming together for the purpose of Christian discipleship.</P>
              <P>Yearly attendance figures as given in this Fact Sheet testify 
              to its small beginning and rapid growth.</P>
              <P>1991 -- 4,200 men met at the Univ. of Colorado Events Center; 
              1992 -- 22,000 men met at CU’s Folsom Stadium; 1993 -- 50,000 
              filled Folsom Stadium to capacity; 1994 -- Seven sites nationwide 
              totaling 278,600 men. 1995 Plans: Promise Keepers scheduled 13 
              conferences across the United States. Total attendance for these 
              13 conferences was between 500,000 and 600,000.</P>
              <P>Why "For men only": The conferences are designed for specific 
              men’s issues in the context of an all-male setting. We have 
              discovered that men are more apt to hear and receive the full 
              instruction of the sessions when they are not inhibited by concern 
              for a woman’s responses. One of the primary goals of the 
              conference is to deepen the commitment of men to respect and honor 
              women.</P>
              <P>(Analysis): Yes, Promise Keepers is a rapidly growing movement. 
              1996 included bringing together 75,000 clergy for a Conference in 
              Washington, D.C. In Promise Keepers literature, repeated 
              references are made to the supposition, "There is strength in 
              numbers." But where is such a false idea supported in Scripture? 
              God usually had to reduce the numerics of Israel’s armies so they 
              would not become proud and take glory unto themselves for 
              victories won -- glory which belonged to God. Read the record of 
              Gideon in Judges 7:1-22 as a prime example. Of course, in our day, 
              the great majority of professing Christians are willing to 
              compromise Biblical principles, mistakenly assuming that size is 
              all-important to God as it is to men. That is a grievous error. 
              Fidelity to the Truth is essential.</P>

              <P>(Analysis): Without doubt these speakers are very capable 
              teachers who are able to give forceful presentations of what they 
              teach. The question to be raised however, concerns whether or not 
              they will be giving these huge crowds of men the whole counsel of 
              God or a modified, altered, misleading presentation of essential 
              Scriptural truths. Since the ministry of these teachers runs the 
              gamut from compromising new-evangelicalism and charismatic error, 
              to ecumenical liberalism, it is clear that they will be 
              introducing the Promise Keepers to unscriptural doctrines and 
              fellowships. This is a very serious matter.</P>
              <P>Promise Keepers officers and major staff members are obviously 
              very capable communicators and seasoned motivators -- their 
              combined talents provide an amazing base for publicity and 
              continued support. An article by Stephen R. McLauchlin in the 
              January/February, 1995 issue of Religious Broadcasters magazine 
              reports that the free 90-second daily "Promise Keepers Men in 
              Action" spot announcements are already being carried on 
              approximately 400 stations. This article encourages stations to 
              publicize Promise Keepers by "giving coverage to the conferences, 
              signing up to air "Men in Action," and covering local stories that 
              highlight grass roots experiences of the movement."</P>
              <P>Campus Crusade for Christ is also involved in the movement. In 
              the "Alumni Relations" newsletter of January, 1995 the following 
              article was included which describes the purpose of "Strategic 
              Alliance," the title they have given to the Promise Keepers/Campus 
              Crusade organizational link: "Strategic Alliance -- Have you 
              attended Promise Keepers and want to receive further training? 
              ‘M.A.N. to Man’ seminars are part of a Strategic Alliance between 
              Campus Crusade for Christ and Promise Keepers to help men 1) 
              personalize issues that concern men; 2) provide basic leadership 
              training; and 3) give information on small-group Bible studies 
              especially for men."</P>
              <P>Campus Crusade has a long history of increasing compromise. It 
              adopted at its inception the policy of totally rejecting Biblical 
              separation; infiltration rather than separation has always been 
              CCC’s stated strategy. As a result of adopting this unbiblical 
              course, CCC has increased its compromise. Liberal, Roman Catholic 
              and Charismatic delusion are now firmly lodged within this 
              incredibly influential organization. Their support will give 
              Promise Keepers a tremendous boost.</P>
              <P>Consider also The National Religious Broadcasters organization 
              which now numbers over 800 broadcasters representing a wide array 
              of diverse theological positions. The NRB began as an official arm 
              of the National Association Evangelicals, later becoming an 
              "independent affiliate" with its own laws and executive committee 
              but with an identical statement of faith. The NAE, since its 
              founding in 1942, has represented a position of compromise between 
              Biblical Fundamentalism and liberal ecumenism. Fifty years ago, 
              the NAE considered Roman Catholicism to be a false religious 
              system, and on occasion, warned about the liberalism of some 
              ecumenical organizations and leaders. Today the NAE embraces more 
              and more ecumenical positions and programs and openly repudiates 
              Biblical Fundamentalism. The NAE has now become a major force 
              which admits that there are some differences between Evangelicals 
              and Roman Catholics, but increasingly advocates cooperation with 
              them in various activities as though the Roman Catholic Church 
              should now be considered part of the body of Christ. NAE leaders 
              are also having fellowship with and commending apostate leaders of 
              the National and World Councils of Churches. Although these false 
              positions are also held by a majority of believers today, they are 
              unscriptural and dangerous; hence the strongest warnings must be 
              given.</P>
              <P>Promise Keepers is being welcomed by Roman Catholic leaders in 
              Southern California. According to the official publication of the 
              Los Angeles Roman Catholic archdiocese, The Tidings, March 31, 
              1995 edition, Promise Keepers is now considered a viable ministry 
              for Catholics. The Tidings reported that at the urging of Cardinal 
              Roger Mahony, Christian Van Liefde, Roman Catholic priest and 
              pastor of St. Hillary Church in Pico Rivera, "has studied the 
              feasibility and appropriateness of utilizing Promise Keepers at 
              the Catholic parish level." Van Liefde, while noting "the 
              evangelical roots of the program," was quoted as stating that 
              "there is no doctrinal issue which should cause concern to the 
              Catholic Church." Van Liefde was further quoted as saying, 
              "Promise Keepers places a very strong emphasis on returning to 
              your own church congregation or parish and becoming an active 
              layman." Van Liefde also mentioned the fact that one of the 
              promises of Promise Keepers is his commitment to "give generously 
              of their time, treasure and talent to their local church." Roman 
              Catholic leaders are quick to observe how Promise Keepers can be 
              used to build a false church which preaches a false gospel.</P>
              <P>The pressure to follow the crowd and silence the voice of 
              scriptural reproof is growing. In closing this article, however, 
              we would point out that any pastor and church wanting to stand 
              against such compromise will have to take a stand now against the 
              Promise Keepers teachings. Many who have already joined this group 
              are now bent on recruiting new members with fully as much zeal and 
              pressure as sports-minded college alumni men seek to recruit top 
              athletes for sports programs.</P>
              <P>We see this recruiting zeal of those who become involved in the 
              movement to be one of its greatest hazards. Why? Because there 
              will be many faithful pastors who have in the past taken a stand 
              against all ecumenical endeavors and movements which would 
              introduce doctrinal error and the devilish spirit of 
              new-evangelicalism into their congregations, but who now are 
              pressured into buying into the Promise Keepers program.</P>
              <P>How could a pastor say "No, we cannot..." to men returning from 
              a Promise Keepers conference who promise the pastor they will 
              support him, work with him, and pray for him as never before? How 
              can he deal with these undoubtedly well-meaning, yet misled, men 
              within his own church who are now exerting pressure upon him to 
              fall into line with the program? Imagine the faithful pastor’s 
              dilemma! Up until now he could herald a warning against Romanism, 
              liberalism, ecumenism, charismatic delusion and the like without 
              reservation. But now he has men within his own flock who are 
              introducing the people to all of the above and more under the 
              attractive packaging -- Promise Keepers!</P>
              <P>Fundamental, Bible-believing pastor, you must take a stand 
              against this or you will be taken down by it. The machinery is 
              coming into place for this movement to have a continuing influence 
              on its Promise Keepers for years to come. Should you be forced 
              into the program now, dear brother, you will be battling its 
              impact for the duration.</P>
              <P>A closing word about those who say, "Why not just emphasize the 
              good things in Promise Keepers?" Such an argument sounds 
              reasonable until you consider the very serious doctrinal errors 
              involved. When a deadly poison is discovered in a popular 
              medicine, no one insists on emphasizing the good ingredients; 
              every one insists on identifying and warning about the poison. 
              When meat or other food is found to be contaminated, the concern 
              is not about the beneficial substances involved, but rather the 
              giving of strong warnings as to the nature, source, and 
              elimination of the contamination. Spiritual poison and 
              contamination (error) are even more dangerous since they affect 
              the eternal welfare of individuals and the reward or loss of 
              reward for believers (1 Cor. 3:9-15; 2 Jn. 8; Rev. 3:8-11).</P>
              <P>As far as naming names is concerned, this also is frowned upon 
              by most believers today. Yet, the Lord Jesus Christ (who is the 
              very personification of love) issued some of the strongest 
              warnings and rebukes ever given to the false teachers of His day. 
              Read Matthew chapter 23 and pay careful attention to the words our 
              Saviour used concerning the Scribes and Pharisees. Notice His 
              instruction to "call no man father" upon earth (v. 9), and also 
              the particular words He used forbidding repetitious prayer (Matt. 
              6:7). Both of these are disobeyed by Roman Catholics. And, mark 
              well the warning of Jesus Christ in Matthew 7:15: "Beware of false 
              prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they 
              are ravening wolves." And, what about Peter, one of the three 
              disciples who were closest to Jesus Christ during His earthly 
              ministry? Was Christ’s rebuke of Peter before the other disciples 
              unnecessary and unloving (Matt. 16:21-23)? Look carefully at the 
              experience of Peter who learned the hard way about the disaster of 
              trying to be a promise keeper in his own strength (Mk. 
              14:26-42).</P>
              <P>Furthermore the apostle Paul, one of the greatest Bible 
              teachers, pastors, evangelists and missionaries of his day, spent 
              three years warning the Ephesian elders about the wolves (false 
              teachers) who would enter into the flock from without; and a 
              similar warning about those who would arise from within the church 
              who would desire to "draw away disciples after themselves" (please 
              read Acts 20:17-32). Likewise both Paul and the other apostles, 
              writing by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, did not hesitate to 
              mention names. Notice how often they rebuked by name those who 
              were disobedient to the Word of God. 1 Timothy 1:20; 2 Timothy 
              4:10, 14; 3 John 9. We must follow their example and obey God 
              rather than to trust the promises of any man.</P>
              <P>Promise Keepers is dangerous, but please do not forget that 
              these words of warning are an effort to "speak the truth in love," 
              praying always that God will help those affected to see this.</P>
