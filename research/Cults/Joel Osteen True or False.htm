      vspace=5 border=0> The latest "star" among the Christian world is Joel 
      Osteen, pastor of nondenominational Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. 
      Osteen claims the nation’s largest congregation with over 30,000 members. 
      Lakewood recently purchased the colossal Compaq Center, formerly home of 
      the NBA’s Houston Rockets. After a whopping $95 million in renovations, 
      the Compaq Center now houses Osteen’s empire called Lakewood Church. 
      Osteen continually sells out huge arenas (at $10 a ticket) across the 
      country. (on ebay Osteen’s tickets list for over $100—can you say 
      $ch-ching$?) <I>New York Times</I> (July 18, 2005) reports Lakewood’s 2004 
      revenue’s of $55 million. Osteen’s book of human-potential, self-esteem, 
      "feel good," self-help-guide titled, <I>Your Best Life Now: Seven Steps to 
      Living at Your Full Potential, </I>ranks number one on the prestigious 
      "New York Times" best-seller list. Wxyz.com writes of Osteen’s enormous 
      popularity, "In the world of religion, he’s achieved the status of a rock 
      star. . ." Clearly, Mr. Osteen wears the coveted crown prince of the 
      Christian kingdom.
      <P></P>
      <P>Osteen’s message is described as ". . . simple self-help message that 
      congregants say is both uplifting and accessible. . ." Osteen proudly 
      wears the title of "the smiling preacher." His theology has been described 
      as "cotton candy" theology – tastes good – but no substance. </P>
      <P>Before we examine Osteen’s disturbing theology, let us lay some ground 
      work for our critique. </P>
      <P>Today’s Christians have been spiritually malnourished with a steady and 
      unrelenting diet of "judge not, that ye be not judged. . .," tolerant, 
      inclusive "junk food" doctrine until they are completely void of any 
      spiritual discernment. May I remind you in Matthew 7 where the popular 
      "judge not, that ye be not judged. . ." mantra occurs contains the 
      harshest warning in the Bible exposing false prophets and exercising 
      personal spiritual discernment. The Lord Jesus in Matthew 7:21-23 provides 
      the most enlightening and frightening warning found in all the scriptures. 
      Many (not a few) people that openly call Jesus "Lord, Lord. . ." and many 
      that "prophesy in thy name. . ." and ". . . cast out devils. . ." and in 
      the name of Jesus Christ perform "many wonderful (not hateful, but nice, 
      sweet) works. . ."— Jesus will utter "I NEVER knew you." They were never 
      saved. If they were ever saved—Jesus could not say, I NEVER knew you. 
      Despite their "many wonderful works" in the name of Jesus, despite calling 
      Him "Lord, Lord"—Jesus Christ will cast them into an eternal lake of fire, 
      calling them "ye that work iniquity." </P>

      <P>Matthew 7 (and there are many other scriptures) is an earth-shattering 
      wake-up call for prayerful Bible discernment. If we, as Christians do not 
      shine the exposing light of the Word of God upon preachers, Christians or 
      anyone and everyone, how can we possibly obey the clear admonition of our 
      Lord and Saviour in Matthew 7:15? How can we "Beware of false prophets, 
      which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening 
      wolves"— if we do not "judge" who are the "false prophets"? How in the 
      world can we even KNOW who are these "false prophets"? They appear as 
      "sheep" or saved people, but they are "ravening wolves." There is only one 
      way—the unchangeable, perfect Word of God. There is a very serious and 
      very deadly Christian belief perverting Christians that says, "I can’t 
      judge them, I don’t know their heart." The Lord Jesus Christ says in 
      Matthew 15:19, <B>"But those things which proceed out of the mouth come 
      forth from the heart; and they defile the man."</B> What comes out the 
      mouth – is in the heart. </P>
      <P>And what came out of the heart and mouth of Joel Osteen during the June 
      20, 2005 interview with Larry King literally sent shivers down my 
      spiritual spine. As a Bible Believing researcher, I have researched many 
      topics, many cultural issues and many false prophets—but what I heard 
      <I>repeatedly</I> from the mouth of Joel Osteen on Larry King clearly 
      ranks as the most disturbing words publicly coming out of a mainstream, 
      accepted preacher. Bar none! </P>
      <P>Before we view Osteen’s troubling statements, let me also add: we are 
      not frivolously "sowing discord among brethren. . ." (Proverbs 6:19); we 
      are not blindly, ". . . straining at a gnat, and swallowing a camel." 
      (Matthew 23:14); nor is any personal malice or contempt against Mr. Osteen 
      intended. </P>
      <P>As Bible Believers, we can disagree on certain doctrinal issues, but 
      never the redemptive work and person of the Lord Jesus Christ. God forbid! 
      God help us to never cease from exposing serious doctrinal errors, and 
      make no mistake about it – several of Joel Osteen’s statements on Larry 
      King Live were serious. <B>Very serious. . .</B> </P>
      <P>The first very alarming portrait of Osteen’s heart (Matthew 12:34) 
      deals with the most important subject in the Bible—salvation is only 
      through the redemptive blood of the Lord Jesus Christ at Calvary. Nothing 
      is more important. Nothing is more evident in the scriptures. The 
      following scriptures (among many) loudly and boldly proclaim Jesus Christ 
      as the ONE and ONLY way of salvation, without any room for 
      misinterpretation or misunderstanding. The Bible makes this crystal-clear. 
      Other doctrines may have opportunity for argument, but not this one.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>John 14:6<BR>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the 
        life: <B>no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</P></B>
        <P>Acts 4:12<BR><B>Neither is there salvation in any other</B>: for 
        there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must 
        be saved.</P>
        <P>John 3:36<BR>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: 
        <B>and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath 
        of God abideth on him.</P></B>
        <P>1 Timothy 2:5-6<BR>For there is one God, and <B>one mediator</B> 
        between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;<BR>Who gave himself a ransom 
        for all, to be testified in due time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>On Larry King Live, the following very disturbing conversation occurred 
      with Larry King and Joel Osteen:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>KING: What if you're Jewish or Muslim, you don't accept Christ at 
        all?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: You know, I'm very careful about saying who would and 
        wouldn't go to heaven. <B>I don't know ...</P></BLOCKQUOTE></B>
      <P>At this point, even Larry King appears surprised by Osteen’s answer. 
      Then Larry tosses Osteen a "soft-ball" to explain his previous answer. And 
      again Osteen openly denies that Jesus Christ is the ONLY way of salvation. 
      </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>KING: If you believe you have to believe in Christ? They're wrong, 
        aren't they?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: <B>Well, I don't know if I believe they're wrong</B>. I 
        believe here's what the Bible teaches and from the Christian faith this 
        is what I believe. <B>But I just think that only God will judge a 
        person's heart</B>. I spent a lot of time in India with my father. I 
        don't know all about their religion. <B>But I know they love God</B>. 
        And I don't know. I've seen their sincerity. <B>So I don't know</B>. I 
        know for me, and what the Bible teaches, I want to have a relationship 
        with Jesus.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Again Osteen denies the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
      Notice, he praises the pagan, false-religion of India as "I know they love 
      God." Unbelievable. . . </P>
      <P>I’m sure some reading this are thinking, "Well, maybe Larry caught Joel 
      Osteen flat footed. Maybe Osteen wasn’t prepared." If Osteen only had been 
      given another chance to testify of the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus 
      Christ, he’d get it straightened out. </P><B>
      <P>Osteen did get another chance. . . </P></B>
      <P>After Larry King opened the phone lines, a concerned Christian asks 
      Joel to clarify his previous statement (which we just viewed). Again 
      Osteen could easily clear this up. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>CALLER: Hello, Larry. You're the best, and thank you, Joe -- Joel -- 
        for your positive messages and your book. <B>I'm wondering, though, why 
        you side-stepped Larry's earlier question about how we get to heaven? 
        The Bible clearly tells us that Jesus is the way, the truth and the 
        light and the only way to the father is through him. That's not really a 
        message of condemnation but of truth. </P></B>
        <P>OSTEEN: Yes, I would agree with her. I believe that. . .</P>
        <P>KING: So then a Jew is not going to heaven? </P>
        <P>OSTEEN: No. Here's my thing, Larry, is <B>I can't judge somebody's 
        heart</B>. You know? Only God can look at somebody's heart, and so -- 
        <B>I don't know</B>. To me, it's not my business to say, you know, this 
        one is or this one isn't. I just say, here's what the Bible teaches and 
        I'm going to put my faith in Christ. <B>And I just I think it's wrong 
        when you go around saying, you're saying you're not going, you're not 
        going, you're not going, because it's not exactly my way</B>. I'm 
        just...</P>
        <P>KING: But you believe your way. </P>
        <P>OSTEEN: I believe my way. I believe my way with all my heart. </P>
        <P>KING: But for someone who doesn't share it is wrong, isn't he? </P>
        <P>OSTEEN: Well, yes. Well, <B>I don't know if I look at it like 
        that</B>. I would present my way, but I'm just going to let God be the 
        judge of that. <B>I don't know. I don't know.</B> </P>
        <P>KING: So you make no judgment on anyone? </P>
        <P>OSTEEN: <B>No.</B> But I...</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>And here Larry really tosses Joel a soft-ball. How about a God-defying 
      atheist? <B>And again, Osteen will not confess that Jesus Christ is the 
      ONLY way of salvation. </P></B>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>KING: What about atheists? </P>
        <P>OSTEEN: You know what, I'm going to let someone -- I'm going to let 
        God be the judge of who goes to heaven and hell. <B>I just -- again, I 
        present the truth</B>, and I say it every week. You know, I believe it's 
        a relationship with Jesus. But you know what? <B>I'm not going to go 
        around telling everybody else if they don't want to believe that that's 
        going to be their choice</B>. <B>God's got to look at your own heart. 
        God's got to look at your heart, and only God knows that. 
      </P></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Friend, the Bible is clear. There is <B>one</B>, and <B>only one</B> 
      way out of an eternal hell and that is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
      Not simply "a relationship with Jesus Christ." Judas Iscariot had a 
      "relationship" with Jesus Christ, walking and talking with the Lord, and 
      even "kissing" the Lord (Luke 22:47), but Judas went to hell (Acts 1:25). 
      Revelation 2:15 reads, "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful 
      witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings 
      of the earth. <B>Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in 
      his own blood</B>," </P><B>
      <P>What can wash away my sins – NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS!</P></B>
      <P>The teaching professed by Osteen that ". . . God’s got to look at your 
      heart. . ." for salvation is wrong. It is grossly wrong. It is deadly 
      wrong. God has already "looked at you heart." In Jeremiah 17:9, the Lord 
      says, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: 
      who can know it?" Proverbs 28:26, says, "He that trusteth in his own heart 
      is a fool. . ." The Lord Jesus says, in Matthew 15 "But those things which 
      proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the 
      man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, 
      fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:"</P>
      <P>Osteen’s refusal to confess the sole redemptive salvation of the Lord 
      Jesus Christ sent shock waves among many of Osteen’s followers. Because of 
      the amount of email and letters questioning his statements, Osteen issued 
      an apology on his web site, stating: </P>

            <P>Dear Friend,&nbsp;</P>
            <P>Many&nbsp;of you&nbsp;have called, written or 
            e-mailed&nbsp;regarding my recent appearance on Larry King 
            Live.&nbsp; I appreciate your comments and value your words of 
            correction and encouragement.</P>
            <P>It was never my desire or intention to leave any doubt as to what 
            I believe and Whom I serve.&nbsp; I believe with all my heart that 
            it is only through Christ that we have hope in eternal life.&nbsp; I 
            regret and sincerely apologize that <B>I was unclear on the very 
            thing in which I have dedicated my life. </B></P>
            <P>Jesus declared in John 14; I<I> am the way, the truth and the 
            life</I>.&nbsp; <I>No one comes to the Father but by 
            me</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that Jesus Christ alone is the only 
            way to salvation.&nbsp; <B>However, it wasn’t until I had the 
            opportunity to review the transcript of the interview that I realize 
            I had not clearly stated that having a personal relationship with 
            Jesus is the <U>only way</U> to heaven.&nbsp; It’s about the 
            individual’s choice to follow Him.</P></B>
            <P>God has given me a platform to present the Gospel to a very 
            diverse audience.&nbsp; In my desire not to alienate the people that 
            Jesus came to save, I did not clearly communicate the convictions 
            that I hold so precious.</P>
            <P>I will use this as a learning experience and believe that God 
            will ultimately use it for my good and His glory. I am comforted by 
            the fact that He sees my heart and knows my intentions.&nbsp; I am 
            so thankful that I have friends, like you, who are willing to share 
            their concerns with me.</P>
            <P>Thank&nbsp;you again&nbsp;to those who have written. I hope that 
            you accept my deepest apology and see it in your heart to extend to 
            me grace and forgiveness.&nbsp;</P>
            <P>As always, I covet your prayers and I am believing for God’s best 
            in your life,&nbsp;</P>

      <P>I find it ironic and demeaning that Osteen "was unclear on the very 
      thing in which I have dedicated my life." <B>He was not UNCLEAR. He was 
      crystal clear.</B> He consistently and clearly rejected that the Lord 
      Jesus Christ was the ONLY way of salvation! We're not talking about a 
      "babe in Christ." <B>We are talking about the pastor of the largest church 
      in the nation!</B> Here he is as an ambassador for the Lord Jesus on a 
      very popular television show and refuses to acknowledge the very thing he 
      supposedly has "dedicated his life"? <B><FONT color=red>Something's 
      seriously wrong with this picture. . .</FONT></B> 
      <P>Osteen’s glossing, or apologizing for his serious statements, does not 
      negate his repeatedly refusal to confess that Jesus Christ is the only way 
      of salvation. If his answers were not so clear, nor given several chances 
      to clarify, his apology might be appropriate. But the heart and soul of 
      the Christian faith is the sole redemptive blood of the Lord Jesus. 
      Without that, there exists no Christian faith. For a preacher to 
      repeatedly refuse to confess that Jesus Christ as the only way of 
      salvation is without excuse, nor apology. 1 Peter 3:15 admonishes the 
      Christian: "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: <B>and be ready 
      always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope 
      that is in you</B> with meekness and fear:" </P>
      <P>Many other statements from Osteen during the Larry King interview were 
      blatantly in opposition to the Word of God. </P>

        been an encourager at heart. And when I took over from my father he came 
        from the Southern Baptist background and back 40, 50 years ago there was 
        a lot more of that. <B>But, you know, I just -- I don't believe in

        don't have it in my heart to condemn people</B>. I'm there to encourage 
        them. <B>I see myself more as a coach, as a motivator to help them 
        experience the life God has for us.</P></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Friend, the greatest "fire and brimstone" preacher that ever lived was 
      the Lord Jesus! He preached about hell more than any other subject. If you 
      don’t believe in proclaiming "fire and brimstone, as Osteen openly 
      confesses, you do not believe the Bible! It’s that simple. </P>
      <P>Jesus Christ took hell very serious. In Mark 9:43-47 the Lord says,

      <P><BR>Jesus Christ took hell so serious — He could say without the 
      slightest hesitation — to remove your eye, cut off your hand or foot, if 
      that would keep you out of hell!<BR><BR><B>If hell is not real — Jesus 
      Christ was the most deceived man that ever lived!</B><BR></P>
      <P>Osteen may sound pious and sweet to say, ". . . I don't have it in my 
      heart to condemn people," but according to the Lord Jesus, they are 
      already condemned. The Lord says in John 3:18, "He that believeth on him 
      is not condemned: <B>but he that believeth not is condemned already</B>, 
      because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." 
      The Christian’s message is not condemnation, but the way out of ALREADY 
      condemnation. If there is no "hell fire and brimstone"—there is no reason 
      for Jesus dieing on the cross. It was a waste. Hell is as much a part of 
      the gospel, as the blood of Jesus Christ. No hell. No blood. No heaven. No 
      gospel. . .</P>
      <P><B><FONT color=red>Friend, if we believe the Bible it is our duty and 
      decency to warn people about hell! Warning someone of the fires of eternal 
      hell is not condemning them - it is just the opposite - we are trying to 
      keep them from being condemned in hell! </FONT></B>
      <P>Because of Osteen's vague and confusing answers, Larry King point-blank 
      asks Osteen if he believed the Bible. (What a strange question to ask the 
      pastor of the largest church in Amerca?) 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>KING: You believe in the Bible literally? 
        <P>OSTEEN: <B>I do, I do.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>There is a problem here - a very, very serious problem. Here is a man 
      that claims to believe the Bible literally. And the Bible over and over 
      and over, warns of a place of called hell, a place of eternal fire and 
      torments where the majority of people will suffer in torments for all 
      eternity. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Matthew 13:49-50<BR>49 So shall it be at the end of the 
        world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the 
        just,<BR>50 And shall cast them into <B>the furnace of fire: there shall 
        be wailing and gnashing of teeth</B>. 
        <P>Revelation 14:10-11<BR>10 The same shall drink of the wine of the 
        wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his 
        indignation; <B>and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone </B>in 
        the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:<BR>11 
        <B>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and 
        they have no rest day nor night</B>, 
        <P>Revelation 20:15<BR>And whosoever was not found written in the book 
        of life <B>was cast into the lake of fire</B>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>How can Mr. 
      Osteen, or anyone, claim to believe the Bible and deliberately refuse to 
      warn people about hell? Is anyone that mean or hateful or so depraved that 
      they willingly refuse to warn others? I'm reminded of a gut-wrenching 
      illustration in <I>Why Revival Tarries</I> by Leonard Ravenhill: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Charlie Peace was a criminal. Laws of God or man curbed him 
        not. Finally the law caught up with him, and he was condemned to death. 
        On the fatal morning in Armley Jail, Leeds, England, he was taken on the 
        death-walk. Before him went the prison chaplain, routinely and sleepily 
        reading some Bible verses. The criminal touched the preacher and asked 
        what he was reading. "The Consolations of Religion," was the replay. 
        Charlie Peace was shocked at the way he professionally read about hell. 
        <B>Could a man be so unmoved under the very shadow of the scaffold as to 
        lead a fellow-human there and yet, dry-eyed, read of a pit that has no 
        bottom into which this fellow must fall? Could this preacher believe the 
        words that there is an eternal fire that never consumes its victims, and 
        yet slide over the phrase with a tremor? Is a man human at all who can 
        say with no tears, "You will be eternally dying and yet never know the 
        relief that death brings"?</B> All this was too much for Charlie Peace. 
        So he preached. Listen to his on-the-eve-of-hell sermon. 
        <P>"Sir" addressing the preacher, "if I believed what you and the church 
        of God say that you believe, even if England were covered with broken 
        glass from coast to coast, <B>I would walk over it, if need be, on hands 
        and knees and think it worth while living, just to save one soul from an 
        eternal hell like that!" </B>(Ravenhill, Leonard, <I>Why Revival 
        Tarries</I>, Fires of Revival Publishers, Zachary, LA, 1973, p. 19) 
      </P></BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT color=red>Is it possible that a man could be so 
      cruel and so criminal to actually believe in hell and steadfastly refuse 
      to warn fellow human beings? </FONT></B>
      <P>Recently, a local TV station interviewed a man that rescued a sleeping 
      family from a burning house. He was riding by the house, saw the raging 
      fire and at the danger of his own life, ran inside the flaming house, 
      screamming and yelling for the family to wake up and get out! The 
      newscaster asked him, "How does it feel to be a hero?" His reply was 
      simply, "<B>I'm no hero; I just did what any decent human being would have 
      done."</B>." 
      <P>Here me and here me well - a man that professes to believe the Bible 
      and refuses to warn people about hell; either does not <B>really</B> 
      believe that Bible, or they are the worse criminal and villain on this 
      earth! <B>And I don't care how big a church they have, or how nice, sweet, 
      loving, compassionate or pious they may sound - they are a wicked devil in 
      disguise!</B>

      </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>In the interview, Larry King tossed Osteen 
      another "soft-ball," asking Osteen about the wicked and vile sins of 
      abortion and homosexuality. Even lost people take a stand on these blatant 
      "sins." 
      <P></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>KING: How about issues that the church has feelings about? Abortion? 
        Same-sex marriages?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: Yeah. You know what, Larry? <B>I don't go there</B>. I just 
        ...</P>
        <P>KING: You have thoughts, though.</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: I have thoughts. I just, you know, I don't think that a 
        same-sex marriage is the way God intended it to be. I don't think 
        abortion is the best. I think there are other, you know, a better way to 
        live your life. <B>But I'm not going to condemn those people. I tell 
        them all the time our church is open for everybody.</P></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Again, Larry appears surprised at Osteen’s waffling. Larry allows 
      Osteen to clarify his confusing position. And again Osteen blatantly 
      contradicts the words of the Lord Jesus Christ. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>KING: You don't call them sinners?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: <B>I don't.</P></B>
        <P>KING: Is that a word you don't use?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: <B>I don't use it.</B> I never thought about it. But I 
        probably don't. But most people already know what they're doing wrong. 
        When I get them to church I want to tell them that you can change. There 
        can be a difference in your life. <B>So I don't go down the road of 
        condemning.</P></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The word "sin" occurs in the King James Bible over 830 times! </P>
      <P>After the previous surprising answers, Larry then asks Osteen the 
      obvious question: <B>Do you believe the Bible? </P></B>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>KING: You believe in the Bible literally?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: <B>I do, I do.</P></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The following conversation during King’s interview displays how far 
      Osteen and the Bible differ. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>KING: Is it hard to lead a Christian life?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: I don't think it's that hard. To me it's fun. We have joy and 
        happiness. Our family -- I don't feel like that at all. <B>I'm not 
        trying to follow a set of rules and stuff. I'm just living my 
        life.</P></B>
        <P>KING: But you have rules, don't you?</P>
        <P>OSTEEN: We do have rules. But the main rule to me is to honor God 
        with your life. To live a life of integrity. Not be selfish. <B>You 
        know, help others. But that's really the essence of the Christian 
        faith.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></B>
      <P>The "essence of Osteen’s Christian faith" is to "help others." (And 
      along the way make a few million$.)</P>
      <P>In 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, the apostle Paul gives us the "essence" of the 
      Christian faith:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>1 Corinthians 15:3-4<BR>3 For I delivered unto you first of 
        all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins 
        according to the scriptures;<BR>4 And that he was buried, and that he 
        rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
        <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Stay away from Joel Osteen and his no condemnation, self-esteem, 
      false-gospel. Warn others. Stay away! There is too much at stake – your
