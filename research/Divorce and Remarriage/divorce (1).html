		<p class="cs8412D823"><span class="csAAD03ED1">Can we be ready for revival if we believe that all hope is gone&mdash;that we have sinned away our day of grace and there is nothing left but judgment? Beloved, we cannot have faith for a revival until we are convinced that God still wants to pour out His Spirit upon us!</span></p><p class="cs8412D823"><span class="csAAD03ED1">Why hasn&rsquo;t America been judged? Why hasn&rsquo;t Jesus come yet? It is because there is still a great harvest ahead and God is &ldquo;. . . not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance&rdquo; (2 Peter 3:9).</span></p><p class="cs8412D823"><span class="csAAD03ED1">We see this great mercy of the Lord in a passage in Isaiah where God instructed the prophet to tell Judah: &ldquo;Where is the certificate of your mother&rsquo;s divorce, whom I have put away? Or which of My creditors is it to whom I have sold you? For your iniquities you have sold yourselves, and for your transgressions your mother has been put away. Why, when I came, was there no man? Why, when I called, was there none to answer? Is My hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver?&rdquo; (Isaiah 50:1-2).</span></p><p class="cs8412D823"><span class="csAAD03ED1">God had already divorced Israel, giving them &ldquo;. . . a certificate of divorce&rdquo; (Jeremiah 3:8). But now His attention was on Judah, a people who had cheated on Him and walked away from Him. God still had a heart for Judah, and He came to them crying to see the certificate of divorce (see Isaiah 50:1). He was saying, &ldquo;Show Me your divorce papers! Prove to Me I ever put you away. It was you who walked away from Me! I did nothing to grieve or hurt you. I loved you the whole time. I came to you and I called you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs8412D823"><span class="csAAD03ED1">Beloved, that is exactly what I see God doing with America right now. He is saying to us, &ldquo;Show Me your divorce papers! Show Me I walked away from you! I have not yet removed my Holy Spirit. Rather, I am still at work all over this nation&mdash;still wooing, calling, coming to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs8412D823"><span class="csAAD03ED1">The Lord is speaking this through many pulpits across this nation. He is speaking it through godly men and women who spend precious time seeking Him. He is calling America back to repentance&mdash;back to His own heart!</span></p><p class="cs8412D823"><span class="csAAD03ED1">We have to be fully persuaded that there is still time, still hope, and that while we are praying, the Spirit is at work in all levels of society, calling and wooing people to Himself!</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
