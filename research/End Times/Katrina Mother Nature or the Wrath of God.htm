      <P>The destruction from hurricane Katrina unleashed a disaster like our 
      nation has never encountered. Like a guided missile, Katrina executed a 
      mission of utmost devastation. Despite our advancements in technology, 
      computers, satellites, healthcare and tons of mind-boggling innovations – 
      the nation stood speechless and helpless. </P>
      <P>It seemed everything that could go wrong – <I>went wrong</I>. The 
      breaking of the New Orleans levees; the thousands of trapped victims; the 
      incessant looting; the perverse crime; the escalating gas prices; the 
      complete collapse of the nation’s infrastructure for disaster aid – each 
      day after Katrina brought new nightmares – each day after Katrina 
      whispered something terrible went wrong. The aftermath from Katrina plowed 
      deeper and deadlier. Our nation and the entire world watched in disbelief 
      as the nightmare from Katrina grew and held the world’s most powerful 
      nation hostage in her devastating grip. Many are asking, <I>"Why? . . . 
      Why did God permit this tragedy?" </P></I><B>
      <P><FONT size=+1>This commentary attempts to answer that question. . . 
      </FONT></P></B>
      <P>Let me first say, my remarks are not without sympathy for Katrina’s 
      thousands of victims, nor is it rooted in any political agenda. The author 
      is neither Republican nor Democrat. I’m reminded of the young boy’s 
      answer, when asked, "Are you a Republican or a Democrat?" His simple, but 
      sincere reply was, "I’m a Christian." </P>
      <P>This article is a Bible Believer’s interpretation of Katrina. Our Lord 
      commands to ". . . discern the signs of the times." (Matt. 16:3) Yes, we 
      could easily stick our head in the sand while pretending God knew nothing 
      of the wrath of Katrina. Yes, we could just as easily claim a mindless 
      Mother Nature caused Katrina. <I>Yes, we could, but we would be wrong.</I> 
      </P><B>
      <P><FONT size=+1>Is God sending America a warning? </FONT></P></B>
      <P>God’s presence and power should never be overlooked in tragedy. As 
      Bible Believing Christians, we should always be faithful to "examine 
      ourselves" – <I>and our nation</I>. We should never foolishly close our 
      eyes and ears to a possible message from our Lord. </P>

      <P>One dazed and shaken victim of Katrina standing in the ruined and 
      ravaged streets of battered New Orleans shocked a reporter with, "This is 
      the hand of God. Did you watch Katrina change course? Did you see how 
      Katrina headed for New Orleans?" She then adds, "America needs to 
      repent!"</P><B>
      <P><FONT size=+1>Was Katrina the wrath and judgment of God?</FONT></B> 
</P>
      <P>Any Bible Believing Christian knows nothing happens without the 
      knowledge and foreknowledge of God. The Lord Jesus says in Matthew 10:29, 
      if a small sparrow falls to the ground, God knows. The Lord goes on to 
      say, ". . . the very hairs of your head are all numbered." (Matt. 10:30) 
      Nothing takes the Lord by surprise. The smallest event does not escape His 
      Omnipresent eye. Zechariah 4:10 says, "<B>For who hath despised the day of 
      small things</B>? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the 
      hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; <B>they are the eyes of the LORD, 
      which run to and fro through the whole earth."</P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>Certainly, the Lord knew the coming devastation and death 
      from Katrina.</FONT> </P></B>
      <P>The scriptures reveal many "natural" disasters as instruments of wrath 
      from the hand of God. The fire and brimstone raining down and destroying 
      Sodom and Gomorrah promptly comes to mind. Let us not forget that the 
      wrath of God once exterminated every breath on the whole earth, save Noah 
      and his family. The Old Testament testifies over and over of the judgment 
      of God. King David bows to the temptation of Satan to number Israel and an 
      angry God kills 70,000 men (1 Chron. 21:14). We read of God’s hand in the 
      Divine destruction of Jericho (Joshua 6:20), the termination of the 
      kingdoms of Babylon, Assyria , Egypt, Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:8) among 
      many others. </P>
      <P>The scriptures establish that God creates, controls and even commands 
      the weather. Amos 4:13, say, "For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and 
      <B>createth the wind</B> . . ." Many times, God specifically employs the 
      wind to preach His message. Just ask a backslidden prophet named Jonah. 
      Jonah 1:4 says, "<B>But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea</B>, 
      and there was a <B>mighty tempest</B> in the sea, so that the ship was 
      like to be broken." Ask the fearful apostles after watching the Lord Jesus 
      calmly rebuke ". . . <B>a great storm of wind</B>. . . and said unto the 
      sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm." 
      The Bible records the amazed apostles, "And they feared exceedingly, and 
      said one to another, What manner of man is this, <B>that even the wind and 
      the sea obey him</B>?" (Mark 4:41)</P>
      <P>The scriptures many times reveal the Lord God utilizes the wind as His 
      instrument of action. In fact, of all the environmental resources at His 
      Omnipotent disposal, the wind emerges as His first choice. The following 
      scriptures, among scores of others, provide our proof:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; <B>I will even rend it 
        with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower 
        in mine anger,</B> and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.<BR>14 
        So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered 
        mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof 
        shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the 
        midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>Ezekiel 13:13-14
        <P></P>
        <P>And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, <B>and the 
        LORD brought an east wind</B> upon the land all that day, and all that 
        night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the 
        locusts.<BR>Exodus 10:13</P>
        <P>And <B>the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind</B>, which took away 
        the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one 
        locust in all the coasts of Egypt.<BR>Exodus 10:19</P>
        <P>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused 
        the sea to go back <B>by a strong east wind all that night,</B> and made 
        the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.<BR>Exodus 
      14:21</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>And the scriptures <I>clearly</I> reveal God employs the mighty wind to 
      judge and destroy nations. The Old Testament pulls back the curtain of 
      history and tragedy to reveal the judgment of God. The scriptures inform 
      us that many disasters we label as natural disasters or accidents, are not 
      natural and are not accidents. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the 
        Egyptian sea; <B>and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand 
        </B>over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make 
        men go over dryshod.<BR>Isaiah 11:15 
        <P></P>
        <P>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and 
        against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, 
        <B>a destroying wind</B>;<BR>Jeremiah 51:1</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Katrina was no accident. Katrina was no haphazard natural disaster. 
      Katrina was no climatic coincident of Mother Nature. <B>Katrina was a 
      warning from the Lord.</B> </P><B>
      <P>Remember, Katrina <I>had to come</I> with the foreknowledge and 
      provision of God. </B>To reason otherwise rejects the scriptures, and 
      denies the sovereign presence of a Holy, Almighty God. </P>
      <P>With that as our solid foundation we can now ask, "Why did God allow 
      Katrina to shatter America?" And more important, "What message from the 
      Lord was wrapped in Katrina?" </P><B>
      <P><FONT size=+1>Can we dare attempt to answer such a question? 
      </FONT></P></B><B>
      <P><FONT color=red size=+1>Not only can we – we MUST!</FONT></B> 
      <P>If the Lord is sending America a message – it is critical . . . it is 
      essential for us to "find the message." </P><B>
      <P>If Katrina was indeed a severe warning from the Lord, the answer should 
      not be difficult to find. I believe the answer clearly and precisely 
      exists in the scriptures. . . </P></B>
      <P>Some Christians have aimed God’s wrath of Katrina toward the gambling 
      casinos of Mississippi or the cesspool of sin and sodomy raging in New 
      Orleans. It’s been noted that Katrina destroyed New Orleans just days 
      before the depraved homosexual festive appropriately called "Southern 
      Decadence" was scheduled there. While a Holy God fiercely condemns and 
      judges such sins, I don’t believe that was Katrina’s mission. Katrina did 
      not merely destroy the casinos, or the hell-holes and homosexual parade of 
      New Orleans. No. Katrina was a warning for an entire nation. Katrina 
      bruised and battered the soul of America. </P>
      <P>Without question – for so many years, much like God’s servant Job (Job 
      1:10), God placed a protective hedge around America. And like Job (Job 
      1:12), it appears God is removing His hedge. </P>
      <P>On September 11, 2001 God removed His hedge around America. On 
      September 11, 2001 God blinded the protective eyes of America. On that 
      horrific day, America stood in "shock and awe" as over 2700 people were 
      brutally murdered by terrorists. Every precaution and prevention fell on 
      deaf ears and blind eyes. Several reporters and commentators remarked it 
      appeared as if "America was wearing blinders." Congress has appropriated 
      hearing after hearing asking, "How did we miss the warning signals?" We 
      didn’t miss it. <I>We just couldn’t see it.</I> Something unusual and 
      something terrible happened in America on September 11. The catastrophe 
      was much worse than the tragedy of September 11. . . God removed His 
      protective hedge.</P><B>
      <P><FONT size=+1>What really occurred on September 11? </FONT></P></B>
      <P>Several days prior to September 11, 2001, violent terrorists rocked 
      Israel. I remember watching the weeping Jewish mothers and fathers 
      carrying the bodies of their children on the news. Innocent children were 
      literally blown apart simply because they were Jews. During this time the 
      American administration forbid and threatened Israel with financial 
      bribery if they retaliated. That Sunday on September 9, 2001, I remarked 
      to the church, if America keeps this hostile attitude toward Israel, 
      America will suffer a major terrorist attack. Little did I realize, in two 
      days America would suffer the greatest single terrorist attack in history. 
      . . </P>
      <P>Make no mistake about it – God has chosen the nation of Israel as His 
      people. Whether you like it or not and whether you believe it or not – 
      God’s hand, both for His pleasure and His purpose, rests on the small 
      nation of Israel. </P>

      <P>When God called, separated and renamed Jacob as Israel, He proclaimed 
      to Israel ". . . as a prince <B>hast thou power with God and with men</B>. 
      . ." (Genesis 32:28) The name Israel literally means <B>"he will rule as 
      God."</B> </P>
      <P>When God destined His Son to this wicked world to die for the sins of 
      mankind, He chose a Jewish girl named Mary to birth and bear His Beloved 
      Son. God committed the "oracles of God" [His Word] unto the Jewish people 
      (Romans 3:2). </P>
      <P>In 606 B.C., during the time of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the 
      tiny nation of Israel. Over 2,000 years the nation of Israel did not 
      exist. In 606 B.C., Israel was literally wiped off the map.</P>
      <P>In 1917, after World War I, the famous<I> Balfour Declaration</I> set 
      aside some land in Palestine for a homeland for the wandering Jews. But 
      the Jews did not return. After the holocaust of Hitler resulting in the 
      madness and murder of over 6 million Jews, they returned home. For 
      hundreds of years, many Christians and Bible students discounted the 
      promises from the Lord to rebuild and return Israel to their land. It just 
      did not seem possible. But, "God is not a man, that he should lie; neither 
      the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and <B>shall he not 
      do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?"</B> (Numbers 
      23:19). In Isaiah 43, the Lord promised He would one day bring Israel back 
      home. He would call them from the east, from the west, from the north and 
      from the south. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Isaiah 43:1-6<BR>1 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O

      <P>After World War II, against all odds and against all obstacles – and 
      there were many. Exactly as the Lord prophesied, <I>from the east</I> came 
      Jews from Shanghai and Hong Kong; <I>from the west</I> came thousands of 
      Jews from Egypt, Morocco, Tunis, Algeria, Europe, the United States and 
      Latin America; <I>from the north</I> came over 20,000 Jews from 
      Czechoslovakia, over 30,000 from Turkey, 36,000 from Bulgaria; and <I>from 
      the south</I> came over 800,000 Jews from the land of the Arabs. The 
      largest and most spectacular migration of a group of people occurred. As 
      He promised, God was calling His people home.</P><B>
      <P>And in 1948, the greatest fulfillment of prophecy and the greatest 
      miracle of the scriptures since the resurrection of the Lord Jesus 
      occurred – the "resurrection" of the nation of Israel.</B> It’s been said 
      World War I prepared the land of Israel for the Jews, and World War II 
      prepared the Jews for the land. </P>
      <P>When the Lord God called out Abram and foretold the coming of Israel, 
      God issued a severe warning concerning the treatment of the Jewish people 
      – ". . . I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth

      <P>If you doubt the identification of the Jews and Israel in Matthew 25, 
      Joel chapter three describes that same event. Only this time there’s no 
      mistaking the role of Israel. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Joel 3:1-2<BR>1 For, behold, in those days, and in that 
        time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and 
        Jerusalem,<BR>2 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down 
        into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my 
        people <B>and for my heritage Israel</B>, whom they have scattered among 
        the nations, <B>and parted my land</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Specifically notice the last four words of verse two: <B>". . . and 
      parted my land." God is going "to plead" with the nations for MY HERITAGE 
      Israel and for parting (dividing) MY LAND. </P></B>
      <P>For over 5400 hundred years the kingdoms of this world rose and fell. 
      During this time, millions upon millions of people lived and died. Wars, 
      atrocities, tears, fears, heartbreak, joy, inventions of man, houses 
      built, pioneers paved paths and life slowly rolled along. And setting off 
      to the side sitting quietly and insignificantly was a patch of land, 
      virtually unbeknownst to the world. A land yet undiscovered by men. In 
      that obscure land God would raise up a nation greater and more powerful 
      than any in the history of the world. "America, America God shed his grace 
      on thee. . ." </P>
      <P>The history of America is unique. The history of America is God. Dr. 
      William Grady penned a magnificent 650 page history of America 
      appropriately titled <I>What Hath God Wrought!</P></I>
      <P>Despite the petty, silly whining of the humanist and atheist, America 
      was indeed a land that God wrought. <I>The Mayflower Compact </I>marks the 
      creation of America. It<I> </I>begins with these inspiring words, <I>"In 
      ye name of God, Amen. . ."</I> Only 204 words long, <I>The Mayflower 
      Compact</I> was the greatest declaration of the Christian God by any 
      nation. </P>
      <P>America has tremendously lived up to her God given heritage. America 
      has sent more missionaries with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ than 
      any nation. Despite her sins, and despite her failings, America has stood 
      for the God of the Bible. America has been a beacon for other nations 
      searching for "One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice 
      for all." </P>
      <P>And America has been the protective friend to God’s Heritage – Israel. 
      As a student of history, it amazes me that despite the politics, despite 
      Republican or Democrat, despite conservative or liberal sitting in the 
      powerful White House, or walking the halls of Congress – until recently, 
      America has consistently been Israel’s best friend. </P>
      <P>The United States of America was the first nation to recognize the 
      nation of Israel. President Truman was the first to sign the credentials 
      recognizing the State of Israel in 1948. From then on, an uncanny 
      relationship occurred. America became Israel’s best friend. </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>President Nixon firmly stated America would stand by its friends, and 
        "Israel is one of its friends." </P>
        <P>President Gerald Ford declared the United States, "commitment to the 
        security and future of Israel is based upon basic morality as well as 
        enlightened self-interest. <B>Our role in supporting Israel honors our 
        own heritage." </P></B>
        <P>President Carter stated, "The United States has a warm and a unique 
        relationship of friendship with Israel that is morally right. <B>It is 
        compatible with our deepest religious convictions</B> and it is right in 
        terms of America's own strategic interests. We are committed to Israel's 
        security, prosperity, and future as a land that has so much to offer the 
        world." </P>
        <P>President Reagan realized this God-given relationship with Israel, as 
        he stated, "Since the rebirth of the State of Israel, <B>there has been 
        an ironclad bond between that democracy and this one</B>." </P>
        <P>But President Lyndon Johnson put it best. When Soviet Premier Aleksei 
        Kosygin asked President Johnson why the United States so strongly 
        supports Israel against 80 million Arabs when there's only three million 
        Israelis, the President replied, <B>"Because it is right."</B> 
      </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>When the former Soviet Union, the violent Middle East or other 
      malicious countries would wink with violence against the tiny nation of 
      Israel, a warning frown from mighty America would silently say, "Don’t 
      even think about it!" America has provided billions and billions of 
      American dollars to build and strengthen Israel. America’s most guarded 
      and valuable military secrets have been at Israel’s disposal. </P>
      <P>Until recently, America has always been the best friend of Israel. It 
      is no stretch to say, if it wasn’t for the protection and provision of 
      America, Israel would not exist today. I have no doubt God wrought this 
      great nation for the propagation of the glorious gospel of the Lord Jesus 
      Christ and the protector and provider of His Heritage, Israel. </P>
      <P>The early 1990s marked a surprising and sickening departure from 
      previous U.S. policy towards Israel. Beginning with President George H. 
      Bush, more and more political pressure was placed upon Israel to surrender 
      their land to the Palestinian terrorists. </P><IMG height=240 hspace=5

      width=152 align=right vspace=5 border=0>The incredible book <I>Eye to Eye: 
      Facing the Consequences of Dividing Israel</I> by White House 
      Correspondent, William R. Koenig, proves many disasters befalling America 
      come in direct and immediate response to George H. Bush, Bill Clinton and 
      George W. Bush's devotion to robbing Israel of their God-given land. 
      Koenig documents the following incredible facts occur because of the 
      U.S.'s pressure to evacuate Israel from their land: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Nine of the ten costliest insurance events in U.S. history 
        <LI>Six of the seven costliest hurricanes in U.S. history

        <LI>Nine of the top ten natural disasters in U.S. history ranked by FEMA 
        relief costs 
        <LI>The two largest terrorism events in U.S. history </LI></UL>Amazon.com 
      says, "<B>All of these major catastrophes transpired on the very same day 
      or within 24-hours of U.S. presidents Bush, Clinton and Bush applying 
      pressure on Israel to trade her land</B> for promises of "peace and 
      security," sponsoring major "land for peace" meetings, making major public 
      statements pertaining to Israel’s covenant land and /or calling for a 
      Palestinian state . . . <B>In this book, Bill Koenig provides undeniable 
      facts and conclusive evidence showing that indeed the leaders of the 
      United States and the world are on a collision course with God over 
      Israel’s covenant land." </B>
      <P>Koenig's book was published in 2004. In a bit of prophetic irony on the 
      cover of his book, <I>Eye to Eye: Facing the Consequences of Dividing 
      Israel</I>, shows a grim-faced President Bush twisting his eyes as a 
      massive hurricane appears. 
      <P>The following events paint a picture of hypocrisy and hostility against 
      Israel and defiance against the Word of God, beginning with President 
      George H. Bush in 1991. Immediately following these political assaults 
      against Israel occur some of the most catastrophic disasters in the 
      history of the United States. To ascribe the disasters at these precise 
      hours as coincident or random chance breaks the sound barrier of 
      statistical probability. The possibility of these many major catastrophes 
      happening by haphazard chance at these precise times is simply 
      impossible.</P>

      <P>1991 30 October - The Oslo Accord</P></B>
      <P>President George H. Bush promoted and proudly signed the infamous Oslo 
      Accord at the Madrid Peace Conference on October 30, 1991. The Oslo Accord 
      was labeled a "Land for Peace" accord that demanded Israel award their 
      land to the Palestinian murderers and terrorists in exchange for peace. 
      The perverse Oslo proposition was simple: give us your land and we’ll stop 
      killing you. </P><B>
      <P>1991 31 October - The Next Day – The Perfect Storm hits</P></B>
      <P>A very rare huge storm starting in the north Atlantic, moving east to 
      west (wrong direction for storms to move - although in the Bible, the Holy 
      Spirit and history move east to west). This storm was so unusual and 
      contrary to "mother nature" it was immortalized by the book <I>The Perfect 
      Storm </I>by Sebastian Junger and later a popular movie. Amazon says of 
      the book <I>The Perfect Storm</I>, "Meteorologists called the storm that 
      hit North America's eastern seaboard in October 1991 a "perfect storm" 
      <B>because of the rare combination of factors that created it.</B> <B>For 
      everyone else, it was perfect hell.</B> In <I>The Perfect Storm</I>, 
      author Sebastian Junger conjures for the reader the meteorological 
      conditions that created the "storm of the century" and the impact the 
      storm had on many of the people caught in it."</P>

      <P>Before proceeding let us clarify who truthfully owns the Gaza Strip and 
      West Bank. God does. He calls it "my land." Joel 3 deals EXACTLY with this

      the nations such as the United States that "scatters" Israel and "parts 
      His land." <B>That is as much the Word of God as John 3:16.</B> And the 
      Untied States is not exempt – "all nations" means "all nations." </P>

        answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her 
        children.<BR>26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the 
        mother of us all.<BR>27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that 
        bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the 
        desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.<BR>28 
        Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.<BR>29 But 
        as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born

      <P>The great preacher, Charles Spurgeon preached a message on "The 
      Judgment of the Nations" on July 12, 1885. Excerpts of Spurgeon’s message 
      follows: </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>There is a judgment also passing upon nations, for as 
        nations will not exist as nations in another world, <B>they have to be 
        judged and punished in this present state.</B> The thoughtful reader of 
        history will not fail to observe, how sternly this justice had dealt 
        with empire after empire, when they have become corrupt. Colossal 
        dominions have withered to the ground, when sentenced by the King of 
        kings. Go and ask to-day, "Where is the empire of Assyria? Where are the 
        mighty cities of Babylon? Where are the glories of the Medes and 
        Persians? What has become of the Macedonian power? Where are the Caesars 
        and their palaces?" . . . <BR>The omnipotent, Judge has not ceased from 
        his sovereign rule over kingdoms, and our own country may yet have to 
        feel his chastisements. 
        <P></P>What is there about London [or the United States] that it should 
        be more enduring than Rome? . . . What are we? What is there about our 
        boastful race, whether on this side of the Atlantic or the other, that 
        we should monopolize the favour of God? <B>If we rebel, and sin against 
        Him, he will not hold us guiltless, but will deal out impartial justice 
        to an ungrateful race.</B> <BR>(Charles Spurgeon, <I>Judgment of the 
        Nations</I>, July 12, 1885)

      <P>Middle East scholar, Robert Horenstein spoke on Israel's disengagement 
      from Gaza Sept. 21 at the meeting of the Golda Meir/Mitzvah group of 
      Hadassah.</P>
      <P>Horenstein stated, "If Israel does carry out this withdrawal, you will 
      see the violence stepped up, because Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al-Aksa 
      Martyrs Brigade will want to show their people that Israel is leaving as a 
      result of their terrorist actions. They have already claimed Sharon's 
      proposal is a result of their armed struggle.<B>I believe that Israel is 
      under a lot of pressure from the Bush administration. . ."<BR></B>A Haifa 
      University demographer, Arnon Soffer, has projected that by 2015 all of 
      Israel, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank will be 60 percent Arab, <B>and 
      this would make it impossible for Israel to retain both its democratic and 
      Jewish character."</B><BR>(Jewish Review, "Disengagement could spawn 
      civil, external violence")<BR>
      <P>At the Mideast summit in Jordan on June 4, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel 
      Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas took the first 
      tentative verbal steps toward a peaceful resolution of their longstanding 
      and bloody conflict. <B>Under pressure from President Bush</B>, Mr. Sharon 
      pledged to begin dismantling some "unauthorized outposts" of Israeli 
      settlements in the West Bank, and Mr. Abbas declared for the first time 
      that "the armed intifada must 
      end."<BR>(http://www.wcpeace.org/israel-palestine.htm) 
      <P>Over the last week, emotional scenes of Jewish settlers being forcibly 
      removed have dominated the television headlines. Israeli Prime Minister 
      Ariel Sharon has talked of how these have been <B>the "saddest days" of

      <P>2005 August - Under U.S. pressure, the Jews are forceably removed from 
      their land.</P></B>
      <P>During the month of August 2005, with unparalleled pressure from the 
      United States – dreaded D-Day came. Over 8500 begging Jewish settlers were 
      forcibly removed from the Gaza Strip. I watched in unbelief as the Jewish 
      people were crying and pleading to remain in their houses and land. The 
      Israeli soldiers came and literally dragged them from their houses. At the 
      orders of the United States and against the protests of the Israeli 
      government, bulldozers came and demolished their homes. The land was then 
      given to terrorists who celebrated and shouted, "Death to Israel!" </P>
      <P>US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told BBC News, <B>"Jewish homes 
      in the Gaza Strip will be destroyed </B>when Israel pulls out its troops 
      and settlers. . . The view is that there are <B>better land uses for the 
      Palestinians </B>to better address their housing needs," adding that the 
      parties would <B>"work towards a plan for destruction and 
      clean-up."</P></B>
      <P>After the Gaza Strip debacle, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 
      immediately began urging Israel to vacate the West Bank, "Everyone has 
      compassion for what the Israelis are going through right now, <B>but it 
      can't stop with the Gaza Strip."</B> </P>
      <P>The hypocrisy and hostility towards the nation of Israel by the Bush 
      administration is unparalleled in U.S. history. Violently removing the 
      Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip, then giving the land to the 
      terrorists and murderers of Israeli children equates to Bush giving 
      Florida to Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda. Why didn’t President Bush give Saddam 
      Hussein the land of Texas instead of bombing Iraq? That would be more 
      logical than demanding Israel to forfeit a strategic defense area of the 
      Gaza Strip and West Bank to vicious killers that hate and kill the 
      Jews.</P><B>
      <P>2005 23 August</P></B>
      <P>Israel completed the evacuation of the Gaza Strip and gave it to the 
      Palestinians. The Gaza Strip evacuation came directly from President 
      Bush's "Roadmap to Peace." </P>
      <P>As my wife and I watched the pleading Jews dragged from their homes and 
      land, I said, "God is not pleased with this. Somebody’s gonna pay big-time 
      for this. God might start destroying some homes and running some people 
      out of their land."</P><B>
      <P>And somebody did. . . And boy did they.</P>
      <P>2005 23 August – the Same Day - Tropical Storm Katrina appears</P></B>
      <P>August 23, a small insignificant tropical storm slowly appeared in the 
      Atlantic below the Bahamas named Katrina. From her beginning 
      meteorologists stated the U.S. had nothing to fear. Katrina packed little 
      punch, plus the computer forecasts kept Katrina calmly corralled in the 
      Atlantic. Defying the computer models, Katrina turned south-east, scraped 
      the south tip of Florida and then with the vengeance of a runaway freight 
      train Katrina took an unexpected turn into the warm Gulf Coast. 
      Meteorologists tracking Katrina’s unusual path labeled Katrina one of 
      history's most bizarre hurricanes. </P><B>
      <P>2005 29 August - Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans</P></B>
      <P><IMG height=200 hspace=5 
      src="Katrina Mother Nature or the Wrath of God_files/katrina_track1.jpg" 
      width=304 align=right vspace=5 border=0>Katrina raced directly toward New 
      Orleans, harnessing deadly strength every moment. Literally recording wind 
      strength "off the scale" On Monday, August 29, the nation watched in 
      horror as deadly Katrina slammed and slaughtered the fragile Gulf Coast. 
      Destructive Katrina left beautiful homes as piles of worthless rubbish. 
      Deadly Katrina tossed bodies like litter along the highway. When Katrina 
      ended her deadly mission America suffered the worst disaster in her 
      storied history. As I saw the thousands of homes destroyed, my mind kept 
      going back to those U.S. ordered bulldozers destroying the Jewish homes in 
      the Gaza Strip. As I saw the thousands and thousands of United States 
      citizens being evacuated from their land, my mind could not keep from 
      remembering the Jewish people crying and literally begging to stay in 
      their land. <B>America found no mercy for the Jewish people. . . </B></P>
      <P>With no mercy. . . Katrina completely "bulldozed" tens of thousands of 
      homes. Katrina completely "evacuated" the celebrated city of New Orleans. 
      Hundreds of thousands are homeless, helpless and hopeless. The greatest 
      displacement of U.S. citizens in history occurred. Over 10,000 people are 
      estimated dead. Over 400,000 jobs were wiped out. President Bush has 
      requested $50 billion from Congress for the first round of Katrina’s 
      expensive bill. Estimates put Katrina’s final bill – over $150 
billion.</P>
      <P><B>Most reporters described the aftermath of New Orleans worse than 
      anything they’ve ever seen.</B>
