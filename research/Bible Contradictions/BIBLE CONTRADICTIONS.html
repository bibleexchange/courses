It consists of the books Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. It forms the basis of the Jewish religion, and has remained essentially unchanged since Ezra and Nehamiah &quot;canonized&quot; the Torah in 444 BC. The &quot;New Testament&quot; consists of materials surrounding Jesus (diaries, letters, narratives, pious fabrications, written and oral histories) that survived Catholic editors 400 years later who were motivated by politics and not, as is obvious to anyone free of theological bias, logic. &quot;Translations&quot; of both the Bible and the New Testament are pitifully lacking; Hebrew (Torah), Greek (New Testament), Aramaic and Chaldean (bits of both) are rich, beautiful, poetic languages with myriad hidden meanings and depth. English translations are pale shadows of the originals. The more mystical or universally philosophical overtones were left out altogether, at Nicea, in 325 AD, when any of the [over 150 versions of the Gospel - hence &quot;Heterodoxy&#39;] writings not in line with the council standards were systematically destroyed to favor the mystically vacant and emotionally mean Orthodoxy. This is when four Gospels (and the other New Testament books) were selected and enforced. <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/tzohr.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">(See Bible Roots)</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Hosea 13:4 &quot;...thou shalt know no G-d but me; for there is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">no Savior besides me</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.&quot; So much for Jesus.... </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Christianity is a Greek-Pagan heresy of Judaism&quot; - Maimonides </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Nothing on this page is original, and it is not an effort to extol one religion over another.

The Bible is a monument of human thought - but alas, the defenders of the New Testament systematically eradicated the competition, to create an illusion that the Theirs was The Great Text.) <br/>The purpose of pointing out contradictions is not to &#39;disprove the Bible,&#39; it is to defuse the small minded literalists who make Bible-based religions look stupid. </span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The author of this page also freely acknowledges that many derive </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">true healing and spiritual fulfillment</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> from the Bible </span><span class="csC382D2BB">and even from</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Christianity; it&#39;s all in the intention. This page targets those who use </span><span class="csC382D2BB">any</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> religion as a weapon. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This page does </span><span class="csC382D2BB">not</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> claim to explain anything in Torah or the New Testament or provide a definitive, final answer. Usually the people who claim to have &quot;the True, Accurate and Final Answer&quot; are the ones who are suspect. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The &#39;Bible,&#39; to the Jews, does </span><span class="csC382D2BB">not</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> include the New Testament, which is seen to some as an opportunistic add-on. The Christian experience of religion is radically different than the Jewish, so inconsistencies seem inevitable when the two are bound together in one book. To begin to understand the Bible, learn Hebrew. To understand the New Testament, learn Greek. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christianity exists in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">translation - </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">and so much gets lost in translation. The Jewish religious experience is joyously human, celebrating and sanctifying </span><span class="csC382D2BB">all</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> acts of life, including eating, excreting, and mating, while contemplating God and Torah in its original language. The Christian experience, because it is a translation, and because of Paulist and other Hellenistic add-ons, is more theoretical, with conditional joy, and strained, convoluted guilt and denial. It attempts to destroy the human part of us, most obviously in its suppression of sex, and notion of &quot;Original Sin.&quot; By splitting God into three, and having a mutilated corpse as its central icon, Christianity becomes Anti-Messiah. (Messiah brings peace...not gore) By inventing a &quot;Devil,&quot; God&#39;s power is subverted and challenged - inconceivable in a non-pagan, one God system. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/tarsus.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">Paul&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> notion of &quot;Original Sin&quot; taints the well of spirituality. Nachmanides said: &quot;We gave you Christians the idea of sin and you didn&#39;t know what to do with it. You&#39;d be better off to just go on being Pagans.&quot; Jewish thinking says &quot;sin&quot; is &quot;missing the mark&quot; - with the constant gentle guidance of Torah to get you closer to that mark - the &quot;mark&quot; being the will of the Creator. Sin and Satan were both given capital letters by the Christians. They are generic concepts in Judaism, where in Christianity they become entities in their own right. This allows a more human-centered focus, providing a distinct target to resist. Real Life is not always so distinct. In the Garden of Eden, the &quot;Tree of Knowing Good and Evil&quot; introduces ambiguity, because it is confusing. Confusing because of both good and evil growing on the same tree. In the Torah, it does </span><span class="csC382D2BB">not </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">say knowing good </span><span class="csC382D2BB">from</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> evil - it says &quot;good </span><span class="csC382D2BB">and</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> evil.&quot; [tov v&#39;ra]. Since this is disturbing, Christians [and many Jews] avoid or censor out this little nuance in translation. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If the evil had been made obvious by isolating it on one tree, there would have been no test for Adam and Eve. It would just be God winding up a toy and watching it run. By confusing the issue (snake symbolising confusion), Adam and Eve were given the opportunity to exercise their own will, and to perhaps grow spiritually. They missed the mark, and here we are today, confronted daily with the same Tree of Knowing Good and Evil. Christianity, being man-centered, focuses on the sin, while Judaism, the God-centered mother religion, focuses on the Creator&#39;s Oneness. Torah says &quot;Choose Life&quot; - which means we are to focus on </span><span class="csC382D2BB">this life</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, not on what we cannot know beyond that. [&quot;Choose Life&quot; has nothing to do with pregnancy, and its use as a slogan by anti-choicers is a grotesque and blasphemous mis-interpretation.] Anyway... </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Jewish Bible was passed on and carefully preserved for more than a millennium when it was finally canonized by the scribe Ezra, in 444 B.C.E. This was the first &#39;religion of the book,&#39; written and kept by people who had been in and out of exile, and with whom &#39;God had formed a special bond.&#39; The early Jewish editors were rigorously conservative, and kept the book to the basics. It was written mostly in Hebrew, with some Aramaic and Chaldean. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before the Bible was canonized (from the Hebrew </span><span class="csC382D2BB">kaneh</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, meaning &#39;cane,&#39; or&#39;upright&#39;), there were prophets everywhere. Jews were literate early on, and many considered themselves authors, commentators, or prophets. Prophecy dwindled after canonization, as the older (and official) texts gained authority. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There were also the numerous claimants to being &quot;Messiah&quot; that annoyed Jewish authorities off and on through the centuries. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some of the Jewish innovations were the concept of &#39;ethical monotheism,&#39; and a system of covenants with an immediate, personal deity. The one-on-one relationship with the creator was democratizing; for a homeless, captive people, it provided a way around &#39;the system.&#39; The Jewish idea of being &#39;The Chosen People&#39; has been causing friction for nearly 4,000 years - but the Jewish conception of &quot;chosen&quot; less like being &quot;better than,&quot; and more like being &quot;singled out.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Rabbi Jesus adhered to the ancient Jewish system of laws, and was a devout Jew (the &quot;Last Supper&quot; was a Passover Seder), but rejected legalistic corruption in the Jewish establishment. For this, conservative Jewish authorities (Sadducees) rejected Jesus, and made it easy for the Romans to crucify him. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/tarsus.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">Paul of Tarsus</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Hellenized the story of Jesus, removed its Jewishness, grafted on Pagan Greek ideas, and opened the gates to hordes of converts. The multitude of Christian cults canonized </span><span class="csC382D2BB">their</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> literature, and added it onto the Torah, calling the combined material the &quot;Old&quot; and &quot;New&quot; Testaments. But Christianity is not the &quot;next phase&quot; of Judaism. It is a religion unto itself, with Judaism as its initial inspiration, but sharply different than Judaism in its teaching. The things in Christianity that sound Jewish </span><span class="csC382D2BB">are</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Jewish. Christianity is not founded so much upon Jesus the man as upon Jesus the concept, and the resulting theology that was invented to support it. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The New Testament is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">not </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">the logical completion of the Old Testament. &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; is a misnomer, an erroneous concept - Christians </span><span class="csC382D2BB">and </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jews have both said so. Judaism is unrelated to any religion that claims that it is the one and only true religion and the sole ticket to heaven, and that if you don&#39;t join, you&#39;re damned. [Catholics also reportedly accept that theirs is not the only way to Heaven - if that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s certainly difficult to understand their role in the torture and killing of tens of thousands of innocents, for purportedly religious reasons. And yes, the Jews killed the Amorites, the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, etc., a fact that is repeated daily, and which has a constant humbling effect. Jewish guilt about its occasional oppressions of others doesn&#39;t make it any easier to contemplate the cruelty of non-Jews.] </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christianity did not </span><span class="csC382D2BB">begin</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> with Jesus, but </span><span class="csC382D2BB">after</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Jesus. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus was an Essene Jew - the Dead Sea Scrolls reveal that the ideas he taught had been part of the Essene tradition for 200 years when Jesus was alive. [Jews today do ritual immersions in water (John the Baptist was a Jew also), and believe in the Final Redemption when the Messiah comes, with the revival of the dead.] Jesus was not an innovator. Fifty years after his crucifixion by the Romans, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/tarsus.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">Paul of Tarsus</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> grafted on Pagan Mithraic ideas and began the Christianity we know today, which is so radically different than its mother religion, Judaism. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The absolutist, Heaven or Hell Christian and Islamic world views differ sharply from Torah (&quot;Old&quot; Testament) religion. They read the Bible (and later writings, Koran, New Testament) and see only black and white. The original Bible religion, Judaism, understands the relationship with the Creator differently, seeing it as a contractual relationship, a dialog, or a dialectic. Jews do not believe that theirs is</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> only </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">way to paradise. Christianity and Islam, later interpretations of Torah, are both much more prone to laying down absolute dictums about the fate of your soul. &quot;God, however, does not play dice.&quot; </span><span class="cs8C9D0446">(Albert Einstein, Jewish Physicist)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A literal approach to the Bible embalms it. The Bible&#39;s function (providing us with a diagnostic tool, a &quot;litmus test&quot; for life) is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">enhanced</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> by its contradictions and ambiguities. It forces our minds to reach beyond the obvious and find new meanings and hidden teachings. The Jewish oral tradition fills in a lot of the blanks. The Zohar (Mystical Biblical commentary from Spain in the 1200&#39;s) says: &quot;The stories in the Torah couldn&#39;t possibly be about what they seem to be about, otherwise we could write better stories!&quot; (III 152a). </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Anyone who is really interested in the Bible should take the time to learn Hebrew and study it in its original language. Experience has shown this writer that it&#39;s worth the effort. All of the hair pulling over the &quot;King James Version&quot; or whatever other translation someone&#39;s using is really a moot point. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Burning Hell, the &quot;Lake of Fire,&quot; the Pointy Tailed Devil, these fictions are all medieval-Christian scare tactics, and have nothing at all to do with the Judaism of Jesus. God created humans, and said &quot;It is Good.&quot; The God of the Bible (Jesus&#39; God) has faith in humanity, and waits for our gratitude and praise. On the other hand, the New Testament God has condemned humanity, robbed his followers of the Joy of Life, and resorted to bullying and sham to corral the faithful. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible is fractal- filled with thickets and labyrinths, and that is why people love it. It has as many contradictions as any other thought system; and is seen by some as a form of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/sant.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">poetry.</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Each of these contradictions could provide a seed for great mystical analysis.

		<span class="csCF6BBF71">There are strains of the Christian church who refer to the Bible as a &#39;Sword&#39;. The metaphor becomes real when they attack the freedoms of others. These contradictions are pointed out for their sake. Many good people believe the Bible is literally God&#39;s Word (&#39;sWord?!?), and reverence it and its teachings appropriately. But Jesus said: &quot;Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.&quot;(Matt.26:52.) </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Buddhist concept of Sword is called &#39;Prajna&#39;- &#39;cutting-through&#39; wisdom. This can be related to a line from a letter of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/tarsus.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">Paul&#39;s</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to the Hebrews where he says: &quot;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.&quot; (Hebrews: 4.12.) </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible is perhaps a potent device for meditation or prayer, or a comfort in times of loneliness, grief or adversity, but when used as a weapon, it loses its validity. The Bible&#39;s commandments are comparable to Hindu, Buddhist, or many other rule-systems, and serve societies well. Any way that people can feel peace, or improve their lives, shouldn&#39;t be disrespected. Unfortunately for peaceful believers, the fanatics twist something sacred into an ugly parody of itself. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I received the following e-mail in 1995: </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs4F7DE8F5">&quot;i don&#39;t what bible you got the verse&#39;s out of but you need to look them up your self they are wrong i look up some and it don&#39;t read that away&quot; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Wow!

Elijah didn&#39;t foretell him and he isn&#39;t a son of David. The Christian Scriptures are not historically accurate in their presentation of Pilate, and the entire writing is suspect. The resurrection narrative stands as a terribly garbled account. The theme of a dying Messiah who atones for sin is not to be found in Jewish sources, but is found in abundance in pagan mythology. How can any thinking person be a Christian? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs3F350D69">Michael </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No, Jesus did NOT fulfill the Biblical prophecies. Some of those prophecies are: &quot;For to us a child is born, ... Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, of the increase of his government and of peace, there will be no end, upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom...&quot; (Isaiah 9:6-7) and &quot;The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.&quot; Is this what Jesus brings when he says: &quot;Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother...&quot; (Matthew 10:34) or &quot;If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.&quot; (Luke 14:26) </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How does setting children against their parents bring peace, or jibe with the fifth commandment (Honor thy Father and Mother)? If Jesus meant &quot;put God first,&quot; then why didn&#39;t he say it? Why did he put himself first? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus&#39; genealogy, claiming that he was a descendant of David the King (a prophetic requirement), is not only fabricated, but doesn&#39;t make sense in light of other aspects of Paulist Christology. This concocted lineage indicates that the line of David was continued in Joseph, but if Mary was a virgin, then how could it be valid? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Then he (Jesus) strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.&quot; Matthew 16:20 </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&quot;Yet I am God your Lord from the land of Egypt; you know no God but Me, and there is no savior besides Me.&quot; Hosea 14:4 [God speaking throught the prophet Hosea] </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Bible defenders present mountains of verbiage trying to rationalize Biblical contradictions - further proving that any point can be backed up by </span><span class="csC382D2BB">something</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in the Bible. The Bible is so fraught with ambiguity that it makes perfect fodder for endless debate. Like newspaper astrologers, the Oracle at Delphi, dreamwork, or ritual magic, its pronouncements are always open to interpretation - rendering them useful more for those willing to suspend rational judgment, not to mention providing fuel for unceasing discussion about important ethical and psychological issues. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs90A83C94">About Context</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is the complaint that some of these lines are taken out of context. But these complainers are taking the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">entire Bible </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">out of context. They miss the point that these contradictions are not presented to invalidate the Bible. They are presented to invalidate fundamentalist literalism. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If a single sentence is flexible in regard to its context, then why are other solitary passages given so much import? For example the line &#39;in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost&#39; appears only once in the entire Bible,(Matthew 28:19) and yet it is at the center of one of the great concepts of Christianity, the Trinity (Which, by the way, weakens Christian claims to monotheism, in the eyes of Jews and Muslims). </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Incidentally, Deuteronomy 4:28 refers to &quot;idols of wood and stone&quot; - the Christian Cross is wood, and inside of the Kaaba, the black box the Muslims all pray to, is a stone, a meteor. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If the context neutralizes what appears to be a contradiction, then doesn&#39;t the context </span><span class="csC382D2BB">also</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> neutralize everything else in the book? The Bible is a holographic compendium of powerful metaphors; it is a fascinating, compelling labyrinth that can be a garden for its scholars; but its authority is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">chosen</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and cannot be imposed on the unwilling. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Even if the context of a passage changes the meaning </span><span class="csC382D2BB">so much</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> that it &#39;no longer contradicts,&#39; the fact is, that the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">apparent</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> contradiction is enough to prove the point that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">there are</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> contradictions, even if trivial. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An even more objective viewpoint is to for a moment not to even look at individual passages, but to look at the entire Bible, and even the New Testament, in the context of world history, other religions, other sacred texts, and other religious traditions. The Hebrew Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Levicticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, canonized 445 B.C. by Ezra and Nehamiah) has its contradictions, and the Prophets and Writings have their own contradictions. The New Testament, canonized 812 years later, in about 367 A.D., has its many contradictions and inconsistencies. (see <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/tzohr.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">Bible History</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christianity</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> itself</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> exists in a context - as a derivitive re-forming of Judaism, it shares with Islam the status of &quot;Latecomer.&quot; The words: &quot;Amen&quot; and &quot;Halleluyah&quot; are Hebrew, and were considered ancient in Davidic times (1000 BC). These words are intoned many times daily by observant Jews, with Psalms you can find in any Bible, but in Hebrew and not Elizabethan English. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs90A83C94">About Morality</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Religion or &quot;God&quot; are not the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">sources</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of morality (The source of morality is Your Heart). The immorality of some who claim to be righteous and holy, and the goodness of many without religion, demonstrates this. Religion and morality are two separate concepts that sometimes overlap, but that are really independent of each other. When religionists proclaim that theirs is the one true faith and attempt to convert or destroy those who believe differently, they are committing immorality of a most dangerous kind. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs16E84F30">THE OCCULT</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Occult&quot; means &quot;hidden,&quot; and refers to ancient knowledge and tradition forced into hiding by meddlesome Christians.

Babylonian influences solidified this entity into a specific, evil being, and now, Christianity has elevated the Devil to an equal footing with God. Bible belt teenagers becoming &#39;Satanists&#39; and going on killing sprees are the obvious products of a fundamentalist environment; borne of parents who see evil everywhere, from Harry Potter books to Tinky Winky, these kids rebel in the easiest way: becoming what their parents most fear and obsess over. They do it by claiming belief in a &quot;religion&quot; that owes its very existence to Christianity. (And yes, Anton Lavey). </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Christian obsession with the Devil and witchcraft actually fosters and propagates what they try so hard to repress. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fundamentalist abhorrence of evil is really a lack of faith, because God </span><span class="csC382D2BB">created</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Evil: </span></p><p class="csE48F72D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">[Isa 45:7 KJV] I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Trying to avoid the issue, newer translations change &quot;evil&quot; to &quot;woe,&quot; or &quot;calamity,&quot; but the Hebrew word in the original is &quot;Ra,&quot; which translates into &quot;Evil.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">As Christianity took over Europe, attempts to suppress Pagan holy day celebrations met fierce resistance.

To be consistent, then, they should also reject Christmas (Yule), Easter (Ostara), and Pentecost (Lugnasa&eth;), also Pagan holidays co-opted by Christians in an attempt to erase the true origins. They should also reject the Resurrection (Pagan) and the transubstantiation of bread and wine into blood and flesh (Pagan). Christian demons and devils are no different than Buddhist, or even Hindu ones (Not as colorful though...) Christian God-forms (Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghost, the Devil) are just as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as any other religions&#39;. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christians believe that Pagans worship the Earth, and say it is sin to worship the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">created</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, instead of worshiping the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Creator</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.

Eve&#39;s role in this story has been used to justify oppressive attitudes towards women, and nature, especially within parts of the Christian tradition. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Evolution of Creation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&#39;Creationists&#39; insist that when evolution is taught in schools it should be preceded with the disclaimer that &#39;It is only a theory.&#39; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Perhaps when teaching &#39;creation science,&#39; </span><span class="csC382D2BB">that</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> class should be preceded with the disclaimer:&#39;The Bible consists entirely of mythology, incomplete history, and unprovable claims.&#39; Christian doctrine </span><span class="csC382D2BB">cannot</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> be proven - faith is NOT proof. Nor is the fact that it is written in black and white proof. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The fact of biological evolution is so much more mystical and awe inspiring than the 6 day fundamentalist metaphor, it&#39;s hard to believe they can disassociate their abbreviated, magical/miraculous version of life&#39;s beginnings from observed reality. This refusal to adapt the facts into their belief system destroys their credibility almost more than anything else they do. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A belief system that cannot co-exist with observed science is invalid. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Genesis says the world was created in six days. It also says that Adam lived 930 years (Gen 5:5), and that Noah was 600 years old when the flood happened (Gen 7:6). We can take these figures literally, believing that &quot;people just lived longer in those days,&quot; or if we have a shred of intelligence or honesty, we can surmise that Biblical time reckoning is on a metaphoric scale. Of course, this allows Genesis to agree with observed evolution. </span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="csCAF88F58">&quot;But do not ignore this one fact beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.&quot; </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">(2 Peter 3:8) </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Creationists are now trying to push &quot;Intelligent Design,&quot; a cobbled together scientific-sounding fairy tale that pretends to refute the obvious process of nature.

How could they all be right? They are all equally convinced, equally fooled, and equally brainwashed. (The Jews believe that theirs is not necessarily the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">only</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> way to Heaven, and don&#39;t try to convert anyone.

Ask all of the people </span><span class="csC382D2BB">they</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> have attacked. Look at their arrogant dismissal of all other beliefs. Look at their bad taste-- bumper stickers that say: &quot;Christians aren&#39;t perfect; they&#39;re just forgiven.&quot; (The implication here is that they are </span><span class="csC382D2BB">nearly</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> perfect; still </span><span class="csC382D2BB">better</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> than nonbelievers.

One approached a friend&#39;s mother after he broke his neck, hinting that her resistance to Christianity was the cause. The notion that a pack of irrational nonsense would have prevented a car accident, or that it would cure a broken neck is annoying enough; but the egotism of someone trying to get another &#39;notch on their gun&#39; at such a sensitive time is appalling. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another example is a how a co-worker told me that his father, a Baptist minister, has systematically manipulated the family inheritance in such a way that his seven other brothers and sisters are completely cut out of receiving any money. He has also disowned his son and refused him burial in the family plot, because his son, 52 years old with a grown daughter, has admitted to himself and the world that he&#39;s gay. This man, a Baptist minister, a supposedly moral person, justifies his cold-blooded viciousness to </span><span class="csC382D2BB">his own family</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> because he believes he&#39;s right and has all the answers. Typical behavior, similar to that of Tom DeLay and so many other self-annointed, sanctimonious Christians, who believe that any act, no matter how dishonest, unethical, or deceitful, is justified if it &quot;leads to the cross.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;Fundamentalists&quot; frequently mis-interpret the very scripture they use to browbeat people with. Their blanket condemnation of homosexuality ignores the fact that </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">the Bible says absolutely nothing about Lesbianism</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> - there is no prohibition of women having sex with other women in the Bible at all - yet Gay women are included in Christian busybody attacks on people&#39;s private lives. Conversely, while the second of the Ten Commandments prohibits &quot;Graven Images,&quot; the Catholic Church is crawling with images and carvings of saints, apostles, and the mutilated corpse of the Rabbi Jesus they worship. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The &quot;Message,&quot; as they call it, that they want to tell everyone about, is nothing new. Everyone has heard it. To assume out of hand that other&#39;s religion is error, and that they come with the correct answer, is insulting and only makes the &quot;messenger&quot; look stupid. Don&#39;t they get sick of &quot;saving&quot; each other over and over? </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Of course, some genuinely want to help the world, and actually do. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that. Christians actually do huge amounts of charity and relief work and are to be greatly commended and admired. This is teaching and leading by example - a totally meritorious and noble activity. But one thing leads to another, and the demons that are necessary to fuel the Christian/Muslim cosmologies become larger-than-life terrors. Before you know it, you&#39;ve got Wahabi Muslims, or Calvinists, or Ralph Reed and Tom DeLay. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">They claim it is &quot;compassion&quot; that drives them to proselytize; but it is not. Nagging doubt presses them to convert others, for when others fall in line, the Christian mythos gets another &quot;yes&quot; vote, so it </span><span class="csC382D2BB">must</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> be right. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Callous, xenophobic, and lacking experience of the larger world, fundamentalists see the devil&#39;s hoofprints everywhere, in anything outside of their sheltered, one-dimensional lifestyle. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Fundamentalists personify the &#39;Ugly Americans.&#39; (Elsewhere in the world, United States citizens have a reputation for being loud, insensitive, pushy, infantile, and myopic; hence &quot;Ugly Americans.&quot; [The <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://dim.com/~randl/news.htm"><span class="csE67D1022">current</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> occupant of the Oval Office is the Ugliest of Them All.) Fundies achieve this </span><span class="csC382D2BB">within our own borders</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, with the same selfish oblivion to the experience of others. Like the loudmouthed polyester-clad boor in Italy, the Fundie assumes that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">everyone</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> speaks his language, and that they&#39;re just pretending not to.

Contemplating the Trinity or the Binding of Isaac is to contemplate contradiction, which opens the mind to mystery. How can God be all-powerful, creating distant galaxies, and also be active in human history, concerned about our every thought? The mystics of Bible religion freely admit that there are ambiguities and impossibilities in the Bible; they are able to use these to get closer to the Eternal One. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The mystics don&#39;t carry signs that say &quot;God Hates Fags,&quot; though, because they know better. Only literalists, with their limited learning and understanding, attempt the hopeless task of making every word stand up to modern rational scrutiny (and their own stunted agendas). This is destroying religion, ripping the mystery out of it and turning it into pre-fab fast food. Many people </span><span class="csC382D2BB">HATE</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> religion, because of its various ugly failings. What do they turn to? Consumer Culture.

The anti-intellectualism of fundamentalism makes mysticism impossible. </span></p><p class="cs2C9D4ECD"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christian Ayatollahs whip their sheep into frenzies by scapegoating and playing on their fears.

Cynically, doubting our ability to improve, Christianity dwells on the corruption in humanity, death, and avoidance of Hell. Judaism, the religion that Christianity evolved out of, puts God and Torah (the Bible) at the center, trusting and cultivating our potential to come near, and says &quot;choose life!&quot; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">not </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">referring to the terrible choice some women have to make). Christianity puts intermediaries (Jesus, Saints, Popes, Bishops, Priests, etc.) between people and God; Judaism allows a </span><span class="csC382D2BB">direct</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> connection. Judaism does not claim to be the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">only</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> way to get close to God, while Christianity does. Christianity is uncomfortable with learning and an intellectual approach; Judaism sees scholarship as a core element of spirituality. Judaism is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">not</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> just Christianity without Jesus. Unlike Christianity, un-assimilated Judaism is deeply mystical, intellectual, challenging, and growth-oriented, while at the same time being passionate, humorous, lively, and playful.
