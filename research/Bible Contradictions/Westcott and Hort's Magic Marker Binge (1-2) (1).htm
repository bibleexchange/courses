<H1>Would you take a magic marker to your Bible and cross out words from 
passages?</H1>
<P>This chart illustrates what was done when the text used by Christianity for 
1800 years was replaced with a text assembled by Westcott and Hort in the 
nineteenth century and used as the basis for the English Revised Version, which 
nearly all modern translations closely follow.</P>
<P>The text shown here is the King James Version. Words, sentences, or entire 
verses in <S><FONT color=#660000><B>strikethrough</B></FONT></S> illustrate 
portions that have been removed from the text underlying the KJV New Testament. 
<B>Not all modern versions are the same. </B>Sometimes the NASB will include a 
word the NIV doesn't, or the NRSV might omit a phrase the NIV and NASB both 
retain, etc... but for the most part, the examples below represent nearly all of 
the popular modern versions. (Psudeo-KJV versions such as the NKJV are far more 
subtle and are a different case. See the articles section for NKJV 
examinations.)</P>
<P>Compare your modern version and see what the KJV has that yours doesn't. 
<I>This list is not comprehensive, it is just a sample!</I> <B>The modern 
critical text that forms the basis for nearly all modern versions omits the 
equivalent of the entire books of 1st and 2nd Peter.</B></P>
<DIV align=center>
<DIV class=shadebox>
<P>Critics commonly charge that the traditional Bible text used by believers for 
1800 years <I>adds</I> material, and that we should be thankful for Westcott and 
Hort who came along in the 19th century to restore the text of the New Testament 
that had been corrupt for 1800 years and during the entire reformation. This 
charge is of course made <I>against evidence to the contrary</I>, as you will 
find if you research the text lines (read other articles on this website). 
Further, it is interesting to note that one of these verses is this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Romans 13:9</B>: For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt 
  not kill, Thou shalt not steal, <U><B>Thou shalt not bear false 
  witness</B></U>, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, 
  it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy 
  neighbour as thyself.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The phrase "thou shalt not bear false witness" is missing from the modern 
critical text (and therefor most modern versions). Now I ask you: is it 
reasonable to assume that a scribe <I>added</I> a self-incriminating phrase to 
the passage? Isn't it more likely that "those who corrupt the word of God" (2 
Cor. 2:17, KJV) <I>removed</I> the phrase which indicted them?</P></DIV></DIV>
