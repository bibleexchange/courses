In other words Moses taught the people that victory over their enemies was a sign from God that their behavior was pleasing to God, while their defeat and deaths at their enemies&#39; hands was to be construed as God&#39;s disfavor, he finding fault with his people as unworthy sinners who needed chastizing via defeats at the hands of their enemies.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Christianity turns Moses&#39; teachings upside down and on their ear for it declares that just because a Christian&#39;s enemies triumph over him in taking his life, this does not mean God holds his people in disfavor, he is only &quot;testing&quot; them to see if they will be loyal to him till death. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Where are Christians getting these notions from that contradict Moses&#39; teachings if they do not exist in the Old Testament?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">I understand that Christianity is a hybrid religion which has embraced Hellenistic Greek motifs which glorify martyrdom. Judah was under Hellenistic Greek rule by the Greek Seleucids of Antioch, Syria and the Ptolemies of Alexandria, Egypt. The Book of Four Maccabbees reveals that some Jews, including priests had accepted Greek religious beliefs. The Maccabees led a succesful revolt, purging the Jerusalem Temple of apostate Greek sympathizers and restored the cult to its pre-Greek Mosaic rituals and point of view. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">The Maccabees never-the-less fell under Hellenistic Greek influence and the writings of the intertestamental period (the Apocrypha) glorify Jewish martyrs who resisted the Syrian Greeks by refusing to accept Greek gods and rituals into the Temple. These Jewish martyrs are dated circa 160 B.C., about 160 years before&nbsp; Christ&#39;s birth. So, for at least 160 years Jews had come to glorify and honor martyrs who gave their lives for the faith.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">I understand that the Jewish cult of martyrs, assimilated from the Hellenistic Greeks, was transferred to the Christians who saw Jesus as a type of martyr who was willing to lay down his life for the sake of the Kingdom of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Henten and Avemarie (2002) on Martyrs in pre-Christian times (before the first century A.D.).

Ancient philosophers valued sacrifice on behalf of others for important causes. Some of them put this ideal into practice themselves. They functioned as model figures, because they showed how important goals could be reached even under extremely difficult circumstances. Indeed, Aristotle characterises a virtuous person as somebody who is prepared to sacrifice himself for one&#39;s friends and one&#39;s homeland and if necessary, to die for it.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(p. 11. &quot;Noble death of philosophers.&quot; Jan Willem van Henten &amp; Friedrich Avemarie. </span><span class="csF9A76D5">Martyrdom and Noble Death: Selected Texts from Graeco-Roman, Jewish and Christian Antiquity</span><span class="cs6DA126DA">.

Severe suffering or execution did not shake their convictions.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&quot;In the Roman period philosophers believed that Socrates also provided an example of how to live. Paradoxically, his death exemplified this way of life. The Stoic philosopher Epictetus, for example, refers to Socrates in his presentation of the ideal philosopher as a witness for the truth who refuses to make any concession that would lead to betraying one&#39;s conviction. Socrates&#39; acceptance of death formed the ultimate proof of his steadfastness and ability to maintain his freedom of thinking under any circumstances. Epictetus greatly admires his resolute decision to prefer a noble death to living on dishonourably: He saves himself by dying, not by flight.&#39; Socrates figures in Epictetus&#39; argument as the steadfast philosopher who does not shrink away from the threats of a tyrant, who says what he has to say with full frankness and independence, and accepts torture or even execution if these are the consequences of his attitude. Jewish and Christian martyrs also share Socrates&#39; attitude towards death, which was ideal in the eyes of many in the imperial age.&quot; (p. 14. &quot;Pagan Traditions of Noble Death.&quot;)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&quot;The famous Athenian dramatist, Euripides (fifth century BCE), depicts the theme of noble death in several of his tragedies. These tragedies are often situated in a mythic past. They may, however, have fulfilled an exemplary function for the audience with an eye upon the contemporay political situation. Several tragedies highlight the theme of atoning or substitute death. Before life could continue, the wishes of an Olympic or anonymous god had to be fulfilled, or the spirit of a deceased person had to be satisfied. Euripides&#39; penchant for the theme of self-sacrifice may be closely connected with the social and political developments in Athens...&quot; (pp. 14-15. Henten &amp; Avemarie)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&quot;Noble death clearly has a patriotic significance in Euripides&#39; tragedies...Erechtheus...the sacrifice of another maiden, the daughter of the Athenian king Erechtheus. The mother of the girl...agrees to her daughter&#39;s sacrifice, because she thinks that it better that one dies instead of all. Such a depiction of the death of an individual as a substitue for the death of many or all can be found in several later texts, including Christian ones. Famous, of course, is the high priest Caiaphas&#39; statement about Jesus&#39; death in the Gospel of John, which anticipates and comments upon John&#39;s passion narrative&quot; &#39;You do not understand that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed&#39; (John 11:50). Praxithea explains the effective meaning of her daughter&#39;s death and states that she dies as one for all and the benefit of the city.&quot; (p. 16.

The Jews found this Christian argument to be nonsensical. Their Torah quite clearly told them that once a year on Yom Kippur God would forgive the whole nation of _all_ their sins, so there was _no need_ for a savior to be born and killed to redeem man of his sins and reconcile man to God; notice also that this annual procedure for absolvement of &quot;all sins&quot; is declared to be &quot;everlasting&quot; and without end, for all of eternity. God does not say this statute is in force until the arrival of a post-exilic messiah, it is in force for all of eternity, even after the messiah&#39;s arrival, a notion repudiated by Christianity. So why would God _contradict Himself_ by changing His mind ending Yom Kippur and replacing it with Christianity and a slain savior? It makes no sense.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Leviticus 16:30-34 RSV</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&quot;...for on this day shall ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU, to cleanse you; from ALL YOUR SINS you shall be clean before the Lord...the priest...shall make atonement...for ALL THE PEOPLE of the assembly.

Jeremiah understood at the conclusion of a 70 year Exile (Jer 25:12) while Ezekiel understood it would be at the conclusion of a 40 year Exile (Ez 4:6). The Bible informs us that prophets are not to be believed until their prophecies have been accomplished (De 18:21). The fact that Jeremiah and Ezekiel were wrong is given &quot;a blind-eye&quot; by both Jewish and Christian apologists who both argue that the faithful should continue to believe in the prophets despite the biblical warning _</span><span class="cs9C4758E0">you are not to believe until the prophecy is fulfilled_</span><span class="cs6DA126DA"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(De 18:21).

I think we should go back and look at whether Christianity is even a valid belief. So let&#39;s start with the core belief of Christianity - that Jesus is the &#39;Messiah&#39; (whether Jesus even existed is another question and there are lots of books written about this - fact is there is little evidence for it, but that doesn&#39;t even matter here). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">According to Christian belief, the Messiah that will save Israel and mark a new era in God&#39;s kingom on earth, can only be the Messiah if he is in line to be the king of Israel, which requires the Messiah be in the royal line of Solomon, and shall NOT be, according to Jeremiah 22:28-29, a descendent of Jeconiah. In this context check out Matthew 1:1-16 and Luke 3:23-38 where we are presented with two genealogies of Jesus that are in conflict. They both cannot be correct as they disagree, and this discredits the bible as the infallible word of God. But Christians don&#39;t give up so easy, they explain away the different lineages by claiming the genealogy found in Matthew is the lineage of Jesus through his father Joseph, and the genealogy found in Luke is the lineage of jesus through his mother Mary. Now there is no reason found in the Bible to think this, and both passages in fact say they are the lineages of Jesus through his father Joseph, but Christians need to explain away the contradiction or the basis for their whole religion is in question. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">In the lineage in Matthew, a couple of issues arise - first, Joseph was NOT the father of Jesus, since Mary was a virgin. As Christians claim, God was the father not Joseph. But God is not a descendant of Solomon. So if God is the biological father of Jesus, as the gospels and Christians assert, then Jesus is not a descendant of Solomon, and if not, then he cannot be the Messiah. Further, if you read the lineage in Matthew, Jeconiah is in the list of ancestors of Jesus. But according to Jeremiah 22:28-29, no descendants of Jeconiah can be king of Israel. But the Messiah has to be a king according to prophecy...thus for two reasons, Jesus could not be the Messiah based on this lineage.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">So that leaves us with Luke&#39;s lineage. This lineage is different than the one in Matthew, so Christian scholars attempt to justify this by claiming the lineage in Luke is through Jesus&#39; mother Mary. However, even if we accept this lineage is indeed Mary&#39;s, which there is no reason to do other than to justify the discrepancy, you must deal with a second difficulty - the rights of the royal line are not passed through the mother, only the father. Even though Mary, through her lineage, was a descendant of David as required by prophecy, she should be excluded from being able to pass those rights of the bloodline because of being a female (Deut 21:16). But even if Mary could transfer kingship, Mary (if this is indeed her genealogy) is a descendant of Nathan not Solomon. Nathan is a brother of Solomon, and the Messiah must be a descendant of Solomon, so again, this lineage cannot be that of the Messiah. Even if the kingship could go through Nathan, Luke lists two people in this genealogy named Shealtiel and Zerubbabel and they are descendents of Jeconiah according to Matthew 1:12, and as shown above, Jeconiah cannot be an ancestor of the Messiah. Further, in Matthew, Jeconiah is listed as a descendent of Solomon, so the lineages again disagree, and Luke&#39;s then disagrees with other Old Testament lineages which also show Shealtiel and Zerubbabel as descendants of Solomon not Nathan. So, the question is, is Mary a descendant of Solomon through Jeconiah or of Nathan and not Solomon? Either answer disqualifies the lineage as that of the Messiah, ignoring completely that the kingship could not be transferred through the mother anyhow. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">The fun of all of this is that it shows that Jesus CANNOT be the Messiah, and if he is not, the basis for Christianity whithers.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://forums.thestranger.com/showthread.php?t=3521" target="_self"><span class="csA555AFC7">http://forums.thestranger.com/showthread.php?t=3521</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs29D35F49">Conclusions (27 January 2009):</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Jesus Christ cannot be the Messiah for several reasons as has been presented above:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(1) He arrived at the &quot;wrong time,&quot; he was 500 years too late according to the timetables of Ezekiel and Jeremiah.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(2) What he would &quot;do&quot; as a Messiah according to Christians is in _contradiction_ to his duties as presented by Ezekiel (the Messiah offering the blood of slain bulls and goats for his sins and his people&#39;s sins on a regular basis, monthly and yearly, for all of eternity).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(3) He didn&#39;t fulfill the Messianic Prophecies appearing in the Old Testament (leading Israel and Judah to military victories over their human enemies).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(4) He doesn&#39;t have the necessary Messianic Lineage.

For the New Testament claims that Joseph was a descendent of King Jeconiah, who in the Hebrew Bible was cursed to never have a descendent &ldquo;sitting on the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah&rdquo; (Jeremiah 22:30).

The term &quot;Messiah&quot; is simply the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek term &quot;Christ.&quot;...Why is it that the vast majority of Jews has always rejected that Jesus is the one who was predicted- a savior sent from God in order to suffer for others, so as to bring salvation, and then be raised from the dead?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">The answer is actually quite simple. In the Jewish tradition, before the appearance of Christianity, there was no expectation of a suffering Messiah. But doesn&#39;t the Bible constantly talk about the Messiah who would suffer? As it turns out, the answer is no. Since the beginning, Christians have frequently cited certain passages in the Old Testament as clear prophecies of the future suffering Messiah, passages such as Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22, in which someone suffers horribly, sometimes expressly for the sins of others. These passages, Christians have claimed, are clear statements about what the Messiah would be like. Jews who do not believe in Jesus, however, have always had a very effective response: the Messiah is never mentioned in these passages. You can check it out for yourself: read Isaiah 53 or Psalm 22...The term &quot;Messiah&quot; never occurs in them. In Jewish tradition, these passages refer not to the Messiah but to someone else...&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(pp. 227-229. &quot;A Suffering Messiah.&quot; Bart D.

But obviously if they said &quot;Jesus is the Messiah,&quot; they meant it in a traditional Jewish sense, for example, that he would be the king who would establish the throne once more in Israel and rule over his people...This hope that Jesus could be the Messiah was radically disconfirmed by the events of history: Jesus never did raise an army, never did drive the Romans out of the promised land, never did establish Israel as a soveriegn state. Instead he got crucified. This showed his followers that their faith in him had been unfounded...the earliest Christians...logic was impeccable. Jesus is the Messiah. Jesus suffered and died Therefore, the Messiah had to suffer and die.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">But what was one to do with the fact that there were no Jewish prophecies that the Messiah would suffer and die? The earliest Christians began searching the Scriptures for hints of their new belief, and they found them, not in passages that referred to the Messiah but in other passages that describe the suffering of God&#39;s righteous one. Christians concluded, and argued, that these passages were actually referring to the Messiah, even though the Messiah is never mentioned in them and even though no one had ever thought, before this, that they referred to the Messiah.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(pp. 233-234.

It is no wonder that the apostle Paul, writing decades after Christians had come up with this idea, indicates that it is the greatest stumbling block for the Jews (1 Corinthians 1:23). Even though this is the very foundation for all Christian belief, to many Jews it was a ridiculous claim.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(p. 236.

Ehrman understands that the earliest followers of Jesus, called the Ebionites, observed Torah. He understands that these people were later denounced as heretics, marginalized and superceded by later Christians who believed, under Paul&#39;s influence, that Jesus had intended to do away with Judaism. That is to say the &quot;original&quot; Jewish-Christians, the Ebionites, observed Torah and circumcision.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Ehrman:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">&quot;One of the most pressing and intriguing questions that historians of early Christianity have had to face is how the thoroughly Jewish religion of Jesus so quickly transformed itself into a religion of gentiles.

It was only his later followers who saw him as starting a new religion. He appears to have had no intent to start a new religion. Some of his later followers retained the Jewish character of his proclamation. As the Christian religion developed in other directions, however, these followers came to labeled heretics. This is one of the real ironies of the early Christian tradition, that the original form of the religion came to be cast out and denounced.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">The followers of Jesus known as the Ebionites urged that Jesus never intended to abrogate the law; since he was the Jewish Messiah sent from the Jewish God to the Jewish people in fulfillment of the Jewish law, and since he himself wholeheartedly embraced the Jewish law, his followers needed to be Jewish -and needed to keep the law...Jesus taught his followers that they needed to keep the law if they wanted to enter the kingdom of heaven. In fact, they had to keep it even better than the leaders of the Jews themselves (Matthew 5:17-20). Jesus in this Gospel is portrayed as a teacher of the law who conveys its true meaning to his followers. He never urges them to break any of the laws. He urges them to follow him by observing the law.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">This view of what it meant to follow Jesus was destined to lose out in the struggles over core beliefs in the early church. The apostle Paul&#39;s views were different from those of the Ebionites (who saw Paul as the archenemy), of Matthew, and of Jesus himself. Paul was quite vociferous in claiming that the law can have no role in having a right standing before God.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">(pp. 237-239.
