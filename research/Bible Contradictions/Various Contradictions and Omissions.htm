<H1>Various Contradictions and Omissions</H1>
<P>This table compares various verses in the KJV, NIV, NASB, and NWT. The term 
"OMITTED" is used when either the phrase <I>or</I> the verse in question is 
omitted. This table is a very small sampling of contradictory verses, not an 
exhaustive one.</P>
<P>Some people have objected to me comparing the NWT with the NIV and NASB. They 
complain that the NWT is an "obvious" corruption of Scripture on the part of the 
Jehovah's Witness cult. Instead of complaining about the comparison, they should 
be wondering why the NIV and NASB so frequently agree with the NWT.</P>
<P class=smtxt>I have noticed that in some cases, different editions may not 
treat a verse the same way. This table represents the verses as I have them in 
my printed editions (NIV&nbsp;1984, NASB&nbsp;1977, NWT&nbsp;1984).</P>
