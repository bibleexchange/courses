He said: Surely I know what you do not know.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.31</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And He taught Adam all the names, then presented them to the angels; then He said: Tell me the names of those if you are right.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.32</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] They said: Glory be to Thee! we have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us; surely Thou art the Knowing, the Wise.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.33</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] He said: O Adam! inform them of their names. Then when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not say to you that I surely know what is ghaib in the heavens and the earth and (that) I know what you manifest and what you hide?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.34</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam they did obeisance, but Iblis (did it not). He refused and he was proud, and he was one of the unbelievers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.35</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden and eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish and do not approach this tree, for then you will be of the unjust.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.36</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] But the Shaitan made them both fall from it, and caused them to depart from that (state) in which they were; and We said: Get forth, some of you being the enemies of others, and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.37</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Then Adam received (some) words from his Lord, so He turned to him mercifully; surely He is Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.38</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] We said: Go forth from this (state) all; so surely there will come to you a guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, no fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.39</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject My communications, they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.40</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] O children of Israel! call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and be faithful to (your) covenant with Me, I will fulfill (My) covenant with you; and of Me, Me alone, should you be afraid.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.41</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And believe in what I have revealed, verifying that which is with you, and be not the first to deny it, neither take a mean price in exchange for My communications; and Me, Me alone should you fear.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.42</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And do not mix up the truth with the falsehood, nor hide the truth while you know (it).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.43</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and bow down with those who bow down.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.44</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] What! do you enjoin men to be good and neglect your own souls while you read the Book; have you then no sense?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.45</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And seek assistance through patience and prayer, and most surely it is a hard thing except for the humble ones,<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.46</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Who know that they shall meet their Lord and that they shall return to Him.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.47</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] O children of Israel! call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.48</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And be on your guard against a day when one soul shall not avail another in the least, neither shall intercession on its behalf be accepted, nor shall any compensation be taken from it, nor shall they be helped.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.49</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We delivered you from Firon&#39;s people, who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.50</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and drowned the followers of Firon and you watched by.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.51</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We appointed a time of forty nights with Musa, then you took the calf (for a god) after him and you were unjust.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.52</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Then We pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.53</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We gave Musa the Book and the distinction that you might walk aright.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.54</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when Musa said to his people: O my people! you have surely been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for a god), therefore turn to your Creator (penitently), so kill your people, that is best for you with your Creator: so He turned to you (mercifully), for surely He is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.55</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when you said: O Musa! we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly, so the punishment overtook you while you looked on.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.56</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Then We raised you up after your death that you may give thanks.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.57</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And We made the clouds to give shade over you and We sent to you manna and quails: Eat of the good things that We have given you; and they did not do Us any harm, but they made their own souls suffer the loss.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.58</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate making obeisance, and say, forgiveness. We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who do good (to others).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.59</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them, so We sent upon those who were unjust a pestilence from heaven, because they transgressed.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.60</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when Musa prayed for drink for his people, We said: Strike the rock with your staff So there gushed from it twelve springs; each tribe knew its drinking place: Eat and drink of the provisions of Allah and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.61</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when you said: O Musa! we cannot bear with one food, therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask for. And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them, and they became deserving of Allah&#39;s wrath; this was so because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.62</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.63</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We took a promise from you and lifted the mountain over you: Take hold of the law (Tavrat) We have given you with firmness and bear in mind what is in it, so that you may guard (against evil).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.64</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Then you turned back after that; so were it not for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you, you would certainly have been among the losers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.65</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And certainly you have known those among you who exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, so We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.66</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and those who came after it, and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.67</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when Musa said to his people: Surely Allah commands you that you should sacrifice a cow; they said: Do you ridicule us? He said: I seek the protection of Allah from being one of the ignorant.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.68</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow neither advanced in age nor too young, of middle age between that (and this); do therefore what you are commanded.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.69</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what her color is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a yellow cow; her color is intensely yellow, giving delight to the beholders.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.70</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is, for surely to us the cows are all alike, and if Allah please we shall surely be guided aright.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.71</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow not made submissive that she should plough the land, nor does she irrigate the tilth; sound, without a blemish in her. They said: Now you have brought the truth; so they sacrificed her, though they had not the mind to do (it).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.72</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when you killed a man, then you disagreed with respect to that, and Allah was to bring forth that which you were going to hide.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.73</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] So We said: Strike the (dead body) with part of the (Sacrificed cow), thus Allah brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs so that you may understand.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.74</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Then your hearts hardened after that, so that they were like rocks, rather worse in hardness; and surely there are some rocks from which streams burst forth, and surely there are some of them which split asunder so water issues out of them, and surely there are some of them which fall down for fear of Allah, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.75</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after they had understood it, and they know (this).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.76</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when they meet those who believe they say: We believe, and when they are alone one with another they say: Do you talk to them of what Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this before your Lord? Do you not then understand?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.77</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.78</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And there arc among them illiterates who know not the Book but only lies, and they do but conjecture.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.79</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Woe, then, to those who write the book with their hands and then say: This is from Allah, so that they may take for it a small price; therefore woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.80</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And they say: Fire shall not touch us but for a few days. Say: Have you received a promise from Allah, then Allah will not fail to perform His promise, or do you speak against Allah what you do not know?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.81</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Yeal whoever earns evil and his sins beset him on every side, these are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.82</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, these are the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.83</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: You shall not serve any but Allah and (you shall do) good to (your) parents, and to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy, and you shall speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate. Then you turned back except a few of you and (now too) you turn aside.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.84</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your cities; then you gave a promise while you witnessed.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.85</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you out of their homes, backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits; and if they should come to you, as captives you would ransom them-- while their very turning out was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the other? What then is the re ward of such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous chastisement, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.86</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] These are they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter, so their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.87</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent apostles after him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit, What! whenever then an apostle came to you with that which your souls did not desire, you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.88</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And they say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.89</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that which they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve, but when there came to them (Prophet) that which they did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so Allah&#39;s curse is on the unbelievers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.90</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they should deny what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.91</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when it is said to them, Believe in what Allah has revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed to us; and they deny what is besides that, while it is the truth verifying that which they have. Say: Why then did you kill Allah&#39;s Prophets before if you were indeed believers?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.92</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments, then you took the calf (for a god) in his absence and you were unjust.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.93</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief Say: Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.94</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Say: If the future abode with Allah is specially for you to the exclusion of the people, then invoke death if you are truthful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.95</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have sent before, and Allah knows the unjust.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.96</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life (greedier) than even those who are polytheists; every one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the chastisement, and Allah sees what they<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.97</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Say: Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel-- for surely he revealed it to your heart by Allah&#39;s command, verifying that which is before it and guidance and good news for the believers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.98</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His apostles and Jibreel and Meekaeel, so surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.99</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.100</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] What! whenever they make a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? Nay, most of them do not believe.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.101</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when there came to them an Apostle from Allah verifying that which they have, a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.102</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, &quot;Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a disbeliever.&quot; Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot hurt with it any one except with Allah&#39;s permission, and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls, had they but known this.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.103</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And if they had believed and guarded themselves (against evil), reward from Allah would certainly have been better; had they but known (this).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.104</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] O you who believe! do not say Raina and say Unzurna and listen, and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.105</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do not like, nor do the polytheists, that the good should be sent down to you from your Lord, and Allah chooses especially whom He pleases for His mercy, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.106</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.107</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Do you not know that Allah&#39;s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah you have no guardian or helper?<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.108</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Rather you wish to put questions to your Apostle, as Musa was questioned before; and whoever adopts unbelief instead of faith, he indeed has lost the right direction of the way.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.109</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back into unbelievers after your faith, out of envy from themselves, (even) after the truth has become manifest to them; but pardon and forgive, so that Allah should bring about His command; surely Allah has power over all things.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.110</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and whatever good you send before for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah sees what you do.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.111</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And they say: None shall enter the garden (or paradise) except he who is a Jew or a Christian. These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.112</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Yes! whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is the doer of good (to others) he has his reward from his Lord, and there is no fear for him nor shall he grieve.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.113</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like to what they say; so Allah shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.114</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And who is more unjust than he who prevents (men) from the masjids of Allah, that His name should be remembered in them, and strives to ruin them? (As for) these, it was not proper for them that they should have entered them except in fear; they shall meet with disgrace in this world, and they shall have great chastisement in the hereafter.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.115</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And Allah&#39;s is the East and the West, therefore, whither you turn, thither is Allah&#39;s purpose; surely Allah is Amplegiving, Knowing.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.116</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And they say: Allah has taken to himself a son. Glory be to Him; rather, whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His; all are obedient to Him.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.117</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, Be, so there it is.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.118</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And those who have no knowledge say: Why does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us?

Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who are sure.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.119</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner, and you shall not be called upon to answer for the companions of the flaming fire.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.120</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians until you follow their religion.

They said: How can he hold kingship over us while we have a greater right to kingship than he, and he has not been granted an abundance of wealth? He said: Surely Allah has chosen him in preference to you, and He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique, and Allah grants His kingdom to whom He pleases, and Allah is Amplegiving, Knowing.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.248</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And the prophet said to them: Surely the sign of His kingdom is, that there shall come to you the chest in which there is tranquillity from your Lord and residue of the relics of what the children of Musa and the children of Haroun have left, the angels bearing it; most surely there is a sign in this for those who believe.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.249</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] So when Talut departed with the forces, he said: Surely Allah will try you with a river; whoever then drinks from it, he is not of me, and whoever does not taste of it, he is surely of me, except he who takes with his hand as much of it as fills the hand; but with the exception of a few of them they drank from it. So when he had crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said: We have today no power against Jalut and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet their Lord said: How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by Allah&#39;s permission, and Allah is with the patient.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.250</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when they went out against Jalut and his forces they said: Our Lord, pour down upon us patience, and make our steps firm and assist us against the unbelieving people.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.251</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] So they put them to flight by Allah&#39;s permission. And Dawood slew Jalut, and Allah gave him kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of what He pleased. And were it not for Allah&#39;s repelling some men with others, the earth would certainly be in a state of disorder; but Allah is Gracious to the creatures.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.252</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] These are the communications of Allah: We recite them to you with truth; and most surely you are (one) of the apostles.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.253</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] We have made some of these apostles to excel the others among them are they to whom Allah spoke, and some of them He exalted by (many degrees of) rank; and We gave clear miracles to Isa son of Marium, and strengthened him with the holy spirit. And if Allah had pleased, those after them would not have fought one with another after clear arguments had come to them, but they disagreed; so there were some of them who believed and others who denied; and if Allah had pleased they would not have fought one with another, but Allah brings about what He intends.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.254</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] O you who believe! spend out of what We have given you before the day comes in which there is no bargaining, neither any friendship nor intercession, and the unbelievers-- they are the unjust.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.255</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving, the Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His; who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission?

When Ibrahim said: My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die, he said: I give life and cause death. Ibrahim said: So surely Allah causes the sun to rise from the east, then make it rise from the west; thus he who disbelieved was confounded; and Allah does not guide aright the unjust people.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.259</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Or the like of him (Uzair) who passed by a town, and it had fallen down upon its roofs; he said: When will Allah give it life after its death? So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him to life. He said: How long have you tarried? He said: I have tarried a day, or a part of a day. Said He: Nay! you have tarried a hundred years; then look at your food and drink-- years have not passed over it; and look at your ass; and that We may make you a sign to men, and look at the bones, how We set them together, then clothed them with flesh; so when it became clear to him, he said: I know that Allah has power over all things.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2.260</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when Ibrahim said: My Lord! show me how Thou givest life to the dead, He said: What! and do you not believe?

But they will give them back the reply: Most surely you are liars.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.87</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day; and what they used to forge shall depart from them.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.88</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] (As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah&#39;s way, We will add chastisement to their chastisement because they made mischief.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.89</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And on the day when We will raise up in every people a witness against them from among themselves, and bring you as a witness against these-- and We have revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything, and a guidance and mercy and good news for those who submit.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.90</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the doing of good (to others) and the giving to the kindred, and He forbids indecency and evil and rebellion; He admonishes you that you may be mindful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.91</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have made a covenant, and do not break the oaths after making them fast, and you have indeed made Allah a surety for you; surely Allah I . knows what you do.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.92</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And be not like her who unravels her yarn, disintegrating it into pieces after she has spun it strongly. You make your oaths to be means of deceit between you because (one) nation is more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only tries you by this; and He will most certainly make clear to you on the resurrection day that about which you differed.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.93</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And if Allah please He would certainly make you a single nation, but He causes to err whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases; and most certainly you will be questioned as to what you did.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.94</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after its stability and you should taste evil because you turned away from Allah&#39;s way and grievous punishment be your (lot).<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.95</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And do not take a small price in exchange for Allah&#39;s covenant; surely what is with Allah is better for you, did you but know.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.96</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] What is with you passes away and what is with Allah is enduring; and We will most certainly give to those who are patient their reward for the best of what they did.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.97</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Whoever does good whether male or female and he is a believer, We will most certainly make him live a happy life, and We will most certainly give them their reward for the best of what they did.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.98</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] So when you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaitan,<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.99</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Surely he has no authority over those who believe and rely on their Lord.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.100</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] His authority is only over those who befriend him and those who associate others with Him.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.101</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And when We change (one) communication for (another) communication, and Allah knows best what He reveals, they say: You are only a forger. Nay, most of them do not know.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.102</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Say: The Holy spirit has revealed it from your Lord with the truth, that it may establish those who believe and as a guidance and good news for those who submit.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.103</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And certainly We know that they say: Only a mortal teaches him. The tongue of him whom they reproach is barbarous, and this is clear Arabic tongue.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.104</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] (As for) those who do not believe in Allah&#39;s communications, surely Allah will not guide them, and they shall have a painful punishment.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.105</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Only they forge the lie who do not believe in Allah&#39;s communications, and these are the liars.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.106</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] He who disbelieves in Allah after his having believed, not he who is compelled while his heart is at rest on account of faith, but he who opens (his) breast to disbelief-- on these is the wrath of Allah, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.107</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] This is because they love this world&#39;s life more than the hereafter, and because Allah does not guide the unbelieving people.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.108</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] These are they on whose hearts and their hearing and their eyes Allah has set a seal, and these are the heedless ones.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.109</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] No doubt that in the hereafter they will be the losers.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.110</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Yet surely your Lord, with respect to those who fly after they are persecuted, then they struggle hard and are patient, most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving, Merciful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.111</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] (Remember) the day when every soul shall come, pleading for itself and every soul shall be paid in full what it has done, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.112</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And Allah sets forth a parable: (Consider) a town safe and secure to which its means of subsistence come in abundance from every quarter; but it became ungrateful to Allah&#39;s favors, therefore Allah made it to taste the utmost degree of hunger and fear because of what they wrought.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.113</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And certainly there came to them an Apostle from among them, but they rejected him, so the punishment overtook them while they were unjust.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.114</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Therefore eat of what Allah has given you, lawful and good (things), and give thanks for Allah&#39;s favor if Him do you serve.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.115</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] He has only forbidden you what dies of itself and blood and flesh of swine and that over which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring nor exceeding the limit, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.116</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And, for what your tongues describe, do not utter the lie, (saying) This is lawful and this is unlawful, in order to forge a lie against Allah; surely those who forge the lie against Allah shall not prosper.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.117</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] A little enjoyment and they shall have a painful punishment.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.118</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] And for those who were Jews We prohibited what We have related to you already, and We did them no injustice, but they were unjust to themselves.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.119</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Yet surely your Lord, with respect to those who do an evil in ignorance, then turn after that and make amends, most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving, Merciful.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.120</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Surely Ibrahim was an exemplar, obedient to Allah, upright, and he was not of the polytheists.<br/>[</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">16.121</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] Grateful for His favors;
