The Holy Spirit is _not_ supposed to contradict itself and make mistakes yet it did here, _unjustifiably_ cursing Ammon for all eternity for an action initiated by the &quot;elders of Midian.&quot; I of course realize that some Christian Apologists could argue there is _no_ contradiction. They could argue that Deuteronomy 23:3 _supplements_ Numbers 22:7 by &quot;adding&quot; Ammon to Midian and Moab as hiring Balaam. The problem with this &quot;apology&quot;? Why then aren&#39;t Midian&#39;s descendants cursed by God and forbidden to enter the Holy Congregation, only Ammon and Moab are cursed? It makes no sense. The Holy Spirit has _erred_ TWICE (1) by cursing Ammon for Midian&#39;s act of hostility in De 23:3 and (2) causing Nehemiah 13:1-3 _not_ to mention that Midian is also cursed by God for hiring Balaam in addition to Ammon and Moab. In other words, no-where in the entire Bible is Midian specifically cursed by God and the Holy Spirit for hiring Balaam to curse Israel, only Ammon and Moab!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Ezra 10:1-44 reveals that Israel (the returning exiles from the Babylonian Captivity) have sinned and married foreign women (some of whom are Ammonites and Moabites), they agree to put away or send away their foreign wives and their mixed blood children.

Quite clearly Ezekiel refutes this notion. &quot;The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father.&quot; Christ&#39;s death &quot;fulfils&quot; the Law and ends it power over man. Christians are NOT to observe the Law, Christ&#39;s death has ended such observances. Ezekiel refutes this notion stating that the father&#39;s righteousness cannot absolve the son of his sins.

Despite the clarity of this statement, it was apparently not enforced when the descendants of &quot;bastards&quot; had achieved important social status. Biblical genealogies show, for example, that David was a ninth-generation descendant of Perez, the bastard son of Judah and Tamar (Gen. 38:24-30 ; Ruth 4:18 ; 1 Chron. 2:5-14 ). Obviously, though, David was not denied entry into the assembly despite his descent from one who had been illegitimately born. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Bibliolaters will argue that David was exempted from the restriction, because, if Perez is considered the first generation, then David was the tenth and was therefore eligible to enter the assembly. The inerrantist argument is that the restriction extended even to the tenth generation but did not include the tenth, so the fundamentalists think that they have scored another victory in their never-ending quest to explain away biblical inconsistencies that we pesty skeptics continue to point out. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Their explanation, however, is just another grasping for straws, because the expression in the original Hebrew did not mean </span><span class="cs9C4758E0">even to</span><span class="cs6DA126DA">, as the following literal translation will show: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">A bastard doth not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even a tenth generation of him doth not enter into the assembly of Jehovah (</span><span class="csF9A76D5">Young&#39;s Literal Translation of the Holy Bible</span><span class="cs6DA126DA">). </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">The idea of </span><span class="cs9C4758E0">to </span><span class="cs6DA126DA">or </span><span class="cs9C4758E0">until</span><span class="cs6DA126DA"> was not in the original. The expression, then, did not mean that descendants of bastards were to be banished from the assembly </span><span class="cs9C4758E0">up until but not including the tenth generation</span><span class="cs6DA126DA">. Its obvious intention was to denote a permanent, everlasting banishment. Descendants of bastards were simply </span><span class="cs9C4758E0">personae nongratae</span><span class="cs6DA126DA"> in Yahweh&#39;s sacred assembly, no matter how long ago the indiscretion had occurred--except, as we have noted, in cases of important social status. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">We can expect bibliolaters to insist that the intention of the restriction on bastards was to ban them only until the tenth generation, which would have allowed David to sneak in just under the wire. For the sake of argument, we will concede them the quibble and then ask them to explain why the descendants of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel, were not banned from the assembly &quot;up until&quot; the tenth generation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">According to Exodus 6:23 , Aaron married a woman named Elisheba, who was &quot;the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon.&quot; The significance of this can be seen when the genealogy of the bastard Perez is examined. Amminadab was a fourth-generation descendant of Perez (Ruth 4:18 ; 1 Chron. 2:5-9 ), so Aaron&#39;s wife was the fifth. Aaron&#39;s sons born to Elisheba (Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, Ex. 6:23 ) were therefore sixth-generation descendants of the bastard Perez, and they were all consecrated to serve as priests in the assembly of Yahweh (Num. 3:3 ). This sounds very much as if they &quot;entered into the assembly of Yahweh.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Nadab and Abihu disgraced themselves and, in typical Yahwistic fashion, were killed (Lev. 10:1-2), but Eleazar figured prominently in priestly activities all through the 40 years of wilderness wanderings. Bibliolaters cannot argue that the banishing of bastards from the assembly occurred after the sons of Aaron were consecrated, because Eleazar served as priest long after the events recorded in Deuteronomy, where the restriction on bastards was stipulated. Eleazar is mentioned in priestly services all through Joshua and didn&#39;t die until the very end of the book (24:33). At this point, Eleazar&#39;s son Phinehas (only a seventh-generation descendant of Perez) assumed Eleazar&#39;s office and was serving in it as late as Judges 20:29. In fact, Yahweh had conferred on Phinehas and his descendants &quot;the covenant of an everlasting priesthood&quot; after Phinehas had thrust a spear through an Israelite man and a Midianite woman whom he had caught in the act of adultery (Num. 25:6-13). On that occasion, Yahweh seemed unconcerned about Phinehas&#39;s direct descent from the bastard Perez. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Maybe some inerrantist reader would like to explain to us why there is no inconsistency in any of this.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Till&#39;s above article does _not_ mention that Jesus Christ is himself a descendant of Perez-the-bastard via his stepfather Joseph.

Quite clearly Perez is a &quot;bastard&quot; as Judah did _not_ &quot;marry&quot; Tamar.

Needless to say, most Catholics would be horrified to learn that the title awarded Mary was _originally_ associated with a goddess famed for being a harlot who had many lovers, animals and men, who was looked upon as the patron goddess of whores and prostitues, as well as homosexuals, transvestites and eunuchs at Solomon&#39;s Temple in Jerusalem. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">Millions of Jews, Christians and Moslems today are blissfully _unaware_ of all of the above as they with religious zeal slaughter each other for &quot;God and Country.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6DA126DA">This esoteric knowledge is known only by a few scholars who quietly publish their findings in professional journals away from the public eye so as to not antagonize and upset the faithful and thus avoid being subjected to the indignant wrath of defenders of the faith (Jewish, Christian and Moslem Apologists) who, in the past, have resorted to public ridicule, harrassment and threats of those who would dare suggest their God, Yahweh, Christ, or Allah, is a recast of earlier Mesopotamian gods and goddesses.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA5B76252">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="cs57F554CB" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/index.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">Main Page</span></a></span><span class="csA5B76252"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a class="cs57F554CB" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/archaeologydatestexts.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">Archaeology Menu</span></a></span><span class="csA5B76252"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a class="cs57F554CB" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/OldTestament.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">OT Menu</span></a></span><span class="csA5B76252"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a class="cs57F554CB" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/NewTestament.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">NT Menu</span></a></span><span class="csA5B76252"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="cs57F554CB" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/GeographyIssues.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">Geography Menu</span></a></span><span class="csA5B76252"> &nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/illustrations.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">Illustrations Menu</span></a></span><span class="csA5B76252"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a class="cs57F554CB" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/booksreccomended.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">Bibliography Menu</span></a></span><span class="csA5B76252"> &nbsp; <a class="cs57F554CB" href="http://www.bibleorigins.net/Linkspage.html" target="_self"><span class="cs54F124F6">Links Menu</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
