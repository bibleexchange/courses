<p><h3>Book 2</h3>
<br><h3>The Cow</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse2_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.2</b>]
<br>
<br> This Book,
<br> there is no doubt in it,
<br> is a guide to those who  guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who believe in the unseen and keep up prayer and  spend out of what We have given them.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And who believe in that which has been revealed to you  and that which was revealed before you and they are sure of the  hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.5</b>]
<br>
<br> These are on a right course from their Lord and these it is  that shall be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who disbelieve,
<br> it being alike to them whether  you warn them,
<br> or do not warn them,
<br> will not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their  hearing and there is a covering over their eyes,
<br> and there is a  great punishment for them.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And there are some people who say:
<br> We believe in Allah  and the last day;
<br> and they are not at all believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.9</b>]
<br>
<br> They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe,
<br> and  they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.10</b>]
<br>
<br> There is a disease in their hearts,
<br> so Allah added to their  disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them,
<br> Do not make mischief in the  land,
<br> they say:
<br> We are but peace-makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers,
<br> but they  do not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them:
<br> Believe as the people believe  they say:
<br> Shall we believe as the fools believe?
<br> Now surely they  themselves are the fools,
<br> but they do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they meet those who believe,
<br> they say:
<br> We believe;
<br>  and when they are alone with their Shaitans,
<br> they say:
<br> Surely we  are with you,
<br> we were only mocking.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah shall pay them back their mockery,
<br> and He leaves them  alone in their inordinacy,
<br> blindly wandering on.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.16</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they who buy error for the right direction,
<br> so  their bargain shall bring no gain,
<br> nor are they the followers of  the right direction.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire  but when it had illumined all around him,
<br> Allah took away their  light,
<br> and left them in utter darkness-- they do not see.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Deaf,
<br> dumb (and) blind,
<br> so they will not turn back.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Or like abundant rain from the cloud in which is utter  darkness and thunder and lightning;
<br> they put their fingers into  their ears because of the thunder peal,
<br> for fear of death,
<br> and  Allah encompasses the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.20</b>]
<br>
<br> The lightning almost takes away their sight;
<br> whenever it  shines on them they walk in it,
<br> and when it becomes dark to them  they stand still;
<br> and if Allah had pleased He would certainly  have taken away their hearing and their sight;
<br> surely Allah has  power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.21</b>]
<br>
<br> O men!
<br> serve your Lord Who created you and those before you  so that you may guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Who made the earth a resting place for you and the heaven a  canopy and (Who) sends down rain from the cloud then brings forth  with it subsistence for you of the fruits;
<br> therefore do not set  up rivals to Allah while you know.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to  Our servant,
<br> then produce a chapter like it and call on your  witnesses besides Allah if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.24</b>]
<br>
<br> But if you do (it) not and never shall you do (it),
<br> then be  on your guard against the fire of which men and stones are the  fuel;
<br> it is prepared for the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And convey good news to those who believe and do good  deeds,
<br> that they shall have gardens in which rivers flow;
<br>  whenever they shall be given a portion of the fruit thereof,
<br> they  shall say:
<br> This is what was given to us before;
<br> and they shall be  given the like of it,
<br> and they shall have pure mates in them,
<br>  and in them,
<br> they shall abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable-- (that  of) a gnat or any thing above that;
<br> then as for those who  believe,
<br> they know that it is the truth from their Lord,
<br> and as  for those who disbelieve,
<br> they say:
<br> What is it that Allah means  by this parable:
<br> He causes many to err by it and many He leads  aright by it!
<br> but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the  transgressors,
<br>
<a name = "verse2_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and  cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined,
<br> and make  mischief in the land;
<br> these it is that are the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.28</b>]
<br>
<br> How do you deny Allah and you were dead and He gave you life?
<br>  Again He will cause you to die and again bring you to life,
<br> then  you shall be brought back to Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.29</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth,
<br> and He  directed Himself to the heaven,
<br> so He made them complete seven  heavens,
<br> and He knows all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And when your Lord said to the angels,
<br> I am going to place in  the earth a khalif,
<br> they said:
<br> What!
<br> wilt Thou place in it such  as shall make mischief in it and shed blood,
<br> and we celebrate Thy  praise and extol Thy holiness?
<br> He said:
<br> Surely I know what you do  not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And He taught Adam all the names,
<br> then presented them to the  angels;
<br> then He said:
<br> Tell me the names of those if you are  right.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.32</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Glory be to Thee!
<br> we have no knowledge but that  which Thou hast taught us;
<br> surely Thou art the Knowing,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.33</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O Adam!
<br> inform them of their names.
<br> Then when he had  informed them of their names,
<br> He said:
<br> Did I not say to you that  I surely know what is ghaib in the heavens and the earth and  (that) I know what you manifest and what you hide?
<br>
<a name = "verse2_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We said to the angels:
<br> Make obeisance to Adam they  did obeisance,
<br> but Iblis (did it not).
<br> He refused and he was  proud,
<br> and he was one of the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And We said:
<br> O Adam!
<br> Dwell you and your wife in the  garden and eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish and  do not approach this tree,
<br> for then you will be of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.36</b>]
<br>
<br> But the Shaitan made them both fall from it,
<br> and caused them  to depart from that (state) in which they were;
<br> and We said:
<br> Get  forth,
<br> some of you being the enemies of others,
<br> and there is for  you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Then Adam received (some) words from his Lord,
<br> so He turned  to him mercifully;
<br> surely He is Oft-returning (to mercy),
<br> the  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.38</b>]
<br>
<br> We said:
<br> Go forth from this (state) all;
<br> so surely there  will come to you a guidance from Me,
<br> then whoever follows My  guidance,
<br> no fear shall come upon them,
<br> nor shall they grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject My  communications,
<br> they are the inmates of the fire,
<br> in it they  shall abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.40</b>]
<br>
<br> O children of Israel!
<br> call to mind My favor which I bestowed  on you and be faithful to (your) covenant with Me,
<br> I will fulfill  (My) covenant with you;
<br> and of Me,
<br> Me alone,
<br> should you be  afraid.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And believe in what I have revealed,
<br> verifying that which is  with you,
<br> and be not the first to deny it,
<br> neither take a mean  price in exchange for My communications;
<br> and Me,
<br> Me alone should  you fear.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not mix up the truth with the falsehood,
<br> nor hide the  truth while you know (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and bow down with  those who bow down.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.44</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you enjoin men to be good and neglect your own souls  while you read the Book;
<br> have you then no sense?
<br>
<a name = "verse2_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And seek assistance through patience and prayer,
<br> and most  surely it is a hard thing except for the humble ones,
<br>
<a name = "verse2_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Who know that they shall meet their Lord and that they shall  return to Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.47</b>]
<br>
<br> O children of Israel!
<br> call to mind My favor which I bestowed  on you and that I made you excel the nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And be on your guard against a day when one soul shall not  avail another in the least,
<br> neither shall intercession on its  behalf be accepted,
<br> nor shall any compensation be taken from it,
<br>  nor shall they be helped.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We delivered you from Firon's people,
<br> who subjected  you to severe torment,
<br> killing your sons and sparing your women,
<br>  and in this there was a great trial from your Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We parted the sea for you,
<br> so We saved you and  drowned the followers of Firon and you watched by.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We appointed a time of forty nights with Musa,
<br> then  you took the calf (for a god) after him and you were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We pardoned you after that so that you might give  thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We gave Musa the Book and the distinction that you  might walk aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa said to his people:
<br> O my people!
<br> you have  surely been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for a god),
<br>  therefore turn to your Creator (penitently),
<br> so kill your people,
<br>  that is best for you with your Creator:
<br> so He turned to you  (mercifully),
<br> for surely He is the Oft-returning (to mercy),
<br> the  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> we will not believe in you until  we see Allah manifestly,
<br> so the punishment overtook you while you  looked on.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We raised you up after your death that you may give  thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made the clouds to give shade over you and We sent to  you manna and quails:
<br> Eat of the good things that We have given  you;
<br> and they did not do Us any harm,
<br> but they made their own  souls suffer the loss.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We said:
<br> Enter this city,
<br> then eat from it a  plenteous (food) wherever you wish,
<br> and enter the gate making  obeisance,
<br> and say,
<br> forgiveness.
<br> We will forgive you your wrongs  and give more to those who do good (to others).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.59</b>]
<br>
<br> But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than  that which had been spoken to them,
<br> so We sent upon those who  were unjust a pestilence from heaven,
<br> because they transgressed.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa prayed for drink for his people,
<br> We said:
<br>  Strike the rock with your staff So there gushed from it twelve  springs;
<br> each tribe knew its drinking place:
<br> Eat and drink of the  provisions of Allah and do not act corruptly in the land,
<br> making  mischief.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> we cannot bear with one food,
<br>  therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of  what the earth grows,
<br> of its herbs and its cucumbers and its  garlic and its lentils and its onions.
<br> He said:
<br> Will you exchange  that which is better for that which is worse?
<br> Enter a city,
<br> so you  will have what you ask for.
<br> And abasement and humiliation were  brought down upon them,
<br> and they became deserving of Allah's  wrath;
<br> this was so because they disbelieved in the  communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly;
<br> this  was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who believe,
<br> and those who are Jews,
<br> and the    Christians,
<br> and the Sabians,
<br> whoever believes in Allah and the  Last day and does good,
<br> they shall have their reward from their  Lord,
<br> and there is no fear for them,
<br> nor shall they grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.63</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We took a promise from you and lifted the mountain  over you:
<br> Take hold of the law (Tavrat) We have given you with  firmness and bear in mind what is in it,
<br> so that you may guard  (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Then you turned back after that;
<br> so were it not for the grace  of Allah and His mercy on you,
<br> you would certainly have been  among the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly you have known those among you who exceeded the  limits of the Sabbath,
<br> so We said to them:
<br> Be (as) apes,
<br> despised  and hated.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.66</b>]
<br>
<br> So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and  those who came after it,
<br> and an admonition to those who guard  (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa said to his people:
<br> Surely Allah commands you  that you should sacrifice a cow;
<br> they said:
<br> Do you ridicule us?
<br>  He said:
<br> I seek the protection of Allah from being one of the  ignorant.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.68</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to  us what she is.
<br> Musa said:
<br> He says,
<br> Surely she is a cow neither  advanced in age nor too young,
<br> of middle age between that (and  this);
<br> do therefore what you are commanded.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.69</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to  us what her color is.
<br> Musa said:
<br> He says,
<br> Surely she is a yellow  cow;
<br> her color is intensely yellow,
<br> giving delight to the  beholders.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.70</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to  us what she is,
<br> for surely to us the cows are all alike,
<br> and if  Allah please we shall surely be guided aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.71</b>]
<br>
<br> Musa said:
<br> He says,
<br> Surely she is a cow not made submissive  that she should plough the land,
<br> nor does she irrigate the tilth;
<br>  sound,
<br> without a blemish in her.
<br> They said:
<br> Now you have brought  the truth;
<br> so they sacrificed her,
<br> though they had not the mind  to do (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you killed a man,
<br> then you disagreed with  respect to that,
<br> and Allah was to bring forth that which you were  going to hide.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.73</b>]
<br>
<br> So We said:
<br> Strike the (dead body) with part of the  (Sacrificed cow),
<br> thus Allah brings the dead to life,
<br> and He  shows you His signs so that you may understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Then your hearts hardened after that,
<br> so that they were like  rocks,
<br> rather worse in hardness;
<br> and surely there are some rocks  from which streams burst forth,
<br> and surely there are some of them  which split asunder so water issues out of them,
<br> and surely there  are some of them which fall down for fear of Allah,
<br> and Allah is  not at all heedless of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.75</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you then hope that they would believe in you,
<br> and a party  from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah,
<br> then  altered it after they had understood it,
<br> and they know (this).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they meet those who believe they say:
<br> We believe,
<br>  and when they are alone one with another they say:
<br> Do you talk to  them of what Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend  with you by this before your Lord?
<br> Do you not then understand?

<a name = "verse2_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and  what they make known?

<br>
<br> Woe,
<br> then,
<br> to those who write the book with their hands and  then say:
<br> This is from Allah,

<a name = "verse2_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Fire shall not touch us but for a few days.

<br> Have you received a promise from Allah,

[<b>2.83</b>]

<p>
[<b>2.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We made a covenant with you:
<br> You shall not  shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your  cities;

<a name = "verse2_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.85</b>]
<br>
<br> Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from  among you out of their homes,
<br> backing each other up against  them unlawfully and exceeding the limits;

<br> Do you then believe in a part  of the Book and disbelieve in the other?
<br> What then is the re ward  of such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this  world,

[<b>2.86</b>]

<a name = "verse2_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.87</b>]
<br>
<br> And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent apostles  after him one after another;
<br> and We gave Isa,

<br>  clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit,
<br> What!
<br>  whenever then an apostle came to you with that  which your souls did not desire,
<br> you were insolent so you called  some liars and some you slew.

<a name = "verse2_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.88</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Our hearts are covered.

<br> Allah has cursed  them on account of their unbelief;
<br> so little it is that they  believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.89</b>]
<br>
<br> And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that  which they have,
<br> and aforetime they used to pray for victory  against those who disbelieve,
<br> but when there came to them  (Prophet) that which they did not recognize,
<br> they disbelieved in  him;
<br> so Allah's curse is on the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.90</b>]
<br>
<br> Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they  should deny what Allah has revealed,
<br> out of envy that Allah  should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He  pleases;
<br> so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon  wrath,
<br> and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.91</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them,
<br> Believe in what Allah has  revealed,
<br> they say:
<br> We believe in that which was revealed to us;
<br>  and they deny what is besides that,
<br> while it is the truth  verifying that which they have.
<br> Say:
<br> Why then did you kill  Allah's Prophets before if you were indeed believers?
<br>
<a name = "verse2_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.92</b>]
<br>
<br> And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments,
<br>  then you took the calf (for a god) in his absence and you were  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.93</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain  over you:
<br> Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and  be obedient.
<br> They said:
<br> We hear and disobey.
<br> And they were made  to imbibe (the love of) the calf into their hearts on account of  their unbelief Say:
<br> Evil is that which your belief bids you if  you are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.94</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If the future abode with Allah is specially for you to  the exclusion of the people,
<br> then invoke death if you are  truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.95</b>]
<br>
<br> And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands  have sent before,
<br> and Allah knows the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.96</b>]
<br>
<br> And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men  for life (greedier) than even those who are polytheists;
<br> every  one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand  years,

 and Allah sees what they<br>
<a name = "verse2_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.97</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel-- for surely he revealed  it to your heart by Allah's command,
<br> verifying that which is  before it and guidance and good news for the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.98</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His apostles  and Jibreel and Meekaeel,
<br> so surely Allah is the enemy of the  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications  and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.100</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> whenever they make a covenant,
<br> a party of them cast it  aside?
<br> Nay,
<br> most of them do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.101</b>]
<br>
<br> And when there came to them an Apostle from Allah verifying  that which they have,
<br> a party of those who were given the Book  threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew  nothing.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.102</b>]
<br>
<br> And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in  the reign of Sulaiman,
<br> and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever,
<br> but  the Shaitans disbelieved,
<br> they taught men sorcery and that was  sent down to the two angels at Babel,
<br> Harut and Marut,
<br> yet these  two taught no man until they had said,
<br> "Surely we are only a  trial,
<br> therefore do not be a disbeliever.
<br>" Even then men learned  from these two,
<br> magic by which they might cause a separation  between a man and his wife;
<br> and they cannot hurt with it any one  except with Allah's permission,
<br> and they learned what harmed  them and did not profit them,
<br> and certainly they know that he who  bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil  was the price for which they sold their souls,
<br> had they but  known this.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.103</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they had believed and guarded themselves (against  evil),
<br> reward from Allah would certainly have been better;
<br> had  they but known (this).
<br>
<a name = "verse2_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.104</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not say Raina and say Unzurna and  listen,
<br> and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.105</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do  not like,
<br> nor do the polytheists,
<br> that the good should be sent  down to you from your Lord,
<br> and Allah chooses especially whom He  pleases for His mercy,
<br> and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.106</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be  forgotten,

<br>
<a name = "verse2_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.107</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens  and the earth,
<br> and that besides Allah you have no guardian or  helper?
<br>
<a name = "verse2_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.108</b>]
<br>
<br> Rather you wish to put questions to your Apostle,
<br> as Musa  was questioned before;
<br> and whoever adopts unbelief instead of  faith,
<br> he indeed has lost the right direction of the way.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.109</b>]
<br>
<br> Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn  you back into unbelievers after your faith,
<br> out of envy from  themselves,
<br> (even) after the truth has become manifest to them;
<br>  but pardon and forgive,
<br> so that Allah should bring about His  command;
<br> surely Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.110</b>]
<br>
<br> And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and whatever good  you send before for yourselves,
<br> you shall find it with Allah;
<br>  surely Allah sees what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.111</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> None shall enter the garden (or paradise)  except he who is a Jew or a Christian.
<br> These are their vain  desires.
<br> Say:
<br> Bring your proof if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.112</b>]
<br>
<br> Yes!
<br> whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is  the doer of good (to others) he has his reward from his Lord,
<br> and  there is no fear for him nor shall he grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.113</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Jews say:
<br> The Christians do not follow anything  (good) and the Christians say:
<br> The Jews do not follow anything  (good) while they recite the (same) Book.
<br> Even thus say those who  have no knowledge,
<br> like to what they say;
<br> so Allah shall  judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they  differ.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.114</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is more unjust than he who prevents (men)  from the masjids of Allah,
<br> that His name should be remembered  in them,
<br> and strives to ruin them?
<br> (As for) these,
<br> it was not  proper for them that they should have entered them except in  fear;
<br> they shall meet with disgrace in this world,
<br> and they shall  have great chastisement in the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.115</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is the East and the West,
<br> therefore,
<br> whither  you turn,
<br> thither is Allah's purpose;
<br> surely Allah is  Amplegiving,
<br>  Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.116</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Allah has taken to himself a son.
<br> Glory be  to Him;
<br> rather,
<br> whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His;
<br>  all are obedient to Him.
<br>

<br>
<a name = "verse2_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.118</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who have no knowledge say:
<br> Why does not  Allah speak to us or a sign come to us?
<br> Even thus said those  before them,
<br> the like of what they say;
<br> their hearts are all alike.
<br>  Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people  who are sure.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.119</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of  good news and as a warner,

<a name = "verse2_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.120</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Jews will not be pleased with you,
<br> nor the  Christians until you follow their religion.
<br> Say:
<br> Surely Allah's  guidance,
<br> that is the (true) guidance.
<br> And if you follow their  desires after the knowledge that has come to you,
<br> you shall have  no guardian from Allah,
<br> nor any helper.

<p>
[<b>2.121</b>]
<br>
<br> Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it  ought to be read.

[<b>2.124</b>]
<br>
<br> And when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words,
<br> he  fulfilled them.
<br> He said:
<br> Surely I will make you an Imam of men.
<br>  Ibrahim said:
<br> And of my offspring?
<br> My covenant does not  include the unjust,
<br> said He.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.125</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place  of) security,
<br> and:
<br> Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on  the standing-place of Ibrahim.
<br> And We enjoined Ibrahim and Ismail  saying:
<br> Purify My House for those who visit (it) and those who  abide (in it) for devotion and those who bow down (and) those who  prostrate themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_126"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.126</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Ibrahim said:
<br> My Lord,
<br> make it a secure town and  provide its people with fruits,
<br> such of them as believe in Allah  and the last day.
<br> He said:
<br> And whoever disbelieves,
<br> I will grant  him enjoyment for a short while,
<br> then I will drive him to the  chastisement of the fire;
<br> and it is an evil destination.
<br>
<a name = "verse2_127"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.127</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the  House:
<br> Our Lord!

<br> Our Lord!

<br>

[<b>2.130</b>]

<br> And who forsakes the religion of Ibrahim but he who makes  himself a fool,

<br> And the same did Ibrahim enjoin on his sons and (so did)  Yaqoub.

<br>
<br> Nay!

<a name = "verse2_134"></a>

[<b>2.134</b>]
<br>
<br> This is a people that have passed away;

[<b>2.136</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> We believe in Allah and (in) that which had been  revealed to us,

<br> and (in) that which  was given to Musa and Isa,
<br> and (in) that which was given to the  prophets from their Lord,

[<b>2.137</b>]
<br>
<br> If then they believe as you believe in Him,
<br> they are indeed  on the right course,

<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> do you say that Ibrahim and Ismail and Yaqoub and the  tribes were Jews or Christians?
<br> Say:
<br> Are you better knowing or  Allah?

<p>
[<b>2.141</b>]

<br>
<a name = "verse2_143"></a>

[<b>2.143</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus We have made you a medium (just) nation that you  may be the bearers of witness to the people and (that) the  Apostle may be a bearer of witness to you;
<br> and We did not make  that which you would have to be the qiblah but that We might  distinguish him who follows the Apostle from him who turns back  upon his heels,
<br> and this was surely hard except for those whom  Allah has guided aright;
<br> and Allah was not going to make your  faith to be fruitless;
<br> most surely Allah is Affectionate,

<br>
<a name = "verse2_144"></a>
<p>
[<b>2.144</b>]
<br>
<br> Indeed We see the turning of your face to heaven,
<br> so We  shall surely turn you to a qiblah which you shall like;
<br> turn then  your face towards the Sacred Mosque,
<br> and wherever you are,
<br> turn  your face towards it,

[<b>2.145</b>]

<br> And even if you bring to those who have been given the  Book every sign they would not follow your qiblah,
<br> nor can you be  a follower of their qiblah,
<br> neither are they the followers of  each other's qiblah,

<br> and he has not been granted an abundance of wealth?
<br> He  said:
<br> Surely Allah has chosen him in preference to you,

<br> So  when he had crossed it,
<br> he and those who believed with him,
<br> they  said:
<br> We have today no power against Jalut and his forces.

<br> If you give alms openly,

<br> (Alms are) for the poor who are confined in the way of  Allah-- they cannot go about in the land;

<br> Those who swallow down usury cannot arise except as one whom  Shaitan has prostrated by (his) touch does rise.
<br> That is because  they say,

<br> O you who believe!
<br> when you deal with each other in  contracting a debt for a fixed time,
<br> then write it down;
<br> and let a  scribe write it down between you with fairness;
<br> and the scribe  should not refuse to write as Allah has taught him,
<br> so he should  write;
<br> and let him who owes the debt dictate,
<br> and he should be  careful of (his duty to) Allah,
<br> his Lord,
<br> and not diminish anything  from it;
<br> but if he who owes the debt is unsound in understanding,
<br>  or weak,
<br> or (if) he is not able to dictate himself,
<br> let his  guardian dictate with fairness;
<br> and call in to witness from among  your men two witnesses;
<br> but if there are not two men,
<br> then one  man and two women from among those whom you choose to be  witnesses,
<br> so that if one of the two errs,
<br> the second of the two  may remind the other;
<br> and the witnesses should not refuse when  they are summoned;
<br> and be not averse to writing it (whether it is)  small or large,
<br> with the time of its falling due;
<br> this is more  equitable in the sight of Allah and assures greater accuracy in  testimony,
<br> and the nearest (way) that you may not entertain  doubts (afterwards),
<br> except when it is ready merchandise which  you give and take among yourselves from hand to hand,
<br> then  there is no blame on you in not writing it down;
<br> and have  witnesses when you barter with one another,
<br> and let no harm be  done to the scribe or to the witness;
<br> and if you do (it) then surely  it will be a transgression in you,
<br> and be careful of (your duty) to  Allah,
<br> Allah teaches you,
<br> and Allah knows all things.

<br> And if you are upon a journey and you do not find a  scribe,
<br> then (there may be) a security taken into possession;
<br> but  if one of you trusts another,
<br> then he who is trusted should deliver  his trust,
<br> and let him be careful (of his duty to) Allah,
<br> his Lord;
<br>  and do not conceal testimony,

<br> Our Lord!
<br> do not  punish us if we forget or make a mistake;
<br> Our Lord!
<br> do not lay on  us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us,
<br> Our Lord do not  impose upon us that which we have not the strength to bear;
