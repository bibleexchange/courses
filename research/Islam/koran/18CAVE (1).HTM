<p><h3>Book 18</h3>
<br><h3>The Cave</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse18_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.1</b>]
<br>
<br> (All) praise is due to Allah,
<br> Who revealed the Book to His  servant and did not make in it any crookedness.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Rightly directing,
<br> that he might give warning of severe  punishment from Him and give good news to the believers who do  good that they shall have a goodly reward,
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Staying in it for ever;
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.4</b>]
<br>
<br>  And warn those who say:
<br> Allah has taken a son.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.5</b>]
<br>
<br> They have no knowledge of it,
<br> nor had their fathers;
<br> a  grievous word it is that comes out of their mouths;
<br> they speak nothing  but a lie.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Then maybe you will kill yourself with grief,
<br> sorrowing after  them,
<br> if they do not believe in this announcement.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment  for it,
<br> so that We may try them (as to) which of them is best in  works.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely We will make what is on it bare ground without  herbage.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> do you think that the Fellows of the Cave and the  Inscription were of Our wonderful signs?
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.10</b>]
<br>
<br> When the youths sought refuge in the cave,
<br> they said:
<br> Our  Lord!
<br> grant us mercy from Thee,
<br> and provide for us a right course  in our affair.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.11</b>]
<br>
<br> So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of  years.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two  parties was best able to compute the time for which they  remained.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.13</b>]
<br>
<br> We relate to you their story with the truth;
<br> surely they were  youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in  guidance.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And We strengthened their hearts with patience,
<br> when they  stood up and said:
<br> Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the  earth;
<br> we will by no means call upon any god besides Him,
<br> for  then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.15</b>]
<br>
<br> These our people have taken gods besides Him;
<br> why do they not  produce any clear authority in their support?
<br> Who is then more  unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah?
<br>
<a name = "verse18_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you forsake them and what they worship save Allah,
<br>  betake yourselves for refuge to the cave;
<br> your Lord will extend  to you largely of His mercy and provide for you a profitable  course in your affair.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And you might see the sun when it rose,
<br> decline from their  cave towards the right hand,
<br> and when it set,
<br> leave them behind  on the left while they were in a wide space thereof.
<br> This is of  the signs of Allah;
<br> whomsoever Allah guides,
<br> he is the rightly  guided one,
<br> and whomsoever He causes to err,
<br> you shall not find  for him any friend to lead (him) aright.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And you might think them awake while they were asleep and We  turned them about to the right and to the left,
<br> while their dog  (lay) outstretching its paws at the entrance;
<br> if you looked at  them you would certainly turn back from them in flight,
<br> and you  would certainly be filled with awe because of them.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus did We rouse them that they might question each  other.
<br> A speaker among them said:
<br> How long have you tarried?
<br> They  said:
<br> We have tarried for a day or a part of a day.
<br> (Others)  said:
<br> Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried.
<br> Now send  one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city,
<br> then let  him see which of them has purest food,
<br> so let him bring you  provision from it,
<br> and let him behave with gentleness,
<br> and by no  means make your case known to any one:
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.20</b>]
<br>
<br> For surely if they prevail against you they would stone you  to death or force you back to their religion,
<br> and then you will  never succeed.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they  might know that Allah's promise is true and that as for the hour  there is no doubt about it.
<br> When they disputed among themselves  about their affair and said:
<br> Erect an edifice over them-- their  Lord best knows them.
<br> Those who prevailed in their affair said:
<br>  We will certainly raise a masjid over them.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.22</b>]
<br>
<br> (Some) say:
<br> (They are) three,
<br> the fourth of them being their  dog;
<br> and (others) say:
<br> Five,
<br> the sixth of them being their dog,
<br>  making conjectures at what is unknown;
<br> and (others yet) say:
<br>  Seven,
<br> and the eighth of them is their dog.
<br> Say:
<br> My Lord best  knows their number,
<br> none knows them but a few;
<br> therefore contend  not in the matter of them but with an outward contention,
<br> and do  not question concerning them any of them.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not say of anything:
<br> Surely I will do it tomorrow,
<br>
<a name = "verse18_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Unless Allah pleases;
<br> and remember your Lord when you forget  and say:
<br> Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer course to the  right than this.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And they remained in their cave three hundred years and  (some) add (another) nine.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Allah knows best how long they remained;
<br> to Him are  (known) the unseen things of the heavens and the earth;
<br> how clear  His sight and how clear His hearing!
<br> There is none to be a  guardian for them besides Him,
<br> and He does not make any one His  associate in His Judgment.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your  Lord,
<br> there is none who can alter His words;
<br> and you shall not  find any refuge besides Him.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And withhold yourself with those who call on their Lord  morning and evening desiring His goodwill,
<br> and let not your eyes  pass from them,
<br> desiring the beauties of this world's life;
<br> and  do not follow him whose heart We have made unmindful to Our  remembrance,
<br> and he follows his low desires and his case is one  in which due bounds are exceeded.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> The truth is from your Lord,
<br> so let him who please  believe,
<br> and let him who please disbelieve;
<br> surely We have  prepared for the iniquitous a fire,
<br> the curtains of which shall  encompass them about;
<br> and if they cry for water,
<br> they shall be  given water like molten brass which will scald their faces;
<br> evil  the drink and ill the resting-place.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> We do not  waste the reward of him who does a good work.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.31</b>]
<br>
<br> These it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity beneath which  rivers flow,
<br> ornaments shall be given to them therein of  bracelets of gold,
<br> and they shall wear green robes of fine silk  and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold,
<br> reclining therein on  raised couches;
<br> excellent the recompense and goodly the resting  place.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And set forth to them a parable of two men;
<br> for one of them  We made two gardens of grape vines,
<br> and We surrounded them both  with palms,
<br> and in the midst of them We made cornfields.
<br>
<a name = "verse18_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.33</b>]
<br>
<br> .
<br> Both these gardens yielded their fruits,
<br> and failed not aught  thereof,
<br> and We caused a river to gush forth in their midst,
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And he possessed much wealth;
<br> so he said to his companion,
<br>  while he disputed with him:
<br> I have greater wealth than you,
<br> and  am mightier in followers.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself.
<br> He  said:
 I do not think that this will ever perish <br>
<a name = "verse18_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not think the hour will come,
<br> and even if I am  returned to my Lord I will most certainly find a returning place  better than this.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.37</b>]
<br>
<br> His companion said to him while disputing with him:
<br> Do you  disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust,
<br> then from a small  seed,
<br> then He made you a perfect man?
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.38</b>]
<br>
<br> But as for me,
<br> He,
<br> Allah,
<br> is my Lord,
<br> and I do not associate  anyone with my Lord.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And wherefore did you not say when you entered your garden:
<br>  It is as Allah has pleased,
<br> there is no power save in Allah?
<br> If  you consider me to be inferior to you in wealth and children,
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Then maybe my Lord will give me what is better than your  garden,
<br> and send on it a thunderbolt from heaven so that it shall  become even ground without plant,
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Or its waters should sink down into the ground so that you  are unable to find it.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And his wealth was destroyed;
<br> so he began to wring his hands  for what he had spent on it,
<br> while it lay,
<br> having fallen down  upon its roofs,
<br> and he said:
<br> Ah me!
<br> would that I had not  associated anyone with my Lord.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And he had no host to help him besides Allah nor could he  defend himself.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Here is protection only Allah's,
<br> the True One;
<br> He is best in  (the giving of) reward and best in requiting.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And set forth to them parable of the life of this world:
<br> like  water which We send down from the cloud so the herbage of the  earth becomes tangled on account of it,
<br> then it becomes dry  broken into pieces which the winds scatter;
<br> and Allah is the  holder of power over all things.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this  world;
<br> and the ever-abiding,
<br> the good works,
<br> are better with your  Lord in reward and better in expectation.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And the day on which We will cause the mountains to pass away  and you will see the earth a levelled plain and We will gather  them and leave not any one of them behind.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall be brought before your Lord,
<br> standing in  ranks:
<br> Now certainly you have come to Us as We created you at  first.
<br> Nay,
<br> you thought that We had not appointed to you a time  of the fulfillment of the promise.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Book shall be placed,
<br> then you will see the guilty  fearing from what is in it,
<br> and they will say:
<br> Ah!
<br> woe to us!
<br>  what a book is this!
<br> it does not omit a small one nor a great  one,
<br> but numbers them (all);
<br> and what they had done they shall  find present (there);
<br> and your Lord does not deal unjustly with  anyone.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We said to the angels:
<br> Make obeisance to Adam;
<br> they  made obeisance but Iblis (did it not).
<br> He was of the jinn,
<br> so he  transgressed the commandment of his Lord.
<br> What!
<br> would you then  take him and his offspring for friends rather than Me,
<br> and they  are your enemies?
<br> Evil is (this) change for the unjust.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.51</b>]
<br>
<br> I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens  and the earth,
<br> nor of the creation of their own souls;
<br> nor could  I take those who lead (others) astray for aiders.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when He shall say:
<br> Call on those whom you  considered to be My associates.
<br> So they shall call on them,
<br> but  they shall not answer them,
<br> and We will cause a separation  between them.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And the guilty shall see the fire,
<br> then they shall know that  they are going to fall into it,
<br> and they shall not find a place  to which to turn away from it.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have explained in this Quran every kind of  example,
<br> and man is most of all given to contention.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And  nothing prevents men from believing when the guidance comes to  them,
<br> and from asking forgiveness of their Lord,
<br> except that  what happened to the ancients should overtake them,
<br> or that the  chastisement should come face to face with them.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And We do not send apostles but as givers of good news and  warning,
<br> and those who disbelieve make a false contention that  they may render null thereby the truth,
<br> and they take My  communications and that with which they are warned for a mockery.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the  communications of his Lord,
<br> then he turns away from them and  forgets what his two hands have sent before?
<br> Surely We have  placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it and  a heaviness in their ears;
<br> and if you call them to the guidance,
<br>  they will not ever follow the right course in that case.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord is Forgiving,
<br> the Lord of Mercy;
<br> were He to  punish them for what they earn,
<br> He would certainly have hastened  the chastisement for them;
<br> but for them there is an appointed  time from which they shall not find a refuge.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) these towns,
<br> We destroyed them when they acted  unjustly,
<br> and We have appointed a time for their destruction.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa said to his servant:
<br> I will not cease until I  reach the junction of the two rivers or I will go on for years.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.61</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they had reached the junction of the two (rivers)  they forgot their fish,
<br> and it took its way into the sea,
<br> going  away.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.62</b>]
<br>
<br> But when they had gone farther,
<br> he said to his servant:
<br> Bring  to us our morning meal,
<br> certainly we have met with fatigue from  this our journey.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.63</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Did you see when we took refuge on the rock then I  forgot the fish,
<br> and nothing made me forget to speak of it but  the Shaitan,
<br> and it took its way into the river;
<br> what a wonder!
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.64</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> This is what we sought for;
<br> so they returned  retracing their footsteps.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Then they found one from among Our servants whom We had  granted mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from  Ourselves.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Musa said to him:
<br> Shall I follow you on condition that you  should teach me right knowledge of what you have been taught?
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.67</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
 Surely you cannot have patience with me <br>
<a name = "verse18_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And how can you have patience in that of which you have not  got a comprehensive knowledge?
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.69</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> If Allah pleases,
<br> you will find me patient and I  shall not disobey you in any matter.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.70</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> If you would follow me,
 then do not question me  about any thing until I myself speak to you about it <br>
<a name = "verse18_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.71</b>]
<br>
<br> So they went (their way) until when they embarked in the boat  he made a hole in it.
<br> (Musa) said:
<br> Have you made a hole in it to  drown its inmates?
<br> Certainly you have done a grievous thing.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.72</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Did I not say that you will not be able to have  patience with me?
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.73</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Blame me not for what I forgot,
<br> and do not constrain  me to a difficult thing in my affair.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.74</b>]
<br>
<br> So they went on until,
<br> when they met a boy,
<br> he slew him.
<br>  (Musa) said:
<br> Have you slain an innocent person otherwise than for  manslaughter?
<br> Certainly you have done an evil thing.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.75</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Did I not say to you that you will not be able to  have patience with me?
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.76</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> If I ask you about anything after this,
<br> keep me not  in your company;
<br> indeed you shall have (then) found an excuse in  my case.
 <br>

<br>
<br> So they went on until when they came to the people of a town,
<br>  they asked them for food,
<br> but they refused to entertain them as  guests.
<br> Then they found in it a wall which was on the point of  falling,
<br> so he put it into a right state.
<br> (Musa) said:
<br> If you had  pleased,
<br> you might certainly have taken a recompense for it.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.78</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> This shall be separation between me and you;
<br> now I  will inform you of the significance of that with which you could  not have patience.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.79</b>]
<br>
<br> As for the boat,
<br> it belonged to (some) poor men who worked on  the river and I wished that I should damage it,
<br> and there was  behind them a king who seized every boat by force.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for the boy,
<br> his parents were believers and we feared  lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon  them:
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.81</b>]
<br>
<br> So we desired that their Lord might give them in his place  one better than him in purity and nearer to having compassion.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for the wall,
<br> it belonged to two orphan boys in the  city,
<br> and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them,
<br> and  their father was a righteous man;
<br> so your Lord desired that they  should attain their maturity and take out their treasure,
<br> a mercy  from your Lord,
<br> and I did not do it of my own accord.
<br> This is the  significance of that with which you could not have patience.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.83</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ask you about Zulqarnain.
<br> Say:
<br> I will recite to you  an account of him.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.84</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We established him in the land and granted him means  of access to every thing.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.85</b>]
<br>
<br> So he followed a course.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.86</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when he reached the place where the sun set,
<br> he found  it going down into a black sea,
<br> and found by it a people.
<br> We  said:
<br> O Zulqarnain!
<br> either give them a chastisement or do them a  benefit.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.87</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> As to him who is injust,
<br> we will chastise him,
<br> then  shall he be returned to his Lord,
<br> and He will chastise him with  an exemplary chastisement:
<br> And as for him who believes and does  good,
<br> he shall have goodly reward,
<br> and We will speak to him an  easy word of Our command.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.89</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he followed (another) course.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.90</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when he reached the land of the rising of the sun,
<br> he  found it rising on a people to whom We had given no shelter from  It;
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.91</b>]
<br>
<br> Even so!
<br> and We had a full knowledge of what he had.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.92</b>]
<br>
<br>  Then he followed (another) course.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.93</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when he reached (a place) between the two mountains,
<br> he  found on that side of them a people who could hardly understand a  word.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.94</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Zulqarnain!
<br> surely Gog and Magog make mischief  in the land.
 Shall we then pay you a tribute on condition that  you should raise a barrier between us and them <br>
<a name = "verse18_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.95</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> That in which my Lord has established me is better,
<br>  therefore you only help me with workers,
<br> I will make a fortified  barrier between you and them;
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.96</b>]
<br>
<br> Bring me blocks of iron;
<br> until when he had filled up the  space between the two mountain sides,
<br> he said:
<br> Blow,
<br> until when  he had made it (as) fire,
<br> he said:
<br> Bring me molten brass which I  may pour over it.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.97</b>]
<br>
<br> So they were not able to scale it nor could they make a hole  in it.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.98</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> This is a mercy from my Lord,
<br> but when the promise  of my Lord comes to pass He will make it level with the ground,
<br>  and the promise of my Lord is ever true.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And on that day We will leave a part of them in conflict with  another part,
<br> and the trumpet will be blown,
<br> so We will gather  them all together;
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.100</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will bring forth hell,
<br> exposed to view,
<br> on that day  before the unbelievers.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.101</b>]
<br>
<br> They whose eyes were under a cover from My reminder and they  could not even hear.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.102</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do then those who disbelieve think that they can take  My servants to be guardians besides Me?
<br> Surely We have prepared  hell for the entertainment of the unbelievers.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.103</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in (their)  deeds?
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.104</b>]
<br>
<br> (These are) they whose labor is lost in this world's life  and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of  hands.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.105</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they who disbelieve in the communications of their  Lord and His meeting,
<br> so their deeds become null,
<br> and therefore  We will not set up a balance for them on the day of resurrection.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.106</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus it is that their recompense is hell,
<br> because they  disbelieved and held My communications and My apostles in  mockery.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.107</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who believe and do good deeds,
<br> their  place of entertainment shall be the gardens of paradise,
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.108</b>]
<br>
<br> Abiding therein;
<br> they shall not desire removal from them.
 <br>
<a name = "verse18_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.109</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord,
<br> the sea  would surely be consumed before the words of my Lord are  exhausted,
 though We were to bring the like of that (sea) to add <br>
<a name = "verse18_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>18.110</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I am only a mortal like you;
<br> it is revealed to me that  your god is one God,
<br> therefore whoever hopes to meet his Lord,
<br> he  should do good deeds,
<br> and not join any one in the service of his  Lord.
