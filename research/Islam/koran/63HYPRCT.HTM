<p><h3>Book 63</h3>
<br><h3>The Hypocrites</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse63_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.1</b>]
<br>
<br> When the hypocrites come to you,
<br> they say:
<br> We bear  witness that you are most surely Allah's Apostle;
<br> and Allah  knows that you are most surely His Apostle,
<br> and Allah bears  witness that the hypocrites are surely liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.2</b>]
<br>
<br> They make their oaths a shelter,
<br> and thus turn away from  Allah's way;
<br> surely evil is that which they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.3</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because they believe,
<br> then disbelieve,
<br> so a seal  is set upon their hearts so that they do not understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you see them,
<br> their persons will please you,
<br> and  If they speak,
<br> you will listen to their speech;
<br> (they are)  as if they were big pieces of wood clad with garments;
<br> they  think every cry to be against them.
<br> They are the enemy,
<br>  therefore beware of them;
<br> may Allah destroy them,
<br> whence are  they turned back?
<br>
<a name = "verse63_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them:
<br> Come,
<br> the Apostle of Allah  will ask forgiveness for you,
<br> they turn back their heads and  you may see them turning away while they are big with pride.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.6</b>]
<br>
<br> It is alike to them whether you beg forgiveness for them  or do not beg forgiveness for them;
<br> Allah will never forgive  them;
<br> surely Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.7</b>]
<br>
<br> They it is who say:
<br> Do not spend upon those who are with  the Apostle of Allah until they break up.
<br> And Allah's are  the treasures of the heavens and the earth,
<br> but the  hypocrites do not understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.8</b>]
<br>
<br> They say:
<br> If we return to Medina,
<br> the mighty will surely  drive out the meaner therefrom;
<br> and to Allah belongs the  might and to His Apostle and to the believers,
<br> but the  hypocrites do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.9</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> let not your wealth,
<br> or your children,
<br>    divert you from the remembrance of Allah;
<br> and whoever does  that,
<br> these are the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse63_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And spend out of what We have given you before death  comes to one of you,
<br> so that he should say:
<br> My Lord!
<br> why  didst Thou not respite me to a near term,
<br> so that I should  have given alms and been of the doers of good deeds?
<br>
<a name = "verse63_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>63.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah does not respite a soul when its appointed  term has come,
<br> and Allah is Aware of what you do.
